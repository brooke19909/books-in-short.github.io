The OSAGO insurance system is not only an opportunity to save a vehicle from the consequences of an accident, but also an opportunity to protect yourself from hooligan actions, natural disasters, unforeseen circumstances and other unjustified expenses. </p><p>  Compulsory motor third-party liability insurance is compulsory motor insurance widespread in Russia, the CIS countries and some other states.  Under the MTPL policy, the insurance agency will be ready to compensate for the damage to life and health caused to another person in a traffic accident.  Unlike comprehensive insurance, compulsory motor third-party liability insurance does not indemnify the owner, but the injured third parties. </p><p>  This article will provide a rating of CTP insurance as of 2018, which will allow readers to easily navigate the market. </p><div class="photo" data-original="braininjuryma.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Happy driver" class="if uuid-2997864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110623/2997864.jpg"></div><h2>  Company Reliability </h2><p>  Ratings evaluate the activities of insurers based on the so-called.  insurance reliability indicator, which is calculated from the ratio of the amount collected to the size paid.  This information gives an almost complete objective picture of the activity of the insurance company and its reliability in providing compensation in the insurance situation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Current CTP Insurance Rating: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Company </td><td>  Description </td></tr><tr><td>  VTB Insurance </td><td><p>  A reliable company that is considered the most financially stable in Russia with a long-term credit rating of BB +.  It occupies the highest position in the reliability rating of insurance companies in compulsory motor liability insurance.  VTB has been awarded the prestigious A ++ rating, but the services are expensive. </p></td></tr><tr><td>  ROSGOSSTRAKH </td><td><p>  The largest insurance group in Russia, one of the pioneers in this market.  She has been assigned AAA and A ++ financial reliability ratings.  Nevertheless, the company was found to be in violation of antitrust laws.  Denials of car insurance payments are also encountered. </p></td></tr><tr><td>  "Renaissance Insurance" </td><td><p>  An insurance company belonging to the backbone enterprises of the Russian insurance industry.  International rating A ++. </p></td></tr><tr><td>  "RESO-Guarantee" </td><td><p>  An insurance institution with A ++ reliability rating and an expanded network of representative offices.

It is focused mainly on legal entities.  Rating A ++. </p></td></tr><tr><td>  SOGAZ </td><td><p>  Another backbone company, ranking 2nd in the country in terms of insurance premiums.  Despite the abundance of positive aspects, complaints are sent to SOGAZ regarding the fact that the company's managers do not sell compulsory motor third-party liability insurance without life insurance.  Rating A ++. </p></td></tr><tr><td>  "Consent" </td><td><p>  The company is in the TOP-10 of the largest insurance companies in the country.  In professional circles, Consent is often criticized for its policies, and therefore has a not so high reputation.  When working, ‚ÄúConsent‚Äù allows itself to violate the payment deadlines or reduce their size several times.  Rating A +. </p></td></tr><tr><td>  Alfa Insurance </td><td><p>  Russian insurance network with an international reliability rating of BB.  At the same time, critical reviews are regularly received from the company from the owners of electronic policies, the claims of which relate to the insufficient level of reimbursed losses.  Russian rating A ++. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="photo" data-original="www.rgs.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance Company" class="if uuid-2983849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110623/2983849.jpg"></div><p>  If you carefully follow the insurance preferences of the residents of Moscow, you will notice that they strangely coincide with the national average.  This is due to the fact that due to the high concentration of financial flows, most of the largest Russian insurance companies have a main office in the capital, and branches operate in other cities.  Thus, if you want to know the average situation by insurance companies in Russia, then you can see the rating of IC in Moscow - the differences will not be so big. </p><h2>  <span>Rating of insurance companies</span> on OSAGO payments </h2><p>  The rating differs from the previous one, since the payout indicator primarily indicates the loss-making of the company.  The percentage indicated in the table shows the ratio of the volume of reimbursed funds to the volume of bonus payments, that is, in fact, the ratio of costs to profits.  If the company‚Äôs activities are in order, this percentage will not deviate from the limit of 40-60%, however, changes are allowed when companies carry out certain types of insurance, implying these deviations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="osago-online-kalkulyator.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MTPL insurance policy" class="if uuid-2997782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110623/2997782.jpg"></div><p>  Here is the insurance rating for OSAGO payments for 2018.  These are companies that are most often recommended for cooperation on their solvency. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Company name </td><td>  Payout percentage </td></tr><tr><td>  Ingosstrakh </td><td>  51% </td></tr><tr><td>  Sogaz </td><td>  fifty % </td></tr><tr><td>  Alfa Insurance </td><td>  46% </td></tr><tr><td>  VTB </td><td>  20 % </td></tr><tr><td>  RESO </td><td>  48% </td></tr><tr><td>  "Liberty Insurance" </td><td>  49% </td></tr><tr><td>  "ERGO Life" </td><td>  45% </td></tr><tr><td>  Chulpan </td><td>  45% </td></tr><tr><td>  AIG </td><td>  7% </td></tr><tr><td>  "Absolute" </td><td>  25% </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  How is the rating formed? </h2><p>  There are numerous factors by which the reliability ratings of insurers are compiled.  Moreover, this information is obtained not only on the basis of ratings, but also in highly specialized communities, for example, the Russian Auto Insurers Union owns such information.  To gain access to it, you must register on his website and become a full member, but if the user leaves the union, the possibility of obtaining information will remain. </p><p>  The agencies composing the CTP insurance rating create lists of the most reliable, and they are based primarily on relevant information in recent years, taking into account only specific parameters.  Experts take into account the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  payout speed; </li><li>  quality of service; </li><li>  positive and negative reviews, their overall ratio; </li><li>  how many motorists regularly turn to this particular company for insurance services and how satisfied they are with the services provided. </li></ul><p>  You should not look for options for a compulsory motor third-party liability insurance policy at a reduced cost, because the price is fixed today and can only be changed one way or another only in the way you work with brokerage houses, agencies, and other intermediary organizations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MTPL payment" class="if uuid-2983854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110623/2983854.jpg"></div><h2>  Expert Ratings </h2><p>  This is the main and most respected type of insurance company ratings based on internal corporate data.  The disadvantage is that either you cannot independently verify the veracity of this data, or you may have questions about the objectivity and independence of the resource that published this rating (however, the presence of referral links on the page from companies located in the top of the sheet is an obvious hint) . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In this case, what should be based on when choosing an insurance policy?  You can choose a company and then regret it, or you can get right on target.  Correct lists of insurance companies are usually published in the format of corporate reports based on official verified statistics.  Therefore, it is recommended to check whether all the information was scooped from sources worthy of attention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="magazine.iblbanca.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car insurance" class="if uuid-2984140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82172/2984140.jpg"></div><h2>  Popular ratings </h2><p>  Do not exclude the so-called user ratings based on individual voting, usually on the Internet.  This voting format has a significant drawback due to the fact that Internet users have the ability to win votes in favor of a particular participant.  And even if we exclude any fraud, such a vote in any case can be called objective only with a big stretch, because the average user does not have expert opinion in this area and can focus only on their own experience, which could be positive or negative. </p><h2>  Moscow rating </h2><p>  Metropolitan ratings usually reflect the "average hospital temperature" in the country, and therefore they should always be compiled with particular care.  The MTPL insurance rating of Moscow is compiled in accordance with customer reviews. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Company name </p></td><td><p>  Overall rating </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Ingosstrakh </p></td><td><p>  2.2 (123 reviews) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  VTB </p></td><td><p>  2.3 (47 reviews) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  SOGAZ Insurance Group </p></td><td><p>  1.9 (230 reviews) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  "Liberty - Insurance" </p></td><td><p>  1.8 (9 reviews) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  ERGO </p></td><td><p>  1.9 (11 reviews) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  "ALPHA INSURANCE" </p></td><td><p>  2.1 (207 reviews) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  "VSK Insurance House" </p></td><td><p>  2.3 (430 reviews) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  "RESO Guarantee" </p></td><td><p>  2 (247 reviews) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  "MAX Insurance Group" </p></td><td><p>  2.2 (110 reviews) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  "Renaissance Insurance" </p></td><td><p>  2 (63 reviews) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  "Insurance joint-stock group ENERGOGARANT" </p></td><td><p>  0.7 (21 reviews) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  "Absolute Insurance" </p></td><td><p>  4.1 (7 reviews) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Zetta </p></td><td><p>  2.5 (25 reviews) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  "AD CK Chulpan" </p></td><td><p>  2.6 (14 reviews) </p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="photo" data-original="antiko22.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top OSAGO insurers 2016" class="if uuid-2983871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110623/2983871.jpg"></div><h2>  Novosibirsk rating </h2><p>  The undisputed flagship stably holding a leading position in this market in Novosibirsk is Rossgosstrakh.

Such ratings are rarely considered by experts due to their subjectivity, but rather are in the nature of unilateral user recommendations.  Popular ratings usually collect data from open resources - forums, otzovik portals, as well as official websites of insurance companies, which often resort to moderating negative comments, which also negatively affects the objectivity of popular ratings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fullhub.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Like and dislike" class="if uuid-2983876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110623/2983876.jpg"></div><p>  MTPL insurance rating from users: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  SC </td><td>  Rating </td><td>  Resolved Issues </td><td>  Number of reviews </td></tr><tr><td>  Zetta Insurance </td><td>  88.30 </td><td>  95 </td><td>  930 </td></tr><tr><td>  Alfa Insurance </td><td>  87.69 </td><td>  2675 </td><td>  5994 </td></tr><tr><td>  "Reso-guarantor" </td><td>  86.70 </td><td>  455 </td><td>  3601 </td></tr><tr><td>  "Absolute Insurance" </td><td>  84.80 </td><td>  8 </td><td>  120 </td></tr><tr><td>  "Consent" </td><td>  78.74 </td><td>  424 </td><td>  2512 </td></tr><tr><td>  YUGORIYA </td><td>  77.5 </td><td>  140 </td><td>  1040 </td></tr><tr><td>  "Renaissance Insurance" </td><td>  69.09 </td><td>  237 </td><td>  1429 </td></tr><tr><td>  "CAPITAL life" </td><td>  64.70 </td><td>  57 </td><td>  232 </td></tr><tr><td>  Ingosstrakh </td><td>  62.66 </td><td>  102 </td><td>  1148 </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  How much can you trust ratings? </h2><p>  If you look at the ratings and trace the correlation between the results presented by them, you can find that even the top companies in the first places in various ratings can have different results depending on who provides the site.  At the same time, having conducted even a superficial study, comparing several sources, it can be noted that in most cases, VTB-Insurance, Alfa Insurance or Renaissance Insurance somehow fall into the top ten.  This is due not so much to the presence of indisputable objective factors that do not allow these enterprises to fly out of the top, but to the fact that companies have already gained a certain reputation.  But this usually applies to general corporate listings.  In individual expert tops, one can still find the truth.  Well, if we talk about user ratings, then, as already stated, this option is the least objective, unless you want to read what people write. </p>
