In the spring, the selection of summer dresses on the shelves is small, so women often take to making new dresses for their daughters themselves.  Even without being a master in sewing, you can sew beautiful summer sundresses for girls.  The main thing is to be patient and use your full creative potential. </p><h2>  Which style should I prefer? </h2><p>  Every mother wants her daughter to be the most beautiful, so she tries to dress her in fashionable outfits.  If women sew summer dresses and sundresses for girls, they try to choose the right style so that the young beauty captivates everyone with her new outfit.

    <p>  Do not forget about various decorative elements.  Summer <span>sundresses for girls</span> look very beautiful <span>,</span> decorated with various lace, ribbons, bows or flowers.  You can also use various pebbles, beads or rhinestones.  If you show a little imagination, then even from the <span>simplest dress</span> you can make a beautiful and fashionable outfit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, the choice of style depends on the skill of the mother.  If there are no special skills in sewing clothes, then it is better to start with the simplest products.  Having gained a little experience, it will be possible to start sewing more complex and labor-intensive outfits. </p><h2>  Material for sundress </h2><p>  After the issue with the style has been decided, it is necessary to find the fabric from which you can sew summer sundresses for girls.  Of course, it can always be purchased at the store.  But it often happens that dresses or blouses are hanging in the closet that have long been forgotten.  It is from them that you can sew magnificent outfits for your daughter.  This will not only save the thing from the sad fate, but also save a lot of money. </p><p>  When choosing a material, do not forget that the outfit will be used in hot weather.  To make the girl comfortable in a sundress, it is better to sew it from a natural, not very dense fabric. </p><h2>  The easiest option sundress </h2><p>  Sometimes my mother does not have enough time, but there is a desire to sew a summer sundress for a girl with her own hands.  In this case, you can give preference to very easy to sew along.  To make it, you will need to draw two rectangles of appropriate sizes on the fabric.  The width of each of them will be equal to the full volume of the girl's waist, and the length is taken arbitrary: from the arm to the proposed bottom.  You also need to add 10 cm to the hem and the drawstring for elastic, and 3 cm to allowances for the width. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="summer dress for girls pattern" border="0" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1021519.jpg" width="478"></div>

Further from above it is necessary to make a drawstring and insert an elastic band into it.  The bottom of the product is bent and stitched.  It is also necessary to sew on straps that can be made from the same material, or use a satin ribbon for this.  The finished sundress must be ironed.  To make the outfit more attractive, it can be decorated with lace, bows or flowers made of fabric.  Sewing such summer <span>sundresses for girls is</span> very easy!  And young beauties will look spectacular in them. </p><h2>  Summer sundress for the girl: pattern </h2><p>  An experienced seamstress will very easily build a pattern of the future outfit.  It will be much more difficult for a mother who does not have experience in needlework.  But even without special skills, you can sew a summer sundress for a girl.  The pattern for him is built quite simply.  First you need to find the shirt that sits on the girl best.  You will also need a large sheet of paper on which the pattern will be drawn.  The wallpaper remaining after the repair is perfect for this. </p><p>  The cooked T-shirt must be folded in length in half so that its front is outside.  Then you need to put it on the paper, backing off from the edge by about 10 cm. Next, the shirt should be outlined.  The neck of the front will always be slightly lower than the neck of the back.  It cannot be described.  To correctly transfer the pattern, take a pin and make punctures in the places of the neck of the front.  After you remove the shirt, holes will be visible on the paper.  Connect them with a line - this will be the neck of the front. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Correct the pattern </h2><p>  In order for the sundress to turn out to be magnificent, it is necessary to make it a little wider and longer than the shirt.  The product is lengthened as follows: from the drawn bottom line, lay horizontally a few centimeters, put points and connect them with a line.  We increase the width of the future sarafan a little differently.  On the side of the armhole from the bottom of the figure, we postpone 8-10 cm, put a point, connect it with the beginning of the armhole and the bottom.  The bottom also needs to be slightly rounded from the side of the armhole, otherwise after stitching the side parts of the sundress will be longer than the front or back. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="summer dresses and sundresses for girls" border="0" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1021521.jpg" width="534"></div>

    <p>  Attach the resulting pattern again to the paper and copy.  This copy will be the back shelf.  On the first received pattern, cut the neckline along the drawn additional line to get the front shelf of the future sundress.  Making patterns in this way, you can even sew summer sundresses for girls even without special skills. </p><h2>  Cutting and sewing </h2><p>  After constructing the pattern, the resulting details need to be decomposed into fabric, which should be folded in half.  Outlining them, we must not forget about allowances for seams.  To do this, draw lines at a distance of 1.5 cm from the pattern.  After that, all the details must be carefully cut. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted summer dress for girls" border="0" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/1022332.jpg" width="451"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The resulting fragments need to be swept away and tried on.  If mistakes were made during cutting, they need to be corrected and after that stitching the seams.  Then the bottom of the product, the neck and armholes are processed.  If you want to complicate the work a bit and make the dress more elegant, you can make a belt for it or sew an elastic band at the waist.  The finished product must be well ironed. </p><h2>  Additional details for a sundress </h2><p>  Summer sundresses for girls can be decorated in completely different ways.  If you have a lot of fabric left after sewing the product, you can sew sleeves on the product.  Cutting them out is pretty easy.  To do this, take a T-shirt, lay out a sleeve on paper and outline.  In the place where the sleeve is sewn to the main product, make punctures with a pin.  Take off the t-shirt and connect the punctures with a line.  Transfer the resulting pattern to a double-folded fabric, taking into account the allowances for the seams.  Sew on the sleeves.  You will get a rather original dress. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself summer dress for girls" border="0" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1021515.jpg" width="525"></div>

    <p>  Also, if desired, you can sew a collar to the neck, decorate the dress with pockets or make ruffles from the remaining material.  The more you show imagination, the more original your product will be, and your daughter will be delighted with the new outfit. </p><h2>  Crocheted <span>sundresses</span> for girls </h2><p>  Crocheted knitted summer <span>sundresses for girls</span> look very nice <span>.</span>  Patterns for knitting can be selected very different.  Experienced craftswomen in this needlework can use more complex patterns, and for beginners it will be enough to apply the simplest knitting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="summer sundresses for girls crochet patterns" border="0" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1023667.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The product can be solid, connected by one pattern.  This option is the simplest and does not require special skill.  It will be enough to learn how to crochet crochet posts.  After mastering this simple pattern, you can begin to work.  For a sarafan, you need to knit two rectangles of the required size and sew them.  You can decorate the product with a belt knitted from threads of a different color. </p><p>  Summer sundresses for girls look very beautiful, consisting of a yoke knitted with a simple pattern and an openwork airy skirt.  The bottom of the sundress in this case is performed by complex patterns, the patterns of which can be found in needlework magazines. </p><h2>  Knitted sundresses </h2><p>  Knitted things are very relevant this season, so it will be not only beautiful, but also fashionable knitted summer sundress for the girl with knitting needles.
