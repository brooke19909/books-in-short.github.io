  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Garage sales contract - what to consider when drafting this document</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In order to sell or buy a property, you must go through a series of mandatory procedures.  The garage, no matter how small it is, also requires careful design.  Moreover, the main place in the list of documents that will have to be drawn up during the transaction is occupied by the garage sale contract.  It is in it that all relations between the contracting parties are established. </p><p>  Consider the issue from the point of view of the buyer and reveal some aspects of the acquisition process. </p><p>  What to check before concluding a contract </p><p>  So, the first thing to do is to make sure that the person offering you this object is really the owner, or at least its authorized representative.  To do this, you just need to ask for a certificate of ownership of the garage and identification card.  If the personal data in the certificate and in the passport (or power of attorney) match, then you can talk further.  This stage is mandatory, you should deal only with those persons who have the right to sign the contract of sale of the garage. </p><p>  It is advisable to verify the authenticity of the certificate of ownership through the registration authorities.  Now this is quite possible.  You just need to take the details, pay a small fee and write a statement. </p><p>  However, garages were not always registered with the justice authorities.  Most of them back in Soviet times were built by the method of cooperation, so there may not be standard registration documents.  In such cases, you already have to deal with the administration of the cooperative and you need to make sure the seller‚Äôs membership, and also check the completeness of its payments for all contributions.  And most importantly - take an interest in whether the ownership of the cooperative itself is framed for all these garages. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It will not be superfluous to consult with a knowledgeable lawyer, showing him copies of the documents submitted to you.  The fact is that after the purchase and sale of the garage is completed, all monetary issues will be settled, you will still have to contact the registration authorities, but you will have to.  And if everything is not all right there, problems cannot be avoided.  Will have to draw up through the court. </p><p>  What other documents are needed for registration </p><p>  It should be noted that such a transaction does not require <span>notarization.</span>  <span>The</span> contract of sale of the garage can be drawn up independently and, if all the conditions are satisfactory, sign it.  The text must indicate the value of the property (preferably according to the BTI) and the fact that the garage is not burdened with obligations - credit, collateral and others.  Then the agreement is submitted together with other documents to the registration chamber for further processing. </p><p>  The general list of required securities is as follows: </p><ul><li>  the contract itself, signed by the parties; </li><li>  acceptance certificate (if issued); </li><li>  certificate of registration of the seller as an owner; </li><li>  if the previous document is missing, then documents from the cooperative about the ownership of this object by the seller; </li><li>  in case of joint ownership of property - consent of the spouse to conclude a transaction. </li></ul><p>  However, sometimes the parties are still afraid to make a mistake and conclude a contract for the sale of a garage with a notary.  Most often, the buyer who is afraid of losing money becomes the initiator of such an action.  However, if such a need arose, you can advise contacting the registration chamber.  For some time, the same transactions have been made there.  This option is also convenient because no new forms are required; registrars have a sample garage purchase and sale agreement.  Moreover, qualified lawyers on-site will check all documents for compliance with the law. </p><p>  As a result, the document will not cause doubts either among partners or registration authorities.  Then we can assume that it is composed correctly. </p>
