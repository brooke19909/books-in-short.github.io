Explay Pulsar: specifications and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Last year, Explay introduced the world its new budget smartphone, which is designed for long-term work without recharging.  As for the “Pulsar Express”, user reviews point to the particularly wide communication and multimedia capabilities of the device.  The smartphone is able to withstand up to three days without recharging in battery life, supports two SIM cards and is additionally equipped with the ability to charge other mobile devices.  For all its merits, the telephone “Pulsar Express” received an acceptable price (from 4,500 to 6,000 rubles) in the domestic market.  This mobile device provides comfortable operation on a 5-inch display, two cameras allow you to communicate via video and capture the brightest moments of your life.  Considering the smartphone “Exercise Pulsar”, we begin the review with the built-in memory, it is 4 GB here, and if you wish, you can expand this feature with an additional card.  You will be able to take whole collections of films or music with you on trips. </p><h2>  Phone "Pulsar Express": reviews about the configuration </h2>

The light-colored box contains a graphic image of the communicator, the name of the mobile device and its manufacturer.  Inside on the foam protective stand is the smartphone itself and some of the necessary components of the “Pulsar Express”.  Overview and technical information are also included.  The kit consists of a charger, adapter, <span>micro USB cable,</span> warranty card and user manual.  Thus, you can connect the smartphone to other mobile devices and charge them.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone explorer pulsar reviews" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19307/689213.jpg" width="600"></div>  If we talk about the appearance of Explay Pulsar, user reviews pay attention to its massiveness and roughness.  It’s really difficult to call elegant.  The mobile device has a powerful battery, so its thickness is 12 mm.  The design is reminiscent of previous models of budget smartphones from Explay, it can also be compared with other smartphones in this price category.  The case is made of plastic, the corners of the device are slightly rounded, the five-inch screen is completely covered with glass, the back cover is removable, its surface is corrugated, a thin frame passes on the sides.  On the front top panel there is a <span>front camera, a</span> light indicator and a voice speaker.  Touch <span>function keys are</span> usually located at the bottom of the display.  On the right side, we can see the power button, and on the left - the volume control.  On the rear panel in the center there is a camera that stands out a little from the entire surface, it is edged with silver metal.  Nearby you can see the flash and an external speaker.  On the top of the mobile device there is a headphone input and a slot for connecting a memory card.  The speaker is located on the bottom end panel.  The back cover of the smartphone is made of dark plastic, pollution and fingerprints are invisible on it.  The casing of the mobile device slides a little in the hand.  Therefore, the owners of the “Pulsar Express” often start their reviews with a recommendation to keep the communicator tighter so as not to “jump out” of their hands.  Pay special attention to the side panels when working, because they slide much more than the back cover.  As for the ergonomics of the “Exercise Pulsar”, user reviews say that not everyone can quickly get used to the non-standard layout of the screen lock and volume keys, but in general, working on a smartphone is convenient and comfortable.  The adjustment button performs the function of taking pictures.  Its reverse location will be very useful when controlling with one hand.  The assembly of the case is very high quality, while pressing on the surface, the smartphone does not emit squeaks, there are no deformations and backlashes.  The back cover is removable and snaps back easily, and the speaker cannot be accidentally covered by hand during a call.

Of the minuses, you can immediately note the low viewing angles, even with a slight tilt of the mobile device, the image seems to flow across the screen, and the colors are distorted.  Information on the protective properties of glass is not available.  As well as <span>an oleophobic coating.</span>  Most likely, the display does not additionally have protection against mechanical damage.  <span>The touch screen</span> supports up to five simultaneous touches, but the sensitivity is poor.  When working indoors or outdoors on a cloudy day, the colors are saturated and bright, but if you just start working in bright sunlight, the picture instantly fades.  The device has a brightness adjustment setting.  The smartphone’s display is average in quality, but it’s enough for everyday work.

The software is quite standard for communicators, it includes Google services, browsers, readers and players.

The mobile device has 512 MB of RAM and 4 GB of internal memory, and the smartphone also has a graphic amplifier.  The performance of the gadget can not boast of its power, because its filling is very mediocre.  A smartphone with lateness responds to touch, but in general, global freezes and crashes of the system were not noted.  The mobile device reproduces high-quality video in HD quality, and given its five-inch screen, it is quite possible to watch movies or TV shows on it.  The only drawbacks are the aforementioned viewing angles, color reproduction in bright light and a small <span>screen resolution.</span>  When turning pages on the Internet and scaling, slight delays are noted.  The smartphone is not intended for serious games.  But its performance is not so low either.  With some games, the gadget copes well, only with heavy applications a noticeable lag and a long load were revealed.  The external speaker sounds quite loud and high quality, even at low rates.

The main one is equipped with a flash, which is useful in poor shooting conditions.  The camera application cannot please with its functionality.  Regarding this aspect of the “Pulsar Express” operation, user reviews confirm that the system often crashes during operation, freezes, and to fix this, you need to restart the smartphone.  The resulting photos are not clear, they have noise, blur and lack of detail.  Especially this defect manifests itself when shooting at dusk or in a room with poor lighting.  Taking pictures at night is not at all recommended due to the terrible quality of the photos taken.  In daylight, the pictures are of high quality, but sometimes there may be some blue in the image.  The mobile device has a pan function, but there is no macro.  The smartphone can also record video that plays in 3 GP format.  If the video is obtained quite high quality, then there may be problems with the sound, because the speech is almost indistinguishable.

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The smartphone allows you to work immediately with two SIM cards, one of them is ordinary, and the second only supports micro format.  The mobile device has the function of working with wireless networks, which are always well supported.  The smartphone can be used as a navigator, because the battery is able to withstand a long time without recharging.  The battery contains 4000 mAh, it is striking in its ability to hold a charge.  This support is the low power consumption of the processor and low screen resolution.  When watching a video, the battery will be enough for about 10 hours of continuous operation. </p><h2>  The target audience </h2>

The communicator is suitable for those users who need a device with an excellent battery, and not with record technical characteristics.
