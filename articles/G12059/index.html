    <p>  Therefore, it can be seen with the naked eye. </p><p>  According to neighboring constellations, you can navigate in the starry sky to find the constellation Triangle.  Andromeda, Perseus, Aries and Pisces will help you with this. </p><h2>  From history and mythology </h2><p>  <span>This constellation has</span> been known since antiquity, but where exactly the name came from remains unknown.  There are notes about him in the Babylonian catalogs and manuscripts, which were recorded about 1100 BC.  The constellation has been known since the birth of astronomy and was described by the Greek Ptolemy in the second century BC.  The constellation Triangle was present on the star charts of the Cretans and Phoenicians.  Everything suggests that he has a fairly long history.  One of the ancient astronomers, Eratosthenes, the constellation of the Triangle resembled the resemblance to the Nile River Delta, and in Greece it was called Deltonon because of the outlines resembling the capital Greek letter "Delta". <br>  From written sources on Greek mythology, it is known that the constellation of the Triangle was identified with the island of Demeter - Sicily - and its three main cities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Let's talk about characteristic peaks </h2><p>  The constellation Triangle forms a shape resembling a geometric figure, according to its name. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="constellation northern hemisphere sky tri" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1442676.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Outlined by the three most prominent stars in this constellation.  The brightest <span>cosmic objects</span> Alpha, Beta and Gamma form the actual figure of a triangle.  The most significant cosmic bodies in the constellation Triangle include the brightest object in its <span>star system,</span> beta, called Deltotum.  From Earth to this star, the distance is approximately 125 light years.  The second brightest in this constellation - Alpha - belongs to the classification of white-yellow subgiants.  It is also called the top of the triangle, it is a double star of a complex spectrum.  The distance to the stellar object is 64.2 light years.  Gamma, the third star in brightness, is a white dwarf, located 188 light-years from Earth.  Delta has the same structure as Alpha.  It consists of two dwarfs - yellow and orange.  The distance between our planet and these stars is at least 35 light years. </p><h2>  Spiral Galaxy M33 </h2><p>  The constellation is easily recognizable and contains in its visible boundaries at least not the brightest, but one well-known spiral galaxy M33, which is of type Sc and is part of the group of local galaxies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spiral galaxy m33" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1441862.jpg" width="600"></div>  There are several nebulae in it, there are many massive bright blue stars and star clusters with increasing density to its center.  The distance from the Sun to the spiral galaxy M33 is three million light years.  More than 110 variable stars are currently discovered in this galaxy.

    <p>  These largest spiral galaxies have their own subgroups of galaxies.  Most of them are associated with the "mother" of huge gravitational forces.  The Triangle Galaxy honorably takes third place (after Andromeda and the Milky Way) in the <span>local group of galaxies.</span>  Its diameter is approximately 50-55.6 thousand light years. </p><p>  A sufficiently large size M33 X-7 black hole was discovered in the Triangle galaxy.  The mass of the cosmic body is 16 times greater than that of the Sun.  This is one of the largest black holes, with the exception of only supermassive holes at a fairly close distance from us. </p><p>  Other galactic systems also enter the constellation Triangle, they are less bright, and their magnitude does not exceed the eleventh star system.  The largest of them is the spiral galaxy NGC925.  The distance from our Sun to NGC925 is 46 million light-years.  This is far enough away, but thanks to heavy-duty telescopes, astronomers are studying outer space and the unique objects of the universe in this part of the sky. </p>
