    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  A number of shortcomings are noted by guests of the Villa Holiday Apartments.  Reviews contain such negative comments: </p><ul><li>  far enough to get to the beach; </li><li>  for each day of your stay at the hotel you need to pay an additional city tax of 1 euro; </li><li>  there is practically no greenery on the territory (there used to be a grassy lawn, but now it is concreted under the summer terrace of the restaurant); </li><li>  in addition to the building, the photo of which is presented on the official website, there are older buildings, the living conditions in which are much worse; </li><li>  despite the stated availability of a kitchenette, there are very few cooking options; </li><li>  on the beach, sunbeds and umbrellas are available at an additional cost; </li><li>  expensive alcohol in a restaurant and bar; </li><li>  linen is not of very good quality (washed, and in places in holes); </li><li>  rare replacement of bed linen and towels; </li><li>  too modest food at an overpriced price (it is better to eat in neighboring establishments); </li><li>  the restaurant menu lacks fresh vegetables and fruits; </li><li>  on the way to the beach you will constantly come across mountains of garbage and ditches with unpleasant odor water; </li><li>  there is practically no entertainment, and therefore in the evenings it is boring at the hotel; </li><li>  constant power outages (but this is a problem not only of this hotel, but of the whole city); </li><li>  it‚Äôs inconvenient that you can‚Äôt pay with a card (you have to carry a lot of cash with you or withdraw it from an ATM with a high commission); </li><li>  it is necessary to remind about the ordered transfer, otherwise you will be forgotten to meet at the airport. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Despite the many shortcomings of Villa Holiday Apartments (Montenegro), this hotel is considered one of the best in Ulcinj.  Travelers from around the world often choose it for a quiet family vacation.  It is quite cozy, quiet, and also has everything you need for a comfortable stay.  The secret to success is that this hotel is a family business.  The owners are constantly on the territory, showing active participation in the work of all services of the institution. </p><p>  It is impossible not to say about the location of the hotel.  Of course, the beach is far enough away, but this drawback can be compensated by a free shuttle service.  As for excursion programs, the hotel can be considered an ideal starting point for exploring the sights of Montenegro.  But the food here leaves much to be desired.  It is much tastier and cheaper to eat in catering establishments located nearby. </p>
