Among Russians, Turkey is also considered one of the most popular tourist destinations.  It has a wonderful climate, clean and fresh air, rich infrastructure and three whole seas for every taste: Black, Aegean and Mediterranean.  As practice shows, cities located on the Mediterranean <span>Sea (Kemer,</span> Belek, Side) are more popular among tourists from Russia.  But many argue that the Aegean coast also should not be discounted.  It has a very beautiful nature, many attractions and amazingly beautiful underwater world.  Among the most popular resorts of the Aegean coast, Marmaris, Bodrum and Kusadasi can be noted, where many budget-friendly hotels and hotels 2,3 and 4 * are concentrated. </p>

There is no children's animation, mini-club or a separate children's menu.  There is only a children's pool and a small playground.  Also, the road to the beach on the bus may not be completely pleasant for children, and the hours of departure of the transfer may not coincide with the kids' daytime sleep.  Therefore, before you go to this hotel with a child, you should think about whether you will be comfortable there. </p><h2>  Catering </h2><p>  On the territory of the Grand Hotel Faros (Turkey, Marmaris) there is one bar and restaurant.  The hotel serves a daily buffet, which offers a varied and tasty menu of international and Turkish dishes.  Dinner is served at the salad bar.  Drinks are available at the poolside bar.  Local alcohol - free in unlimited quantities, imported drinks - for a fee. </p>

    <h2>  The cost of rest at the hotel </h2><p>  A lot of travel companies in different cities of our country specialize in selling tours to the above hotel.  The cost of travel usually depends on the city of departure, as well as on the date of travel and purchase of the tour.  For example, if you book a hotel in advance a few months before the proposed vacation, the price will be much lower.  But, unfortunately, we cannot always know the exact date of the vacation, and then, to save money, many, on the contrary, try to buy a ‚Äúlast-minute tour‚Äù a few days before departure, although, as a rule, this approach does not always make it possible to the hotel that seems preferable.  You have to choose from what's left. </p><p>  Speaking specifically about the Grand Hotel Faros 4 * hotel (Turkey), it is quite difficult to buy a ‚Äúlast-minute ticket‚Äù to it.  Usually at the peak of the season they are all sold out and there are no places in the complex.  Therefore, it is preferable to purchase a ticket in advance. </p><p>  The cost of a tour to Faros from Moscow for seven nights in a double room usually starts from 50 thousand rubles and can reach 90 thousand rubles, depending on the chosen month of residence and occupancy of the hotel itself. </p><h2>  What is the opinion of the hotel about its guests </h2><p>  About the complex Grand <span>Faros Hotel 4 *</span> (Marmaris) reviews can be heard quite contradictory.  Middle-income people, accustomed to budget holidays and not belonging to the category of too demanding tourists, are delighted with the time spent in ‚ÄúFaros‚Äù.  But people who like to relax in conditions of increased comfort and try to find cons in everything, of course, to put it mildly, are not happy with the facilities and services provided at the hotel. </p><p>  Let's try to figure out the advantages of this tourist complex.  Many vacationers note that, despite the fact that the hotel is quite small, it is very cozy.  On its territory and in the rooms it is clean and beautiful, the pool is also clean, the water practically does not smell like bleach.  The balcony offers stunning mountain views.  In the evenings it is quiet and calm.  But, if you want fun, then you can easily get to Barstreet, where there are a huge number of different restaurants and clubs. </p>

    <p>  Food at the hotel all guests like, a lot of food.  From meat dishes - delicious chicken in different cooking options.  Sometimes they serve fish.  There are fruits, a lot of greens, a variety of salads and side dishes.  Pastries and sweets - in a huge assortment, very unusual and tasty. </p><p>  Room cleaning is satisfactory.  The staff is all polite, but there are few Russian-speaking employees. </p><p>  The city itself is clean and beautiful - a lot of greenery, mountains, the smell is gorgeous.  Everywhere flowers, palms, cypresses grow. </p><p>  As for the cons.  Judging by the reviews of tourists who were dissatisfied with the holidays spent at the Grand Hotel Faros 4 * hotel (Marmaris), the complex is completely not suitable for families with kids.  There is practically no children's animation and entertainment, the territory is small, there is nowhere to walk.  Far to the sea, this is the 3rd beach line.  You can only get to the beach by bus, which runs only three times a day.  From the airport to the hotel, travel far and long.  Among the guests - mostly Germans.  There are practically no tourists from Russia. </p><p>  The hotel is very basic, no frills.  The work of the Internet leaves much to be desired.  Air conditioners cool poorly.  Maids do their job poorly. </p><h2>  Things to do for people who booked a tour to this Marmaris hotel </h2><p>  To begin with, the city in which Faros is located is located in a picturesque bay and is surrounded on all sides by mountains and hills with dense vegetation.  Here you can arrange endless walks along the 13 km long embankment and admire the beauties of nature throughout the rest. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the city is located in a bay, the sea here is always calm, without waves.  The beaches are sandy, which makes relaxing with young children especially enjoyable.  Although, in comparison with the Mediterranean Sea, the water here is colder, in July and August you can calmly make long swims, enjoy the warm weather and bask in the bright rays of the sun. </p><p>  Marmaris is also considered the most party city in the country.  In addition to the longest promenade, where there are many bars and clubs with free admission, there is also the famous street - Bar Street, where the fun lasts until the morning.  From Grand Faros to Bar Street can be easily reached by public transport in 15 minutes. </p>

    <p>  There is no open sea in Marmaris, and because of this feature, excursions on yachts in the bays are common in the city.  At the hotel you can buy such a tour at a very reasonable price.  Also, Faros guests can independently visit the famous ancient fortress of Marmaris (entrance costs 5 lire), take a walk along the narrow streets of the old city, take beautiful pictures in the square with a clock tower and enjoy the show ‚ÄúSinging Fountains‚Äù (beginning at 9 a.m. daily).  Near the square is the archaeological park "Rocks of Wellbeing", the entrance to which is completely free.  Here, all the rocks are planted with plants and cacti that grew in the country in the ancient period.  Also in the park you can see the finds found in the city in the IV century BC.  Two water parks are open for fans of water entertainment in the city: the small Atlantis complex and the larger Aqua Dream. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, from Grand Hotel Faros 4 * (Marmaris) you can go on many excursions that are almost inaccessible to tourists spending their holidays off the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  For example, excursion buses daily leave from here to the ancient <span>cities of Ephesus,</span> Tlos and Dalyan, the Saklykent gorge, to the eighth wonder of the world - the sources of Pamukkale and to the thermal sources of Sultaniye.  The road to these attractions from Marmaris is much closer than from Kemer or Antalya. </p><p>  Near Marmaris is the island of Sedir with the famous snow-white beach of Cleopatra.  Also, many may be interested in the G√∂kova Pine Park, located in the pleasant village of Akiaka (Gokova Bay). </p><p>  In terms of shopping in Marmaris, too, everything is fine.  There are many chain stores with high-quality products for every taste. </p><h2>  In outline </h2><p>  The Faros Hotel is not bad, with a green area, rich infrastructure, a wide range of services and friendly staff.  The service is average, the food is decent.  In general, if you rely on numerous reviews about the Grand Hotel Faros (Marmaris), it is suitable for simple accommodation and measured beach holidays, it is consistent with the ratio of price and quality. </p>
