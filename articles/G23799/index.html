    <p>  In December 2011, a long time ago 2011, the device began to be delivered to the smartphone market under the index I. This is the <span>Samsung Galaxy Ace</span> S5830, or rather, its modification.  What are the differences between the two models?  The device with index I has a slightly different graphics accelerator, and there is also another processor operating at a frequency of 832 megahertz. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The device‚Äôs delivery set includes, in addition to himself, the Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace Black battery, as well as a charger.  Also, the user is given the opportunity to synchronize the smartphone with a personal computer or laptop using a cable such as MicroUSB - USB.  This wire is included with the device.  Well, the microSD memory card with a capacity of 2 gigabytes completes the set.  It may or may not ship with the phone.  It all depends on which country the device is purchased in. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dimensions </h2>

    <p>  Samsung Galaxy Ace S5830 is similar to the device under the name S II.  So to speak, outwardly this is just a small copy of the corresponding phone.  Control elements are still located, supplemented by a rectangular button, the device body has the same geometry. </p><h2>  Production material </h2>

The back panel is painted black, the lid is not smooth, but embossed.  A practical solution, given the fact that the relief helps to avoid scratches and mechanical damage.  At the same time, the lid will still be overwritten, and fingerprints on black plastic are much more noticeable than on white.  For the rest, we note that a chrome piping runs along the perimeter of the phone.  The plastic from which the Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace phone is made (firmware is available on the company's official website) is glossy. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2><p>  It can please people who have made their choice in favor of this unit.  Smartphone experts have repeatedly conducted tests that reveal the superior build quality of the device.  The device did not reveal any backlashes or creaks during long-term operation.  Not even the most ordinary crunch appeared.  At the same time, the screen of the device with additional glass or plastic is not protected.  That is why it will not be so difficult to scratch it. </p><h2>  Reliability and convenience </h2>

    <p>  Such a small mass allowed the device to be used successfully.  The Samsung Galaxy Ace S5830 phone lies in the hand, the price of which is about nine thousand rubles, very reliable.  This is achieved, among other things, due to the ergonomic design, which is complemented by a perforated rear panel.  It is convenient to transport the phone in any pockets, be it jeans, a jacket or an ordinary shirt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Front Panel </h2><p>  Here is the <span>proximity sensor.</span>  It is located at the top of the front side.  Not far from him, on the side, a spoken speaker perched.  Its volume is average, sometimes in a conversation is not enough.  There is no necessary margin, for which you can automatically set a minus.  Yes, quality is generally on par.  From the other end of the wire, the interlocutor is audible, the sound purity is not lame.  But if you work in conditions of high noise or the interlocutor has problems with the microphone (and maybe he speaks quietly), then this will be a serious problem. </p><p>  Under the screen are touch keys that allow us to get to the main menu, as well as go back one item.  There is a backlight.  It is not regulated.  The backlight color is white.  It is not visible in the light, although in low light conditions it becomes an obvious advantage of the device.  Between the elements of the transition to the menu and the item back there is a key with which we can move to the device‚Äôs desktop.  This is a standard move for the creations of a South Korean manufacturer.  The key is framed by chrome-plated plastic.  Has a small stroke, squeezed quite softly.  If the user holds the button for a few seconds, a menu will open.  In it, we can see which applications are currently running on the phone. </p><h2>  Left side </h2><p>  Here is a thin key that allows us to adjust the volume level in the device.  With it, we can change the sound mode, as well as control the volume in the multimedia player, where music files and video clips open.  Slightly above you can find a sector in which there is a strap mount.  As a precaution, one cannot fail to note this. </p><h2>  Right side </h2><p>  There is a power control button on this side.  She is responsible for locking and unlocking the device, as well as for turning it on and off.  A little lower than the button you can find a compartment in which the user can install a microSD memory card.  This nest is covered with a special protective plug made of plastic.  When the card is installed as needed, you will hear a soft click. </p>

    <h2>  Bottom end </h2><p>  There is a microphone for voice communication.  Everything, nothing else we will not find on it. </p><h2>  Top end </h2><p>  Here the choice will be more, after all.  The composition consists of a jack for a wired headset of 3.5 mm standard, as well as a MicroUSB port, which simultaneously serves as a means of synchronization with a personal computer and charging. </p><h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  It has a fairly large eye of the main camera.  Nearby there is a flash that allows you to take photos of good quality in low light conditions.  Well, it ends with a sound speaker, which is covered with a metal mesh. </p><p>  Removing the cover is quite simple.  To do this, simply pry it in the lower end, for a special recess.  When the user removes the back cover, he will be able to detect the device‚Äôs battery under it.  If you remove it, then you can see the slot in which the SIM card is installed. </p><h2>  Conclusion and owner reviews </h2><p>  In general, ‚ÄúSamsung Galaxy Ace S5830‚Äù makes a pretty good impression.  And this cannot be noted.  What we get on the list of the main advantages of the device?  The first is the camera.  Still, five megapixels are not lying on the road.  Photos are high quality, even in low light.  Well, in general, <span>everything is known by comparison,</span> and this case is no exception. </p><p>  Secondly, it was not bad to implant the software and the operating system.  It works fast enough, special slowdowns in the process of conducting numerous tests were not found.  Thirdly, the advantage is an interesting, ergonomic design.  But to compete with the most powerful devices of the segment, this is clearly not enough.  Perhaps a couple of words should be said about the dynamics of the device, which is distinguished by the clarity of the sound supply. </p>

    <h2>  Competitors </h2><p>  One of the competitors of Samsung Galaxy Ace is Huawei IDEO X5.  Compared with the subject of our review today, it has a more original design, which is automatically recorded in the advantage.  In addition, 512 megabytes of RAM is built into the device, and a more powerful processor provides better performance.  The processor runs at a frequency of 800 megahertz.  In addition, the diagonal of this device will be larger by 0.3 inches.  The screen resolution of Huawei is 480 by 800 pixels.  The average cost of the device is almost the same - ten thousand rubles. </p><p>  Another competitor is the LG Optimus Hub.  Here we have a screen of the same diagonal.  The resolution will be lower, only 320 by 480 pixels.  However, there is a camera (5 megapixels).  512 MB of RAM are built into the device; there is a Qualcomm processor family.  It operates at frequencies up to 800 megahertz.  The price of the device falls in the range from eight to nine thousand rubles. </p><p>  Finally, we answer the question of how to update the Samsung GT S5830 Galaxy Ace.  To do this, we need firmware for the device, which can be found on the official website of the company.  Corresponding programs are also needed.  This, of course, is about Kies.  After all the components are assembled, we connect the phone and start the automated process of replacing files.  However, the user does this at his own risk, do not forget about it. </p><p>  By the way, the object of our today's review of RAM installed is half as much.  And this sometimes leads buyers to the idea that it is better to take another device with the best technical characteristics for the same price.  And the built-in memory for storing user data hardly exceeds 150 megabytes. </p>
