To do this, go to Phuket Wake Park.  And no matter whether you are a beginner or an expert in wakeboarding, you will get a lot of positive emotions in the exciting rides of a large freshwater lake.  And the article will introduce this interesting sport that Thai people have been fond of since the age of six. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="Gm4sQ4yC_P8" data-url="https://youtu.be/Gm4sQ4yC_P8" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/5/0/2/2/5022.jpg"></div><h2>  Wake park </h2><p>  What can you say about wakeboarding?  This is an actively developing sport and recreation.  Amateurs and beginners see it as fun and safe entertainment on vacation.  In the elements of wakeboarding, you can see something from the water ski slalom and at the same time the presence of acrobatic jumps.  This is done by professionals. </p><p>  Phuket Wake Park is located next to the Kathu waterfall and is one of the interesting places for outdoor activities in Phuket.  He works all year round.  This is a small artificial lake, the size of which is 410 by 110 meters.  The depth of the reservoir is 2 meters.  There are no waves and boats on the lake, and skating is due to the suspension mechanism.  The athlete stands on a special board, picks up the cable, and forward.  It is worth mentioning that wakeboards do not just become legs.  There is a wakeboard holder for different levels of skiing.  The athlete puts on his feet shoes with a special sole and reinforced heel, which softens blows on the water.  This design holds feet securely on the wake.  There are different shoes: lace-up and Velcro.  The toe of the boot may be open and closed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="grandboats.kiev.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wakeboard Mounts" class="if uuid-2584553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2584553.jpg"></div><h2>  Trails and equipment </h2><p>  The track is quite long, equipped with Sesitec cable systems that provide cable work for beginners, and covering the entire body of water.  By the way, if someone falls on a long track, then you will not have to go back to the start on foot.  They come for him on a bike and deliver to the place of start. </p><p>  Do not rush to buy equipment for riding on the board, everything can be rented at the base of the park.  To try out this type of entertainment, you must follow the rules of wakeboarding: put on a life jacket, helmet and choose a wakeboard (this is a wakeboard).  A professional instructor gives complete instructions and tips before starting independent skiing, and for free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.actionsportasia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket Wake Park" class="if uuid-2584005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2584005.jpg"></div><p>  Conveniently, Russian-speaking professional wakeboarders work in Wake Park, who took first places in international competitions.  That is why you should not be afraid of beginners.  They are in good hands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In Phuket, Wake Park is interesting to watch professionals who do interesting <span>acrobatic stunts.</span> </p><h2>  Work with instructors </h2><p>  True, beginners on a large highway will not be able to immediately make successful "rides" on the water.  Therefore, as elsewhere, you need to start with the track for beginners.  And this is a positive aspect of Phuket Wake Park, because a beginner can order an individual training with a professional.  The instructors patiently and intelligibly explain how to stand on the board, how to hold your body, how to hold the rope with your hands.  This is a free training for beginners.  At first it‚Äôs always difficult, but gradually understanding comes to what‚Äôs what and how it works.  In training, beginners go through all the basics of wakeboarding. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.phuket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amusement park" class="if uuid-2584008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2584008.jpg"></div><p>  But no less interesting advanced training is provided by trainers for professionals, sharing their best practices on how to overcome high-quality obstacles on the lake.  There are no boundaries for perfection.  For professionals, there are obstacles on the lake: kickers, straights, a step down, a pipe, a double fan box and one Steffen-Wallert. </p><p>  When you overcame the fear of the first exit to the water, wakeboarding (photo above) is great, fun and extreme - beginners who have mastered the track share their impressions.  Youthful excitement is bursting, and I want to ride again and again.  Professionals, of course, are far away, but it looks cool even from the outside. </p><h2>  Phuket Wakeboarding Schools </h2><p>  In Phuket, wakeboarding begins at an early age.  There is even a special children's school in which the guys are seriously and actively training.  They take to school from 6 years old, at this time the main skeletal bones are already formed.  Children start wakeboarding with kneeboards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sheffieldcablewaterski.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Skiing in nibord" class="if uuid-2584352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2584352.jpg"></div><p>  This is a board on which they ride on their knees or stomach.  It all depends on the configuration of the board.  This is a fun and easy task.  Anyone can use the nibord, as it is included in the cost of admission to Wake Park. </p><h2>  Wake Park Tickets </h2><p>  At Phuket Wake Park, you can enjoy skiing on the clock or by buying a full day ticket.  Beginners who, one might say, absolutely know nothing and do not know how, can not only learn to stand and ride a wakeboard on their own.  It is also an opportunity to learn a few tricks, if you have the ability and desire, and get great pleasure from it! </p><p>  Many beginners think that taking a full-day ticket on the first day of their appearance in the park is not worth it.  They just do not imagine how interesting this entertainment is.  But, when the first trial ‚Äútrips‚Äù on a wakeboard are made, the realization comes that you can actually ride all day.  The next day, of course, both arms and legs can hurt.  But this is from tension and improper grip of the cable.  All comes with experience. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.makemytrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket Amusement Park in Phuket (Thailand)" class="if uuid-2584013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2584013.jpg"></div><p>  The park is open from 07:30 to 23:00.  There is the possibility of a night ride when the entire park is lit.  The park has a funded card, convenient for local residents. </p><h2>  Wake Park Services </h2><p>  Phuket Wake Park <strong>is a</strong> great place to spend a joint holiday with the whole family or with friends.  As you can see, this sport is submissive to all ages.  To eat during your stay in the park, you can go to the indoor restaurant and enjoy Thai, Western, as well as Russian cuisine.  The restaurant serves pork chops, steaks, spaghetti, seafood, a variety of sandwiches and sandwiches. </p><p>  The park has everything for a wonderful time.  For visitors to Wake Park, various types of services are provided, which include a shower, changing rooms, a swimming pool, a large number of parking spaces and free Wi-Fi.  There is also a spa and hotel rooms for those who have come for more than one day.  The staff speaks English, and the work of the park's staff is aimed at ensuring safe recreation, skiing and entertainment on the water. </p><section class="h"></section>
