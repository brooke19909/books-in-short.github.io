This island, like the other, Crete, is associated with legends and myths.  According to legend, it was here, in the azure waters of the Mediterranean, that the divine Aphrodite was born, therefore this paradise is often called the island of Love.  And thanks to this, newlyweds like to come here - to celebrate their honeymoon.  By the way, in recent years, tours including the organization of wedding ceremonies have become popular.  Their cost is 1500-1700 US dollars for a married couple.  And these services are provided without exception by all the resorts of <span>Cyprus: Ayia Napa,</span> Protaras, Larnaca, Paphos, Limassol, etc. Another reason to visit Cyprus is christening.  There are many Christian churches and monasteries that are several centuries old. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus Resorts Ayia Napa" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/561412.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Trip to Cyprus: tours, prices, service </h2><p>  As already mentioned, this paradise <span>Greek island</span> located in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Turkey and Syria attracts millions of travelers from all over the world every year.  It never loses its relevance as a tourist destination, because it is considered not only as a beach resort, but also as a place with a rich historical and cultural heritage.  Regardless of which resort in Cyprus to choose a tour, the rest will be truly interesting and exciting.  As for the cost of living in hotels and services, they can not be called cheap.  Even budget hotels cannot boast of low prices.  A weekly tour to a 2 or 3-star hotel will cost from 20,000 rubles, no less.  But even in them tourists will receive a high level of service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  General Description of the Makronissos Village Hotel </h2><p>  This hotel complex is located 500 meters from the beach.  Despite the fact that in the advertising materials it is indicated as a hotel, in fact it is not.  This is a mini-village, consisting of comfortable bungalows, made in a special <span>Mediterranean style.</span>  They are located next to a walk alley and numerous taverns, restaurants and cafes.  However, the complex has its own institutions of this kind.  Weekly, Macronissos Village 3 * hosts traditional Cypriot nights with national dishes.  The territory of the complex, which is literally surrounded by greenery, is equipped with everything necessary for an ideal holiday.  For children there is a water park, for fans of sports entertainment - tennis courts, horse riding fields, a swimming pool and much more.  The biggest advantage of these apartments is the magnificent view from the window, and it is not so important where the windows look: at the garden, the surroundings, the pool or the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus: tours, prices" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/561406.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the hotel does not have its own beach, so tourists have to use the nearest municipal beach (400-500 m).  Admission is free, however sun loungers and umbrellas are provided for vacationers for a fee.  Water activities are also paid.  But everyone can play beach volleyball.  By the way, tourists can use other beaches at their discretion, just in order not to get lost, they need to buy a special brochure for vacationers in the town of Ayia Napa.  The map that is available in it will show where and on what you can go from any part of the village. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists, before heading to a particular hotel, begin to study not the brochures, but the reviews of former vacationers.  And this is somewhat correct.  After all, here you can find objective information.  However, do not forget about the moment of subjectivity.  Nevertheless, the reviews about Macronissos Village Club, which are available on various portals, are mostly positive.  Of course, the hotel does not claim to be elite, but the level of service here is quite high.  Tourists speak very warmly about the cooks and all the hotel staff.  Hospitality and friendliness are the most characteristic features of Cypriots.  There are practically no complaints about the level of service.  In a word, at this hotel each of the tourists will meet the ideal price-quality ratio, and what more could you ask for? </p>
