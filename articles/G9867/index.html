Indeed, the choice is sometimes quite difficult to make.  Chic European resorts, surrounded by sights, are an excellent prospect for relaxation.  But sometimes one wants to be away from the hustle and bustle of the city, from civilization and endless crowds of tourists.  And far from always succeeding in going on vacation in the summer.  And here, every tourist begins to remember about luxury resorts offering excellent beach vacations even in winter. </p><p>  One of these paradise towns is precisely the popular Indian state of Goa.  Yes, India is considered to be a lagging country around the world, most of the locals really live below the poverty line, in appalling conditions.  This does not detract from the advantages of Goa: endless sandy beaches, gorgeous untouched nature - what else do you need on vacation? </p>

    <h2>  Resort Features </h2><p>  Of course, it‚Äôs not enough to choose a resort, you must choose a hotel.  In Goa, problems with finding a suitable option certainly will not arise.  Budget mini-hotels are replaced by luxury apartments located on the coast.  But in choosing the best option, you should be extremely careful and careful: not all the options offered by the tourist operator correspond to their description.  And here reviews of real vacationers will be needed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We want to bring to the attention of all potential tourists a small and, at first glance, modest hotel Casa Rofina Guest House.

    <h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  So, the guest house Casa Rofina Guest House 1 * was built in 2005, and already in 2015 underwent a major renovation, as a result of which it changed beyond recognition.  It must be admitted that often tour operators offer Russians this particular option.  The hotel is located in one of the best resort regions of North Goa - Candolim.  This region is not the most popular among tourists, but recently the number of vacationers here has increased significantly. </p><p>  Casa Rofina Hideaway Guest House 1 * is located just 45 km from the international airport and is a colonial-style building traditional for Goa.  There are not many such hotels here.  The first floor is occupied by the owners of the house, there is also a common leisure room where vacationers can be, share their emotions and impressions of the rest, but the second floor is reserved for rooms.  The place here is quite quiet and calm, remote from the main road, so finding it is not always easy.  The location is the main and undeniable advantage of the hotel, which has already been appreciated by many vacationers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Many of the tourists who are offered by Casa Rofina Hideaway Guest House (Candolim) are skeptical of him, in principle, not expecting anything really good from a 1-star hotel.  But contrary to the prevailing stereotype, I want to say that the rooms here are excellent: spacious and comfortable.

It has air conditioning to ensure freshness and coolness in the rooms, as well as a safe and fridge. </p><p>  Superior rooms at Casa Rofina Guest House 1 * are even more spacious, with a kettle and kitchenware. </p><p>  And finally, the rooms of the highest category are represented by two huge rooms with an entrance hall and a full kitchen.

The room offers stunning views of the coast, and tourists have the opportunity to enjoy the sunsets and meet the sunrises. </p>
