Searching for Black Lake on a map will be quite problematic.  And not because it is not there, or it is very small, but because there are many geographical objects with this name, and not only water bodies, and not only in Russia.  It is simply impossible to tell about all within the framework of one article, especially since the local population considers their Black Lake to be unique and the best.  Therefore, we will consider some of them. </p><h2>  Healing spring </h2><p>  Let's start with one of the most famous in our country.  Khakassia is rightfully proud of its body of water.  People come here not only to relax, but also to heal a bit, swim in the mineral lake, and draw water in the springs.  In addition, at the bottom of the lake there are bottom sediments, which are recognized as therapeutic.  True, for vacationers there are no special conditions, except that nearby there are recreation centers and the private sector in the village of the same name.  By the way, this village Black Lake is also very attractive for tourists.  After all, the famous phytocenter Praskovya works there, where you can heal according to Siberian recipes, as well as purchase herbal preparations.  In connection with the popularity of this place, the logical question is: "How to get to the Black Lake?"  There are several roads.  The northernmost is most often used: 4 kilometers from the village of Novotroitskoye.  However, you can drive from the south - from Sayanogorsk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to the black lake" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/311785.jpg" width="600"></div>

Now it is located on a kind of peninsula that used to be an island.  Historians still argue why it is called Black.  According to one version, this happened due to the fact that the water is stained with humic acids and seems dark.  But there is another story.  In the Time of Troubles, local residents hid on the island, but the Poles found them, hacked or drowned, burned the surrounding <span>pine forest</span> .  The island turned into a black ashes.  He, like the lake, began to be called Black.  In the village of Oil Hills, which was located on the same island, butter was produced for bagels, which were served on the royal table. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Black Lake on the map" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/311784.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Lake on land </h2><p>  The next Black Lake on our list is not a lake at all.  This is a city park in Kazan.  Once upon a time there really was a lake with that name.  Around there were green spaces, and the coast is trimmed with ledges.  The water was unusually clean, but swam over time, and local authorities decided to fall asleep.  But the park remained.  At the end of the century before last, it was the main place for festivities of Kazan.  Here was a <span>restaurant,</span> photo <span>pavilions</span> , a fountain, which turned into a skating rink in winter.  And in the 30s of the twentieth century, the ‚ÄúArch of Lovers‚Äù was installed here, which has amazing acoustics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="black lake" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/311783.jpg" width="600"></div>  These are not all objects with the mysterious name "Black Lake".  In Ulyanovsk, for example, there is an old lake with this name and an ecological park around, where many animals live, rare and endangered representatives of the flora grow.  The amazingly picturesque lake in the Czech Republic is also called - the deepest and largest among all natural lakes in this country.  Guests and <span>residents of Montenegro</span> enjoy the beauty of the Black Lake in <span>the</span> Durmitor <span>National Park</span> .  Melt water in the spring form an amazing waterfall here.
