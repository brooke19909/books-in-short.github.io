    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  Geigel Lake spread to the west of the country.  Its total area does not exceed 0.8 square meters.  km, it reaches 2.8 km in length and only 800 m in width. It rises by more than 1.5 thousand meters above sea level. The lake belongs to the sewage type and flows into the large river Shamkirchay.  This body of water belongs to the National Park of Azerbaijan, bearing the same name - Geigel. </p><h2>  Education and Nutrition </h2><p>  It is worth noting that many unique reservoirs are located on the territory of such a state as Azerbaijan.  Geigel Lake - crater, was formed during a large-scale earthquake that occurred back in 1139, as a result of the fall of mountain peaks.  That is why the minimum depth in this pond is not less than 25 m. The largest depression reaches a mark of 96 m. This depth determines that the temperature of lake water, even in the high summer months, never rose above +19 <sup>o</sup> C. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Geigel Lake in Azerbaijan, the photo of which can be viewed in the article, is nourished thanks to annual snowmelt and precipitation, as well as due to flowing small rivers, mountain and underground springs.  The water here is surprisingly always quite clean and transparent, which allows you to see the bottom of the reservoir even in the deepest depressions.  A well-mineralized water is an excellent tool for irrigation and drinking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="geigel lake in azerbaijan photo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1258593.jpg" width="600"></div>
