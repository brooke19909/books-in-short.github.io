As the saying goes, you borrow money from a bank, and you give yours and with interest.  Therefore, it is important that the terms and conditions and transparency of the debt agreement be a priority for the financial institution in which the future cardholder opens a credit account. </p><p>  To date, the number of financial institutions offering to arrange a convenient tool for obtaining loans, namely a credit card, is enough.  Baltic Bank is no exception.  This financial institution is part of the banking group of one of the leading institutions in this market - Alfa-Bank.  And for many this is a powerful argument. </p><p>  Any Baltic citizen can apply for a Baltic Bank credit card.  And it is not necessary that the bank‚Äôs office is located in the city of the borrower, everything can be arranged via the Internet.  A contract to receive through a representative or by mail.  Of course, it is more reliable if the future borrower personally arrives at the bank branch and opens a credit line without intermediaries.  Fast registration and high-quality service will make it easy to purchase an additional payment instrument for using borrowed funds on favorable terms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baltic bank credit card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/2191100.jpg" width="NaN"></div>

That is, for customers whose organizations are served in this company.  The lowest rate on the card is at least 26%.  The organization has formed the following conditions of use: </p><ol><li>  There is no need to change the card for four years from the date of issue. </li><li>  The period for making the next payment is a week. </li><li>  The limit does not exceed 400,000 rubles. </li><li>  When making any settlement operations by card, each client receives notifications from the bank and is informed of the available cash balance. </li><li>  Convenient work with a virtual personal account. </li></ol><p>  Before you start using the card, you need to clarify one important point.  First of all, the client must have an open current account.  Depending on how the future borrower uses his account, there are two categories of cards: </p><ol><li>  <em>Affiliate</em> .  For those who have a deposit in the bank. </li><li>  <em>Personal</em> .  This product is available only to payroll customers. </li></ol><p>  But as for the conditions of service, they do not differ from each other.  Both products are pre-approved, so before starting the release, the bank will check the information for its authenticity for each questionnaire received. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to close a card of a Baltic bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/2191101.jpg"></div>

The amount of payment that will need to be paid each month is 5% of the total debt plus interest rate.  The conditions are relevant only for those cards where the total payments are more than 3,000 rubles.  In the event that the client delays the payment, penalties begin to apply. </p><h2>  <span>Grace periods</span> and limits </h2><p>  Surely every client has heard that credit card holders are given grace periods during which additional interest amounts are not charged to the principal amount of the debt.  The bank provides a maximum of a week to pay the debt, and the available limit is 400,000 rubles.  However, it is important to understand that the amount in the conditions of this limit may vary, depending on the individual consideration of the application of each candidate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer to a Baltic bank card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/2191103.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to make a transfer to a card </h2><p>  Each credit card holder has the opportunity to register a personal account on the official website.  Entering the data, it is possible to transfer to the card of any bank in a matter of minutes.  It is only necessary to indicate the card number of another holder and confirm the operation via SMS. </p><h2>  How to check card balance? </h2><p>  There are three ways you can check your credit card balance: </p><ol><li>  Through an ATM. </li><li>  Through SMS requests. </li><li>  Through a personal account on the site, or download a client application through which you can work with a credit account on a computer. </li></ol><p>  To find out the available limit amount on a credit card, you need to write the following request form in the SMS message: balance - ID (card ID, which, when activated, comes in the SMS message).  However, in order to use this service, it must first be connected at any bank office.  We dial 9210000921 (+7) and then follow the automatic prompts of the system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="check card balance baltic bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/2191102.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to close the card of the Baltic Bank? </h2><p>  Many customers make one serious mistake - they independently liquidate a payment instrument.  But even if they did not use the card, but it was activated, closing is possible only by contacting the bank.  The payment instrument is tied to a credit account.  Therefore, to close the card, you must follow the instructions: </p><ol><li>  Call the bank and check how much debt exists. </li><li>  Pay off the debt on the card. </li><li>  Arrive at the bank branch with a passport and write an application to block the card. </li><li>  Wait for a message or other notification that the service has been implemented. </li></ol><p>  As a rule, it takes several business days to close a credit card account of a Baltic Bank.  After this period, it‚Äôs worthwhile to once again come to the bank and get a certificate on account closure and the absence of claims from the financial institution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bank card baltic bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/2191098.jpg"></div>
