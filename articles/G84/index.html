    <p>  For RGB ceiling lighting in a clean, dry room, products with IP20 class can be used.  If the room is not heated, it is better to give preference to diodes like IP22. </p><p>  For exterior lighting, tapes with <span>protection class IP44</span> can be used <span>.</span>  However, such structures must be under the roof.  They withstand splashing water, temperature changes.  However, such tapes cannot withstand a long stay in water.  They can also be used to create lighting in the kitchen or in the bathroom. </p><p>  In dusty environments, IP65 type devices can be used.  They are also not afraid of cleaning with a jet of water under pressure.  This class of luminaires is also shock resistant.  Therefore, the presented tape can be used for tuning cars. </p><p>  Waterproof are tapes of class IP67.  They can be used for lighting inside pools.  The presented products are not afraid of a long stay under water.  Also, this tape can be used to highlight fountains. </p><h2>  Dimmer </h2><p>  To connect the tape to the network, you must use a special dimmer and controller for RGB backlighting.  These are integral attributes of the electrical products presented. </p><p>  Dimmer allows you to control the intensity of lighting.  If necessary, it can make the stream of rays bright, allowing you to fully illuminate the space.  In some cases, the flow rate can be reduced. </p><h2>  Controller </h2><p>  The controller also allows you to create lighting effects, control the shade of the glow.  The presented device also sets the lighting program.  The controller also controls the speed of the color change. </p><p>  Today, many models of dimmers and controllers have built-in systems for remote control of the light flux.  This allows using special controls to set the glow parameters. </p><h2>  Control unit selection </h2><p>  RGB backlighting with or without a remote control needs a must-have component.  This is the power supply unit, which is responsible for supplying the necessary voltage to the electrical device.  You need to choose it correctly.  This takes into account the power of the tape.  It can be 12 or 24 V. </p><p>  First you need to calculate how much electricity consumes 1 m of tape.  To do this, refer to the documentation that comes with the diode device.  Next, multiply this indicator by the length of the tape.  For example, in the course of simple calculations, it was found that the total power of the system is 48 watts. </p><p>  The power supply must withstand the rated load a little more.  Moreover, the stock should be about 25%.  For a tape with a rated power of 48 W, a 60 W power supply is suitable.  This will provide normal conditions for the functioning of the system. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  RGB backlighting today is made by different brands.  They are distinguished by quality, cost and functionality.  Well-proven products of European brands Cree, Geniled, Sveteco, etc. These are the highest quality ribbons that can create a high-quality color flow. </p><p>  Domestic manufacturers also offer for sale many varieties of such lights.  These products are also marked by acceptable quality.  Among the most popular brands should be noted LUX, LEDCraft. </p><p>  Experts say that you should not buy backlight of Chinese production.  It is not of high quality.  Saving on components leads to overheating of the diodes.  In this case, their service life is significantly reduced.  In this case, the backlight will not be able to provide a high-quality luminous flux.  Managing these tapes also leaves much to be desired.  Light spots can be detected on the surface of the product. </p><p>  Having considered the features and characteristics of the RGB backlight, everyone will be able to purchase the appropriate option in accordance with the operational features. </p>
