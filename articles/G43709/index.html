It beckons with exoticism and mystery, tales of pirates, Spanish conquistadors and countless treasures.  But even without these beautiful legends, Maracaibo Lake is attractive at any time of the year.  It is large, picturesque and unique, and therefore it is worth it to be seen at least once in a lifetime. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Maracaibo Lake" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/845313.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  A bit of history and facts </h2><p>  So where is Lake Maracaibo located and what is it like?  This amazing pond is located in South America, in a country called Venezuela.  It is not only the largest on the mainland, but also one of the oldest on the planet.  Today, its banks are covered with <span>sugarcane</span> and cocoa plantations, but this was not always the case. </p><p>  A large brackish reservoir, which later became known as Lake Maracaibo, was discovered by Europeans in 1499.  The Spaniard Alonso de Ojeda was struck by the dwellings of the natives built on stilts: the panorama reminded him of Venice, and therefore he called open lands ‚ÄúLittle Venice‚Äù, that is, Venezuela.  The port of Maracaibo arose here after three decades. </p><p>  Lake Maracaibo, whose photo can be seen in our article, is actually a lagoon.  It is connected to the <span>Venezuelan Gulf by a</span> shallow strait in the north.  It feeds on a body of water from a large number of rivers and streams, and a quarter of the country's population lives on its vast banks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Maracaibo lake photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/845335.jpg" width="526"></div>

It is believed that this is the second body of water that currently exists on our blue-eyed planet.  Then, in 1823, the famous battle will take place, the outcome of which allowed Venezuela to become an independent state.  But in the era of the formation <span>of the Earth's relief,</span> people were not here.  It is believed that the lake is of glacial origin.  However, there is another opinion.  Some researchers believe that in the past a meteorite fell here, which formed a giant crater.  Over time, the depression was flooded with water, and so the lake arose. </p><h2>  City Maracaibo </h2><p>  Maracaibo Lake on its shores sheltered many settlements, but the largest of them is the city of the same name with a reservoir.  It has several founding dates, but it is generally accepted and most probable is July 24, 1499 - the day when the Spaniards expedition first discovered a huge reservoir, declared these lands the possession of Spain and laid the first settlement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the lake maracaibo" class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/845315.jpg" width="311"></div>

    <p>  In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, these shores were a favorite place of pirates (remember the captain Blood - the hero of R. Sabatini).  They repaired ships here, rested from hikes, and possibly hid treasures.  Later, a fortress, called Gibraltar, grew on the banks of the strait.  But it was destroyed by the rebel Indians.  The city slowly grew and developed, perhaps partly because the sea robbers settled here.  He gained true prosperity after drilling the first oil well in the late nineteenth century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Two suns of Maracaibo </h2><p>  Lake Maracaibo is known for another feature: they will tell you that there are two suns - white and black.  Black is oil, the deposits of which at the bottom of the reservoir are truly colossal.  It gives the city life, forcing it to grow and develop.  Despite the fact that the extraction of <span>black gold</span> (if only Pizarro knew that real gold is hidden not in Peru, but in Venezuela!) Is very active here, the water in the lake remains crystal clear. </p>

    <p>  White sun Maracaibo called products created by local craftswomen.  Knitted lace is made of white thread.  The intricate patterns are different each time, so there is not a single napkin similar to another.  And this is one of the favorite souvenirs of these places. </p><h2>  Lightning Catatumbo </h2><p>  Maracaibo is known for another phenomenon called Katatumbo Lightning.  Over the confluence of the Katatumbo tributary into the lake at an altitude of about five kilometers, a glow is constantly observed.  Lightning without thunder occurs here about 1.2 million times a year.  They can be seen at a distance of four hundred kilometers, therefore, in the past, sailors often focused on them.  For centuries, people could not explain the strange phenomenon, so they came up with beautiful legends.  Modern science knows the reason for this strange phenomenon: it is hidden in a large accumulation of warm gases above the water column, which rise into the cold <span>layers of the atmosphere</span> and react there.  One way or another, but the famous zippers adorn the coat of arms of the state of Zulia and are a real attraction of the region. </p><h2>  And finally I‚Äôll tell you ... </h2><p>  Luxurious in size and beauty, the lake not only gives life to the people living on its shores.  In the water column of Maracaibo, numerous species of fish and other underwater inhabitants are found.  The coast is overgrown with lush tropical forests and agricultural land. </p><p>  The origin of the name Maracaibo is not known for certain.  Some researchers believe that the Indians called this area "Maara Ivo", that is, a land where there are many snakes.  Others believe that the Indians during the battle suddenly shouted "Mara Kayo", which means Mara fell, died (Mara is the name of a warrior).  But be that as it may, this lake is a real gem not only of the Caribbean region, but also of our entire planet. </p>
