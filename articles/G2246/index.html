    <h2>  Components </h2><p>  First of all, you should decide on the details of the costume.  It will definitely be a long skirt and bodice.  However, if it is not possible to make beautiful all the details, you can safely do with just one belt.  From the accessories you can prepare a veil, you will also need a huge number of different <span>jewelry on your hands,</span> ears, legs - earrings, rings, chains, bracelets, etc. </p><h2>  Bodice </h2><p>  If a woman is going to make a costume for belly dancing with her own hands, work can begin with preparing the bodice.  For this, a regular opaque bra (preferably foam rubber) may be suitable.  If it is already a suitable color, it will only need to be decorated.  However, it‚Äôs better to pre-trim it with the desired fabric, so that its appearance is not mundane.  It will be impossible to create an integral part of the skin, therefore it will consist of several parts.  The first is the part for the cups.  It is cut out in a rectangular shape and bent over the finished product.  To do this, you will need to make several folds of fabric on the principle of creating a tuck.  You will also need fabric on the straps.  To do this, cut out long rectangles that simply wrap these parts on all sides.  The pieces are already sewn on the bra, they can even be sewn with a decorative stitch.  ‚ÄúPonytails‚Äù are hidden under the details for the cups of the bodice, which are sewn last.  We go further, creating individual parts for a costume for belly dancing with our own hands.  When the bra is completely wrapped with new fabric, you need to start decorating the product.  Everything that a lady likes will be useful here.  It can be just beautiful embroidery with threads or beads, or there can be glued sequins in the form of fish scales, etc. Then the woman herself decides what she wants to get as a result.  However, one must remember that everything should be fairly securely attached, because in this costume you will have to dance, that is, actively move. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oriental belly dance costumes" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/351197.jpg?1394540877023" width="275"></div></h2><h2>  Skirt </h2><p>  Sewing a belly dance costume includes making a <span>long skirt.</span>  To do this, you need to take a fairly thin <span>transparent fabric</span> that drapes perfectly, such as chiffon or crepe chiffon.  Now you need to decide which skirt you want to make.  Two options can be considered.  The first is an ordinary straight skirt with slits on the sides, the second is a sun skirt. </p><p>  In any case, you need to pre-prepare the <span>costume patterns</span> for belly dancing.  So, for a straight skirt, you will need to take two pieces of fabric that will sew together on the sides until the end of the thigh.  Unstitched sections and the bottom are simply hemmed.  Above, you can provide for the usual wide belt, which must be made of elastic fabric, because it will most likely be on the hips, and not on the waist.  To do this, you need a piece of fabric twice as wide as the belt itself.  The fabric for the belt bends along the width with the wrong side inward.  Next, the belt is sewn to the skirt.  To do this, first, the inner part of the belt (which is adjacent to the body) is sewn with a skirt, then the fabric allowances are tucked in, covered with the front part of the belt, and everything is swept.  If everything turned out neatly, a decorative stitch starts at the front of the belt.  Oriental belly dance costumes also suggest the possibility of creating a skirt-sun.  It can be sewn in the same way as the previous one, however, the tissue will leave a little more, about 2.5 times.  After all, the skirt-sun is a circle with a neckline for the waist in the center.  The top of the skirt, along the waistline, can be seized.  The hem is hemmed with a narrow hem; a wide belt is sewn to the top.  That's all, the skirt is ready. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="belly dance costume patterns" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/351196.jpg?1394540914157" width="214"></div></h2><h2>  Belt </h2><p>  When preparing a costume for a belly dance with your own hands, it is important not to forget about such a moment as the design of the belt.  It is this detail that gives the costume a special appeal.  How to make it?  To do this, it is better to pre-prepare the pattern in full size.  The top will definitely be straight, and the bottom of the belt can be triangular, curly, rounded - any to your taste.  The length of the product is calculated: this is the circumference of the waist plus about 4 cm on the fastener.  You can make tucks so that the product fits perfectly on the figure. </p><p>  The fabric is also selected: on the basis of the belt - dense, you can cotton, and on the top - something light and beautiful, such as supplex, satin, crepe satin.  You will also need a dense non-woven fabric for gluing the product, it will be attached from the inside to the front of the product.  When the parts are ready, they need to be folded with their faces inward, stitched, turned out, through the left hole, sweep and insert the fastener (the belt can simply be tied).  Now it remains to decorate it in the same way as the bodice. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing belly dance costume" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/351201.jpg?1394541044491" width="264"></div></h2><h2>  Accessories </h2><p>  What other details might oriental belly dance costumes suggest?  Of course, these are special decorations.  Earrings, <span>bracelets on the hands</span> and ankles are definitely needed - the more the better, because when a woman dances, they ring nicely.  By the way, they can also be made independently from beads or beads.  You need to decorate the neck with chains or coarse beads, and your fingers with rings.  However, it is important not to overdo it with decorations so that the figure is not too bulky.  Of course, one should not forget about bright makeup, where the eyes should stand out especially. </p>
