There are many different hotels here, but now we will focus on only one.  And this is Sudala Beach Resort 3 *, located in the resort town of Khao Lak. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The advantage of this hotel is that it is literally at arm's length from the sea.  In walking distance is the famous Bang Niang Beach, which is the best of those that are available in the vastness of the resort of Khao Lak. </p><p>  In addition, the place where the Sudala Beach Resort is located is developed in terms of infrastructure.  Restaurants, cafes and the local market are within walking distance.  The airport, however, is far away - 60 kilometers from the hotel.  But the rest will not be disturbed by the noise of planes taking off and landing. </p><p>  The address is as follows: Bang Niang Beach, 56/4 Moo 5, index 82190. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.superzajezdy.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sudala beach resort khao lak" class="if uuid-2965959" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2965959.jpg"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Sudala Beach Resort is a 3-star hotel and has everything that a hotel of this level should have.  The list of services includes: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Free Wi-Fi in the business center. </li><li>  Private parking with security. </li><li>  Transfer services. </li><li>  Luggage storage. </li><li>  Reception open 24 hours a day. </li><li>  Currency exchange point. </li><li>  Laundry. </li><li>  Item with fax and photocopy. </li><li>  Room and room service. </li></ul><p>  The staff working at Sudala Beach Resort 3 * speaks only two languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Thai and English.  Unfortunately, no one knows Russian here.  The reason for this is the lack of a large flow of tourists from Russia at this hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sawadee.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sudala beach resort 3" class="if uuid-2965957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2965957.jpg"></div><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Of course, most tourists stay at Sudala Beach Resort (Khao Lak), because it is very picturesque, and there is also a beach in the immediate vicinity, where they plan to spend all their time. </p><p>  However, even being in the hotel, you can do something with yourself.  Here's what from the leisure infrastructure: </p><ul><li>  Sun terrace and BBQ area. </li><li>  Pools. </li><li>  Massage parlor. </li><li>  Holding culinary master classes. </li><li>  Library. </li><li>  Organization of excursions. </li></ul><p>  In addition, there is an excellent restaurant and bar on site.  But you can tell about them separately. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  On the territory of Sudala Beach Resort 3 * (Khao Lak) there are two establishments: </p><ul><li>  The Sunny Restaurant serves international and local cuisine. </li><li>  Bar Enjoy. </li></ul><p>  People who rested at this hotel spoke warmly about the organization of breakfasts.  They are tasty, varied and fresh, nothing is boring even for a long vacation.  Local Thai food is especially good - gourmets and lovers of exotic food will surely be satisfied. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But tourists recommend taking breakfast here only.  In the vicinity there are many different restaurants and cafes with an impressive range of food and low prices.  If you want to take away as many gastronomic experiences as possible from Thailand, then you should go to new places for lunch and dinner.  And be sure to try fresh seafood that is fried in local markets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com.hk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sudala beach resort 3 khao lak" class="if uuid-2965960" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2965960.jpg"></div><h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  Sudala Beach Resort offers guests three categories of rooms: </p><ul><li>  Superior 2-bed apartment.

Very spacious and comfortable rooms with comfortable furniture and good fixtures. </li><li>  The location is really advantageous.  In a leisurely step, you can walk to a place where shops and restaurants are concentrated in 5-7 minutes.  To the market - 15 minutes. </li><li>  The beach, which is within easy reach, is conveniently divided into zones.  If someone wants to sunbathe, then he should sit next to the bar.  Lovers of coolness will love the dense shade of trees. </li><li>  If you want to take a walk somewhere, then you don‚Äôt even need to leave the hotel.  It is incredibly picturesque - a lot of greenery, there are sun loungers around the pool with umbrellas, relaxation areas. </li><li>  A small bay with a secluded beach and a palm grove, in which the hotel is located, pleases the eye of every tourist. </li><li>  The sea itself is clean, with a comfortable gentle approach. </li><li>  The territory and the surroundings are very quiet.

Each tourist is greeted here as if a long-awaited guest, and then they are treated the same throughout their stay. </li><li>  Massage is done very high quality, and for little money.  You should definitely try this procedure at least once. </li><li>  Excursions are interesting.  The surrounding area has many scenic spots to see.  For example, waterfalls or Similan islands.  The received impressions will be difficult to describe in words. </li></ul><p>  In general, if you study all the reviews left about the rest at Sudala Beach Resort 3 * (Khao Lak) reviews, we can conclude that the hotel meets expectations.  And, importantly, value for money is optimal here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bangkokpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sudala beach resort 3 khao lak reviews" class="if uuid-2965974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2965974.jpg"></div><h2>  When and who better to come? </h2><p>  It is important to give an answer to this question.  In Thailand, as everyone knows, the holiday season does not stop almost never.  The mild climate reigns throughout the year.  If we talk about Khao Lak, then the temperature of air and water is the same both in high and in low season - approximately +28 ... 31 ¬∞ C and +28 ¬∞ C, respectively. </p><p>  It is best to plan a vacation in winter.  December, January, February are considered the most successful time to relax in the resort of Khao Lak.  At this time there are not very many tourists, and there is practically no rain. </p><p>  Who will like it here?  People who dream of a secluded vacation.  This place is not for lovers of active pastime and not for those who crave shopping. </p><p>  By the way, people who want to go on excursions are also worth coming here.  This resort is a convenient starting point for the Similan Islands, Tachai and Surin.  Just remember that they are closed to the public during the storm and rainy season.  As a rule, this period lasts from mid-May to the end of October. </p><p>  Khao Lak is a calm, quiet and Europeanized resort.  There really are a lot of guests from Europe, especially Germans and Scandinavians.  There are few tourists from Russia, and some consider this a serious plus (those who wish to take a break from the Russian-speaking situation). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sawadee.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sudala beach resort reviews" class="if uuid-2965970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2965970.jpg"></div><h2>  Terms of Accommodation </h2><p>  People who decided to plan their trip on their own, rather than buying a tour, should get acquainted with them.  The conditions are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Check-in starts at 14:00. </li><li>  Check out lasts until 12:00. </li><li>  The hotel does not accept guests with children and animals. </li><li>  Extra beds are not available in the apartment. </li><li>  When booking, you must provide your credit card details.  The object accepts "Master Card" and "Visa". </li><li>  A certain amount may be blocked in the account before the guest arrives.  This is a guarantee that the guest really intends to stay at the hotel. </li></ul><p>  By the way, there is another nuance regarding Wi-Fi.  In the rooms it is provided, but at an additional cost.  It costs 350 baht per day (approximately 712 rubles at the current rate). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.choowap.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sudala Beach Resort 3 *" class="if uuid-2965977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2965977.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Finally, it should be said about the price.  A trip to Thailand with accommodation at the Sudala Beach Resort for one person will cost about 50,000 rubles.  This price includes: </p><ul><li>  Accommodation in a double room for 9 days (8 nights). </li><li>  Breakfast </li><li>  Services of a Russian-speaking guide, which can be used at any time of vacation. </li><li>  Round-trip flights departing from Moscow. </li><li>  Transfer from the airport to the hotel and then back. </li></ul><p>  It is important to clarify that the cost is approximate.  There are options both cheaper and more expensive.  The exact cost depends on the chosen tour operator, time of year, advance booking and many other nuances. </p>
