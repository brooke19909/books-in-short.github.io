    <h2>  Feature of hotels in the Krasnodar Territory </h2><p>  Almost all possible places of residence in Sochi were built a long time ago (the exception is hotels created specifically to accommodate a huge tourist flow from around the world during the Winter Olympic Games, for example, the Azimut hotel chain), but this may not bother , since they very often carry out cosmetic and overhaul repairs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="health resort green grove work" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/565406.jpg" width="550"></div>  This is exactly what the Green Grove sanatorium survived (reviews confirm that regular customers could not rest because of work here for about two years).  It opened updated only in the middle of summer 2013.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of the sanatorium Green Grove in the Krasnodar Territory </h2><p>  The hotel itself is considered to be elite, as it is buried in beautiful green thickets of the Caucasian National Reserve (hence its name), spreading over a vast area of ‚Äã‚Äã46 hectares.  "Green Grove" (sanatorium), the photo of which confirms the beauty of the landscape, will make it possible to create a professional gorgeous photo shoot on its territory that will remain in memory for many years, especially if it was dedicated to a solemn event, such as a wedding or an anniversary date.  The building is located at a distance of 160 meters above the sea level, almost in the mountains, which allows us to talk about the crystal clearness and freshness of the local air that can heal.  In Sochi, "Green Grove" (photos do not so vividly demonstrate all the advantages of the hotel) offers to plunge into your atmosphere completely, that is, take a virtual tour.  It will give a very accurate and colorful picture of the future holiday destination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="green grove health resort address" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/565403.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Several luxury villas located by the outdoor pool and tennis court will also delight guests.  Three of them are 2-story and one 4-story.  There are deluxe, junior suite and presidential rooms.  The houses have gyms, saunas (some with a private pool), billiard rooms and places to relax. </p><h2>  Hotel Services </h2><p>  Sochi sanatorium has arranged an entire entertainment system on its endless territory.  All guests will find a lesson to their liking and interests.  In order to verify the reality of this fact, you can see photos of tourists who have been here or study reviews.  Sanatorium "Green Grove" (Sochi) has a good rating because of them, since on most sites it is composed of the opinions of travelers. </p><ol><li>  Fans of water procedures will like their own beach at a distance of only half a kilometer from the sanatorium, outdoor and indoor pools with sizes of 305 and 105 square meters, respectively. </li><li>  A gym with the most modern equipment and a sports complex for training in seven sports (handball, soccer, tennis and table tennis, badminton and, of course, volleyball with basketball) will not let the muscles relax. </li><li>  A billiard room will help you have a great time in the evening after a day filled with sea and sun.  The service is one of the additional, but its cost is low - 250 rubles per hour. </li><li>  Own cinema will entertain everyone, since not only films, but also cartoons are shown here.  The capacity of the hall is 400 people. </li><li>  Business travelers can make use of the local business center, which has fax and Internet services. </li><li>  Employees of the tour desk will help to better explore the <span>sights of the Krasnodar Territory</span> and tell you exactly where to go in the first place. </li><li>  At a bright playground, children can have fun, but if parents want to go "on their own swimming", they can leave their children in the care of the teacher (costing only 100 rubles per hour). </li><li>  Sanatorium "Green Grove", work on the development of infrastructure which is carried out all year round, every new season pleases regular customers with another entertainment.  By the way, a discount system is provided for this type of customer. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanatorium Green Grove Mr. Sochi" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/565412.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  When is the time to eat? </h2><p>  In the city of Sochi, "Green Grove" (reviews say this, not ceasing), the customers' nutrition is given the closest attention, as this is one of the keys to a healthy life.  Beloved by many, the all-inclusive food system allows everyone to make their own individual daily meals, none of the guests remain hungry.  The cooks and the staff responsible for the food in the sanatorium compile a list of dishes according to the time of year and the wishes received from customers.  The canteens clearly defined the time for breakfast (8.30-10.00), lunch (13.00-14.30) and dinner (18.30.20.00).  As in many foreign hotels, appearance at a dinner in an ‚Äúunsightly‚Äù form is unacceptable, that is, you should not go in shorts, sandals or, for example, with hair wet after the sea.  In addition to three meals a day, you can have a snack during the day in the following establishments: </p><ol><li>  Festival bar, located in the dance hall in the second building. </li><li>  Cafe-bar Veterok, which has taken a convenient place on the beach, where you can take a warm, warming drink or a soft one. </li><li>  Beer Bar "Cool."  Located in the first building, there are not only drinks of different varieties, but also dishes, so it is quite possible to satisfy hunger here. </li><li>  The restaurant ‚ÄúPanorama‚Äù in the second building is named due to its beautiful location - on the sixteenth floor of a high-rise building you can see a gorgeous view of the mountain ranges and the sea surface. </li></ol><h2>  Room reservation </h2><p>  To book a room for a trip to the city of Sochi, the sanatorium "Green Grove" is really exactly the same ways as in any other hotels in Russia and abroad.  Firstly, you can contact the travel agency or the operator.  They will help you fill out all the necessary forms and tell you a list of the necessary medical certificates (they are usually needed to undergo a treatment course). </p><p>  Secondly, you can use online booking systems (booking and other similar things), but this is not recommended due to the high percentage of probability of false information on the site.  Naturally, they offer many discounts and sale of rooms for the action, but it should be remembered that such trips can end in the most adverse conditions. </p><h2>  Booking a room for accommodation without intermediaries </h2><p>  OJSC sanatorium "Green Grove" - ‚Äã‚Äãa respectable place.  It has a high-quality official website where you can make a reservation yourself. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="health resort green grove reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/569505.jpg" width="600"></div>  To do this, you must fill out the standard form, where it is necessary to indicate the number of people, the category of the desired number, last name, first name and middle name with the date of birth and other details.  If you have any difficulties, you can call the number indicated in a separate tab ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù, and friendly customer service managers will solve this problem.  The Green Grove (sanatorium) address has the following: Resort Avenue, 120. It is quite easy to find this place using the navigator or local residents.  Rarely does a resort receive guests without prior reservation due to its high demand and particularly heavy workload not only in the midst of summer, but also in winter (people come here not for the sea and tan, but, for example, for wellness procedures).

    <h2>  The necessary documentation for living in a sanatorium </h2><p>  In the city of Sochi, the sanatorium "Green Grove" is engaged not only in the reception and entertainment of guests, but also professionally specializes in providing them with therapeutic and wellness procedures.  That is why the package of documents required here differs from the requirements of ordinary hotels (passports, vouchers and birth certificates for children under 14 years of age are presented at the hotels).  The following documents are checked in the sanatorium: </p><ul><li>  internal passport; </li><li>  photocopy of medical insurance policy; </li><li>  pre-issued spa card. </li></ul><p>  Especially for the kids you need to take: permission to travel from parents and a birth certificate of a child, up to 14 years old a certificate from the sanitary and epidemiological station about vaccinations (including diphtheria). </p><p>  By the way, just such a package of documents is valid in almost all sanatoriums in Russia. </p><h2>  Procedures provided by Green Grove </h2><p>  In Sochi, the Zelenaya Roscha sanatorium offers one of the most common procedures - hydrotherapy (pearl and contrast baths, therapeutic with biological additives: naphthalan, bischofite, essential and aromatic oils; ascending, circular and Charcot's souls; massages using water jets; procedures using radon). </p><p>  The massage services system is striking in its diversity: manual, general, using honey, vibro, anti-cellulite and pressure therapy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews health resort green grove sochi" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/565401.jpg" width="600"></div>  In the "Green Grove" practiced ozone therapy, physiotherapy, therapeutic physical activity (in the <span>form of swimming,</span> physical education and gymnastics).  Also, specialists in the field of medicine in the sanatorium will be engaged in the analysis of your blood and urine, will make different types of diagnostics, then prescribe a course of treatment.  There is no dominant specialization at the sanatorium, here they are involved in the correction and putting in order of the cardiovascular and nervous systems, the musculoskeletal system, skin and gynecological diseases.  Judging by the reviews left on various Internet resources, visitors were satisfied with the medical services provided.
