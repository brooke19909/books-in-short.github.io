    <h2>  Medical services </h2><p>  Many Petersburgers seek to visit the White Nights health resort (sanatorium).  Sestroretsk is located just 38 kilometers from the northern capital, that is, you can get here very quickly and easily, and the climatic features - being in a large pine park - contribute to the saturation of the air with useful ions. </p><p>  Together with the natural factor, a whole range of medical procedures and studies is offered.  Patients with cardiovascular pathologies can have an ECG done in a timely manner.  Laboratory studies will allow you to control the correctness of the prescribed procedures.  If necessary, exercise therapy and other physiotherapeutic procedures are prescribed: massage (both traditional and underwater), inhalations, aerophytotherapy, therapeutic swimming, electrotherapy, applying special mud, visiting a salt cave, warming up with paraffin and ozokerite. </p><p>  Additionally, patients can undergo a bowel examination in the monitoring room, undergo oxygenation in the high-pressure chamber, or under conditions of discharged (artificial "mountain") air.  There are thalasso and hirudotherapy rooms, a <span>dry carbonic bath</span> and an infrared sauna.  You can visit the solarium, dentist or beautician. </p><p>  The presence of contraindications to any procedure is considered individually. </p>

    <h2>  Natural factor of recovery </h2><p>  It will be useful for a person even without special health problems to visit the White Nights sanatorium (Leningrad Region).  Sestroretsk is considered a resort place due to its natural features, one of which is the healing mud of local lakes, related to silt. </p><p>  Its beneficial effect on the body consists of mechanical and biochemical factors, as well as biostimulating and antibiotic effects.  Mud procedures are prescribed for problems with the musculoskeletal system or diseases of the peripheral nervous system, after which there is an improvement in metabolism and the intensity of inflammation decreases.  The healing power of the air determines the proximity of the sea bay and the pine massif. </p><p>  As an additional therapeutic factor, we can distinguish favorable climatic conditions of a moderate continental nature, in which mild winters and non-hot summers are successfully combined. </p><h2>  Leisure activities </h2><p>  In addition to medical procedures, the emotional mood of patients is very important.  Therefore, the sanatorium "White Nights" (St. Petersburg / Sestroretsk) offers residents an extensive cultural program.  You can go on a sightseeing tour of the palaces and suburbs of St. Petersburg or a tour of the picturesque places of the Karelian Isthmus.  On the territory of the sanatorium, evenings with dance programs are arranged, films and concerts are offered to the attention of vacationers.  Sometimes they organize meetings with popular artists.  There is an opportunity for holding various seminars, conferences and business meetings.  It offers residents a cafeteria and bar, a beauty salon and a hairdresser, a pharmacy and a shop, as well as a parking lot.  The territory of the sanatorium is promptly cleaned and ennobled. </p>

    <h2>  Organization of spa treatment </h2><p>  Being in resorts of this type is good because it combines the elements of healing and relaxation, that is, therapeutic measures are carried out gently and unobtrusively and are perceived by patients more kindly than in hospital walls.  For many patients, referral to a sanatorium is a continuation of medical therapy in a specialized institution. </p><p>  The complex of measures at the White Nights institution (sanatorium) consists in organizing close medical supervision, advising specialists of various fields, round-the-clock medical services by nurses, prescribing diagnostic and treatment procedures according to the health resort card and the patient's condition. </p><h2>  additional information </h2><p>  For placement in the sanatorium, it is necessary to provide an identity document (passport - for an adult, for a child - a birth certificate), and medical papers (spa card, ticket and policy of compulsory medical insurance).  Children are accepted only over the age of four, always accompanied by their parents. </p><p>  Check-in usually occurs in the morning at 8.00, check-out at 20.00.  If there is no personal vehicle, you can get to the institution from St. Petersburg in two ways: from the Finland railway station to Sestroretsk station, then change to bus number 310 (go to the ring), or from the Staraya Derevnya metro station in St. Petersburg by bus to the stop "38th kilometer of Primorsky highway". </p>

    <h2>  Should I go to the resort "White Nights" </h2><p>  In Sestroretsk (St. Petersburg), the feedback from those who visited was called to come.  After all, an institution for treatment and rest over a long time of work has gained extensive experience and material base, which allows us to successfully carry out therapeutic and preventive measures and help people with a wide range of pathologies of varying degrees of development. </p><p>  The proposed sets of measures really alleviate the condition of patients and accelerate the healing process after surgical interventions and serious diseases, as evidenced by numerous reviews.  However, the building has not been repaired since the opening day, and equipment and household items have not been updated.  Therefore, there is moderate deterioration of the interior, although all the necessary guests are provided. </p><p>  In general, the opinion about the rest at the White Nights institution (sanatorium) is positive, although there is some dissatisfaction with the service and equipment that does not always work, but you can find a reason for dissatisfaction in the five-star hotel.  We can say that the price-quality ratio is fully justified. </p>
