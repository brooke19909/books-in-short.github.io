    <p>  Very developed in the resort plan is the city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.  ‚ÄúMountain Air‚Äù provides you with the opportunity to ride along one of the 14 tracks.  Each tourist can choose the level of difficulty that suits him personally, which may be due to his preparation and ability to manage his inventory.  This ski resort will provide an opportunity to have a good rest both for an experienced athlete and for a completely green beginner who is just starting to master this skill and perceives everything that is happening as something new and unusual. </p><p>  In total there are 23 kilometers to drive.  For this, people are actively coming to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.  ‚ÄúMountain air‚Äù has three zones, which in a special order are indicated by different colors.  <span>The green zone</span> is suitable for those who are just learning and learning the basics, need careful instruction and do not want to be urged on again, so as not to make mistakes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the red can ride those who already know a lot and can feel quite calm, racing at high speed and standing firmly on their feet. </p><p>  And the black zone is like a karate belt of a similar color.  Only masters and professionals go there, who are bored with simple tests, which they pass with great ease. </p><p>  You can rent equipment on weekdays for 300 rubles (per hour).  At the weekend - 350 rubles per hour.  If your child is less than seven years old, for him the prices will be 150 and 200 rubles.  To use the left-luggage office, you need to spend 100 rubles. </p><p>  Housing can be found for 5-13 thousand rubles a day in a quality hotel. </p><p>  The Mountain Air Resort has a special training slope where no one will disturb or knock down beginners.  You can also head to the ski cross section or to the snowboarding park. </p><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  Winter is very reluctant to leave Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.  ‚ÄúMountain air‚Äù is abundantly covered with beautiful fluffy snow for a long time.  Here is a long cold season.  You can start skating in December.  Last tourists come back in April. </p>
