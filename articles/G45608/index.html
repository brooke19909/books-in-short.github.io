    <p>  Holidays in this city are never boring.  And let him far to Paris and Rome, he knows how to give himself and surprise every guest who sets foot on his territory.  Tallinn is a very interesting city in Estonia.  During its existence, it has changed its appearance more than once, as well as its traditions and cultures.  Today, the guests are reminded of the past by the Old City, a piece of history where life lingered a bit in past centuries.  Walking along its streets, you imagine yourself a resident who lived here two centuries ago.  Modern residential buildings, <span>restaurants, cafes,</span> shops, supermarkets and hotels in Tallinn - this is not all that can be seen in this city.  Local attractions have long attracted tourists who are full of the city all year round.  Their visit is always exciting and interesting.  But if you want to plunge into the world of peace and tranquility, then you should go outside the city, where you can see small farms and several beautiful beaches filled with vacationers in the warm season. </p><p>  As a rule, for their holidays, guests choose Tallinn hotels.  They are distinguished by good service, although in many ways inferior to other European hotels.  And yet, they almost never go empty: some of the guests come for leisure, and some visit Tallinn for business purposes.  If you decide to spend your holidays in this mysterious Estonian city, then it will not hurt you to find out what Tallinn hotels are like.  Talk about the most popular. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Tahetorni</strong> <strong>Hotel 3 *</strong> </p><p>  This hotel is the best place to relax from the bustle of the city, because it is surrounded by picturesque nature and clean air.  It offers comfortable rooms in which each guest can feel at home.  Of the additional services, special rooms for allergy sufferers and disabled people should be noted.  Wonderful local cuisine is offered by the restaurant and several cozy cafes. </p><p>  <strong>Hotel</strong> <strong>Oru Hotel 3 *</strong> </p><p>  The hotel is a great place for families and <span>conferences.</span>  The proximity of many of Tallinn's sights makes this hotel popular with many vacationers.  The rooms offer beautiful views of the old part of the city.  The rooms are clean and bright.  Of the additional services, the hotel will provide you with a spa, delicious cuisine in local restaurants, a hairdresser and other services, from which you will have only the most pleasant memories. </p><p>  <strong>Hotel</strong> <strong>Reval</strong> <strong>Hotel</strong> <strong>Olympia 4 *</strong> </p><p>  You can start your stay in Tallinn with the Reval Hotel Olympia <strong>.</strong>  This is one of the tallest buildings in the city, made of glass and metal. <strong> </strong>  The hotel rooms are designed in a traditional Scandinavian style, with wooden materials and bright colors used for decoration.  The rooms have everything that can only match the level of four stars.  Delicious dishes are prepared in the restaurant, and you can have a quick meal in the cafe.  On one of the floors of the hotel there is a luxurious pool, and Bonnie and Clyde nightclubs are very popular among young people.  Among the additional services offered by the guest are free internet, a business center, a hairdresser, a beauty salon and much more. </p><p>  Reviews of Tallinn hotels can tell a lot about the level of service and the comfort of your stay.  For example, towards the <strong>hotel</strong> <strong>Hotel</strong> <strong>Braavo 3 *</strong> both positive and negative reviews are sent.  The negative of some vacationers is associated with not very comfortable rooms, poor nutrition and the absence of such basic things as a hairdryer.  But, nevertheless, Reval Hotel Olympia is considered one of the best hotels in Tallinn.  It is convenient that it is located in the very center of the city. </p><p>  Tallinn hotels are diverse and unpredictable.  Which one to choose is up to you.  But do not forget one thing that you will spend most of your time on excursions and walks around the city, so even the most inexpensive hotel can be a good option. </p>
