And although earlier models with good functionality were prohibitively expensive, today almost anyone can afford a new-fashioned gadget. </p><p>  The Keneksi Fire 2 smartphone from Chinese manufacturers is another confirmation of this.  The company that introduced this model was founded in Shenzhen in 2011 and entered the Russian market the same year.  Today, 3.5 million people in our country, the CIS and Europe have become owners of the devices of this brand.  The company has established itself mainly thanks to its new products, which have become an alternative to expensive phones.  The Keneksi Fire 2 model, a review of which is the main topic of this article, played a special role in promoting the company. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The story about the smartphone is worth starting with the words that it was released in 2013 and became the second in the ‚Äúfiery‚Äù series of the brand.  The prototype of the Chinese gadget was the top models of Samsung, a leader among Asian electronics manufacturers.  So, in the flowing lines of Keneksi Fire 2 Black it is easy to recognize the features of the Galaxy S4, the competitor's flagship device.  Speaking of color solutions: the model in question is also available in black and white. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The smartphone is made in the classic monoblock format, like all modern gadgets.  The case is plastic, there are no physical control keys, there are only touch buttons at the bottom of the screen, as well as traditional lock and volume buttons on the sides.  The dimensions of the phone are 7 x 13.5 cm, and the thickness is 1 cm, with a weight of 136 grams.  By today's standards, this is a pretty weighty and big model.  Such dimensions are justified, since the Keneksi Fire 2 has a 4.5-inch (approximately 11.5 cm) touchscreen display.  The screen with an IPS-matrix and a resolution of 960 x 540 pixels is multi-touch, recognizes up to 7 clicks at a time.  This display is very convenient for most modern applications and games.  And the brightness and support of 16 million colors make the smartphone an ideal solution for watching movies and surfing the Internet. </p>

    <p>  Among the negative qualities of the device, most often people mention a weak battery, the charge of which with active use is enough for one day.  Also, quite a lot of complaints come about the slow operation of the camera, a primitive flash and autofocus errors.  There are complaints of poor build quality, creaking of the back cover and difficulties with removing it.  There are dissatisfied with the sound of music in the headphones and a weak navigation system, as well as for individual users, the complicated menu of the smartphone caused difficulties. </p><p>  Although there are many negative points, the model has more positive ratings.  Buyers report that the main advantage of Kenexi Fire 2 is its low price.  To be more precise, in the summer of 2015, this device can be found on sale for 4 thousand rubles or less. </p><p>  In the kit there is a plastic protective case, which is also positively noted by those who bought it.  A bright display and the presence of 2 SIM cards, of course, appeal to everyone.  Many are unhappy with the speed of the camera, but most still note that the resulting images are of good quality, they are colorful and clear. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth listening to gamers, because it is by the work of modern mobile games that you can judge the performance of the gadget as a whole.  Their scores are very high, it is noted that running applications do not slow down and play at the most comfortable level. </p>
