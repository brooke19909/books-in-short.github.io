  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Skating rinks in Maryino: a list</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As winter approaches, we begin to think about winter forms of entertainment.  And if you don‚Äôt particularly like skiing in a megalopolis, then skates are just right for the place, because in almost every urban area there is a skating rink, and not one.  Especially a lot of them in large sleeping areas of Moscow. </p><h2>  Public ice rink in Maryino </h2><p>  Choosing a place of rest, we primarily pay attention to public areas.  There are several of them in the area: </p><ul><li>  park them.  Artyom Borovik; </li><li>  Park of the 850th anniversary of Moscow; </li><li>  Ice Palace; </li><li>  outdoor ice rink on the street  S. Kovalevskaya; </li><li>  closed pavilion on Myachkovsky Boulevard. </li></ul><p>  The ice rink in the Maryino park, named after the 850th anniversary of Moscow, was recently opened on the left bank of the Moskva River.  Residents of the region greeted its discovery with undisguised joy, as there weren‚Äôt enough equipped playgrounds where children and adults could walk, and youth do sports. </p><p>  The ice skating season begins in Maryino according to the general city schedule.  At the end of November, a large skating rink is poured there, accommodating about two hundred people in one session.  The rink‚Äôs working hours are standard: from eleven in the morning until eleven in the evening.  The territory of the ice rink in Maryino is equipped with warm dressing rooms.  If you are cold, you can warm yourself in small cozy cafes that offer hot drinks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moskva.bezformata.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="skate rental" class="if uuid-3008022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3008022.jpg"></div><p>  For those who only dream of acquiring their own skates, but do not yet have the opportunity, rental works.  Sizes are everything from the 28th to the 45th.  Children under 12 years old can rent skates for fifty rubles.  For adults, rental will cost one hundred rubles per hour.  The rink system operates on the rink.  When renting skates of the administration, a deposit of 500 rubles and any identity document must be left.  There is a nice bonus: if you take skates at the box office, admission will be free for you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are benches all around the rink.  With the onset of dusk, the entire territory is illuminated.  Music is playing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="all-pages.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ice rink in Maryino" class="if uuid-3008005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3008005.jpg"></div><h2>  Ice Palace in Maryino </h2><p>  One of the most popular places is the Ice Palace, children's and youth sports school number 4. On its territory there is an indoor ice rink all year round, to which everyone is invited on weekends. </p><p>  On weekdays, the ice rink for regular visitors does not work.  Until noon, a children's school of figure skating is practiced there.  In the afternoon, ice hockey teams. </p><p>  Ice dancing at this school teaches young children from the age of three.  The head coach of the school, Anatoly Yeremin, says that the available ice is enough to understand the basics of figure skating.  Then you can go to more professional teams and specialized schools. </p><h2>  Indoor ice rink </h2><p>  For lovers of indoor skiing, an indoor ice rink in Maryino opens its doors.  It can be reached both from the Bratislavskaya metro station and from the Maryino side.  For those who get to the rink for the first time, the shopping center "Boom" is a good guideline.  And from him to the rink is five minutes. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the ice rink is closed, it is quite cold in it.  Therefore, all who are going to ride, the administration advises to dress warmer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is no wardrobe on site.  Therefore, take with you only the necessary minimum of things that can be left on the bench.  A significant refinement will be the information that skate rental is not there.  Therefore, this place will serve as good entertainment only for those who have their own skates. </p><p>  In winter, mass skating takes place only on Sundays, from eight to nine in the evening.  Admission is 100 rubles.  The territory plays music. </p><p>  If you get to the skating rink in Maryino by the navigator, then the exact address is: Myachkovsky Boulevard, Building 10, Building 3. You must walk no more than 15 minutes from the metro.  This is the only indoor ice rink in Maryino. </p><h2>  Free ice skating spots </h2><p>  For those who would like to skate, but do not want to pay for skating, in Maryino there is a park to them.  Artyom Borovik.  Go there without a doubt.  The ski season opens in the park on November 10th.  The uniqueness of this place is that there are two completely free skating rinks.  One with natural ice, the other with artificial ice.  Artificial ice is suitable for young children and those adults who only comprehend the basics of figure skating.  On such ice it is easier to maintain balance due to its high density. </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rink is 2 thousand meters.  There is where to roam.  There is a hockey ground at the rink.  On weekends, there is a figure skating section with no age limit.  Classes are held on weekends from 10 to 12 in the morning.  The cost of a subscription is about two thousand rubles.  A one-time lesson will cost a thousand rubles. </p><p>  There is a skate rental point at the rink.  There are locker rooms and a left-luggage office in which you can leave personal items.  If your skates are dull, the master immediately, in place, will sharpen the blades for 250 rubles.  Very fast and high quality.  Free riding time - on weekdays from ten in the morning to three in the afternoon.  On holidays, an entry ticket can cost up to 250 rubles.  Children under 6 years old admission is free. </p><p>  The address of the free ice rink in Maryino is: Maryino or Bratislavskaya metro station, Artem Borovik park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ccmakarov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ice rink in Maryino" class="if uuid-3008006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3008006.jpg"></div><h2>  Ice safety </h2><p>  Ice skating is the most dangerous and traumatic.  If your child is skating for the first time, be sure to tell him what safety rules to follow. </p><ul><li>  Firstly, there is no need to accelerate much.  Loss of control leads to the fact that the child will lose balance and fall.  And this is dangerous, since no one teaches the correct fall of children.  You can accidentally hit your head or break yourself something. </li><li>  Secondly, you can not cling to a number of standing or traveling people.  They can fall and strike with their skates anywhere in the body, as they do not control themselves during the fall. </li><li>  Thirdly, you need to ride only in the general direction, in no case not crossing the road traveling. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="worldpics.pro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="children ice skating" class="if uuid-3008008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3008008.jpg"></div><h2>  How to choose the right equipment </h2><p>  To avoid unnecessary trouble, you need to pay attention to several details when buying skates.  Buy skates with leather boots only.  In plastic boots, legs swell and freeze faster.  Be sure to check the stiffness of the sole and boot area around the ankle.  In no case should they have defects or bend. </p><div class="photo" data-original="4.bp.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="black skates" class="if uuid-3008007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3008007.jpg"></div><p>  Do not buy larger skates.  In such skates, the leg is in a free position, it can slip at the most uncomfortable moment and cause injury.  Do not forget that skates are recommended to be worn only on woolen socks. </p>
