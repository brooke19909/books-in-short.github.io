    <p>  By nature, each of us at birth is given a certain set of mental and physical qualities, as well as instincts.  They help to survive in this complex world.  Everything else directly depends on the education that we received at an early age.  Children with their own character traits simply cannot constantly agree with their parents.  This is due to the fact that each person is a person and has his own, specific point of view. </p><p>  The problem of fathers and children arises in front of loved ones belonging to different generations.  Each of them has its own historical period.  In this regard, from generation to generation, the views on life and the system of its values ‚Äã‚Äãare changing, which any of us is ready to decisively defend. </p><p>  In earlier times, people considered the principles of elders as the basis of being.  However, quite often, children, absorbing family experience, want to get out of the influence of adults.  However, they deny all the dogmas of the older generation.  It seems to children that they will be able to build their lives much better, brighter and more interesting.  They want to resolve all issues on their own as soon as possible. </p><p>  The problem of fathers and children arises in almost all formations of human society: </p><p>  - in family; </p><p>  - in the labor collective; </p><p>  - in general, in the social formation. </p><p>  From the very birth of a child, parents teach.  When he goes to kindergarten - educators.  A schoolboy is a teacher.  At a certain time in this chain there is a moment when all teachings begin to cause rejection.  Usually this occurs when the child begins to develop personal qualities, awareness of the right of own choice, as well as responsibility for him. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The problem of fathers and children is rather complicated nowadays.  In some cases, the task of establishing equilibrium in the views of generations simply cannot be solved.  Some of us enter into open confrontation with representatives of another generation, others, for the possibility of peaceful coexistence, go aside, allowing ourselves and others to gain freedom in the implementation of ideas and plans. </p><p>  The problem of fathers and children is very relevant today.  She is very keen on people from different generations.  However, it must be remembered that only mutual tolerance and respect for each other will allow us not to go into a serious confrontation.  The most important thing is love and understanding. </p><p>  The advice of parents is, in essence, a compulsion or dictate.  As a <span>person</span> develops, a person more and more rarely has a desire to obey.  Parents need to realize this in time and translate the arrow of relations with children into neutral ways of presenting their information.  Otherwise, conflicts are inevitable. </p><p>  The most difficult thing for parents is that they have to accept their child as he is, put up with all his shortcomings, as well as character traits.  In addition, the older generation must forgive the insults and wrongdoings of their children.  It is also difficult to reconcile with the fact that the child will grow up and go into his adult life, which has its own concerns and affairs. </p><p>  The problem of fathers and children in literature has been raised quite often.  This issue has been touched upon to some extent by many writers.  The most striking echo of the theme of all times is the novel by I. S. Turgenev, ‚ÄúFathers and Sons‚Äù.  In addition to this work, the very name of which indicates its main theme, the interrelations of generations were covered in many masterpieces of literature.  It is difficult to say who first raised this issue.  The problem is so vital at all times that its description has always existed on the pages of works of literature.  I did not ignore the complex problem of A.S.  Griboedov in his comedy "Woe from Wit."  Affected her and L.N.  Tolstoy in the novel War and Peace. </p>
