  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Maps.Me: user reviews, application description, features of use</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the world of navigation, an imperceptible revolution is now taking place.  There are still a huge number of programs that work exclusively with an Internet connection.  This, of course, is not bad, but far from always and not everywhere the Internet is at hand.  And professional satellites-oriented devices do not need an average user.  However, there are applications that are able to work offline.  The best of these is Maps.Me.  We will review the reviews about this wonderful application in the article, but first we will find out what kind of program it is. </p><div class="photo" data-original="github.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="maps me reviews" class="if uuid-3015431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3015431.jpg"></div><h2>  What is Maps.Me? </h2><p>  So, the Maps.Me application is a navigator that can work offline.  True, for such work you will need to pre-download maps.  But then the positioning and laying of the route occurs without the participation of the Internet.  Only GPS is activated.  It is very comfortable.  Here are the features the application has: </p><ul><li>  Accurate location of the user.  The program is able to establish the location of a person (or his phone) with an accuracy of several meters.  GPS positioning is used for positioning. </li><li>  Paving the route.  Maps.Me, reviews of which we will discuss a little later, can plot a route of any complexity from point A to point B. Moreover, the application tries to choose the shortest route. </li><li>  Display infrastructure on the maps.  The application uses maps that are very detailed.  They even have infrastructure: cafes, restaurants, gas stations, attractions and more. </li><li>  Information about traffic jams and accidents.  A very useful option for motorists.  The application shows the situation on the road.  If there are any traffic jams or accidents, the program will notify the user. </li><li>  You can download the guide.  Together with maps, you can download a guide to a particular country.  It will show all the sights, museums and other objects of interest to the tourist. </li></ul><p>  Such rich functionality makes Maps.Me a more interesting application than maps from Google.  Yes there, even the legendary Navitel has never made such unique applications or devices.  Now it's time to see what users say about this application.  Do they share the delights of other users?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="lifehacker.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="navigator maps me reviews" class="if uuid-3015434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3015434.jpg"></div><h2>  App Interface Reviews </h2><p>  First, let's see what users say about the interface of the Maps.Me application on Android.  User reviews are unambiguous: the interface is very convenient and well-made.  All the necessary tools and functions are at hand.  And this is the most important thing.  Another feature is the presence of the Russian language.  Users (especially our compatriots) are very happy about this fact.  This makes the application more convenient.  In general, everything is in order with the application interface.  Even advertising is not as much as in other programs.  However, some users say that the design itself is very boring.  Designers obviously did not apply imagination.  And for some, this is a negative point.  But do not forget that we have a specialized application, and not a game.  His main task is to work well.  And beauty is a secondary matter.  In general, the utility interface is not bad.  There is no discomfort when working with the application.  Now let's move on to the other features. </p><div class="photo" data-original="3dnews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="maps me user reviews" class="if uuid-3015435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3015435.jpg"></div><h2>  Card Quality Reviews </h2><p>  Now let's talk about the quality of the maps that are provided by the Maps.Me application.  User reviews in this regard are unambiguous: the cards are high quality and accurate.  Users note that they surpass the famous Google maps in accuracy.  Indeed, with the accuracy of the latter, not everything is as good as we would like.  As for maps, Maps.Me has one more advantage: they are sketchy.  No satellite imagery.  This allowed to significantly reduce the size of the cards.  Also, users liked the fact that infrastructure objects are displayed on maps.  This is a very useful feature for tourists and travelers.  It is worth noting that the most important objects are displayed.  There are no small shops there.  But this is good, since it also reduces the size of the card.  At the first start, the application automatically downloads a general world map and a map of the country in which the user is now located.  If you need to go to another country, it will be enough to download the appropriate map in advance.  Then the Internet will no longer be needed.  It is for this approach that users love Maps.Me.  However, consider other features of the application. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="androidt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="maps me for android reviews" class="if uuid-3015436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3015436.jpg"></div><h2>  Application Reviews </h2><p>  And what about offline work?  What say those who often use Maps.Me for iPhone?  Reviews in this regard are pretty good.  Many users indicate that the application quickly finds the right satellites and pretty accurately determines the current location of a person.  In the same way, the program behaves when plotting a route.  It takes her only a few seconds to find the shortest way to her destination.  Moreover, the route is laid taking into account all traffic jams and obstacles along the route.  The application definitely has no problems with this.  Also, users note the excellent responsiveness of the interface.  You never have to wait long for the opening of a tool.  The application slows down a bit only when downloading new maps from the Internet.  Then small bugs become noticeable.  And in the offline mode with the speed of the program, everything is in order.  But now it's time to move on to the other features of the application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mforum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="maps me for iphone reviews" class="if uuid-3015437" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3015437.jpg"></div><h2>  Feedback on the option of showing traffic jams and accidents </h2><p>  Maps Maps.Me, reviews of which we are considering, have one very useful option for motorists: they show all kinds of traffic jams on the route and accidents that occurred on the road.  This helps to correctly assess the situation on the road and on the fly to change the route if movement along the selected path is difficult or even absent.  Users note that the traffic jam service works well and adequately shows all possible problems.  However, at the same time, they note one very large drawback: the traffic service works exclusively when connected to the Internet.  In offline mode, the application simply has nowhere to get relevant information from.  But then you can be sure that traffic jams and accidents will not threaten. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mforum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cards maps me reviews" class="if uuid-3015438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3015438.jpg"></div><h2>  Travel Guide Reviews </h2><p>  Navigation in Maps.Me, reviews of which we are considering, is far from the only application option.  There is also a very useful thing for tourists - travel guides.  Users note that these same guides are incredibly accurate.  They have not only mapped locations for the sights and museums of a city, but they also have detailed historical information about the most famous artifacts.  Of course, the historical description is not everywhere.  For example, comprehensive information is provided about the Winter Palace or the Coliseum.  But about some hut in the spill - there is nothing.  But this is understandable, because all the information cannot be placed in a regular mobile application.  Users note only one drawback of guidebooks - their volume is quite large, so they have to be downloaded for a long time.  Yes, and not the fact that they fit on a smartphone.  There may simply not be enough memory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mforum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="navigation maps me reviews" class="if uuid-3015439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3015439.jpg"></div><h2>  Autonomy Reviews </h2><p>  This is probably the most important parameter.  As a navigator, Maps.Me, reviews of which are considered in the framework of this article, affects the autonomy of the device.  In this matter, almost all users indicate that the application "eats" the battery very briskly.  During an hour of active use, most of the charge can fly away.  And this is when the Internet is off.  Apparently, the developers have not fully optimized their brainchild.  So when working with Maps.Me it is worth stocking up with an external battery. </p><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  The Maps.Me app, which we just reviewed, is a great option for tourists and those who like to travel very much.  It has a huge set of the most popular features and is completely free.  It can plot routes, display the user's location, show infrastructure, provide information about traffic jams and accidents, show nearby attractions and provide historical information about them using a guide.  There is only one drawback of the program so far: it has a very strong (and negative) effect on the autonomy of the gadget.  The rest is a very successful program from reputable developers. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So to summarize.  The Maps.Me application, reviews of which we have reviewed, is very popular among users.  It also has an impressive range of options and is completely free.  Those who like to travel definitely need to install it on their smartphone. </p>
