    <h2>  Distinctive features </h2><p>  The Liebher refrigerator (production: Germany and Austria) is a symbol of the European standard of household appliances.  The latest technologies allow the company to create super-class A devices that save 30% more energy than the most popular class A models of other brands. </p><p>  The Liebher refrigerator is produced daily by the company in the amount of over seven thousand units.  Consumers are offered small-sized, built-in, combined, one- and two-chamber models.  In addition, the brand also manufactures freezers, wine racks, and professional refrigeration equipment. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The company was founded by Hans Liebher in 1949.  Then it was a family business.  The first success was brought by the small mobile models of Liebher refrigerators, reviews of which the first buyers aroused interest, thereby laying the first bricks in the building of a prosperous brand. </p><p>  Since the 60s of the last century, the company launches the production of devices using the innovative FrostSafe technology.  It is a chamber divided into four sections, each of which is cooled independently of each other.  <span>Liebher refrigerators,</span> customer <span>reviews</span> regarding which made a splash, are still known for the most innovative approaches and innovative solutions of their manufacturer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Starting from the 70s, the Liebher refrigerator became ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù: it regulates the temperature by electronic control and emits sound signals at critical moments. </p><p>  The 80s brought new trends to the production of the famous brand - portable models.  You can take them with you on a picnic, on vacation, on long trips.  Liebher was the first to provide this unique opportunity.  Refrigerators, customer reviews about the convenience and ease of use which began to sound more often, brought the brand to a new, higher level. </p><p>  Since the 90s, the company has been focusing on the environmental friendliness of its models.  In 1993, it was officially announced that the <span>refrigeration equipment of the</span> corporation completely switches to new technologies that do not lead to the destruction of the ozone layer of the atmosphere.  And today the company pays special attention to environmental problems, even if it is not always profitable from a commercial point of view. </p>

    <h2>  Core technology </h2><p>  German Liebher refrigerators are a treasury of various innovations that help to improve the quality of food storage.  The corporation offers the following technologies in its numerous models: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <em>BioFresh</em> <strong><em>is</em></strong> a refrigerator system in which you can adjust the temperature and humidity level inside the equipment.  This function allows you to choose the optimal conditions for storing different types of food.  For meat, fish and milk, a low level of moisture is more suitable, while for fruits and vegetables it is high.  Thanks to this technology, you can increase the shelf life of products at least three times.  In addition, this system does not allow food to freeze completely, which allows you to save all the necessary vitamins, minerals and taste. </p><p>  Other companies offer a similar technology, calling it a "freshness zone" and others, but the author of this innovation is undoubtedly Liebher.  Refrigerators, reviews of which are only enthusiastic, are presented in a wide range and have additional functions. </p><p>  <em>CoolPlus</em> is a system that protects the refrigerator from decreasing ambient temperature.  This technology is used in single compressor models.  The system operates in such a way that when the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor of the device starts to work intermittently.  This is reflected in the climate of the camera.  This technology allows you to extend the compressor.  This is achieved due to the presence of a sensor in the freezer, which responds to changes in ambient temperature and thereby regulates the level of activity of the compressor. </p><p>  <em>Door sliding</em> is a door installation technology in which it connects directly to a furniture niche.  This function uses the <span>built-</span> in Liebher <span>refrigerator</span> . </p><p>  <em>Door on door</em> <strong><em>is a</em></strong> technology in which the furniture door is directly connected to the refrigerator. </p><p>  <em>FrostControl</em> is a system that protects products in the event of power outages.  The technology captures the initial temperature values ‚Äã‚Äãuntil the power is turned off and holds them for as long as possible. </p><p>  <em>NoFrost</em> is a popular cooling system that avoids the formation of frost and ice on the walls of the chamber.  This is achieved by special air circulation, in which moisture leaves the refrigerator.  At the same time, all products are blown with cool air, which allows to qualitatively increase the shelf life without freezing to the camera machines. </p>
