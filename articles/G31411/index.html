  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Revolutionary Invention - Dice Cutting Machine</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many modern housewives simply can not imagine their life without an indispensable assistant performing all the mechanical work - a food processor.  These devices provide an opportunity to save time and make life easier for women. </p><p>  They perform a huge number of functions and help to quickly prepare your favorite family dishes.  With their help, you can grind cereals and nuts, knead the dough, make cocktails, sauces, mashed potatoes, salads and even ice cream.  A mandatory attribute of a healthy lifestyle - natural fresh juices - will help to get a food processor with a juicer and a citrus press.  The baby food will be prepared by a blender attachment, the most delicious juicy minced meat - a meat grinder.  But still, some salads, soups and other dishes are still prepared manually.  The fact is that until recently, food processors were not equipped with a nozzle for dicing.  It turned out that, having a good multifunctional unit in the kitchen, the woman was forced to manually chop potatoes for soup or vegetables for vinaigrette. </p><p>  A kind of revolutionary invention was the ProfiKubixx combine created by Bosh.  This is the first dice-cutting <span>food processor</span> .  It is equipped with a special nozzle that can cut almost any product: meat, cheese, vegetables, fruits and much more.  With it, dishes such as olivier, vinaigrette, okroshka will turn out many times faster.  In this case, you can adjust the size of the cubes depending on the dish that needs to be prepared. </p><p>  But this is not the only advantage of this model.  Numerous attachments for a food processor are attached to it, allowing you to perform a number of other operations.  The kit includes a chopper knife, several shredder disks, a grater disc, a dough mixer, a blender, a disc beater, a citrus press and a berry press.  A capacious bowl (3.9 l) makes it possible to work with large volumes of products.  So a food processor cutting cubes is a multifunctional device that can take on a significant part of the work. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, if you need to cook a small portion of salad, it is easier to do everything by hand, especially since in working with vegetables it takes more time to wash and peel them than to cut them.  For the sake of this, assembling the device, which then will have to be disassembled and washed, is inappropriate.  But when it comes to the upcoming celebration, when it is necessary to quickly prepare a wide variety of dishes, a food processor cutting into cubes is a real find. </p><p>  In addition to this device, by the beginning of 2012, there were two models on the Russian market that performed a similar operation.  This is a multifunctional meat grinder HV8 ME645 from Moulinex and a Philips blender HR1659.  All three units give a good result and cope with meat, cheeses, raw and boiled vegetables and many other products.  Unprocessed pieces remain in each of them, but the percentage of waste is small, especially when chopping boiled vegetables.  Onions give in poorly to such cutting, for which it is better to use other nozzles. </p><p>  The weak point of many <span>kitchen appliances</span> is their assembly, disassembly and cleaning.  A food processor cutting cubes is no exception.  But against the background of the invaluable help that he renders in preparing a large number of dishes, these are trifles.  The scope of this model is quite wide.  It can be used not only for salads.  The dice function is also useful when preparing soups, side dishes, vegetable stews, fruits for filling pie and many other dishes.  In addition, this is a universal assistant, which will chop the minced meat, and squeeze the juice, and chop, and knead the dough.  So the housewives who dreamed of a device that can cut into cubes will be satisfied with this wonderful model.  This is not just a marketing move, it is a really useful appliance in the kitchen that will do the routine and save a ton of time for more enjoyable activities. </p>
