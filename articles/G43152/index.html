    <h2>  History </h2><p>  This village was first mentioned in the fourteenth century in the will of the Prince of Russia Dmitry Donskoy, who left this village before the start of the Battle of Kulikovo to his sons Ivan and Vasily.  At the beginning of the seventeenth century it was already referred to as the imperial palace village by the lake. </p><p>  In ancient times, here, in huge meadows located between the rivers, there was a cattle feeding point before it was sent to Moscow.  It is possible that the village got its name due to this.  The inn that existed in these places before the revolution bore a similar name - ‚ÄúBullish‚Äù. </p><h2>  Rod Vorontsovs </h2><p>  In 1704, for great services to Russia, by decree of Peter the Great, the village was transferred to the royal governor, Illarion Vorontsov.  Historians rarely remember him, but his descendants are better known, since they played a big role in the history of the Russian state. </p><p>  His eldest son, Mikhail Illarionovich, served as vice chancellor during the reign of Tsarina Anna Ioannovna.  Elizaveta Petrovna appointed him Chancellor.  He played an important role in the fate of M.V.  Lomonosov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vorontsov estate in Bykovo" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464040.jpg" width="600"></div>

The youngest son - Ivan Illarionovich - married Maria Volynskaya. </p><p>  The great-grandson of the voivode - Mikhail Semenovich - bravely commanded a division during World War II and proved himself to be the governor of the tsar in the Novorossiysk Territory. </p><p>  The childhood and youth of all descendants of the Vorontsovs are closely related to the estate in Bykovo.  The last owners of the estate were the Vorontsov-Dashkovs. </p><h2>  M.M.  Izmaylov </h2><p>  In 1762, the Vorontsov estate in Bykovo became the property of M.M.  Izmailov.  A Turk of origin, in one of the battles he went over to the side of the Russian army and converted to Orthodoxy.  For some time he served as the marshal of the royal court.  Under Catherine the Second, he was appointed chairman of the Expeditions of the Kremlin buildings. </p><p>  Izmailov drew the most famous Russian <span>architect Bazhenov</span> to the design and construction of the structure <span>.</span>  However, soon the construction of the palace was suspended due to the huge costs of maintaining the Russian army, who fought with the Turks.  Thus, the famous architect was left out of work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="estate of Vorontsov dashkovs in bull" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464041.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At this difficult time for the great architect, M. M. Izmailov made him an order for work in Bykovo.  The estate was noticeably dilapidated and required serious reconstruction.  Thanks to this combination of circumstances, the finest hour of the talented architect came. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The construction of a new palace </h2><p>  V.I. Bazhenov with desire set to work.  We must give him his due, he made a bold decision - to completely change the appearance of the structure.  According to the architect‚Äôs plan, the new Vorontsov-Dashkovs estate in Bykovo was to be built in the western part of the estate, on an artificial hill.  For this, the peasants carried ground in wicker baskets.  In the places where the land was chosen, three artificial reservoirs were created.  Bazhenov's plans included the creation of a real architectural and park ensemble, consisting of a church, ponds, a winter garden, a park, the Hermitage and the grotto.  Unfortunately, the palace built by Bazhenov has not been preserved to this day. </p><h2>  The estate Vorontsov-Dashkov in Bykovo </h2><p>  The palace, which is located in the estate today, was built by the already famous architect at that time, Bernard de Simon, a native of Switzerland, for Count I.I.  Vorontsova-Dashkova - his last owner.  In those days, it was a rare surname.  It belonged to E.R.  Dashkova, who simultaneously lost her son and husband.  To preserve the name of the Dashkovs, <span>Ekaterina Romanovna</span> turned to Alexander the First with a request to assign the name to her grand-daughter's nephew by her husband, Ivan Illarionovich.  Her request was granted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor bykovo map" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/465619.jpg" width="600"></div>

He built a farmyard, a greenhouse and a front door to the estate.  These days they are all lost.  Entrance ramps and a white stone balustrade have been preserved from the Bazhenov construction. </p><h2>  Palace in Bykovo </h2><p>  Even today, when this building is in a very poor state, it still makes a very strong impression.  The palace was built in the traditional style of strict <span>English castles.</span>  Four of its facades are completely different.  South is designed in a classic style.  It is decorated with columns in the form of beautiful figures of women. </p><p>  The cemetery, which is located in front of the portico, has a balustrade with a railing in the form of columns of exquisite shape.  A tower with a sundial was erected on the left side of the palace. </p><p>  The northern facade is considered central.  It is decorated with a magnificent arch, above which is the coat of arms of the Vorontsov-Dashkov clan.  The interior of the house was also in the English style.  Under the ceiling was a frieze of portraits of descendants of the Vorontsov-Dashkov clan.  The hall was decorated with a Baroque-style spiral staircase.  In the main hall of the palace, where ceremonies were held, there was an organ made of silver pipes. </p><p>  In the nineties of the nineteenth century, the Bykovo estate was sold, and according to another version, it was lost to the cards to the engineer of the Kazan Railway N.I.  Ilyin.  The estate belonged to him before the revolution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bykovo estate how to get" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464043.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bykovo: manor, church </h2><p>  Church of the Mother of God of Vladimir was erected in Bykovo in 1789.  Until now, researchers have not come to a consensus on what project it was built.  Some are sure that this creation belongs to V.I.  Bazhenov, others prove that it belongs to A.N.  Bokarev or M.F.  Kazakov.  The magnificent white-stone church is executed in the style of Russian Gothic.  It has no analogues in the architecture of not only the Moscow Region, but also the whole country.  The building has two churches - the Nativity of Christ and the Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God. </p><p>  The main temple is an oval, standing on a high peg.  From the west, a refectory and two bell towers are attached to it.  Crowns the design of a rotunda with a high spire.  It should be noted the luxurious decor of the temple. </p><p>  The temple looks especially impressive from the western facade, from the location of the bell towers.  A snow-white marble front staircase leads to the main platform, located in front of the main entrance to the upper temple, and below it is the lower temple. </p><p>  Inside, it is decorated with artificial marble and wooden carvings. </p><p>  One of the towers was built as a bell tower with a platform for the ringer, and the other for the clock.  In 1884, another bell tower was built, made in the same style, according to the project of I.T.  Tamansky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor bykovo address" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464044.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Church after the revolution </h2><p>  In Soviet times, the interiors of the church were badly damaged.  In 1937, it was closed and ravaged.  Crosses were removed from the spiers, the bells were removed.  The most valuable church utensils and ancient books were ruthlessly destroyed. </p><p>  A sewing workshop was organized in the temple building.  A little later, it was converted into a cinema warehouse.  Only in 1989 the temple was returned to the Russian Church.  <span>Restoration work</span> and services began. </p><h2>  Temple of Ceres </h2><p>  Much is connected with the name of V.I.  Bazhenov in Bykovo.  The manor has a well-preserved snow-white arbor on one of the islands of the pond - the temple of Ceres.  She is very harmonious and proportional.  Three pylons are arranged in a circle, the columns support a cornice and a rounded dome.  Unfortunately, an elegant bridge to the island has been lost, so you can only get to the gazebo by boat. </p><h2>  The sad fate of the estate </h2><p>  The unique complex, the Bykovo estate, the photo of which you see in this article, after nationalization was transferred to the orphanage, which contained orphans of the Red Army.  Gradually valuable things began to disappear from here - unique paintings, carpets, crystal chandeliers, handmade furniture.  Then the organ was broken. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Bykovo photo" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464045.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The magnificent pink alley disappeared, the greenhouse was destroyed, the holy spring was cluttered, where in the old days believers from the whole district went for healing water. </p><p>  Gradually, the tenants of the palace began to change more and more, and the losses from this became more tangible.  In the end, the stable disappeared, the Hermitage was dismantled. </p><p>  After the war, new changes affected Bykovo.  The estate was transferred to the fourth department of the Ministry of Health, and a TB dispensary began to work here.  Dormitory buildings, or rather huts, were built near the palace. </p><p>  Currently, the estate is in complete disrepair, although some officials speak of a sluggish restoration.  If the attitude of the authorities towards this unique complex does not change, then very soon there will be no trace of the former splendor and luxury. </p><h2>  How to get to Bykovo </h2><p>  Manor Bykovo, whose address is the Moscow region, Ramensky district, the village of Bykovo, despite the current neglect, annually meets thousands of tourists visiting these historical places.  Newlyweds even come here for original photo shoots. </p><p>  If you are interested in the Bykovo estate, a map of the Moscow Region will show you the exact route.  You can use public transport or private car. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, this is an outstanding monument of Russian history and architecture - the Bykovo estate.  How to get to her by train?  At the Kazan station, you need to catch an electric train to Bykovo station, and then you will have to walk two kilometers on foot. </p><p>  This path can be overcome by bus - from the station.  Vykhino by bus 424 should go to the station "Club". </p><p>  For many, it will be convenient to get to Bykovo by minibus.  The estate is located near the stop "Club".  You will need a 525 minibus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bykovo estate how to get there" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464046.jpg" width="600"></div>
