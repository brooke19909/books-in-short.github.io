    <h2>  A small overview of the city </h2><p>  First, consider the city of Kemerovo, its features and location.  This city is the administrative center of the Kemerovo region of the same name.  You might think that this is a small town, but this is not the case.  If we look at the statistics, we can see the data that says that the city is on the 30th place in terms of the number of people living in the city and on the 50th place in terms of area (among all cities of Russia). </p>

    <p>  In addition, Kemerovo is the central city in the sphere of economics, industry and transport of Siberia.  It plays an important role in the cultural life of Siberia, and is a leading city in the field of science.  Like some other <span>Siberian cities,</span> Kemerovo is the center of formation of the Kemerovo agglomeration. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many who are going to travel from Moscow to this city are interested in the distance.  Moscow - Kemerovo is not such a close route.  The distance between cities is about 3598 kilometers.  Such a road, of course, may seem long, but this city is certainly worth a visit. </p><h2>  City nowadays </h2><p>  As mentioned above, Kemerovo is not just a town in Siberia.  It is central in many areas of social and economic life.  Over the years, many different industries have been operating here.  There are several large enterprises that are involved in the chemical, food and light industries. </p><p>  This city is the first in the region in terms of population density.  Statistics for 2016 show a population of about 553 thousand people. </p>

    <p>  The economy of the city is also well developed, mainly the services sector dominates here, which is represented mainly by the public sector.  In Kemerovo, the transport system is well developed, in the city there are many routes that trams, buses, trolleybuses and other vehicles run on.  Also, the city plans to build a subway. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thus, you can see that the route Kemerovo - Moscow is really interesting, since Kemerovo is a large city where there are many interesting things. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  It is worth talking separately about the history of the city and the origin of its name.  Many historians agree that the name ‚ÄúKemerovo‚Äù most likely refers to the Turkic word ‚ÄúKemer‚Äù.  This word means several things at the same time: a belt, a mountainside, a belt, etc. </p><p>  The city of Kemerovo is relatively young, when compared with many other cities.  The first mention of this settlement occurs at the beginning of the XVIII century, in 1721. </p><p>  Until the city was formed on this site, there were several settlements.  Initially, the village of Ust-Iskitimskoye was located here, then a village called Shcheglovo.  The city has existed and developed for a long time, having such a name.  However, in 1932 he was given the name that he bears now.  And already in 1943, the city became the administrative center of the entire region. </p><p>  Going along the route Kemerovo - Moscow, you can learn in more detail the history of the wonderful Siberian city of Kemerovo.  However, not only its history is interesting, but also nature. </p><h2>  City climate </h2><p>  Now it is worth getting acquainted with the nature and climate of this wonderful city and its environs.  First you need to say that the city lies in the continental climate zone.  Of course, the climate here is not at all mild.  Some people, especially those who are not used to such weather conditions, sometimes find it difficult to be in such weather conditions.  However, seeing them may also be interesting. </p>

    <p>  Winter lasts really long here.  The winter period usually lasts 2.5 months longer than the calendar winter.  However, the summer time is often pleasing with warm weather.  But, unfortunately, the summer is very short.  On average, it is 11 days less than the calendar.  The average temperature in January is -17 <sup>o</sup> C., July - +19 <sup>o</sup> C. </p><h2>  Time zones and time in Kemerovo </h2><p>  Separately, it is necessary to note the time and time zone in which this city is located.  If you pass the route Kemerovo - Moscow, the time difference may seem quite significant to you.  For example, when in Moscow it is 12 noon, then in Kemerovo it is already 16 o‚Äôclock.  So the difference is 4 hours.  <span>The time zone of Moscow is</span> designated as UTC + 3, and the time zone of Kemerovo, in turn, is UTC + 7.  Thus, while traveling along the route Kemerovo - Moscow, you can pay attention not only to climate change, but also to a significant change in time. </p>

    <h2>  Sights and culture of the city </h2><p>  I must say a few words about the culture of Kemerovo.  The cultural life here is well developed, many theaters are open in the city, for example, drama, puppet, musical and many others.  There is also a philharmonic society in the city.  There are a large number of libraries, both for children and adults.  You should definitely visit the Kemerovo museums, among which the Kemerovo Regional <span>Museum of</span> Local <span>Lore, the Kemerovo Museum of Fine Arts</span> and many others stand out. </p><p>  Among the sights of the city, various parks and squares are especially popular.  You can go to such wonderful places as Victory Park named after  Zhukova, Birch Grove, etc. </p><h2>  Moscow - Kemerovo: how to get there? </h2><p>  There are several ways to get to Kemerovo.  The first option is to travel by car on the route Moscow - Kemerovo.  The distance by car is quite large, it is 3598 kilometers.  Such a trip will take several days, but it will be very interesting, since the path runs through many other cities. </p><p>  The second option - to overcome the <span>plane route</span> Kemerovo - Moscow.  Airplane is a much faster option, but sometimes it is not suitable for everyone.  The flight time is from 4.5 to 5 hours. </p><p>  Another option is to travel by <span>train.</span>  <span>Trains</span> depart from the Yaroslavl station.  Travel time is about 2 days. </p>
