Drawing a parallel with anatomy, you can compare the compressor with the heart, without which the life of the body is impossible.  A person has only one heart, but their refrigerators can have two, and sometimes even three.  Therefore, before buying, you need to figure out what is the difference between the different types of this device, and how many compressors are the best option for them. </p>

    <p>  Modern refrigerators do not have much difference from each other.  Most of the functions and modes with which they are endowed have different names (depending on the manufacturer), but they are all identical.  The main difference between one refrigerator and another is the design (external and internal), as well as the number of compressors. </p><h2>  What is a compressor? </h2><p>  In simple terms, the compressor is designed to cool the working chambers.  The principle of its operation is quite simple: it compresses the refrigerant and delivers it inside the refrigerator, due to which the refrigeration and freezer are cooled.  When refrigerant is compressed, vapors are formed that enter the evaporator and turn into liquid. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  That is, the compressor turns warm air into cold air and with the help of small pipes distills the cold into working areas. </p><h2>  How many compressors are there </h2><p>  The very first refrigerators were made with only one compressor, single-chamber.  Now among them there are both single-chamber and two-chamber models.  And if only one motor is installed on such a device, it will be energy-intensive and powerful, because it needs to provide two compartments with cold at once: a refrigerator and a freezer. </p><p>  Refrigerators with two compressors are mainly available in two-chamber or in the side-by-side form factor.  In this case, each compartment has its own motor, so that the consumer has the ability to separately control the temperature.  In fact, it turns out two independent devices in one.  That is, you can turn off the refrigerator compartment, and use only a freezer or vice versa.  Since in this case one compressor only works for a specific camera, the energy consumption of the motor will be much less than in the first embodiment. </p><h2>  Refrigeration equipment with three compressors </h2><p>  Three-compressor refrigeration devices are quite rare, but they also exist.  Another motor is installed only for those models where there is a wine cabinet or a special chamber, the so-called "freshness zone".  But, by and large, refrigerators with three compressors are not very popular with consumers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Which refrigerator is better? </h2><p>  Do not forget what time we live.  In a modern house there is a fairly large number of a wide variety of electrical appliances: an electric kettle, a washing machine, a TV, a dishwasher, a computer and much more. </p>

    <p>  Each device in itself does not consume a large amount of energy, but if taken together, the electricity consumption is quite large.  That is why almost every family is thinking about how to save and reduce energy consumption. </p><p>  The principle of operation of the refrigerator with two compressors is arranged in a special way so that it is quite economical.  Many will ask: how can this be, because two motors must consume more than one.  It turns out that the whole point is that each of the two compressors is less energy-intensive compared to models where it is one.  Moreover, if, for example, the temperature in the refrigerator compartment rises, then only one compressor with a small energy consumption is turned on, it only works on a certain section of the refrigerator.  The motor does not spend its energy on cooling the <span>freezer,</span> which is already cold and corresponds to the set temperature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Refrigerators with two compressors also have another advantage - the ability to turn off an unnecessary camera.  Imagine a situation where the whole family goes on vacation for two weeks.  Of course, no products will be stored in the refrigerator, because during this period of time they will surely deteriorate.  Therefore, owners of a refrigerator with two compressors can turn off the cooling of the refrigerator.  The whole period of time, while the family is on vacation, one motor will not work, which, of course, will save electricity.  At the same time, the freezer will continue to function and successfully retain the remaining products until the owners arrive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="refrigerator with two compressors Price" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/1849143.jpg" width="357"></div>

    <h2>  Manufacturers and models of refrigerators with two compressors </h2><p>  Almost every brand that produces and sells cooling household appliances has in its lineup models equipped with two motors.  One of the most popular manufacturers of cooling equipment with two motors are: </p><ul><li>  Atlant; </li><li>  Bosch; </li><li>  Stinol. </li></ul><p>  They have a fairly large line of two-compressor refrigerators, which differ in size, color scheme, camera arrangement, minimum temperature, various modes and functions. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that there are also <span>built-in refrigerators</span> with two compressors.  Their peculiarity is that they can be mounted directly in furniture, thus, the kitchen will be designed in the same style and will be stylish and modern. </p><h2>  Atlant Company </h2><p>  Atlant refrigerators are manufactured in Belarus and are very inexpensive, but at the same time, high-quality devices.  When choosing refrigeration equipment from this manufacturer, you should pay attention to the letters that appear before the digital model number.  If the letters XM are at the beginning of the model, it says that this Atlant refrigerator is two-compressor. </p>

    <p>  Consider the most popular sixtieth line of refrigerators of this company.  The marking of this series looks like this: XM 60xx-xxx, where xx is the indication of a specific model, and xxx is the color. </p><h2>  Description of models </h2><p>  We start the review from the refrigerator compartment.  The shelves of the refrigerator are made of special strong glass, they can be rearranged.  At the bottom there are two drawers that are intended for vegetables or other products. </p><p>  The doors are equipped with standard small shelves on which to store various products.  There are also two special lockable trays, they can be used for products that emit strong odors. </p><p>  <span>The freezer</span> can work in normal mode or in quick freeze mode.  Thanks to this function, the consumer has the opportunity to keep their fruits and vegetables in good condition without losing their beneficial properties.  The faster the freezing process occurs, the more nutrients remain in the products. </p><p>  It is very convenient to look at the operation of the refrigerator on the indicators located at the top.  There you can also look at the status of the cameras and what mode is currently enabled.  The control panel is quite simple, without extra pointers and buttons. </p><h2>  Defrost </h2><p>  The defrosting system of these refrigerators is drip.  The frost on the back wall turns into drops of water and partially evaporates, maintaining optimal humidity inside the refrigerator. </p><p>  According to the instructions for the Atlant refrigerator with two compressors, the freezer compartment is manually defrosted.  To do this, turn off the freezer and install a shovel from the bottom to drain melt water, and next to it we install some container with a volume of at least two liters. </p><p>  The price of the sixtieth series of a refrigerator of this brand starts at 17 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Bosch </h2><p>  The German brand has been pleasing its customers with good European quality for a long time.  The range of electrical products that the company produces is quite large.  Among them are refrigerators with two compressors.  Of the huge number of models, one should highlight one of the most popular - KGS 35XL20. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bosch refrigerator with two compressors" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/1849153.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  This model of the Bosch refrigerator with two compressors is made in a laconic design, with the ability to outweigh the doors so that they open in the right direction.  The shelves are also made of tempered glass, have high strength, are not scratched, and can be placed in the refrigerator in a way that will be convenient for the consumer. </p><p>  As mentioned above, one of the main advantages of refrigeration equipment is its efficiency.  This model of the refrigerator has an energy class A +, which means that it fully meets all European standards of energy efficiency. </p><p>  KGS 35XL20 has a unique system, called LowFrost, which allows you to avoid temperature changes when the device is running.  Due to this, the formation of ice in the freezer occurs very slowly and the ice grows in a thin layer.  Therefore, the process of defrosting the refrigerator should be done no more than once a year. </p><p>  In addition to standard functions, this equipment has an autonomous cold preservation system.  In the absence of electricity, the required temperature is maintained inside the refrigerator and freezer for 22 hours.  Therefore, the products will not deteriorate even if there is no electricity in the house for almost the entire day. </p><p>  The price of a refrigerator with two compressors varies, depending on the outlet, but it is in the range of 36-38 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Company stinol </h2><p>  To date, the named brand does not exist.  The plant for the production of refrigeration equipment was located in Lipetsk and successfully worked for several years.  But now it is not possible to purchase a Stinol refrigerator with two compressors. </p><p>  In 2005, this company was bought by the famous Italian brand Indesit.  And if you want to buy a two-compressor refrigerator, which is produced in Russia, then you should pay attention to the Indesit company. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Atlant refrigerator with two compressors" class="if" height="271" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1853260.jpg" width="395"></div></h2><p>  Refrigerators with two compressors are quite popular and very convenient to use devices.  Therefore, if there is a choice between refrigeration equipment with one engine and with two, then we can safely say that two-compressor refrigerators are the preferred option. </p><p>  They are very convenient to use, because the consumer has the ability to adjust the temperature separately in each chamber.  If any work area will not be used for a certain period of time, then you can simply turn it off.  Due to this, significant energy savings will be detected, which is very important today. </p>
