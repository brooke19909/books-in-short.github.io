    <h2>  Tree </h2><p>  Building from a bar is simple, quick, a guarantee of smooth walls and a very high attractiveness of the structure from the outside.  These buildings are becoming more and more technological.  Of course, this is not the cheapest house, from glued beams, perhaps the most expensive.  However, its attractiveness does not fall.  Since in this case there is a paradox. </p><p>  The most economical cottage or house is also from timber.  How so?  Everything is simple.  It is environmentally friendly and durable, will stand for seventy years or more without any repairs and rebuilds, which is not characteristic of buildings made of another material.  Wood will always be in preference, despite the fact that there is a huge amount of more modern materials for construction on the market today.  Wood is heat, it is comfort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Materials and cost </h2><p>  During the construction of cottages and private houses, the latest technologies are applied, the LesDomstroy company also builds high-quality and modern baths.  For wooden buildings, a profiled beam is used - planed or sawn - coniferous.  For stone houses - Ytong gas silicate blocks, porous ceramic porous <span>blocks</span> or modular ceramic slit brick.  LesDomstroy (Moscow) and erects frame buildings using Canadian technology.  Moreover, the houses built by this company, regardless of the material, last equally long. </p><p>  Prices compared with other construction companies are quite reasonable.  In the catalogs they are indicated for the standard design and standard equipment - always "turnkey".  If you want to reduce the price by changing the set of options, clients turn to consultants-architects, and there was no case that they did not meet, this is the principle of the LesDomstroy company.  The head office address is remembered by all customers.  In addition to the reviews left, they recommend this company to their friends and relatives who want to buy housing or a cottage near Moscow.  At Prospect Mira, at 184, building 1, future clients come from all over the city, and often from regions.  But first, it is recommended to send a request by e-mail for preliminary calculations of work and prices. </p>

    <h2>  Structure </h2><p>  LesDomstroy is a group of companies which, in addition to the main office, has a number of support companies: a warehouse base, a production unit, and a transport company.  Addresses of offices can be found by contacting the head office, since it is one.  Others will have to search far from Moscow - in Cheboksary or Krasnodar.  And in Moscow - this is Prospect Mira, 184, building 1. It is there that the entire directorate, customer service departments, financial service, technical supervision, and the service of Ch.  engineer, design and estimate department, architectural bureau. </p><p>  First you need to contact the department that works with customers, it is there that all the first questions will be resolved: design, layout changes, cost estimates, selection of construction and materials.  Each customer has a personal manager-architect, who accompanies him from the first visit to the commissioning of the building, and he does not change during the warranty and post-warranty service times. </p><h2>  Architects </h2><p>  The bureau of architects of the company is constantly engaged in the search and development of ever new projects of the most varied complexity.  During each year, up to seventy unique and original designs of cottages and private houses appear.  The image of the future home for each person should be unique.  Therefore, all the architects of LesDomstroy absolutely always and exclusively strictly follow the wishes of the customer with regard to the appearance, layout or use of materials. </p><p>  Literally everything needs to be taken into account: from environmental features to color preferences.  Moreover, any smallness can ruin the atmosphere of suburban happiness: a road that is too close, the movement of the sun, which does not illuminate the rooms, neighbors, good or bad, insufficient insulation, and so on.  And all this needs to be made in the form of amendments to the project regulated by technical standards.  The company's architects firmly observe the design principles that ensure the reliability of the building, the comfort of living in it and the visual appeal. </p>
