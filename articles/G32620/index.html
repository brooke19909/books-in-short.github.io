    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  According to the reviews of the guests, the following negative points can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  prices for accommodation and meals are somewhat overstated; </li><li>  not far from the hotel there are urban sewage, which, with a certain direction of the wind, brings an extremely unpleasant smell to the territory; </li><li>  many dishes that are declared in the restaurant menu are not available; </li><li>  since there are no signs in the city that would help get to the hotel, it‚Äôs quite difficult to find the way; </li><li>  despite the fact that the quality of cleaning is good, it is strange that maids do not always remove garbage from the room; </li><li>  the rooms have terrible soundproofing, and therefore it is unlikely that you can fully relax. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the Konyushenny Dvor is one of the most popular <span>hotels in Ryazan.</span>  Here, urban comfort and country coziness are incredibly successfully combined.  Despite the fact that the cost of living is quite high, many tourists and business people choose this particular accommodation option.  You have a unique opportunity to relax in a green corner of nature with its own pond and clean forest air.  And if you want to be at the epicenter of urban life, then you have to overcome a relatively short distance to a huge park - about half an hour by walking. </p>
