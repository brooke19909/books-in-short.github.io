Every year, this area is visited by a huge number of tourists who want to look at historical sights and picturesque landscapes.  If you decide to go on a trip to Normandy, then you will certainly enjoy Etretat, France (you can see the photo of the city below).  In this publication, we have collected the most interesting information about the tourist town in Upper Normandy: history, attractions, interesting facts, as well as routes. </p><h2>  Where does the name of the city come from? </h2><p>  The origin of the name of the city is still unknown.  Some researchers argue that its significance is associated with the "end of the road", while others - with "sheer cliffs."  One of the most common versions is the Scandinavian origin of the name, which translates as ‚Äúsetting sun‚Äù.  No one knows until the end whether this theory has something in common with reality.  However, this would be quite logical, because scientists recognized the influence of the Scandinavian elements on the toponym, and there are also versions about its translation as a "village in the east."  Many writers and artists indirectly confirm this theory with their works, for example, the book of Henry Bacon and the names of the paintings by Claude Monet, in which there is a phrase ‚Äúsetting sun‚Äù.  However, most scientists are inclined to another version, according to which the toponym comes from the Scandinavian word ‚Äúneedle‚Äù.  This is due to the fact that the Normans first saw in this area - that is, with rocks.  So the modified word was called the city of Etretat (France). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  General information about the city </h2><p>  The city was considered one of the most popular health resorts in Europe in the late XVIII - early XIX centuries.  During this period, from an ordinary village in which fishermen lived, it turned into a famous seaside village.  Etretat, France (photo of the city you can see below) owe such a coincidence to the picturesque coast of the English Channel, as well as sheer cliffs that tourists liked. </p><p>  Today this place is the main thing that attracts a large number of travelers to Upper Normandy.  In the summer period, the flow of tourists does not stop, but in the fall it noticeably decreases. </p>

    <p>  A constant number of local residents in the town reaches only 1.5 thousand.  The settlement itself covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãno more than 4 km¬≤.  However, Etretat Square is considered taking into account the golf course and the coast without buildings.  The city has both relatively wide streets and a large number of cozy streets.  If you rise to a high plateau, you can watch the cliffs on the shore and a beautiful view of the strait.  On a hill are ancient castles and mansions, in which both the local elite and famous people live and are simply rich from all over France. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cliffs in Etretat </h2><p>  Fans of natural attractions will definitely like the cliffs of Etretat (France), which are located on the English Channel.  Their height is approximately eighty meters, and to the north, in the direction of Fekan, is already a little more - from one hundred to one hundred and twenty meters.  <span>The white cliffs of</span> Etretat (France) are composed of chalky limestone interspersed with silicon.  Due to the impact of sea water, the latter is washed out, and therefore cliffs appear.  In addition, this factor also affects the polishing of silicon, which caused the formation of pebbles on the shore.  Also, the change in this area is affected by the fact that the chalk is washed out due to rainwater.  Thus, it is destroyed, and so the rock collapses. </p>

    <h2>  Offenbach Castle </h2><p>  The town of Etretat (France), whose attractions are described in this article, is famous for its historical buildings.  One of them is Eig Castle, which stands on a street named after one of the country's famous composers who once lived in this city.  The building was built in the second half of the XIX century according to the ideas of one of the local architects - Theodore Ushon.  He arrived at the invitation of Amedere Boyer, better known as a man guarding a recipe for healing water (lemon balm).  The French Carmelite monks had long ago discovered her recipe, and the lord's family made sure that he reached the descendants.  After Boyer‚Äôs death, his wealthy widow married one of the Polish princes, Jozef Lubomirski, who served as chamberlain to the Russian Emperor Nicholas the First.  It was the nobleman who became the owner of the building and took in it many noble, influential people and creative people of his time.  If you pre-book such a service, then in the castle you can now spend the night in the room of ‚ÄúMaria Cristina's Suite‚Äù or ‚ÄúIsabella Tower‚Äù.  The cost of such pleasure is 200 euros.  To date, the building is owned by the family of the original owners, they organize a large number of excursions, as well as honored guests from around the world.  At the same time, they constantly emphasize that Eig Castle is not a hotel at all.  The building of the historic mansion is open to tourists in the summer (except for June, as well as with the exception of a couple of weeks in August) and the first month of autumn.  At this time every day (except Tuesday) from two in the afternoon until six in the evening excursion walks are held here.  In order to get inside, you must first sign up. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Salamander Mansion </h2><p>  If you need to stay in the city of √âtretat (France), the hotels here are varied.  And they are not always fabulously expensive.  The most popular hotel among tourists is the Hotel des Falaises, next to which is located the so-called ‚ÄúSalamander Mansion‚Äù.  The history of this building is quite interesting.  And today, the construction site is also complete without a hotel and restaurant. </p><p>  Back in 1912, a famous architect Emil Mozh launched a new project.  The building, which was subsequently constructed, included the territory of the establishment, the Marquise de Sevigny's grill bar.  The house became a "salamander" in a later period. </p><p>  For the construction of the building, the architect was inspired by medieval French structures. </p>

Sights of this region also include local temples, one of which is the main church of North Dam, located on the street of the same name. </p><p>  The building of the first temple was built on this site in the XII century, and today on this territory you can see the temple restored in the XIX century.  If you go through the gate, then you find yourself in the old city cemetery, where soldiers who died during the Allied landings on Norman territory in the summer of 1944 are buried. </p><p>  The square, which bears the name of one of the French bishops - Lemony, is also known as a monument to other soldiers.  They died in the First World War.  The monument contains an inscription dedicated to soldiers. </p><p>  The Protestant temple, which was built at the end of the XIX century, is also preserved in Etretat. </p><h2>  Other attractions </h2><p>  Not far from the temple is a building with the Arsene Lupine Museum, which was opened seventeen years ago.  Previously, it was a house known for having the famous French writer Maurice Leblanc living in it.  It was they who invented the character of Arsen Lupine, who acts in dozens of novelist detectives.  In addition, Etretat has a building for a music concert hall, as well as a maritime center, an old station and many other attractions. </p><p>  So how do you get to the city?  We will describe this in detail below. </p><h2>  How to get to the city? </h2><p>  The route that you plan to go must be determined in advance, since there will most likely be no one to ask on the spot.  Small stations are often quite crowded. </p><p>  So, you decided to go to the city of Etretat (France).  You can get here from Paris as follows.  You need to go from the station of Saint-Lazare (at the metro station of the same name). </p><p>  Remember that there are no direct trains to Etretat since the 70s of the last century.  Therefore, it is necessary to plan a trip as follows: you get a train to the nearest village, and then go by bus or take a taxi. </p><p>  Take train tickets at the box office of Saint-Lazare station to the region you need - Upper Normandy.  The city itself is located in the department of Seine Maritime.  You can go to two stations.  The first option is the city of Le Havre, and the second is Breote-Bezville.  Tickets are sold at the box office of any <span>Paris railway station,</span> as well as on the page of French railway carriers, where an electronic ticket is paid using a credit card, and then printed. </p><p>  If you chose Le Havre, then you can get to Etretat from here by regular bus.  Keolis Seine Maritime is the name of the carrier company.  It‚Äôs best to pre-study the timeline on the Internet.  You will need the 24th route.  This option is the most budgetary to come to the city of Etretat (France).  The reviews say, however, that it is necessary to prepare - there will be a lot of people.  The last bus to Etretat is six in the evening.  The trip takes approximately 40 to 60 minutes. </p>

    <p>  If you have chosen the station Breote-Bezville, you will also need to go from here by bus to the city.  There are two routes from this point.  The first is a bus that leaves on Friday evening, and the second on Saturday morning.  The schedule corresponds to the seventeenth route.  On average, it will not take you more than half an hour.  The cost of the trip is also quite low. </p><p>  In addition, from Breot-Bezville you can get to Etretat if you take a taxi.  This option is quite common.  According to travelers reviews, this method is the most convenient.  You do not need to study the timetable and worry about whether your luggage will fit in the car, as well as crowding next to other passengers.  A time trip also takes about half an hour.  The option is different in that you get to the city very quickly, however, this pleasure will be much more expensive.  If the price of a bus ticket is only a few euros, then a taxi costs about fifty euros.  However, you decide - depending on the circumstances and budget allocated for the trip. </p><p>  Perhaps, as noted by tourists who have visited these places, you will have to wander in Breot-Bezville to find a taxi.  To order a car from the station to Etretat, you need to call the phone number indicated on the street signs.  As a rule, it can be found on one side of the roadside sign.  If there are several phone numbers, this means the number of taxi drivers working in the vicinity of the station.  When they are free, they will be able to pick up passengers.  Be prepared for the fact that taxi drivers may not speak English (like most Normans), so you will have to indicate the direction of the route in French.  You can also ask someone who knows both languages ‚Äã‚Äãto explain to the driver where to go.  Or you can order a car in advance.  So you do not have to waste time at the station. </p><p>  In order to leave Etretat on time, you also need to study the return schedule or book a car in order to catch a train to Paris. </p>
