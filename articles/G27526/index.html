They have a lot of flowers, greenery, but few different accessories.  To create a eurobouquet do not even use felt packaging.  It is enough to bandage it with a ribbon.  We invite you to get acquainted with photos of European bouquets, their features.  After all, these floral ensembles combine freshness and elegance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bohemiaflowershop.bloomnation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bouquet with lilies" class="if uuid-3076642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42358/3076642.jpg"></div><h2>  Eurobud characteristic </h2><p>  The main feature of the European bouquet is an equal amount of all its components.  For such compositions, a careful selection of colors is needed.  Of particular importance are shades.  Their number should not exceed three tones.  Experienced florists masterfully make such bouquets.  Any girl or woman will be happy with this exquisite gift. </p><p>  The Eurobouquet combines style, arrangement, dimensions, technique of execution by the master.  This style first appeared in Europe.  German, Dutch, French florists laid the foundation for the creation of such compositions.  They evenly filled the space between the flowers to get a dense and compact bouquet.  The packaging was used in very small sizes. </p><p>  Eurobouquets can have a round, pyramidal, spherical or triangular configuration.  If oriental floristic art requires strict canons for shades, then European is loyal in this regard.  The length of the stems and the angle of inclination also do not play a big role.  Such Eurobouquets are usually installed in vases of a much smaller size. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mini bouquet in a vase" class="if uuid-3076630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42358/3076630.jpg"></div><h2>  Biedermeier - famous Eurobuket </h2><p>  The most expressive features are characterized by Biedermeier bouquets.  In the 19th century they were composed of wealthy citizens, burghers, and the bourgeois.  In those days, there was a very fashionable style in art - Biedermeier.  It mixed romanticism with empire.  He was characterized by jewelry made of silk, luxurious lace, satin ribbons.  With the help of a special wire, the stems of the flowers were lengthened.  Among the natural elements could use artificial inserts. </p><p>  In the 20th century, Biedermeier was replaced by elegant round bouquets.  Europeans wanted a geometrically noble conciseness.  Magnificent solemnity with ribbons, beads, cuffs faded into the background and became relevant only for a wedding. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="8mIWhirDcn0" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mIWhirDcn0" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/3/2/0/14320.jpg"></div><h2>  Vases, boxes, plates for bouquets </h2><p>  For today's popular European bouquets, they use flat plates, small vases of the most elaborate shapes, round colored cardboard boxes.  Most often they form spherical and hemispherical compositions typical of German floristry.  Dutch compositions are characterized by a combination of more than three shades and a hemispherical and pyramidal configuration. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="encinitasflorist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bouquet on a plate" class="if uuid-3076644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42358/3076644.jpg"></div><h2>  European-style pyramidal bouquets </h2><p>  French florists love flower pyramids.  They require accurate calculation.  First, the main axis of the composition is formed, and then the flowers with the longest stems are laid.  After that proceed to the design of horizontal lines.  The French bouquet also has a lot of bright colors and shades, flowers of different varieties.  Euro-buketics differ in democratic price.  An elegant bouquet will be a confirmation of good taste and a subtle sense of style.  There are many reasons for acquiring such compositions: birthday, graduation, date. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timetoast.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pyramidal bouquet" class="if uuid-3076653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42358/3076653.jpg"></div><h2>  Names for European flower bouquets </h2><p>  These names are most often associated with well-known European places.  Very often, compositions are named after famous cities.  So, you can find the names "Venice", "Marseille", "Portofino", "Nice".  Isn't it romantic?  Such names contain not only mood, but also a whole world of images. </p><p>  Some French light-heartedness can express a bouquet called "Lyon".
