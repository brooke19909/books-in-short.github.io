But with cars everything is much more complicated.  And so many citizens are looking for the answer to their question about tax deductions when buying a vehicle.  Is he really there?

    <h2>  Fairy tales </h2><p>  <span>How to get a tax deduction</span> when buying a car?  Honestly, no way.  Such a refund is not provided for in the law.  That is, you can get a property deduction, but not when it comes to a vehicle. </p><p>  So, thinking about a refund when buying a car just does not make sense.  It's a waste of time.  It is not put to anyone - neither to pensioners, nor needy, nor to ordinary citizens.  However, there is a tax deduction when buying a different type of car.  More precisely, it helps to reduce the tax base for the sale of real estate.  Such a return takes place.  It relies directly on the seller.  What is it about?  And what do you need to get one? </p><h2>  For sellers </h2><p>  Is there a tax deduction for buying a car in certain cases?  Only partially.  The thing is that you can get a refund by the seller.  More precisely, to reduce the tax base for tax payments in the future.  And nothing more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As we have already found out, buyers do not have any rights to this deduction.  Thus, you should not think about a refund when buying a vehicle.  But if you acted as a seller, you will have to worry in advance about obtaining this "benefit" in order to ease your tax obligations to the state.  This is not so difficult as it might seem at first glance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get a tax deduction when buying a car" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1221554.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The timing </h2><p>  The tax deduction when buying a car (or rather, when selling it) is due to all sellers.  This is especially true for those whose transport costs more than 250,000 rubles, and is also owned for no more than three years.  It is this category of taxpayers who must pay tax after the transaction.  And it can be reduced with simple actions. </p><p>  What is the time period for tax deduction when you buy a car from someone?  It will be necessary to solve the question before the end of the tax reporting period.  At the moment, it is installed until April 30 of each year.  However, a report is required for the previous 12 months.  That is, in 2014 you file statements for 2013, in 2015 - for 2014, and so on. </p><p>  But the terms of consideration of the request usually vary, but do not exceed two months.  On average, you can expect 1-1.5 months of waiting for a response from the tax authorities.  In general, the tax deduction when buying a car from someone takes about 3-4 months.  But how to get it? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Personality </h2><p>  The tax deduction when buying a car from someone is carried out only with an identity card.  That is, you need a passport.  Or rather, a copy of it.  Without this document, no one will talk to you in the tax authorities.  As practice shows, other identification cards are not accepted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car tax deduction" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1221553.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is not necessary to certify copies of all pages of the passport.  After you have these papers, you can start collecting other documents.  There are not so many of them, but not everyone knows the list of everything.  The absence of at least one document will result in a denial of deduction. </p><h2>  Statement and Report </h2><p>  Refunds by tax authorities, as well as a reduction in the tax base when calculating tax, are possible only at the request of a citizen.  Otherwise, you simply do not declare your rights and desires to the state.  No one will impose deductions.  Everyone should think about it himself. </p><p>  The application is written in almost free form.  There is a certain sample - in it you indicate the reason for applying for a deduction, as well as information about the transaction.  You can specify customer information.  Be sure to write about your income and expenses when buying a vehicle. </p><p>  Also required tax reporting.  It is called a declaration, form 3-PIT.  It is filled by you independently with the help of special programs.  There will be nothing difficult or special in the process - you need to enter data on the funds received by you, as well as information about you, the buyer and the car.  All this is not so difficult - to enter data in the appropriate fields on the screen. </p><p>  Among other things, they will require a 2-personal income tax certificate from you.  It is also called an income statement.  If you work for yourself, it is completed personally, otherwise it is taken from the employer in accounting.  Only the originals of the listed documents are needed.  No copies will be accepted, even if they are certified. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax deduction when buying a car" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1221552.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About deal </h2><p>  What else might be required?  Now you have to present all the documents that relate directly to the transaction.  This is the only way to get a tax deduction when you buy a car from one or another citizen. </p><p>  First, you have to attach a certified or original copy of the contract of sale.  Moreover, you must be listed as a seller.  Without this, it will not be possible to submit an application - it is simply not subject to consideration. </p><p>  Secondly, confirmation of your income and expenses.  These are required documents.  Any checks and receipts that could only relate to the transaction will do.  For example, those that confirm the fact of your purchase of transport.  And of course, evidence of the sale thereof. </p><p>  Thirdly, a certificate of ownership and title will also have to be attached to all other documents.  It is advisable to have certified copies thereof.  Then and only then we can think about reducing the tax base when paying debt to the state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Does a tax deduction apply when buying a car" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1221551.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Honestly, many citizens do not think about how to get a tax deduction when buying a car.  Most often, it‚Äôs just more logical to wait 3 years and not pay tax on property sales at all.  It is this option that is common in Russia.  This is quite normal.  In general, everyone should decide the issue of deduction independently.  Just a little waiting can save you most of the problems.  The choice is yours.  Just remember that the buyer is not entitled to tax deductions in connection with the purchase of a car. </p>
