  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How long does it take to produce a Sberbank card?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In our age of electronic money and quick payments, a bank card is an essential companion of almost any adult citizen.  Most people get paid for it and use it for payments.  The most popular bank in our country, due to several advantages, is Sberbank.  If you are just going to order a card from this bank or want to reissue an existing one, you may be interested in the time frame for making a Sberbank card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mildberry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Visa and MasterCard" class="if uuid-3180946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90067/3180946.jpg"></div><p>  Why is the plastic card so popular in the modern world?  It is incomparably more convenient than cash and has several advantages: the buyer does not need to search ‚Äúfor settlement‚Äù, and the seller - change, payment is faster than in cash, it‚Äôs convenient to track expenses, and the loss of a card is not the final parting with money, but only only temporary, while you expect a reissue of the card. </p><h2>  Manufacturing process </h2><p>  To begin with, if you do not have a plastic card, you need to decide on the bank where you will keep your money lying on the card account.  It should be understood that the money itself does not "lie on the card."  They are located in the bank account, and a card is attached to the account, which is a payment instrument.  So, if your card is reissued, then the money does not "transfer from the old card to a new one", but remain in the same account, just a new card is attached to it.  Sometimes several cards can be connected to one account at once, and even of different people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The bank that issues the card is called the issuer, and the place of their production is called the processing center.  Developed <span>banks have processing centers</span> and can be located in different parts of the country.  And small organizations may not have their own processing centers, which is why they use the services of larger ones.  Because of this, for example, the production time of a Sberbank Visa Classic card is shorter than that of a similar card of a less developed bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cim-usa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embosser - card printing machine" class="if uuid-3180201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90067/3180201.jpg"></div><p>  The processing center stores plastic blanks of cards of different payment systems.  When a person creates an application for a card issue or reissue, the work begins: the customer data is recorded on the magnetic tape and the workpiece chip, his data, such as Name, Surname, card number, CVV-code, expiration date, is stamped on plastic.  A special sealed pin envelope imprints the pin code.  Thus, even the processing center employees do not see it.  The card is attached to the pin envelope and sent to the department or by courier to the client‚Äôs house (not all banks and all cities have such a function). </p><h2>  When we run into this </h2><p>  In what situations may we need a deadline for making a Sberbank Visa Gold card or any other?  Firstly, when we produce the initial issue of the card.  Secondly, when we need to reissue it.  It can be ahead of schedule and planned.  A planned reissue takes place at the end of the validity period of the current card: it is prepared in advance and delivered to the same department in which you received the previous card.  If you need to get it elsewhere, then you write in advance a statement about this.  In this case, you will not have to wait.  You just come to the department when the card expires.  The new one will already be stored there. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another thing is early reissue.  It can occur for various reasons: </p><ul><li>  change of name or surname; </li><li>  loss, loss, theft of a card or physical damage; </li><li>  PIN code is forgotten (in some banks it can be changed without reissuing a card); </li><li>  data is compromised; </li><li>  etc. </li></ul><p>  It is worth considering that with an early reissue, the card number changes, but with a planned reissue it does not. </p><h2>  Standard terms of Sberbank </h2><p>  The time for making a Sberbank card depends on several factors: the place where you received the card, participation in bonus programs (Aeroflot, for example), the presence or absence of an individual design.  While a card is being produced, a co-branding program is connected (if necessary) and delivery to the necessary department takes place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aeproject.pro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Branch of Sberbank" class="if uuid-3180203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90067/3180203.jpg"></div><p>  In Moscow, for example, the process from creating an application to delivery to a bank office is two to three business days.  In the regions - from a week to two (in the regional centers cards arrive faster than in other cities of the region).  If you made out an individual design on the site, then add another week to the approval and production of your drawing. </p><p>  The duration of the creation, as a rule, does not depend on the type of card.  The production time of a Sberbank Visa Gold card does not differ from Mastercard Gold or Classic. </p><h2>  How to issue and reissue cards </h2><p>  You can order a card for the first time in several ways: on the Sberbank website, in your Sberbank Online account (both in the web version and in the mobile application), in the branch.  The term for making a Sberbank card does not depend on the order method. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sberbankin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Custom Design Card" class="if uuid-3180955" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90067/3180955.jpg"></div><p>  You can issue an early reissue in your personal account, in a branch, or by calling the Contact Center at 900. A planned reissue is automatic, there is nothing to do. </p><h2>  Terms of manufacturing cards in other banks </h2><p>  The production time in other financial organizations does not differ much from the production time of a Sberbank card.  On average, it is from one to two weeks.  Detailed information can be found in branches, websites or contact sites of banks. </p>
