    <p>  The Costa Brava, where the Blaumar Blanes Hotel is built, is best known for its clean beaches, which have been praised by environmentalists.  Maintaining their cleanliness here is the state.  The resort itself consists of many small coastal towns.  It is easy to travel between them, both by bus and by car.  Among the leisure facilities there is a water park, a mini zoo, many bars, nightclubs and discos.  For history buffs, the Verdakier Center has been opened, where you can look at the monuments of Iberian and Catalan culture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General information about the hotel Blaumar Costa Brava </h2><p>  This resort was built in 1990.  It is noteworthy that he shares the territory with another complex - Blaucel.  They have a common infrastructure, and an underground passage was made between their buildings.  The same company manages both hotels.  The only difference is that the Blaumar Hotel in Spain has less spacious rooms.  It consists of one seven-story building, a sunbathing area and an outdoor pool.  The last renovation was carried out here in 2007, when the rooms and <span>common areas</span> were renovated <span>.</span>  In total, the hotel offers tourists 175 rooms. </p>

It is built on the first line of the coast, so you can get to the beach in 2-5 minutes.  The sea is approximately 100 meters from the main building.

However, it is only 1.5 km away, so you can walk to it on foot.  You can also call a taxi or get by public transport.
