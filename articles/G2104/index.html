    <h2>  Mon Reve 3 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  In order for people planning a trip to have a more complete and clear picture of this hotel, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized reviews of travelers who have already visited Mon Reve.  So, in general, our compatriots characterize the hotel as a fairly modest place.  However, it would be wrong to count on some excesses and delicacies at dinner for little money, so the guests have no particular complaints. </p><p>  Moreover, the rooms in the hotel, although small, are very comfortable, they have everything that a traveler needs to relax.  Plumbing is working properly, the beds are comfortable.  Rooms are cleaned regularly. </p><p>  The staff of Mon Reve (Torre Pedrera) 3 * left a very good impression on vacationers.  So, all the hotel staff are very friendly and always ready to help.  Please note that the majority of guests here are Italians themselves.  Therefore, the staff at the hotel does not speak Russian.  However, in order to explain, basic knowledge of the English language is quite enough. </p><p>  As for food, it, according to tourists, is quite simple here.  However, the quality and taste of the dishes are simply excellent. </p><p>  Of course, travelers considered the location of the Mon Reve a big plus.  After all, the nearest beach can be reached in just a couple of minutes.  By the way, the beaches here are municipal, and not owned by hotels, as in Turkey.  Therefore, the rental of umbrellas and sunbeds will have to pay extra (about 5-6 euros). </p><p>  In general, this hotel is perfect for young and active tourists who prefer to spend the whole day on the beach or travel to interesting places, and return to the hotel only for the night. </p>
