It is here that the country's best museums, theaters, architectural monuments are located, and this is the place where the fate of the whole state is decided. </p><p>  Budapest is the only capital in the world that possesses all this, plus it is a balneological resort, to which tourists from all over the world come annually.  For comfortable treatment and just relaxing ‚Äúon the waters‚Äù comfortable hotels of Budapest with their thermal springs are provided. </p><h2>  What is the use? </h2><p>  The healing properties of thermal springs on the site of the future Budapest were discovered by the Romans, who were the first to build baths here.  The famous Roman baths in this area have become popular due to their healing properties.  This can be found in the frescoes preserved in the most ancient baths. </p><p>  Today in Budapest there are 26 bath houses and 400 hot springs open, some of which have alkaline-hydrocarbonate waters saturated with calcium, sulfur, chlorine salts, fluorides, and some are filled with sulphurous mineral water. </p>

    <p>  People suffering from diseases of the musculoskeletal system, metabolic disorders, the gastrointestinal tract, as well as problems in gynecology and the peripheral circulatory system come for treatment in Budapest.  Hotels with <span>thermal springs</span> are the best way to solve health problems. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Procedures that can be completed at the hotel: </p><ul><li>  taking pearl and mineral baths; </li><li>  mud therapy; </li><li>  hydromassage and hydrotherapy; </li><li>  Jacuzzi and aromatic saunas; </li><li>  salt inhalation. </li></ul><p>  Access to the baths and pools for hotel guests in the center of Budapest near the springs is free. </p><h2>  Margarita Island </h2><p>  Two <span>4-star</span> thermal hotels in Budapest are located on the famous Margarita Island.  Named after the daughter of King Bela IV, this land became a memory of her sad fate.  The girl was only 9 years old when her father vowed that he would give it to God if the Mongol-Tatars defeated.  After the victory, Bela IV built a monastery on the island, where he sent his daughter to be raised and where later she became abbess.  Margarita died at 29 years old, never having seen the big world.  And later she was canonized under the name of St. Margarita, and the island began to bear her name. </p><p>  Today it is an oasis of health and sport, located in close proximity to the center of the capital.  People come here for a run and bike ride from all over the city.  People suffering from diseases travel from afar to swim in the thermal springs of the island and undergo the treatment programs offered by the Budapest hotels located here. </p><h2>  Grand Hotel Margitsiget </h2><p>  An amazing combination of ancient eras, reflected in the design of the hotel, with modern service and level of services makes the hotel popular among lovers of wellness tourism. </p><p>  The hotel is located so close to another thermal hotel in Budapest that they are connected by a heated underground gallery.  It leads to rooms with <span>thermal pools</span> used by guests of the Grand Hotel Margitsiget. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It features: </p><ul><li>  comfortable rooms equipped with a minibar, upholstered furniture, bathroom, safe, coffee maker, Internet and TV; </li><li>  the terrace of the Secheni restaurant, famous throughout the capital, overlooking the Danube and the park, where they offer an international and traditional menu; </li><li>  ice cream parlor for guests with children; </li><li>  beer pub; </li><li>  conference rooms with modern equipment; </li><li>  a fitness club with a different set of sports programs; </li><li>  tennis and cycling; </li><li>  healing procedures. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in the center of Budapest" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/1052996.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  The price includes visiting: </p><ul><li>  thermal pools; </li><li>  baths with a surprise and saunas; </li><li>  aromatic cameras. </li></ul><p>  The wellness program also includes a course of drinking and the possibility of ordering diet food.  The beautiful 130-year-old historic hotel, which was restored and renovated in 2000, leaves only the best memories and a feeling of gratitude with its customers. </p><h2>  Thermal Hotel Margitsiget </h2><p>  This four-star thermal hotel, opened relatively recently, already has its followers.  Due to the large selection of treatment and wellness programs, environmentally friendly materials from which the building was built and decorated, as well as its location in the northern part of Margarita, the hotel is in constant demand all year round. </p><p>  The clients of this popular health resort in Budapest expect: </p><ul><li>  modern rooms with air conditioning, balconies, TVs, bathrooms and comfortable upholstered furniture; </li><li>  there are special rooms for non-smokers and people with disabilities; </li><li>  restaurant "Platan" offers diet food and international cuisine; </li><li>  Cafe Camilla welcomes each guest with cakes and sandwiches; </li><li>  lobby bar and poolside bar; </li><li>  beaches and baths; </li><li>  tennis and sports fields. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Budapest hotels 3 stars" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/1052999.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  The category of medical and preventive procedures offered at the Thermal Hotel Margitsiget includes: </p><ul><li>  mud wrap; </li><li>  balneotherapy; </li><li>  visit to the thermal baths; </li><li>  hydro and electrotherapy; </li><li>  medical and dental examination. </li></ul><p>  The level of service at the hotel refers to the premium class, as evidenced by its popularity among customers. </p><h2>  Thermal Hotel Helia </h2><p>  In Hungary, it is arranged that the 3 star hotels in Budapest cannot have their own thermal springs, so those who prefer a cheaper vacation will have to travel to city-wide baths.  Those who want to get everything at once and not waste time looking for a suitable pool, choose the Thermal Hotel Helia hotel, which is located opposite the Margarita island. </p><p>  Located on the Pest side in a green and environmentally friendly area, this hotel attracts guests who prefer to travel by car, as parking is free.  The view from the windows to the Danube and Buda Mountain also plays an important role, although the main ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù of this hotel is its quality services and excellent service. </p>
