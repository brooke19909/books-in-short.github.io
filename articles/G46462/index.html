Complex development, consisting of houses of different floors (from three to nine floors), is carried out in two stages.  The first stage - two 3-storey complexes - was already commissioned in 2014, at this stage the construction of the second stage is underway.  Developer - Element-Concrete company.  ‚ÄúFinnish quarters‚Äù is far from its first project.  SK enjoys a good reputation in the real estate market, rents all its facilities without delays and imperfections.  As a rule, homebuyers have no complaints against the developer, which, however, is not surprising, since the company‚Äôs activities have been awarded a number of state awards, which, of course, testifies to the quality of the square meters it offers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="finnish quarters" class="if" height="438" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1297280.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  The complex will consist of six houses, in which it is proposed to purchase 788 apartments of various sizes.  At the moment, it is envisaged to sell housing in houses under construction on the basis of equity participation.  You can purchase both a studio and an apartment with one to four rooms.  Some accommodations have spacious terraces. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, in all documents the complex is held as a residential complex ‚ÄúFinnish quarters‚Äù.  However, it is known to many potential buyers under a slightly different name.  True, consonant.  People call the LCD "Finnish Quarter."  Element-Concrete, as the creator of the project, has nothing against it, by and large, since it does not cause confusion, everyone who mentions the complex in different ways, all the same, has in mind the same object.  Which, by the way, enjoys well-deserved popularity.  Why?  This is what will be discussed later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd finnish quarters" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1297279.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  So, what are the advantages of the Finnish Quarters residential complex in comparison with other complexes, which today, by the way, are more than enough in the suburbs of St. Petersburg? </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  An unconditional plus for new buildings.  Vsevolozhsk district is considered one of the best in the region in terms of environmental conditions.  There are no large industrial enterprises, but there are a lot of forests, lakes, rivers.  In addition, five kilometers to the borders of the metropolis from the threshold of the house - this is not the distance today.  So it is safe to say that the Finnish Quarters residential complex is located not in the suburbs, but on the outskirts of St. Petersburg.  But at the same time in the region, due to which the prices for apartments here are ‚Äúprovincial‚Äù.  That is noticeably lower than in the metropolis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  Also, by and large, a plus.  Element-Beton is a competent company that uses the methods and technologies of Finnish builders in its activities, the notorious quality of housing of which is well-known to everyone.  During the construction of the complex, all the features of the climate of the Northern capital were taken into account, which, as you know, is similar to the Finnish one.  The latest panel technologies, involving the use of three-layer structures, made it possible to create truly warm houses, which, in addition, also have thick internal walls that contribute to the sound insulation of apartments.  And the craze of Finnish specialists for large-scale frameless glazing led to the fact that the living quarters in the residential complex turned out to be bright, spacious, comfortable. </p>

    <h2>  Good transport accessibility </h2><p>  The nearest metro stations - "Ozerki" and "Prospekt Prosvescheniya" - from the residential complex "Finnish quarters" can be reached by bus in 15 minutes.  Such an advantage as the presence of a metro almost near the house, not all residential complexes can boast not only of the suburbs, but also of the metropolis.  In addition to buses, minibuses also go to the metro.  Not far from the LCD there are two stations through which trains run to St. Petersburg.  The list of benefits completes the availability of three kilometers from the roundabout complex.  Not so much to get to it by car, at the same time there is enough distance so that the noise of the route does not interfere with the residents, and harmful exhausts do not affect the state of the atmosphere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="concrete element finnish quarters" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1297277.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  And in this regard, the LCD "Finnish quarters" has a lot of advantages.  And let only small shops operate on the territory so far.  With the commissioning of the entire complex, such facilities will be sufficient.  But in 10 minutes you can reach the five largest supermarkets and a huge shopping and entertainment center.  There are not many in the suburbs of LCDs that boast similar accessibility to large shopping centers.  Near the complex there is a school, two kindergartens, several clinics.  Over time, its own similar objects will also appear on its territory. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  Finnish Quarter is a residential complex that offers customers a wide variety of apartments, both in terms of area and in terms of layouts.  As for the first.  In the LCD you can buy a small studio of 22 "squares", and a huge 4-room apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 150 square meters with a terrace and two bathrooms.  The range in cost from 1 million 300 thousand to 13 million will allow a person to choose suitable housing with any state of a bank account.  In addition, a lot of all kinds of layouts - functional, ergonomic, created on the basis of the experience of Finnish builders - makes it possible to make a choice in accordance with your own preferences. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="finnish quarters reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1297278.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  LCD "Finnish quarters": reviews </h2><p>  The main advantages of the complex were listed above.  Do those who are just looking for housing consider it worthy of attention, and are people who already live in the houses of the Finnish Quarters happy with their choice? </p><p>  Both questions can be answered in the affirmative.  Everyone likes it.  New settlers are pleased that houses are rented out with several types of finishes.  If you want to pay less or have decided to make repairs yourself - buy with a draft or pre-finish.  There is extra money - take an apartment with a <span>fine finish.</span>  The company's specialists will do everything themselves, after agreeing on the design with the owner.  People also like the fact that, thanks to frameless glazing, there is a lot of light in their homes.  Well, the owners of apartments with terraces are completely delighted.  In general, there are no complaints.  Construction deadlines are respected, work is carried out in accordance with the schedule, houses are rented out without any imperfections.  Transport runs normally, you do not have to stand at a stop for a long time.  The yards are being landscaped in accordance with the plan; children‚Äôs and sports grounds are equipped near each house. </p><p>  Perhaps, of course, the price of apartments is quite high, nevertheless, they are sold out quickly enough. </p>
