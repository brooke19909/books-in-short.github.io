Tourists come here to visit ancient temples and manors.  Today we will get to know the main attractions of Venev Tula region. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The first written mention of the city of <span>Venev (Tula region), the sights</span> and photos of which we are considering, date back to the XIV century, but there is every reason to believe that the city was founded much earlier, near the Sturgeon River.  Due to the fact that nomads walked through the city to Moscow from the southern steppes, he often went bankrupt, and several times completely burned to the ground.  In the 17th century, earthworks appeared near Venev, the remains of which have survived to this day.  Soon the city lost its defense significance and began to develop as a shopping center.  In 1777, he and the county were included in the Tula province.  With the development of industry, the city began to grow and develop sharply.  Today, the Venevsky Territory is considered the most saturated region of historical monuments in the Tula region.  The sights of Venev will be discussed below. </p><h2>  12 keys </h2><p>  The holy spring is located in the northwest of Venev.  It is believed that its water has healing properties and gives vital energy to everyone who drinks it.  For maximum effect, you can swim in the equipped font. </p>

    <h2>  Epiphany Church </h2><p>  Considering the sights of Venev, Tula region, you can not miss the Epiphany Church, located on the Red Square of the city.  It is one of the most interesting examples of longline churches of the 17th-18th centuries in the region.  Currently, the church is undergoing reconstruction, but it is open to visitors. </p><h2>  Kazan Church </h2><p>  This attraction was built in 1764.  It is located on Red Square, near the Epiphany Church.  At the end of the 19th century, the Kazan Church was a separate warm chapel of the Epiphany, in which winter services were held.  By the end of the last century, the building was preserved in dilapidated form. </p><h2>  John the Baptist Church </h2><p>  The construction of this church dates back to 1773, but it acquired its final appearance in 1857.  The interior has more than once undergone changes, and in the second half of the 19th century the iconostasis was replaced.  The temple is the only one in the area that has not been closed since the day of construction until our time.  It contains many revered and miraculous icons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  St. Nicholas Church (bell tower) </h2><p>  The construction of the church began in 1800 under the direction of the architect K.S.  Sokolnikov.  He designed the tallest and most beautiful temple in the Tula province.  Even the capital's residents admired the grandeur of the church, the most prosperous of whom sponsored its construction.  Due to the complexity and scale of the construction, it lasted about 50 years.  In the middle of the 20th century, the church was destroyed, but the 75-meter bell tower still rises above the city.  Unfortunately, even though it is one of the main attractions of Venev, Tula region, the tower was never reconstructed. </p><h2>  Resurrection Cathedral </h2><p>  The city of Venev (Tula region), the addresses and attractions of which we are considering, is rather small, therefore the main tourist places are concentrated in the center.  The Resurrection Cathedral is part of the architectural ensemble of Red Square.  The cathedral was built on the site of the first church of the city - Paraskeva Fridays - in 1752.  At the beginning of the XIX century, the old building was replaced by a new one, made in the classical style.  In 1837, Alexander the Second visited the Resurrection Church, operating at the cathedral.  In the 1930s, the cathedral was closed and until the 1990s was used as an utility room.  Later, charity organizations began to rebuild it. </p><h2>  Church of the Intercession </h2><p>  The building of this temple was built in 1737, also on Red Square.  In the second half of the last century, the building was used as a warehouse.  If you believe the locals, an underground passage leads from the church to the Resurrection Cathedral and the river. </p><p>  Now consider the sights of the county.  Venev Tula region without them would not be so interesting. </p>

    <h2>  Campanari Palace </h2><p>  In the village of Urusovo, near the city of Venev, are the remains of the Campanari Palace.  The building was built in the late 18th century in a classic style.  On the walls you can still see traces of plaster of those times.  Once in the palace was a large collection of paintings.  This was probably the main estate in the entire county.  In fairness, we note that the Campanari family were only the last owners of the building. </p><h2>  Barsky house of the Davydovs </h2><p>  The village of Aksinino is now almost forgotten, and the manor house of the Davydovs, which is located in it, is remembered only in connection with O.A.  Kiprensky - a brilliant portrait painter, who visited him in 1809.  In 1900, the architectural complex was destroyed, but the church and one of the entry pyramids survived.  To this day, a spiral staircase has been preserved, with which you can climb to the second floor of the bell tower. </p><h2>  Manor Maximilian von Mecca </h2>

    <p>  The palace is located near the village of Khruslovka.  After nationalization, he was transferred to the Moscow Museum of Nobility and partially sold.  First, cattle and beet were raised on the estate, and in 1925 an orphanage was opened here.  In 1984, it was closed, and the building was handed over to organize a boarding house, which never took place.  Currently, the palace is gradually being destroyed.  Traces of farm buildings can be found along the edges of the park, located near the Sturgeon River, on which, by the way, the city of Venev in the Tula region was built. </p><h2>  "Chinese village" </h2><p>  Attractions of ancient years - not the only thing that attracts tourists in this city.  Among modern places of interest, it is worth noting the "Chinese Village" - as the local hotel "Golden City" is called here.  The hotel and the entire surrounding area are made in traditional Chinese style.  The main building with a picturesque carved tower resembles a palace of the Ming era.  The three-level tower houses tea rooms.  The territory adjacent to the hotel welcomes visitors with colorful arbors, fountains, bridges, as well as interesting landscape design. </p>
