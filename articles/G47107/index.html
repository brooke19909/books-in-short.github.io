    <h2>  Founding of San Marino </h2><p>  The state, which today is called the "Republic of San Marino," was founded on a long-lived territory.  Archaeological excavations show that people settled here in the last millennium.  But the documented history of the country begins in 298, when, according to local legend, St. Marine, who fled from persecution, decided to retire from the world to Mount Titano.  The saint came from Dalmatia, where he was persecuted for his religious views.  He hired to work as a masons in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãRimini, and then looked for privacy to the mountain on which he hollowed out the cave as his cell.  Marino's righteous life began to attract pilgrims to him, and a community gathers around him, then a monastery is organized, which in the country is considered the starting point of history and the source of the name of the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is documentary evidence that in the 6th century there was an autonomous monastery.  For 7 centuries, he experienced raids of different tribes: Saracens, Magyars, but retains its independence.  This is facilitated by an extremely convenient location for defense, in addition, the monks constantly worked on the defense capabilities of their monastery, they built fortress walls, made ramparts. </p>

    <h2>  Geography </h2><p>  Today, the Republic of San Marino is surrounded by the state of Italy.  It is located on the southwestern slope of the Monte Titano massif.  80% of the country is mountains.  Monte Titano has three peaks, each of which has long been inhabited.  The foothill plain of the Apennines is suitable for agriculture and has a subtropical, Mediterranean climate.  Winter in San Marino is quite cold, especially February, when the temperature reaches zero.  Summer is mild, the heat is in August-September.  In the mountainous parts it is always cooler than on the plain.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe country is about 60 square meters.  km  San Marino is a republic living in rather harsh conditions.  Life in the mountainous region is not easy, but it allowed local residents to develop a special character and create a unique culture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Gradually, the monastery buys adjacent land from peasants and expands its holdings.  An independent state appears, which is constantly under threat of absorption by stronger and larger countries.  In the 13th century, San Marino became involved in the confrontation between gibellines and Guelphs, taking the side of the former, the country aroused the wrath and curse of Pope Innocent Four. </p><p>  San Marino - a republic that constantly evoked the illusion of its easy capture, for several centuries was subjected to severe pressure and attempts to subjugate by papal Rome.  To withstand such attacks, the country had to show the wonders of diplomacy. </p><p>  In the first half of the 15th century, the republic entered into an alliance with Alphonse Fifth, which allowed it to retain Fiorentino's castle.  In 1462, Pope Pius II resorted to the help of San Marino in the war against Malatesta.  The successful outcome of such an alliance brought the republic power over three villages. </p><p>  In the 16th century, Rome made several attempts to tax San Marino, even resorted to force, but the republic maintained its independence.  In 1543, the papal army, sent to seize the republic, got lost in the dense forests on Mount Monte Titano, this bloodless victory is still a public holiday in the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The 18th and 19th centuries passed in the same persistent struggle against external pressure.  But even Napoleon offered San Marino a friendly alliance.  The Congress of Vienna did not touch the tiny country.  The country's territory is becoming a place of refuge for political emigrants, the extradition of which the government did not allow and zealously defended themselves from attempts to take them by force.  The republic was able to stand in its sovereignty when trying to include it in the composition of its possessions by Pope Pius the Ninth and with the <span>unification of Italy</span> in the 1860s.  During world wars, San Marino remained neutral, although it was not easy. </p><p>  In World War II, the country was mistakenly bombed by British aircraft in 1944.  In July of the same year, German troops were able to briefly occupy the territory of the republic, the British help arriving in time helped to expel the invaders.  After that, the country manages to maintain its independence to the present. </p>

    <h2>  Culture </h2><p>  Residents of the country proudly declare that the Republic of San Marino is the smallest state in the world, and this awareness is the basis of their attitude.  Here they carefully preserve national traditions and self-identity, although the influence of the surrounding state of Italy is extremely great. </p><p>  The main value of the people is the family.  Weddings, christening of children are very magnificent here, the statistics of divorces is very low.  Residents of the dwarf state perfectly understand how important relatives are in the fight against an aggressive outside world, so the feeling of unity is very high here.  The country's chamberness makes it possible to turn national holidays into an almost universal feast; here tables are laid in the length of the streets, for which all residents sit. </p><p>  There are a lot of national festivals that originate in ancient Roman history.  The Festival of the Middle Ages in July becomes a nationwide celebration: people dress up, dance, go on processions, prepare national dishes.  To understand the essence of the culture of this state, it is worth remembering which country the Republic of San Marino - Italy is located in.  Therefore, the culture is extremely similar to the culture of a powerful neighbor, it is only seasoned with notes of great pride in their country. </p>

    <h2>  Republic today </h2><p>  Considering the state structure of the country, one may ask: Is San Marino a republic or a monarchy?  The answer is surprising: San Marino is the oldest republic in the world.  Even during the collapse of ancient Rome, this territory began to be governed by an elected regent, and this continues to this day.  How did this miniature country manage to maintain its social structure surrounded by such powerful states with monarchical rule that tried to capture all the territories around?  The riddle.  But today, the country is ruled by two regents elected for six months.  Given the number of inhabitants of the country (32 thousand people), it can be assumed that almost every person has a chance to visit the regent once in a lifetime. </p><p>  San Marino is a member of the European Union, but has the right to issue a number of euro coins with its own symbols.  The country's economy is mainly provided by financial sectors: banks, insurance, trade.  An important industry is tourism.  Over 3 million people come here every year.  The country has about 30 settlements, the largest is the city of Serravalle, about 10 thousand people live in it.  The official language of San Marino is Italian.  To visit you need to get a Schengen visa, there is no airport in the country, the nearest air harbors are in Italy, for example, in Rimini. </p>

Once upon a time on Mount Monte Titano there were three circles of fortress walls, which began to be built in the 10th century.  Today, some of the belts have not been preserved, but there are defensive walls around the peaks.  Monte Titano mountain has three peaks, on each of them there are defensive towers and fortress walls.  Rocca Guaita (the first tower) appeared in the 11th century, the fortress surrounding it consists of two rows of fortress walls, a bell tower, and watchtowers. </p><p>  Today the fortress can be inspected; magnificent views of the plain open from its walls.  Castello de Cesta - the second tower - was built in the 13th century on the highest peak of the mountain.  The fortress is very well preserved, the spirit of the Middle Ages reigns here, and a museum of ancient weapons is also located on the territory.  The third peak is decorated with Montale fortress, erected in the early 14th century.  You can see this attraction only from the outside. </p>
