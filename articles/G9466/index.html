    <p>  Our country is very large.  And each region has its own number, which is marked on car signs.  If you have a question about 51 regions, where it is, we answer accurately and confidently - this is the <span>Murmansk region.</span> </p><h2>  Where are 51 regions located? </h2><p>  A strong and persistent city with a courageous character.  One of the warmest cities beyond the Arctic Circle.  It is washed by Murmansk by the Kola Bay and the Barents Sea.  Here, as in any city located in the north of the country, there is a polar night and a <span>polar day.</span>  Their duration is 42 and 50 days, respectively.  It is quite interesting to watch the sun returning to the city, especially to people who are not permanent residents of the North.  Starting from a few minutes and gradually increasing its presence, sunlight makes the city happy.  Now, if someone asks which region is 51, you know the answer. </p><h2>  History of the founding of the city </h2><p>  In the distant 1916, the port city of Murmansk was founded.  Due to its strategic position, it developed very rapidly, and soon the first railway appeared here.  For 20 kilometers the city stretched along the bay.  It is worth noting that only a few times in the history of the local people remember that the <span>Kola Bay was</span> covered with ice.  Thanks to the warm currents, the water here almost never freezes, which allows shipping all year round.  Borders Murmansk with Finland and Norway.  Such a neighborhood allows you to trade in fish.  In addition, there is a navy, whose task is to protect the <span>state border.</span>  It is officially established that Murmansk is 51 regions of Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  If you come to Murmansk, be prepared for weather surprises.  It is simply impossible to make a long forecast here.  And if, early in the morning, leaving the house, you squint at the gentle sun, this does not mean at all that returning in the evening will be just as warm and joyful.  If we consider the multiple cities of the Russian North, then Murmansk is by far the warmest.  In winter, the temperature ranges from -10 to -25 degrees Celsius.  Polar night is much worse than winter frosts.  Quite depressing, it acts on local residents who practically fall asleep on the go.  And even the opportunity to contemplate the <span>northern lights</span> does not decorate life, but only suggests that the sun does not look out very soon.  In the spring and autumn, Murmansk is beautiful.  The riot of colors and many shades, of course, delight the eyes of local residents and visitors.  If someone has a question about 51 regions - which region is this, feel free to answer - one where it is very cold! </p>

    <h2>  Ecology of Murmansk </h2><p>  The environmental situation remains rather difficult.  Multiple water bodies require professional cleaning.  If we talk about the Kola Bay, then the situation here is even worse.  No one knows how many wrecks are at its bottom.  This could threaten the city with a natural disaster.  Flora here also does not shine with diversity, but this is understandable.  Few plants can withstand constant cold and lack of sun.  Having seen 51 regions on the car number, ‚ÄúWhere is it?‚Äù  is the first question that arises.  But now you know that this is Murmansk. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Population 51 regions </h2><p>  Throughout the history of its existence, the city managed to survive both the influx and the departure of the population.  Everything is very natural.  Before the foundation of the North Sea Fleet, the population of the city was about 1000 people.  With the development of the port, people came here, but in the 90s the outflow of residents to warmer cities began.  And this is natural.  The situation with the education and personal development of youth remains difficult.  <span>The younger generation</span> seeks to move closer to the capital.  And it will definitely answer correctly, if you ask 51 regions, which city. </p><p>  Over the past 12 years, more than 12,000 people have left the city, a very impressive figure.  Although local authorities have noted an increase in fertility, this will entail problems in the form of a lack of places for children in kindergartens and schools. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  Basically, the cities that are in the north of the country are not rich in attractions.  But this is clearly not about Murmansk.  There is always something to admire, despite the frost.  Of course, the most common entertainment is skiing and snowboarding.  If you are a fan of these sports, then visit 51 regions of Russia.  Here you have at your disposal the North and South slopes, and for those who are uncertainly skiing, an instructor will kindly provide their services.  Naturally, at an additional cost.  Children who can easily ride on snow-covered hills on the so-called ‚Äúcheesecakes‚Äù will not get bored here.  It is not only very fun and exciting, but also safe.  Having plenty of walking and rolling, you can have a delicious lunch at the local cafes, which are located on the top.  Region 51 offers a lot of interesting things. Murmansk is able to surprise and amaze with its beauty. </p>

    <p>  It will be quite interesting to visit the iron giant, which is another local attraction.  We are talking about the icebreaker "Lenin", which welcomes its guests to the port.  A whole storm of emotions is caused by an excursion to the world's first ship, which was equipped with a nuclear undercarriage.  Do not think that this will interest only men.  Both women and especially children will find here something that will be interesting to them.  You will no longer have a question about 51 regions - which city, if you visit it and see all its interesting corners. </p><p>  There is a memorial monument in Murmansk, which is part of the complex "Defenders of the Arctic during the Great Patriotic War."  This is a 36-meter statue of a soldier, which can be seen from almost any part of the city.  Locals call her "Alyosha". </p>

An anchor is located not far from Semenovskoye Lake, a capsule with sea water and a submarine cabin, which died in peacetime, are laid under it.  A lot of military monuments are presented to tourists by 51 regions, where this is of particular importance. </p>

    <p>  If you are interested in the detailed history of the development of the hero city, you should definitely visit the museum of local lore.  The local guide will be happy to tell you the fascinating history of the port, without missing the slightest detail. </p><h2>  51 regions - a city beyond the Arctic Circle </h2><p>  Even though Murmansk is located quite far beyond the Arctic Circle, it can be called bright and colorful.  He is not like the other faceless cities of the north, which are mired in the routine of everyday life.  Perhaps it is not as beautiful as the fashionable foreign resorts, but it feels a strong character.  It‚Äôs worth to come here because, having visited at least once a city with difficult climatic conditions, where the inhabitants love it very much, you will certainly begin to appreciate everything that nature has given.  Daily sunrises and sunsets, the <span>change of seasons</span> and bright colors that color our wonderful world. </p>
