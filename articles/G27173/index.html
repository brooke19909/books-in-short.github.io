Of course, in many respects its resorts are inferior to Thai, but every year the tourism industry is becoming more developed here, and the Russians are no longer afraid to go here even with young children.  Of the many beautiful places in Vietnam, our compatriots most often choose Nha Trang.  This city is considered one of the most developed, here you can find a lot of interesting activities and inexpensive hotel complexes.  A distinctive feature of this resort is the fact that most hotels are located in high-rise buildings and do not have their own territory.  Therefore, when choosing a hotel for yourself, be sure to pay attention to this fact.  After all, often three-star complexes do not even have a pool.  However, the cost of living in them is extremely low and attractive for tourists.  The Bella Boutique Hotel 3 *, to which our today's article is devoted, can be safely attributed to this category.  Our compatriots are actively choosing it because of the low price and convenient location.  Therefore, today we will do a full review of Bella Boutique Hotel 3 * (Nha Trang) and discuss its pros and cons. </p>

    <h2>  General characteristics of the hotel </h2><p>  Bella Boutique Hotel 3 * is a new hotel complex, it was opened this year and does not yet have a large number of reviews on the Internet.  It positions itself as a complex that is ideal for families and tourists.  All categories of vacationers will be quite comfortable in the hotel due to its location in the city center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Bella Boutique Hotel 3 * (Vietnam) consists of one eight-story building.  For the convenience of guests, the residential unit is equipped with elevators.  The hotel rooms cannot please with an exclusive design, but all equipment and furniture are in working condition. </p><p>  The hotel complex has virtually no territory, which must be taken into account when going here.  Kids are not always interested in a hotel, so guests should carefully consider their leisure time. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Bella Boutique Hotel 3 * in Nha Trang is located almost in the city center.  Therefore, it is very convenient to get to various points of the resort and the beach from here.  A cataloged hotel is often described as a beachfront complex.  However, in fact, the beach area is across the street from the hotel.  This distance does not exceed hundreds of meters, but a busy road can create some difficulties for tourists with small children. </p><p>  Kamran Airport is located approximately forty kilometers from the hotel complex.  This distance can be covered in about one hour.  If you take into account the busy traffic and the number of traffic jams, then the travel time can stretch for two hours.  In some cases, it will be more convenient to order an individual transfer from the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  A few words about the beach area </h2><p>  Guests of Bella Boutique Hotel 3 * go to the municipal beach of the city.  The sandy strip stretches almost a kilometer and is clean.  Sunbeds and umbrellas are located here in large numbers, but you need to pay extra for them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Travelers who have already been to Vietnam say that in the daytime it is better not to be on the beach.  The sun during this period of time is very dangerous for the skin, so the largest number of vacationers gather on sun loungers after five in the evening. </p><p>  Near the beach there are a lot of cafes and restaurants.  More than half of them have a menu in Russian and prepare dishes familiar to the stomachs of our compatriots.  The average bill in a cafe usually does not exceed three hundred rubles, and you can often have a delicious dinner for one hundred and fifty rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  It is easy to assume that Bella Boutique Hotel 3 * will not please with its vast infrastructure.  After all, the hotel is located in a building without its own territory.  Of the variety that hoteliers usually offer their guests, the complex can please only a restaurant with sixty seats and a 24-hour reception. </p><p>  Reception staff practically do not speak Russian.  The English language with their pronunciation also acquires a lot of features, so get ready for some difficulties in communicating with the staff. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of Bella Boutique Hotel 3 * (Nha Trang), in the lobby you can change the currency and rent a cell in the left-luggage office.  Near the hotel there is a bicycle parking.  Lovers of this transport often use it, because in Vietnam most of the country's population prefers it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Service level </h2><p>  Do not forget that the hotel complex has only three stars.  Keep in mind that treshki in Turkey and Vietnam are significantly different from each other. In Asia, you will be provided with a much lower level of service and this should be taken into account when acquiring a ticket to this country. </p><p>  Wi-Fi is excellent in the lobby, but the signal level in the rooms is rather weak, so there are certain difficulties with the Internet. </p><p>  If you need to put your clothes in order, then contact the laundry.  Here, your clothes are quickly washed and stroked, so you do not have to worry about your appearance. </p>

    <h2>  How are children living at the hotel? </h2><p>  In Bella Boutique Hotel 3 * (Nha Trang) quite often come with children of different ages.  However, infrastructure for small guests is not here.  Usually, if necessary, the child can be provided with a highchair, and an extra bed can be installed in the room upon request. </p><p>  It is advisable to negotiate such nuances in advance, as Asian hotel employees prefer to know about the preferences of their guests before checking into their apartments. </p>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel building consists of eight floors, from reviews of Bella Boutique Hotel 3 * it becomes clear how small it is.  The hotel complex has only twenty-seven rooms.  All of them are equipped with the necessary equipment and a set of furniture, however, many tourists create a double impression of the apartments.  On the one hand, they are distinguished by cleanliness and novelty, but on the other, they leave a feeling of a certain limitation.  The rooms lack style and gloss, but this is the personal opinion of a certain group of guests. </p><p>  Each room has a TV, fridge, air conditioning and telephone.  If you plan to watch Russian programs in the evenings, then do not flatter yourself - you will be provided with only one channel.  Moreover, the signal quality does not always allow you to watch it with pleasure. </p>

    <h2>  Food concept </h2><p>  Most Vietnam hotels provide their guests with only included breakfast.  Bella Boutique Hotel 3 * does the same, vacationers and dinners go to nearby cafes.  Moreover, many note that the dishes in Vietnam are very tasty, but have their own specifics. </p><p>  Breakfast at the hotel does not differ in variety, but on the tables everything you need is presented in order not to remain hungry.  Typically, the restaurant serves several types of fruits and vegetables, noodles with spices, meat and seafood dishes, as well as cereals with milk and eggs.  We think that such a choice allows all categories of vacationers to get enough. </p><h2>  Cost of tours </h2><p>  Tours to this hotel complex are very affordable, so they are so popular with Russians.  For example, the average cost of a vacation for two for eleven nights will cost about seventy thousand rubles.  This price includes flights, accommodation and breakfast.  Most of our compatriots are planning a trip to Vietnam with great pleasure, given the similar costs. </p><h2>  About Check In </h2><p>  During the processing of documents upon check-in, the reception staff must take a deposit.  Usually in Asian hotels a certain amount of money serves them, but here you will need to leave your passport as a deposit. </p><p>  If you do not want to stay in a foreign country without documents, then copy your passport first.  In the event of problems, you will have copies of identification on hand. </p><h2>  Bella Boutique Hotel 3 *, Vietnam: reviews </h2><p>  What do people write about this hotel complex?  Unfortunately, finding this out is extremely difficult.  The fact is that the hotel was opened not so long ago, and therefore it has not yet managed to get a large number of comments from tourists.  Vouchers here are just starting to be bought up due to the approaching high season in Asia, but here reviews from travelers who visited the hotel are noticeably not enough. </p><p>  Of all the comments that we managed to find, we managed to highlight the pros and cons of this hotel.  Of the negative points, our compatriots noted the following points: </p><ul><li>  meager and monotonous breakfasts; </li><li>  lack of staff knowledge of languages; </li><li>  lack of pool; </li><li>  inconvenient location relative to the sea; </li><li>  slow staff. </li></ul><p>  The advantages of the hotel can be safely attributed: </p><ul><li>  cleanliness in the complex; </li><li>  quality housekeeping; </li><li>  delicious dishes prepared by the restaurant chefs; </li><li>  a large number of restaurants and cafes near the hotel; </li><li>  good location relative to the city center; </li><li>  desire to cater to the needs of Russian tourists. </li></ul><p>  If we talk about the recommendations, then our compatriots themselves have not figured out how much the hotel is suitable for recreation.  Many of those who have already been here immediately after the opening wish to purchase a tour one more time in order to conduct a comparative analysis.  Therefore, it is not known what reviews the complex will receive in the current season. </p><p>  However, coming to this hotel is still worth it.  After all, for a small price you get access to a magnificent beach, the sea and you can learn Vietnamese culture.  In addition, there is a special group of tourists who take great pleasure staying in new hotels.  If you are one of them, then feel free to get a ticket and go to Nha Trang.  This resort is fraught with many secrets and mysteries that can be revealed only by going on an exciting journey. </p>
