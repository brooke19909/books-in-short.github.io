This island is the largest and most hospitable in the whole Canary archipelago.  Tourists are primarily attracted by a huge variety of entertainment for every taste.  Those who are looking for peace and quiet will also like it (they better get better at the resort of Ten Bel, Costa del Silencio beach, which translates from Spanish as “shore of silence” and where cozy family budget hotels, for example, Alborada Beach Club 3, are located *), and those who came here for vivid impressions and noisy entertainments (for this resorts Costa Adeje and Las Americas are best suited).  The weather in Tenerife, believe me, will help to make you remember them warm and affectionate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alborada beach club" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1475111.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  The island also attracts all lovers of water sports and underwater travels.  And finally, people come here with the goal of healing both the body and the soul.  After all, the <span>black sand,</span> which covers almost all the beaches on the island (with the exception of artificially created “white” beaches, the sand of which was specially brought to Tenerife from the Sahara desert) is of volcanic origin and is healing.  With its help, various diseases of the musculoskeletal, nervous system, infertility and a number of other gynecological problems are cured.  Some tourists come here just for this, and they usually like to stay in inexpensive but quite comfortable hotels such as Alborada Beach Club. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="], alborada beach club 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1475114.jpg" width="600"></div>

And all thanks to the fact that many tropical trees are in bloom year-round.  And the air temperature during the year fluctuates between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius.  In a word, it is neither hot nor cold.  Why not heaven in the open air and among the turquoise waters of the ocean.  Some of the beaches on the island are very windy, and they naturally attract windsurfers from around the world.  And next to them are quiet lagoons, and their idyllic picture, of course, like a magnet attracts all lovers of romance: couples in love, newlyweds, youth companies.  Due to this bifurcation, the island is also called “two-faced”.  The nature of the northern and southern parts is very different.  In the south it is hot and sunny, there is very little greenery, in the north there are lushly blooming gardens, humid air and winds.  Every year, the island's international airport receives, without exaggeration, millions of tourists who come here in anticipation of a truly paradise holiday.  According to statistics, Tenerife is the most visited island of Canary.  All year round, all hotels in all resorts operate at full load, and the most popular are budget hotels, for example, the same Alborada Beach Club 3 * hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in tenerife" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1475113.jpg" width="600"></div>

Their favorite resorts are Las Americas, Playa Paraiso, Los Cristianos, and Ten Belle.  It is at the junction of the latter with the “shore of silence” - the Costa del Silencio - the hotel complex Alborada Beach Club.  The beach at the club, and in the entire resort village is non-standard.  Rather, this is not even a beach, but a territory adjacent to a giant pool (more than 3000 square meters) with sea water.  Moreover, it is free only for guests of the Elborada, Marazhilla and Primavera hotel.  All other tourists pay 6 euros for using the pool.  After all, the coast in this part of the island is very high, and in order to go down to the sea, you need to make a lot of effort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alborada beach club beach" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1475108.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Resort Ten Bel </h2><p>  The vast majority of hotels in this resort, like the Alborada Beach Club, are three-star.  They can not be called fashionable, but they are quite comfortable, and the tourists who relax here, for the most part, respond to them more than positively.  Of course, if you came to Tenerife to have a full meal, then this place will certainly seem boring and monotonous to you.  Despite the 3 * category, most of the resort hotels operate according to the all-inclusive concept, which has both its pros and cons.  On the one hand, when you are in a hotel, you can forget about any expenses for food and drinks, on the other hand, in case of dissatisfaction with the restaurant menu, you risk being hungry, or you will have to go to the hotel every time for food any restaurants.  In this case, you will spend double the price of food, which is also completely impractical and even stupid. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  We leave for the hotel "Elborada Beach Club": how to get there? </h2><p>  There are two airports on the island - Northern (domestic), which connects it with mainland Spain and other islands of the archipelago;  and South (international).  It is here that charter flights from the Russian Federation are carried out.  The flight time from the Russian capital to Tenerife is 7 hours if you fly without a transfer.  Direct flights are operated only from Moscow, while residents of other Russian cities use flights that interrupt their flight at least once and stop either in Madrid or in Barcelona.  Most hotels offer their future guests a transfer from the airport to the hotel.  And it’s not at all necessary that this is a luxury hotel.  If this is important to you, then choose Alborada Beach Club.  The service here has been up to the mark since the day it was founded, although we are aware that this is not something we can meet in a 4, and even more so a 5-star hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alborada beach club service" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1475106.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  As already noted, the weather in Tenerife is simply magnificent.  All year round it is warm and sunny, although it often rains in the north, and therefore the air is wetter.  In the southern part, everything is different.  It is dry, there is very little rainfall, and even in summer it is even very hot.  The most comfortable month on both coasts is September.  That is why it is during this period that it is very difficult to find a free room even in a place like the three-star Alborada Beach Club Hotel (Tenerife / Canary Islands).  January is considered the coolest month.  So, if you want to enjoy a beach holiday during the winter holidays, Tenerife is not the best option.  By the way, sometimes it can even snow in the mountains.  Although ski resorts have never been here. </p><h2>  “Elborada Beach Club” </h2><p>  We will begin the description of the Alborada Beach Club 3 * hotel with the fact that until recently it was called differently, namely Ten-Bel Alborada Aparathotel.  He was part of the Tel-Bel hotel chain.  In 2013, the hotel administration decided to update both the interior and technical capabilities.  The hotel complex consists of 8 buildings, in which almost 300 apartments are located.  As already noted, instead of the beach, the hotel has a swimming pool with an area of ​​almost 4 thousand square meters.  There is a beach, of course, but to get to it you need to overcome a considerable descent.  The view from most of the windows or balconies of the rooms is stunning: they look at the vast expanses of the Atlantic Ocean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alborada beach club room description" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1475110.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  This apartment hotel is located in the southernmost point of the island, as you already know, at the junction of two magnificent resorts: Ten Bel and Costa del Silencio.  The distance from the Rhine Sofia Airport to the complex is no more than 10 kilometers.  The pool-beach can be reached in just 4 minutes.  In 50-meter accessibility you can find shops and restaurants, clubs, cafes.  A bus stop is also very close, 1 kilometer away.  Here you can "catch" a taxi that will take you to the right address at a very reasonable price.  To the delight of all lovers of the royal game of golf, a golf club is located 6 km from the Alborada Beach Club. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The Alborada Beach Club hotel complex consists of 8 buildings, in which there are 395 apartments.  In terms of comfort, interior, furnishings and equipment, they are all almost the same.  However, of the total number of rooms, 5 are two-room and have an area of ​​115 square meters.  meters.  They are intended for a family stay, the rest are one-room.  There is another difference - this is the view from the window.  Of course, most tourists prefer to live in rooms with views of the ocean, rather than the courtyard.  The hotel also has accommodations specially equipped for people with disabilities.  By the way, to the delight of dog breeders, animals can be accommodated at a surcharge. </p><h2>  Alborada Beach Club: room description </h2><p>  All apartments in the hotel are spacious and bright.  The vast majority are one-room, and only 5 are two-room.  They are perfect for couples with children or for friends.  All rooms, except those located on the ground floor, have balconies-terraces with outdoor furniture, and there is also a kitchen equipped with a fridge, microwave, tea and coffee making facilities.  The bedrooms have beds, a table, bedside tables, a wardrobe, a TV with satellite channels (there are no Russian programs), and there is also a safe that you can use if you pay a certain amount for the reception.  Tourists can call anywhere in the world by direct dial telephone.  The bath room is unremarkable.  There is a shower, towels, toiletries.  Linen is changed every week, towels can be changed upon request, and cleaning should be done daily.  This is exactly what is written in promotional materials about the Alborada Beach Club.  The reviews of tourists, however, speak about something completely different: linen and towels may not change at all, if you do not ask, the same applies to cleaning.  They come, pick up garbage from the basket and do not even dust the dust. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  As noted, the Alborada Beach Club Hotel operates an all-inclusive restaurant.  This means that the cost of three meals a day, snacks and drinks at any time of the day is included in the price.  Tourists no longer need to pay for their orders and generally think about food.  However, some of them, who have already rested in this hotel, advise to abandon this concept, since the cuisine in “Elborada Beach” is not diverse and very annoying.  However, in fact, not everything is so bad, just quite often chicken dishes are served, and the side dish is repeated all the time.  And do not forget that this is a buffet, and you can always combine dishes at your own discretion.  Nevertheless, no one will remain hungry.  Many people like snacks available at the pool bar, which also has free Wi-Fi.  There is also a vending machine for drinks on site. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alborada beach club restaurant" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1475109.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel service </h2><p>  The territory of Alborada Beach Club is quite large, and tourists often prefer to spend time in the hotel and not go beyond it.  There is a supermarket where you can have everything you need if you decide to cook in your own room.  The hotel also has a currency exchange office, a lobby with comfortable upholstered furniture.  For both children and adults, entertaining animation program shows are organized.  At Alborada Beach Club, the pool is more like a giant artificial pond with sea water.  He has a paddling pool for kids.  Next to it there is the same large sun terrace with sun loungers and umbrellas and magnificent views of the vast expanses of the ocean.  The hotel has a diving school.  Training takes place first in the pool, and then students are allowed to dive into the ocean.  From sports activities there are tennis courts, ping pong, mini golf, </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  As already noted, the feedback from tourists who have already had time to relax at the Alborada hotel is not always positive.  Despite the fact that it was restored in 2013, the furniture in the rooms, according to guest reviews, is very old and recalls the 60s.  However, this can be taken from the other side: perhaps the hotel’s interior was created in a retro style, and then antique furniture is quite appropriate.  However, tourists also complain about groomed, concrete corridors, or the presence of rodents, insects and even reptiles in the hotel.  As already noted, food also does not always satisfy the needs of tourists.  As for the pluses, this is an amazing view from the windows, friendly staff, as well as the opportunity to take an underwater trip, which is taught by skillful professional divers. </p>
