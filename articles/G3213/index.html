Of course, on its front side.  In the event that someone doubts, we will clarify: convex figures on the front side, divided into four groups of four - this is it.  By the way, they can be either embossed (embossed, as experts say), or simply printed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bankcard number" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/62108.jpg" width="397"></div><br><br>  It should be noted that the sixteen-digit number of <span>a</span> Visa <span>bank card is</span> characteristic not only for it, but also for the plastic of the MasterCard system.  But <span>American Express</span> has a 15-digit mark.  If someone has been using banking IPCs (international payment cards) for a long time, then he probably remembers that before Visa was equipped with a thirteen-digit number.  But today you can meet such instances infrequently. <br><br>  Regardless of the number of positions that this attribute is represented, it is unique. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bank card numbers" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/62104.jpg" width="500"></div>  With finding we figured out.  Now let's talk about what do credit card numbers mean?  We will consider the classic version, when a sequence of numbers is applied on the front of the IPC in the form XXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The first X shows which payment system the plastic belongs to (three - American Express, four and five - Visa and MasterCard, respectively); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Second, third and fourth X - identifier of the issuer (organization that issued the card).  It is generated in accordance with a special algorithm; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The fifth and sixth X specify the type of IPC, as well as the bank by which it was issued; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The seventh and eighth X reflect the affiliation of plastic to the specific program within which it was produced; <br>  ‚Ä¢ From the ninth to the fifteenth X - this is the number of the bank card.  But it is formed not in order, but again consistent with a special algorithm.  Often, the number of the branch or branch issuing the IPC, the presence or absence of the chip, and the currency of the account are encrypted in it. <br><br>  As for the sixteenth X, it is a check number, which should result from all sorts of manipulations (mathematical operations) committed with the participation of the first fifteen. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="visa card number" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/62105.jpg" width="331"></div>  Incidentally, the set of Xs from the first to the sixth is BIN.  In simple terms, BIN is the identifier of the issuer, that is, the bank.  It is decrypted accordingly: bank <span>identification number.</span> <br><br>  Sometimes the bank manager forgets to tell the client that the bank card number and card account are two big differences.  Firstly, the difference is in the number of characters.  In the first case there are sixteen, and in the second twenty.  What is characteristic, when the plastic is lost, the client receives a new one, which, of course, has a new bank card number.  As for the card account, not only is it impossible to lose it, it also remains unchanged as long as it is needed. <br><br>  Do we need to memorize or record a sequence of numbers that we have been talking about all this time?  It‚Äôs best to write a combination to your organizer, but don‚Äôt indicate what it is.  In general, try not to get it to third parties, because one day you can find out that they paid it, for example, on the Internet.  You may need sixteen digits to pass through identification during dialing into the call center of your bank.
