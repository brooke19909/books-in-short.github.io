    <p>  However, before you think about it, determine what exactly you are going to do, what kind of product or service to produce, and most importantly - who needs this product or service.  In other words, find out your target audience.  There are two options for the development of further events: either you start to produce something unique that no one has thought of before, or look for where you can get money and sell what is already being sold.  It will not be difficult to assess the situation regarding the current labor supply; it is necessary to find out who produces where and where, at what price they sell. </p><p>  What are the options for <span>where to get money</span> for starting a business?  There are not so many of them, consider all of them in more detail: </p><ol><li>  <span>Bank lending.</span>  It is possible that part of the money will have to be borrowed from the bank.  In this case, you will need to prove that the project <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where can I get the money?" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10548/93104.jpg" width="364"></div>  potentially successful, that the profit received will be enough to pay off current expenses and make payments to the bank.  It is possible that it will be necessary to provide collateral property, which can be real or <span>movable property,</span> as well as a business project itself. </li><li>  Co-investors.  It is also a double edged sword.  Most likely, you will receive money on more attractive terms than in a bank.  On the other hand, you need to be mentally prepared for the fact that profits will have to be shared with partners.  In addition, there is an opinion that the best way to lose friends is to open a business with them.  Naturally, everything is individual in life, but there is something to think about. </li><li>  State programs to support small and medium-sized businesses.  This is the one option where you can‚Äôt get the money quickly.  As in the case of bank loans, here you will have to answer a lot of questions and prove that your business is worthwhile.  It is better to prepare for such "conversations" in advance, and you will have to operate with specific numbers. </li><li>  Own funds that were accumulated earlier.  Yes, piggy banks, previously opened deposits, etc. - this is most likely not the place to get money for starting a business. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to get money quickly" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10548/93102.jpg" width="500"></div>  number, but neglect such sources is also not worth it. </li></ol><p>  What else do you need to know?  Regardless of what activities you plan to engage in, you need to draw up a business plan for at least 2-3 years.  Describe the first of them in as much detail as possible, down to the smallest detail, the next two in general terms.  This will help to determine the budget of your event as accurately as possible, where to get money for starting a business and possible income.  Based on the information received, it is already possible to conclude whether the game is worth the candle, and if so, outline a minimum program for your actions. </p>
