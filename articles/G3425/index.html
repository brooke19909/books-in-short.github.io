  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the uniqueness of some 1924 coins. The cost of rare and ordinary coins</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If in Soviet times, the numismatists' dreams were limited to coins minted in tsarist Russia, the range of interests of modern coin collectors has expanded significantly. </p><p>  At numismatic auctions today you can find coins from the beginning of the Soviet era, for example, 1924.  The cost of coins depends primarily on how they are preserved.  The circulation and technical flaws are also taken into account, thanks to which the coin stands out against the background of its "relatives". </p><h2>  Silver fifty dollars of 1924.  Coin value </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.coinshome.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coin one fifty kopeck 1924 cost" class="if uuid-2745748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2745748.jpg"></div><p>  This coin was made at several mints from silver of 900 tests.  Her weight is about 10 grams.  The cost of a standard coin at a numismatic auction ranges from 10 to 15 dollars (from 678 to 1000 rubles). </p><p>  The ‚ÄúOne fifty dollars‚Äù coin of 1924 belongs to the category of rare ones, the cost of which at one of the numismatic auctions rose to 1,500 dollars or 101,000 rubles.  It was minted at the Leningrad Mint.  The coin became unique due to the non-standard inscription on the edge. </p><p>  Silver fifty rubles, minted in Leningrad in 1924, were marked by the initials of Pyotr Latyshev (‚ÄúP.L.‚Äù).  Coins made in the English Mint were the bearers of the initials of Thomas Ross (‚ÄúT.R.‚Äù). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To rare coins of 1924, the value of which is determined by their small number, numismatists rank fifty dollars, on whose edge the initials ‚ÄúF.R.‚Äù were carved  (Thomas Ross). </p><h2>  The first Soviet coins </h2><p>  Own coins first appeared in the everyday life of citizens of post-revolutionary Russia in 1921.  At first, almost all of them were minted in silver.  The year 1924 was the starting point for the mass production of coins from copper.  A new bargaining chip appeared - penny, as well as two-, three- and five-penny copper coins. </p><div class="photo" data-original="auction.violity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1924 coin value" class="if uuid-2745746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2745746.jpg"></div><p>  Modern numismatists pay special attention to a two-kopeyn coin, which was minted in the period from 1924 to 1925 in Petrograd.  The thickness of this copper coin is 2 millimeters.  Its diameter is 23.88 millimeters and its weight is 6.55 grams.  It is not known for certain exactly what circulation it was minted.  Modern numismatists are ready to pay for this money from 250 to 5050 rubles.  The exact value of a coin depends on its appearance and degree of preservation.  For example, for a two-kopeck coin with a corrugated edge and vertical notches, no one will pay more than 250 rubles. </p><p>  A more valuable instance is a coin with a smooth edge.  For this rather rare money, collectors are ready to pay about 3,000 rubles.  But this, as it turned out, is far from the limit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The price of the most expensive two-kopeck coin is 10 thousand US dollars or 678 thousand rubles.  It turns out that in 1924 a certain batch of bronze ‚ÄúTwo cents‚Äù was minted, as they say, for trial.  Such a coin is today considered a real rarity.  She weighs almost six grams. </p><h2>  How much is a manufacturing defect? </h2><p>  The most expensive defective ‚Äúkopeck piece‚Äù to date is the one that was printed in 1924 using blanks for a coin worth one kopek.  In those days, annoying mistakes like this one were called manufacturing defects.  Nobody needed a coin with non-standard parameters - diameter, weight and thickness (not to mention that the stamp was wider than the metal base). </p><p>  Today, the defective Two Copecks of 1924 are estimated by numismatists at 18 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  "One penny" of 1924.  Coin value at auctions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="collectwith.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coin 1 kopeck 1924 cost" class="if uuid-2745749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2745749.jpg"></div><p>  Another leader of numismatic trading is a penny minted from copper in 1924 and put into circulation in the same year.  It weighs a little more than three grams.  The thickness of the coin is 1.2 millimeters. </p><p>  A coin with a ribbed edge is classified as especially expensive, for the manufacture of an obverse a stamp of 20 kopecks was used in 1924. It is also known that the inscription "USSR" is stretched vertically on the obverse of a unique coin, and the state emblem is entwined with seven turns of tape. </p><p>  The approximate cost of the One Kopek coin of 1924 is 83,334 rubles.  The exact price of similar lots put up at numismatic auctions may be higher or lower than the specified amount.  It all depends on the state of the coin and the name of the mint that minted it. </p><p>  The most expensive penny of 1924 is the so-called trial coin ‚ÄúOne penny‚Äù, minted from aluminum.  The owner of this money, if he wants to sell it at a numismatic auction, can get rich at least 240 thousand rubles.  If the coin is in good condition, its price can reach 243 537 rubles. </p>
