    <p>  In 2014, a more modern model appeared on the market <span>technically</span> with the prefix Mark II, but the manufacturer did not stop there, and a few months later a new gadget was announced - the Canon G7X camera, which laid the foundation for the release of one of the most successful compacts of the last years with improved optics. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  First of all, the camera is designed for those people who need a photo assistant for every day, who are ready to give a tidy sum for a new gadget comparable to the price of a modern flagship smartphone.  Nevertheless, the Canon G7X can attract the attention of advanced photographers who already own serious equipment with a set of optics, since the gadget allows you to seamlessly move from place to place without dragging along a pile of useful, but extremely heavy equipment. </p><p>  It can also be noted that the new camera is ideal for travelers and people who do not want to attract too much attention.  One of the attractive features of the gadget is the possibility of self-portrait shooting due to a well-designed screen that rotates 180 degrees along the vertical axis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design and ergonomics </h2><p>  Digital cameras of the previous generation G1X have something in common with the new style of the G7, and somewhere even the new gadget is similar to the Sony RX100 model.  By its appearance, the camera resembles a neat block of black metal mixed with plastic in facing places - a little brutal, but very impressive, given the small dimensions of the gadget. </p>

    <p>  The camera is not burdened with some riotous variety of design ideas, but it benefits her: the elementary laws of ergonomics are fully observed.  The build quality of the device complies with the brand‚Äôs standards - everything was done well, reliably and without complaints, all the more so since numerous positive reviews prove once again that the Canon is the standard of photographic equipment in any segment. </p><p>  Canon Powershot G7X weighs nearly 300 grams with dimensions of 103x60x40 mm, so the gadget can be called one of the most compact in its class.  The camera weighs quite well, but it is quite suitable for carrying in your pocket.  The grip is classic, like all ‚Äúsoap dishes‚Äù, there are no protrusions on the front, but there is a slight finger rest on the back of the gadget. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Functional elements </h2><p>  On the front of the <span>Canon G7X</span> is a large lens with a telescope and a control dial.  There are also autofocus and backlight lamps for the main controls.  The right side of the camera is reserved for interfaces (USB-mini and micro-HDMI), and then comes the button that activates wireless protocols.  The left side of the gadget is equipped with a convenient lever that raises the main flash if necessary. </p>

    <p>  Above are: a stereo microphone, a power button, a speaker, a flash mechanism, a zoom rocker and a selector to change the exposure and operating modes of the Canon G7X.  Owners do not always leave feedback on the location of functional elements in a positive way, but mostly people who switched to the Canon technology from Sony have problems with management, the rest of the users quickly learn without any problems. </p><p>  The lower part of the camera is reserved for the battery compartment and memory card, here is the NFC pad.  On the back of the gadget is a fairly large navigation screen, a little to the right - <span>function keys</span> for more fine-tuning the camera. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  The Canon G7X camera continues to support the established trend in the photo market for the use of analog selectors with extensive functionality even on such small devices.  The model is equipped with two convenient selector wheels that are located on the lens and on the back of the control panel, the latter having a set of additional keys, even despite the small size of the entire camera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Owners of the gadget do not complain about functional management, especially since the model is devoid of the typical problems that most compacts suffer from - "I can‚Äôt press the small button with my thumb."  Three keys on the back can be reprogrammed to fit your needs and specific situation, which is also very convenient. </p><p>  If you compare the Canon G7X with the first generation Mark II, then since then the interface has not changed at all, but maybe it‚Äôs for the better - why change what works fine so far.  There is a menu with quick access to the main settings in the familiar black-and-white-orange style.  The items look minimalistic, but this does not interfere with the full use of touch support for the display. </p><h2>  Software interface </h2><p>  The main functional menu has three subsections: ‚ÄúMy menu‚Äù, camera settings and shooting settings.  Separately, it is worth noting the fact that there is no duplication of menu items, which is very pleased users who switched from Sony models to Canon G7X.  The instructions for working with the menu and all existing ‚Äúgadgets‚Äù have been completed in more than detail, therefore, after careful review, you can get a multifunctional and compact photo assistant for any application. </p>

    <p>  In the ‚Äúlive‚Äù viewing mode, the screen displays the main parameters for high-quality capture: a histogram, a grid and a virtual horizon (the model is equipped with a gyroscope).  Autofocus point can be changed using touch control. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Canon G7X is equipped with a 3-inch LCD screen with a resolution of one million dots.  The model is not equipped with a complete viewfinder, so you have to endorse on the screen, since it is more than suitable for this - bright, with excellent viewing angles, natural colors and protection from direct sunlight. </p><p>  The screen is equipped with an original hinge, which allows you to adjust it within 180 degrees vertically.  This innovation was appreciated by many fans to take self-portraits.  There were no technical problems with the functionality of the hinge in user reviews, so we can say that the model is equipped with a successful version of the swivel mechanism. </p><h2>  Canon G7X Functionality </h2><p>  A review of camera performance should start with the new latest-generation DIGIC 6 processor, which feels great in conjunction with a standard 1.0 sensor (13.2 x 8.8 mm), showing a resolution of 20.3 megapixels.  The sensor, which is used in the Canon models, has proven itself in such brands as Sony and Panasonic in the RX100 and FZ1000 ranges. </p>

    <p>  There are no complaints about the speed of the new gadget, unlike the same G1X: everything turns on quickly, pictures are processed in one second for JPEG format.  For shooting in RAW, the time significantly increases, but the quality of the photo improves.  The buffer can contain up to six hundred <span>JPEG</span> images in the exchanger and a little less for RAW. </p><p>  Despite the relatively small sensor, autofocus works as it should - the surface is completely covered by a contrast system with 31 points.  Work in most scenes is pretty fast, and only a few profiles, judging by user reviews, have certain difficulties with fixing and fidgeting. </p><p>  Shooting at one point is slightly inferior in accuracy, so you have to control the result during operation, but these are isolated cases for auto mode, otherwise the multi-point scheme copes with its task. </p><p>  There is also macro photography, where it is possible to take high-quality photographs of an object at a distance of 5 cm from the camera, subject to a wide-angle arrangement.  There is a focus bracketing mode - a different focus distance for three shots in a row. </p><p>  There is manual focusing with a rich functional range: a two- and four-fold increase in the focus area with illumination of the object in places of focus change (focus peaking) is an extremely useful and convenient feature of the model.  Many users in their reviews note that the switch to the front ring observation mode to auto focus when the manual is on is not successful, so you have to additionally aim the rear selector, but this can be corrected with the firmware that you will be provided with in any service where digital cameras are serviced and repaired. </p><p>  The camera is equipped with a built-in flash of a good level (for this segment).  The working area ranges from seven meters with wide-angle shooting, and in television mode up to four meters.  There is a function for blurring red eyes, and the additional flash works only in the external mode with the corresponding synchronization. </p><p>  The lens has an optical image stabilizer, which is surprisingly effective, and you can confidently shoot at a solid shutter speed starting from 1/13.  The shutter does not stand out for anything remarkable - it remained the same as in previous generations - electronic with a range of 250-2000 in manual mode. </p><p>  The main profiles for working with the camera have not changed: author, video, creative pictures and filters, P / A / S / M, plot, hybrid car and its modes.  Especially distinguished profile for hybrid auto shooting and creative shots.  The first mode can record video clips at the time of shooting (about seven seconds), allowing you to accompany your pictures with video entourage.  The function will surely appeal to travel enthusiasts and will be widely sought after by reporters. </p><p>  Creative profile allows you to process each shot with six different options using digital zoom, changing crop, adding retro style, chrome and other special effects.  Of course, professional photographers who are used to controlling every little thing when shooting, this mode may not be needed, but as an experiment and looking at the frame from an unusual angle, you should try this profile. </p>

    <p>  In profiles, you can find shooting in HDR mode, where the processing will be performed in a relief, bright or oil style.  There is a function of artificial blurring of the background or other individual objects, there is auto-correction of the dynamic range, darkened areas and other ways to design photos.  The only thing worth clarifying is that this is possible only for pictures taken in JPEG format, although craftsmen were able to adapt the model to other formats through amateur firmware, which can be installed both on your own and in any service where digital cameras are being repaired. </p><h2>  Wireless protocols </h2><p>  As befits modern cameras, the Canon model is equipped with Wi-Fi and NFC modules for mass consumers.  The specially developed CCW application (Canon Camera Window) is available for operating systems based on Android and iOS, allowing you to control the gadget at a distance of five meters without any wires. </p><p>  The image can be saved right away on the smartphone by pressing literally one button, about the same function is available to owners of stationary equipment and laptops via Google Drive, Twitter or similar applications.  There is a function that many competing digital cameras lack - assigning tags and further working with them through any GPS device. </p><h2>  Shooting quality </h2><p>  Especially for the G7X model, the company developed an improved lens with a focal length of 8.8-36.8 mm (35 mm equivalent - 24/100 mm) with an excellent aperture ratio of 1.8 / 2.8.  The combination is very pleasant and useful, despite the small zoom (4.2x). </p>

    <p>  There are no problems with chromatic and spatial aberrations, and even despite the relatively small matrix, the bokeh comes out pretty good.  The model feels great, being in constant auto mode - the camera selects the necessary scene quite accurately and reasonably.  The balance between slow shutter speed and ISO is maintained and the quality of the pictures is very pleasing.  It should be noted separately that the RAW format is not intended for automatic shooting, as well as the use of some filters, but many owners, judging by the reviews, use RAW exclusively in manual mode with their own settings, so this item cannot be called a problem. </p><p>  The pictures taken on the G7X almost leave no room for complaints, especially since in its segment it is the most successful model in terms of price and quality. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  Powershot G7X can be confidently called the main hope of the company "Canon" for success in the compact segment.  Of course, this is not the flagship option, since the gadget matrix has modest indicators, but the model takes the buyer with its balance and compactness.  In addition, the device‚Äôs delivery set has an extensive list, which, in addition to all kinds of wires and adapters, includes a very attractive and high-quality case for the Canon G7X. </p><p>  Powershot is a compact camera with serious capabilities for shooting both photos and videos.  She is the main competitor to the popular Sony series of the RX-100 line.  In order to compete with this product, ‚ÄúCanon‚Äù provided its camera with an excellent inch matrix and excellent optics, which by its technical characteristics have no competitors in its class. </p><p>  Here you can add a very powerful new generation processor and a swivel screen with a high-quality hinge - all this makes the new Canon model very attractive in the photo market. </p><p>  Naturally, it was not without drawbacks, but you can put up with them for the relatively low price that the company asks for its product.  The main points that users complain about in their reviews are insufficient battery life, difficult to learn the menu and the functionality of the gadget, as well as some restrictions on working with the RAW format. </p><p>  For the Canon G7X camera, the price on popular Internet sites ranges from 40,000 rubles ($ 500-600). </p>
