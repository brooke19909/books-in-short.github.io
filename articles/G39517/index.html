    <p>  They reach the metro station "Konkovo" and go to Ostrovityanova street.  At the stop complex, they board any bus or fixed-route taxi that goes in the direction of Leninsky Prospekt.  By public transport from the metro you need to drive two stops. </p><p>  On the second route, you need to get to the Teply Stan metro station and go to the street of the same name.  Using any public transport, drive to the Troparevo Park stop.  There are those who overcome the path from the metro Konkovo ‚Äã‚Äãand Teply Stan to the park on foot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  The complex was defeated in 1961 and gave it the name Park XXII Congress of the CPSU.  Later it was renamed into Troparevo park in honor of the district of the same name, along which there is a recreation area.  The park complex was created in a forest, stretching from the ring highway into the interior of the Moscow region. </p><p>  Initially, a central square was formed in it with six avenues diverging from it.  Picturesque compositions from 40 thousand various trees were added to the main forest stand.  In 1975 he was ennobled, creating a well-maintained recreation area.  A dam was erected on the small river Ochakovka and a rather large pond with a beach was built.  In the pond all year round fishing.  The local catch consists of crucian carp, bream, roach and perch. </p>

    <p>  In spring, flocks of wild ducks fly here.  These <span>waterfowl</span> live on the pond until the fall, until it comes time to fly south.  They feed on fish, algae, crustaceans and nurture offspring.  Numerous duck families with tiny ducklings glide along the water surface in early summer. </p><p>  In 2002, the <span>park zone was</span> taken under protection and assigned status to it - the Troparevsky Nature Reserve.  Territory and trees are constantly monitored.  They maintain cleanliness, remove old and diseased forest stands, and periodically plant new plants.  Two groves were formed in the mixed forest of the reserve - birch and pine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Park Infrastructure </h2><p>  All park paths are asphalted.

    <p>  There is a shooting gallery and a Vityaz paintball club.  The large territory of the club (1.3 ha) is surrounded by a fence.  The 5th Moscow Rifle Division resembles an obelisk and a bunker.  Police are patrolling in the park. </p><h2>  Pond </h2><p>  A large pond with a beach is the heart of the park and a favorite resting place for Muscovites from neighboring areas.  The water in it meets sanitary standards, in the summer there are many who like to sunbathe and swim.  For children, a special bathing area in shallow water is equipped. </p><p>  The beach is equipped with two locker rooms, equipped with approaches to the water.  In winter, two decent wormwoods are cut down in the pond, in which "walruses" bathe.  However, swimming is not so simple.  Leaving feedback about the park, visitors indicate that the cleanliness of the water in the pond is in doubt.  Not everyone decides to swim in this pond. </p><p>  There is a boat station in the park.  Visitors, having rented a boat or pedal boat <span>,</span> go for a walk along the artificial lake.  Trees reflected in the water mirror, floating ducks create an unusually beautiful picture. </p><p>  Nearby there is an area for <span>beach volleyball.</span>  The audience not only plays volleyball here for pleasure, sometimes part of it takes part in competitions.  Rescuers watch the campers on the water from the tower.  There is a cafe-tent on the coast. </p><h2>  Bird kingdom </h2><p>  Although Troparev Park is sandwiched from all sides by housing estates, hares, weasels, moles, squirrels and many birds live in it.  Protein and birds like to feed visitors.  The park is populated not only by wild birds, but also by <span>decorative birds.</span> </p>

    <p>  Near the central square, in a special zone, "bird town", enclosures are installed in which contain decorative birds.  Visitors of all ages love to come to the bird mini-zoo.  They observe with interest the habits of birds. </p><h2>  Springs </h2><p>  Above the spring "Cold", located in the upper reaches of the Kukrinsky stream, the chapel of St. Sergius of Radonezh was erected and consecrated.  Residents from neighboring neighborhoods collect water here, believing that it is healing.  There is another fontanel in the reserve called Troparevsky.  True, the water striking in it is unsuitable for drinking. </p><h2>  Summer amphitheater </h2><p>  The Tropareva Park is equipped with a large summer amphitheater.  Moscow is a magnificent city, there are many places where various festivals are held.  All kinds of cultural events are organized on the summer stage of the Troparevsky park complex. </p><p>  Here people organize festivities, celebrate Shrovetide, New Year and Christmas festivals, hold various fairs and festivals.

Children have fun in the mazes of a large children's town made of wood.  Judging by the reviews of visitors, they like the original complex, which has an attraction in the form of a climbing net. </p><p>  Children with pleasure frolic on a large trampoline with a slide and have fun in the mini-amusement park.  Children learn electric car driving skills, jump on small sports trampolines, ride ponies and horses.  They also like the extreme attraction - zorbing. </p><h2>  Winter holidays in Troparevo </h2>

    <p>  For winter walks and skating, Troparevo Park is good.  The photos of the snow-covered trees, the skating rink and the visitors to the park complex rushing off the hill are great.  The winter center of entertainment in the park is considered to be a mountain located near the summer amphitheater.  The audience on its slopes rushes with a breeze on a sleigh, snow scooters and inflatable balloons. </p><p>  Another ice rink in winter is the rink, where visitors draw intricate figures with their skates on smooth ice.  Muscovites all year round have fun here, having fun on the rides, playing sports and improving health. </p>
