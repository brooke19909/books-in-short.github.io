Sea tour: reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Holidays in Turkey and Egypt have always been the most affordable for tourists.  The Russians have long been accustomed to a certain level of service, so this summer, Sochi's boarding houses and motels, offering an all-inclusive system, are in special demand. </p><h2>  “For” rest in Russia </h2><p>  Holidays in Russian resorts have many positive aspects: </p><ol><li>  Documents.  Tourists do not need to issue a passport or make documents for a visa.  At any time, you can pack your bags and fly to the sea without thinking about the queues at the visa center. </li><li>  Insurance.  An important part of travel is insurance.  Most of all, this topic concerns parents.  Which doctor will come to see the child?  How much will the visit cost?  What medicines will he prescribe?  How to communicate with a doctor?  Fortunately, while traveling in Russia, a citizen can seek medical help from any institution. </li><li>  The language barrier.  There is no need to recall a school English course or download a phrase book on a smartphone. </li></ol><p>  On the other hand, saving money on vacation on the Black Sea will not work, and the service and atmosphere in some places will remind you of the USSR. </p><p>  We will tell you about the most popular resorts and resorts in Sochi - read the real reviews of tourists in our review. </p><h2>  “Aqua Loo” </h2><p>  Holidays in Sochi today is one of the most popular destinations.  Tourists want to see the legendary Olympic buildings with their own eyes.  If you like privacy, pay attention to “Aqua Loo” - a guesthouse located in the Lazarevsky district. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pensions and resorts in Sochi" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1281814.jpg" width="600"></div>

The assortment always has a large selection of hot and cold snacks, fresh vegetables and fruits, salads, pastries and desserts.  There are also several commercial establishments for guests. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Most adults on vacation require a minimum of activity, which can not be said about children.  Inexpensive Sochi resorts “hedged” the pool in case of bad weather, but in “Aqua Loo” they found an option even better.  Near the boarding house is the only year-round water park in the Krasnodar Territory.  Pools and slides, a bath complex, cafes and master classes for children are always fun and sunny. </p><p>  Animators, entertainments, talent contests and outdoor games await the young guests of the boarding house in the clubs “Looshka” and “Akvarik”.  The complex has a magnificent playground. </p><p>  Adults will appreciate sports, bowling, the Nemo SPA complex and the Lost Paradise night club. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="motels inexpensive" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1281816.jpg" width="600"></div>

One of the most popular treatments are iodine-bromine baths.

Developed infrastructure, a water park and a picturesque forest zone attract travelers all year round. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Guest reviews point out that the complex is now in disrepair.  The buildings, built almost ten years ago, require redecoration.  The update will not interfere with the interior and the indoor water park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aqua loo pension" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1281810.jpg" width="280"></div>

    <p>  Since the opening of “Aqua Loo” there has always been a large flow of tourists, but over the years, service has also become “limp”.  Poor work of maids and administrators at the reception upsets regular customers.  In the worst condition, according to the guests, the eighth building is located, although in the rest there are different insects. </p><p>  The territory of the pension is very large and beautiful, but walking on foot is quite difficult.  A minibus runs for guests, and check-in by car is paid. </p><p>  At a decent level is the food.  In the reviews of the guests there is not a single word about poisoning.  However, in some restaurants, visitors are treated a little worse. </p><p>  In general, the complex “Aqua Loo” will be an ideal place to relax, but only after a massive update.  In case of inaction on the part of the leadership, after another ten years, tourists will simply move on to competitors, because now many of them prefer other resorts and resorts in Sochi. </p><h2>  "Motorist" </h2><p>  The best places, as a rule, should be booked a few months before the rest.  Travelers boarded the Avtomobilist boarding house, which opened three years ago after major repairs.  A beautiful 14-story building is located in the village of Kudepsta on the Black Sea coast. </p><p>  Three room categories are available for booking: </p><ul><li>  single standard (17.7 sq. m.); </li><li>  double standard (21 sq. m.); </li><li>  luxury panorama (42 sq. m.). </li></ul><p>  The spacious rooms have new furniture, an LCD TV, air conditioning, a set of toiletries and a telephone.  However, the main highlight is the panoramic windows - depending on the location, guests enjoy magnificent views of the Caucasus Mountains or the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="host aquamarine" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1281812.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the third floor there is a main restaurant with a large selection of dishes, and you can enjoy fresh pastries and desserts in the lobby bar.  In addition, for guests there is a cafe "By the Sea" and a cocktail bar on the beach. </p><h2>  Leisure activities </h2><p>  Prefer holidays in Sochi?  Sanatoria, boarding houses and large hotels try to diversify the leisure of guests. </p><p>  Avtomobilist has its own beach, which can be reached in two ways: </p><ul><li>  on foot through the underpass; </li><li>  on a minibus of a boarding house. </li></ul><p>  For lovers of active entertainment, there are banana and boat rides, water skiing, jet skis, swimming and fishing on the high seas. </p><p>  Young guests will like the playground, as well as fun leisure activities under the guidance of animators.  Adults will enjoy exciting shows and theme parties. </p><p>  At the reception, guests can get acquainted with the excursion program.  A trip to the Olympic Village, <span>33 waterfalls</span> in a boxwood grove, Lesnoye Monastery, <span>Vorontsovskaya Cave</span> and other tours await the most curious tourists. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Pensions and resorts in Sochi are often offered “all inclusive” - a system that includes not only three meals a day, but also medical services.  In “Motorist” there is a wonderful medical base, which specializes in diseases of the nervous system and musculoskeletal system. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ol><li>  The location.  Kudepsta village and transport stops are within walking distance. </li><li>  Having your own beach.  Sun loungers, umbrellas and towels (a deposit is required) are always at the guests' disposal. </li><li>  Cleanliness and comfort.  After major repairs, the entire number of rooms is in very good condition. </li><li>  The food is tasty and varied. </li><li>  Staff.  With rare exceptions, all employees treat guests carefully, try to fulfill any request. </li><li>  Fun for kids. </li><li>  Stable Wi-Fi signal in the hotel and on the beach. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boarding house motorist" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1281813.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  According to traveler reviews, Avtomobilist boarding house does not have a large territory, there are also no sports grounds and a swimming pool.  The entertainment program for adults has not been thought out a bit - in the mornings, charging is performed and a show program once a week.  And finally, one of the main shortcomings of the guests consider the early departure.  According to the rules of the boarding house, you must leave the room at 8 o’clock in the morning. </p><h2>  "Aquamarine" </h2><p>  To relax in a sanatorium inexpensively seeks any budget tourist.  Khosta is a well-maintained village on the coast, which is located 14 kilometers from the center of Sochi.  Unlike the above vacation options, the Aquamarine boarding house (Hosta, Yalta Str. 4A) offers the lowest prices and level of service. </p><p>  The number of rooms is located in a six-story building.  Guests are offered only two accommodation options: </p><ul><li>  standard double room; </li><li>  standard triple room. </li></ul><p>  A refrigerator, air conditioning, a TV and a private bathroom, towels and bed linen are modest, but the rooms are quite clean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="inexpensive boarding houses" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1281811.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Pension “Aquamarine” (Hosta) can be attributed to the system “all inclusive”, because guests pay 2 or 3 meals a day in the dining room.  In addition, there are two bars and a summer cafe on the territory. </p><p>  The city beach is 70 meters away, but it is not equipped with any umbrellas or sun loungers. </p><h2>  Opinion of the guests </h2><p>  The calm atmosphere and the atmosphere of solitude are unlikely to be suitable for a family vacation.  There is no entertainment in the boarding house itself, but if you wish, guests can go to the dolphinarium, Amphibius water park, Oceanarium, bowling club or a good restaurant - all the infrastructure of another Adlerkurort sanatorium is a ten-minute drive away.  Near the “Aquamarine” is the famous balneological resort “Matsesta”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi resorts and pensions prices" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1281809.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  In Sochi, motels and resorts prices are quite high, but a little further from the city center you can relax and not go broke.  Customer reviews talk about inexpensive trips to the Aquamarine complex - ten days with three meals a day will cost about 35,000 rubles for two. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  price-quality ratio; </li><li>  homemade food; </li><li>  location </li><li>  stable Wi-Fi signal; </li><li>  friendly staff; </li><li>  2 minutes to the sea. </li></ul><p>  According to guests, the main disadvantages are noise from the road and the lack of central heating. </p><p>  Rest in a sanatorium is inexpensive - a dream or a reality?  Sochi has opened a lot of budget pensions and small hotels, so you can swim in the Black Sea without serious consequences for your wallet.  The main guarantee of a good vacation is the right attitude and a pleasant company. </p>
