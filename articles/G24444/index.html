Such beautiful flowers can be attached to an elastic band or a hair clip for a girl, to decorate a baby's blouse.  It will look spectacular on the head of the daughter‚Äôs wreath with roses from ribbons. </p><p>  In the article we will discuss the manufacture of such a flower in different ways.  After reading, you will be able to understand how to make a rose from a satin ribbon, and step-by-step photographs will help to compare the manufactured sample with the original made by the master. </p><h2>  Gift wrapping rose </h2><p>  This is one of the easiest ways to make a lush flower.  Such a rose can be made on a long ribbon and wrap the ends of a box with a birthday present.  In the photo below, carefully consider the step-by-step image of the entire process.  It is advisable to take a wide ribbon so that voids do not form in the flower.  Seven turns of tape are wound around the palm.  The process begins not from the end of the segment, but with a retreat.  It is necessary to take into account the size of the box and leave the required length for wrapping it in a circle. </p><p>  When the required number of turns is typed, a knot is tied on the back of the palm of the hand.  The whole pack is removed from the hand, and the turns from the common pile are neatly separated in turn.  They are located first in one direction, then in the other.  The last turn for the rosette from the ribbon is left in the center and with the two fingers crush the middle.  The ends of the product wrap a box with a gift and tie a knot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goodhomediy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ribbon roses" class="if uuid-2468859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2468859.jpg"></div><h2>  Making roses on a bow </h2><p>  A <span>fluffy rose from a ribbon with your own hands</span> will turn out using a thread and a thin needle.  A piece of 20-25 cm is cut with scissors from a whole roll of pink, white, red or yellow tape. The wider the material, the longer the length of the segment you need to take.  The thread is selected to match the color of the satin so that it is not visible in the finished product.  First, one end is sewn along the very edge, then the entire edge of the segment itself is sewn with stitches, at the end of the thread it goes to the other side.  The workpiece is ready, but the thread does not break and you do not need to tie a knot.  From the edge where the work began, a nodule is made from the fabric itself.  This will be the base of the flower. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The next step in the manufacture of satin ribbon roses is to contract the matter.  To do this, the fabric moves with the fingers along the thread towards the base.  The remaining thread is sewn to the base knot.  Ribbon rose petals are neatly aligned with your fingers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="4evercrafting.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rose making method" class="if uuid-2468863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2468863.jpg"></div><h2>  Twisting method </h2><p>  To create such a flower you need to buy a wide ribbon and fold it in half.  You can tuck one edge not completely, but by one third.  Keep the tape in operation by folding it up.  On the right side, the end of the tape folds down at a right angle.  The size of the folded part should be at least 4 cm. From the bottom, the edge is bent again and the inside of the rose is fixed with stitches.  A needle with a thread remains from the bottom, and the fabric of the ribbon is wound on the middle of the flower.  So that the layers of the atlas do not slip off the base, you need to flash the fabric through all the layers with a needle and thread. </p><p>  Continuing to wind the satin ribbon around the workpiece.  When the necessary size of the bud is reached, the edge is cut so that the end is the same size as the rest at the beginning, about 4‚Äì4.5 cm. The edge is tucked diagonally first back, then down.  The line should peek out from under the bend by 1.5 cm. The edge of a do-it-yourself rose from satin ribbons is twisted, and the base of the flower is fixed with a thread.  To do this, use cloth to wrap the base from the bottom 3-4 times.  At the end, a knot is tied and a thread is cut with scissors.  It turns out not a magnificent rose, but a dense bud. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="satin rose" class="if uuid-2470252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2470252.jpg"></div><h2>  Pleated rose </h2><p>  The first step in the manufacture of a flower by this method is folding the ribbon in the middle of the segment at a right angle.  Then you need to wrap the bottom part up, it turns out a fold of the tape at a right angle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cutoutandkeep.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="folding tape" class="if uuid-2468860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2468860.jpg"></div><p>  A similar movement is repeated many times until you feel a significant stack of folded corners under your fingers.  Then both edges of the tape are tightly clamped with your fingers and all the folds are released.  Holding the edges of the craft, you need to gently pull one end towards yourself.  All folds of the rose should shift to the base of the flower. </p><p>  Then a handmade rose from satin ribbons is sewn as follows: a needle with a thread selected to match the satin is threaded through the base to the central petal, a tiny, barely noticeable stitch is made and the thread is brought back down to the base of the craft. </p><p>  The thread is not immediately cut, but wound three times around the ends of the base.  A thick bundle of tape is pierced with a needle and a durable knot is tied.  A rosette is sewn onto the fabric with the same thread, only stitches are made through the lower parts of the petals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cutoutandkeep.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a rose" class="if uuid-2468861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2468861.jpg"></div><h2>  Flip Tape </h2><p>  How to make a rose from a ribbon?  This is not difficult.  Enough to read the step-by-step explanation given in this article.  This option roses are made from a single ribbon by twisting.  Unlike the previously described method, the material does not fold in half, but a small section of fabric is bent on one side of the tape.  Work begins with the base of the craft. </p><p>  The edge of the ribbon is folded diagonally and held in the hand, the rest of the atlas is folded into a roll around this fold.  Then the tape is again turned over to form a diagonal, and the winding continues to the end of the fold.  Twisting and further actions are repeated until the required flower size.  Then the bottom of the base is pierced with a needle and thread, and the needle is guided up into the central part of the craft.  A small stitch is made and the thread comes back down.  All the lower edges of the petals are firmly fastened so that the product does not fall apart.  A knot is tied, and the excess edge is cut with scissors.  The rosette is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theribbonretreat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a rose" class="if uuid-2468870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2468870.jpg"></div><h2>  Folding a flower from individual petals </h2><p>  To make such a beautiful and magnificent rose, as in the photo below, you must first work on the middle of the flower.  A satin ribbon is cut 6-8 cm long, and one edge is bent at right angles to the underside of the ribbon.  A pin with a bead at the end fixes the edge in one position.  The rest of the tape is wrapped around this corner and sewn with a thread selected in the color of the fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fabartdiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="satin ribbon rose" class="if uuid-2468857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2468857.jpg"></div><p>  When the middle of the rose is prepared, it is laid aside and engaged in the manufacture of individual petals.  For work, you will need scissors and a set of thin pins with beads on the end.  The tape fabric is cut into pieces of the same length.  In this case, the length of each element depends on the size of the craft.  If the flower is large and lush, then you need to prepare more petals.  And the pieces are cut longer.  Each petal is made as follows: the fabric is bent at an angle of 90 degrees to the lower side from one and the other end, the edges of the segment are attached using the prepared pins. </p><h2>  Flower assembly </h2><p>  Making roses from a ribbon with your own hands can be considered step by step in the photo in the article.  All parts are assembled together by sewing each petal to the previously assembled base.  Petals are placed with the front shiny side of the fabric up, and the folds of fabric remain from the bottom of the flower.  Sew them in a checkerboard pattern, with a shift to the side so that each element is clearly visible and does not overlap the next. </p><p>  When all the petals are attached, you need to take a green ribbon and make leaflets in a similar way.  They are attached at the bottom of crafts.  Flowers collected from different ribbons look beautiful.  For example, the first layer of elements can be made white, the next pink, and the last layer dark pink or red.  In addition to green leaves, you can sew several even sections of the thinnest ribbon, for example, dark green. </p><h2>  Volumetric flower on a cone </h2><p>  Such a spectacular rose can be placed both on a gift box or on any product - a wreath, a hair clip, an elastic band for hair, a picture or a postcard.  As the name of the subtitle shows, a conical base is required for operation.  In fact, the basis of the craft is a circle 1.5 cm in diameter cut out of dense cotton fabric. However, in the process of stitching parts, it gradually bends with the center up, and a cone shape is obtained. </p><p>  Use a needle and thread in the work, it is advisable to choose it in accordance with the main color of the craft.  Further, the cut end of the ribbon is sewn onto the circle with small stitches around the entire perimeter.  You should get a square of stitches.  Then the tape is folded diagonally and again sheathed with petals around the entire perimeter.  The seams pass through the circle and all layers of the tape.  Each subsequent bend is larger.  Therefore, the petals increase as they move away from the center of the flower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.miniaturesweethk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="twisting roses" class="if uuid-2468865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2468865.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, it is not difficult to assemble a satin rose, and with a step-by-step explanation and photos, the work is even easier to complete.  The main thing is to follow the instructions and fold the petals carefully.  Good luck in your work! </p>
