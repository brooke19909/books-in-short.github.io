It is this feeling that arises when the picturesque village of Katkova is seen.  This oasis is located away from noisy, smoky cities.  Among the greenery of the village, you can completely relax and get rid of fatigue and emotional stress. </p><h2>  Description of the village </h2><p>  Katkova Slit is a small but famous village in the Krasnodar Territory, where tourists come, dreaming of a quiet vacation.  This place is located at a distance of 10 km from Lazarevsky.  If you drive 40 km, you can get to Sochi.  The village got its unusual name due to the fact that the landowner Mikhail Katkov lived here.  Here, in the estate of Michael, there is a <span>mulberry tree of</span> huge size, which for the locals has turned into a shrine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Katkova slit" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1274490.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The settlement is rich in ponds, so it is located on two banks of the Chukhukt River.  In addition, it is located on the Black Sea coast.  The area is very picturesque, because it is located in the foothill zone.  There are many hills of varying heights (an average of 170 meters above sea level).  The local Mount Serenth, which stands in the northern part, is the highest point, it stretched up 732 meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The village has a good fertile mountain chernozem, so all kinds of subtropical plants are booming here.  Also, a large tract Katkova Slit has been preserved here.  In the upper part of the village are hydrogen sulfide springs. </p><p>  There are only two streets and two lanes in the Katkovaya Slit, and the Adler-Dzhubga federal highway is stretched out from below through the village. </p><h2>  Katkova slit: rest for the soul </h2>

There are good wide beaches strewn with small pebbles.  In addition, it is not as crowded here as on Sochi beaches.  There are many quiet places that contribute to a comfortable, restless vacation.  Water in the sea always remains clean and calm.  There is also a river in the village, which allows you to diversify your vacation and cool off in the cool river water.

    <h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Since the Katkova Slit is a resort village, there are hotels of different levels in it.  Luxury rooms are offered for sophisticated guests, and for those with lesser needs and who want to spend time cheaper, there are suitable rooms.  But in any case, regardless of the level of the hotel, this vacation will cost less than in any <span>guest house in Sochi</span> or Adler. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Here you can choose a room in the private sector, but there are also enough hotels here, so all guests will be able to find decent housing for themselves.  Since the city is far from entertainment, many owners of private property on their territory set up mini-parks.  There is clean air and a favorable climate, many grow exotic fruits that can be enjoyed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Katkova slit reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1274491.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Holidays in the Katkovaya Slit are rather aimed at the category of tourists who prefer peace and quiet.  If you are a "party" young man, it is better to find another place for a vacation.  Here you can go for a walk along the excursion route, which is located outside the village.  In the Caucasian reserve you can admire the extraordinary beauty of nature.  Each river is rich in waterfalls, and there are caves in the local forest zones. </p><p>  If you do not go outside the village, you can ride a horse or in a jeep.  At the local cafes, which are located on the coast, you can enjoy a delicious meal of national cuisine.  Residents also offer local wine and real honey.  Many recommendations are usually given by welcoming hotel or private sector owners. </p><h2>  The climate of the territory </h2>

A humid <span>subtropical climate prevails here,</span> so in summer the temperature can rise to +35 degrees.  But the surrounding greenery, mountains and water bodies allow you to safely transfer such indicators of thermometers.  Summer ends only in November, and at the end of this month autumn begins.  Winter in this area is mild, and the temperature does not drop below ‚Äì10 degrees.  Precipitation here falls mainly only in winter, and mainly in the form of rain.

    <h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists have already rested in these parts, and everyone unanimously says that they plan to return to the village of Katkova Slit.  The reviews of these enthusiastic travelers indicate that nature is unusually beautiful, and few locals are very welcoming and friendly.  In addition, there is a convenient gently sloping beach, sometimes sandy, which allows you to relax even with the smallest children.  Those who wish to dilute their quiet rest with fun a little can visit the local cafe in the evening at a disco. </p><p>  As for food: from the reviews it can be seen that in addition to ordinary restaurants there are inexpensive home cafes where they eat hearty and tasty.  If you need to make purchases, purchase souvenirs or want special entertainment, you can go to Lazarevskoye, which can be reached in just 25 minutes. </p>
