    <h2>  Preparing for knitting hats </h2><p>  If you want to start creating a winter hat, then you first need to pick up yarn and knitting needles.  Yarn can be different: woolen, half-woolen, acrylic.  As a rule, mixed yarn is considered to be the best option: acrylic and woolen. </p><p>  After choosing yarn, you need to learn how to <span>knit a hat with</span> knitting needles; there are patterns of such knitting in the magazines Verena and Sabrina.  Knitting needles can be wooden, steel, aluminum.  For a beginner, it is most convenient to knit with steel knitting needles, they have no roughness, they do not bend and do not break. </p><h2>  Types of loops when knitting </h2><p>  When knitting hats, different types of loops are used.  The most important of them are the front ones, that is, when the needle is hooked under the front segment of the loop, and a thread is drawn through it.  When knitting the wrong loop, the needle pokes on the back piece to stretch the thread. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In fact, knitting is an alternation of front and back loops.  The most popular type of knitting - elastic - this is the alternation of the front and <span>back loops</span> in the same row.  That is, it is one wrong side and one facial, then repetition.  Two facial and two wrong, three facial and three wrong, and so on can alternate.  If you are interested in how to finish the cap with knitting needles, then the schemes are in the magazines. </p><p>  Another common type of knitting is the front surface, on the one hand only front loops are knitted.  But the front surface is different in that the canvas can turn out to be uneven. </p>

    <p>  The so-called ‚Äúshawl knitting‚Äù is very popular, which usually guarantees an even knitted fabric.  In this type of knitting, the front and back loops alternate in different rows.  That is, one row is knitted with facial loops, the other row is purl, and so on.  This look is suitable not only for hats, but also for sweaters, vests, scarves. </p><p>  You can knit a hat with braids, in which case the rows of gum regularly intersect, and you get a beautiful pattern. </p><h2>  Knitting pattern </h2><p>  Before knitting a <span>hat with knitting needles, the schemes</span> for which are simple, you must first take measurements.  This will be the volume of the head and its height from the ear to the apex.  Then we knit a sample from the same yarn from which the main product will be created.  It is small, about ten by ten centimeters in size.  Then the sample should be washed in warm water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Then it is dried under natural conditions, and on its basis, loops are calculated to start knitting.  You can now calculate exactly how many loops you need to get started. </p><h2>  Knitting caps on two knitting needles: a set of loops </h2><p>  To create a cap using two knitting needles, you will need very little time.  In addition, the product that you create will be unique, and will definitely fit the size of you or the person you knit. </p>

    <p>  To make such a hat, you need to find only a hundred grams of yarn matching the number of knitting needles, a plastic needle with a wide eye (such a needle is usually sold complete with knitting needles). </p><p>  After knitting the sample, we collect the number of loops we need, we begin to knit with an elastic band two by two or three by three.  Such an elastic band will fit your head well.  It is a uniform alternation of the front and back loops. </p><h2>  Two-knitted simple hat </h2><p>  So, the elastic is knitted, and we are already starting to think about how to finish knitting a hat with knitting needles.  You can simply continue knitting with an elastic stitch after an elastic band 3-4 cm high, and as a result make a rectangle 12 to 15 centimeters high, and then pull the edge of the fabric together with a thread.  Then you need to connect the sides of the rectangle with a needle.  It is necessary to connect with a kettel seam.  The finished product can be washed, dried and steamed with an iron.  And now it‚Äôs already clear how to knit a simple hat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  More sophisticated hat option </h2><p>  If you want your hat to sit better on your head, you need to start its formation after knitting the initial rows with an elastic band.  You need to know exactly how to finish the top of the cap with knitting needles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to finish knitting a hat with knitting needles" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/681688.jpg" width="416"></div>

    <p>  In the last row of the gum you need to somehow mark every twelfth loop, starting with the sixth loop.  You can attach colored threads to these places.  Now, in every second row, the loops marked with such threads are knitted together with the front ones adjacent together.  In the end, you need to decide how to finish the cap with knitting needles.  As a result, ten loops should remain on your knitting needles, you will pull them together with a thread, while leaving its long end.  To connect the edges, you need to insert into the needle with a thick eye the same thread with which you knitted the product, sew them with a stitch seam.  You can not use sewing threads, because of them, the hat will not stretch.  Then you will learn how to finish knitting hats with knitting needles. </p><h2>  Pompom making </h2><p>  Recently, caps with a pompom have come into fashion.  A pompom is an elegant solution to the question of how to finish the top of the cap with knitting needles. </p><p>  To make a pompom, you need two circles of cardboard, they are cut with scissors.  A hole is made in the middle of the circle. </p><p>  The pompom can turn out curly, and for this you better take the yarn obtained as a result of the opening of the former <span>knitwear.</span>  This will be a beautiful option on how to finish the cap with knitting needles. </p><p>  The yarn is wound on cardboard circles (you need to wrap many layers).  After winding, the yarn is cut in the middle of the circle, bound - it turns out a pompom.  To it you still need to attach a thread 25-30 centimeters long.  How to finish knitting hats with knitting needles the easiest?  Pompom! </p>

    <h2>  Knitting on five needles </h2><p>  I must say that a hat knitted with five knitting needles will be more elegant than a hat knitted with two.  It is perfect for lovers of seamless things.  And knitting it is easier, because you do not need to think about how to make a beautiful seam.  Of course, you still have to rack your brains on how to finish a stocking cap with knitting needles.  But everything will look more elegant.  Still need to decide on the answer to the question of how to knit knit hat knitting. </p><p>  For work, you will need five open-ended spokes.  At first it will seem that everything is very complicated.  But over time, you will like to knit on five knitting needles, most likely, you will begin to knit with them absolutely everything. </p><p>  To do everything right, you need to know not only how to start, but also how to finish the cap with knitting needles.  First, we select forty loops on two of them, distribute them into four knitting needles so that each has ten loops, we knit them with the fifth knitting needle.  Care must be taken to ensure that so-called paths, i.e. holes, do not form between the spokes. </p><p>  So we knit to a height of twenty-twenty-five centimeters, and then we begin to reduce the loops.  We knit in each second row two together the front every ten loops.  Then ten loops remain, which we translate on one knitting needle and tighten with a thread.  That's all.  You can also attach a pompom on top.  And then you do not have to think about what a hat is with knitting needles, how to finish knitting it. </p>
