Rose is probably the most divine flower (at least in our country, and throughout the post-Soviet space).  No wonder almost all women love this plant.  Unprecedented beauty and unique aroma made it unique, one might say, the queen among other <span>flowers.</span>  <span>What are</span> roses, cultural classification and characteristics of groups, photos and other useful information - this and much more is described in this article. </p><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  Rose is truly one of the most elegant flowers.  With smooth lines, rich, deep shades and a pleasant aroma, it has won a central place in the hearts of all gardeners. </p><p>  The story of the appearance of roses on Earth is very interesting.  It is believed that in ancient times the goddess Flora lived, who loved God Amur very much.  It was thanks to her love that a flower magical in its beauty and aroma enveloping it appeared.  Rose symbolized for Flora joy and sadness from love at the same time. </p><p>  Even in ancient Greece, a rose was considered to be a plant that could not only calm the excitement of the heart, help the soul renew itself, but also give happiness and long life.  In ancient Rome, roses decorated the streets of the city during various celebrations.  For the first time, Peter I brought roses to Russia; later, Catherine II also fell in love with them. </p>

Such roses are quite resistant to infection by diseases and pests, but do not tolerate winter, so they need reliable shelter.  They bloom from about mid-June until the first frost (two to three times per season). </p><p>  The size of hybrid tea roses varies depending on the particular species: from half a meter to a meter.  The leaves of this group are very large, dense and dark.  The flowers themselves have a color from pale pink to deep burgundy.  The diameter of the bud can be up to 14 centimeters, in addition, it can be either single or collected in inflorescences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The classification of rose varieties in the named and considered group is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Julias Rose - the stems of this variety are standing upright and have a height of about 80 centimeters, which is why they are most often cut for bouquets.  These are very beautiful flowers, with buds from five to seven centimeters, they have a slightly elongated shape.

Gloria's buds are up to fifteen centimeters in diameter and gold in color. </li></ul><h2>  Description of Floribunda Group </h2><p>  This group of roses was obtained after crossing tea roses and polyanthus.  As a rule, they are planted on the curbs and flower beds.  Plant height varies from forty centimeters to one meter.  This group of roses is distinguished by semi-double buds, which are collected in lush brushes.  The buds have orange or bright red shades, most often of two or three-color color.  The scientific classification of roses of the named group also exists in the same name. </p><p>  Floribunda group is very demanding on the soil on which it is planted.  In this regard, the soil must be periodically fed with useful substances.  Such roses are well tolerated in winter, provided that they are reliably sheltered from the weather. </p><p>  Such varieties of Floribunda are very popular: </p><ul><li>  Margaret Merrill - The main feature of this variety is a very pleasant, spicy smell.  The bush grows to half a meter tall.  The buds are in the shape of a bowl, are semi-double. </li><li>  Angela - this shrub grows very quickly to a decent height (about four meters), it blooms continuously throughout the season.  Angela has pink-colored buds that spread a delicate floral aroma around her. </li></ul><h2>  Description of the Grandiflora Group </h2><p>  Grandiflora is very reminiscent of tub roses, but it also took a lot from Floribunda's group.  The stems of the flowers of this group stand vertically upwards, they reach a height of about two meters. </p>

    <p>  The classification of the rose plant of this group is divided into three classes: </p><ol><li>  Nostalgic: this includes roses of the brands of England, partly France and Germany.  The William Shakespeare 2000 rose is especially popular; it is considered one of the best red roses in the UK.  The bush of this rose has a height of a little more than a meter, it is all studded with small terry inflorescences of red color with a slight shade of purple. </li><li><strong></strong>  Canadian selection: roses of this variety are quite resistant to frost (even to forty degrees).  The most popular is the Cuthbert Grant rose, a small bush in size (a little more than a meter in height and about eighty centimeters in width).  Flowers of this variety have a purple hue, they do not grow individually, but are collected in a single brush, about 7-9 pieces each. </li><li><strong></strong>  Ground cover: this classification of rose varieties, in turn, is subdivided into high and low varieties, which spread perfectly, as well as very small and larger drooping ones.  A rose of the Sommermorgen variety is very interesting - with its help, you can very beautifully design borders.  Her bush reaches a height of just over half a meter, it is all dotted with small (up to five centimeters in diameter) terry buds that have a pale pink tint. </li></ol><h2>  Description of the polyanthus group of roses </h2><p>  The polyanthus group is distinguished due to the crossing of two species: Chinese rose and multiflorous.  This group is characterized by small buds, which are combined into inflorescences of the shield shape.  Buds can be both ordinary and terry.  Their shades are diverse: from boiling white to bright saturated red.  Roses of the polyanthus group can be with a pleasant aroma and without it. </p><p>  Roses of this group bloom long enough, until late autumn.  The height of the middle bush is small - about half a meter.  Very low bushes of this group (about thirty centimeters) are grown only at home.  This group of roses is easily affected by fungal bacteria.  You can propagate them both by vaccination, and by using cuttings.  The classification of roses with photos of this group is presented in this article.  Moreover, below are examples of specific names of these colors for the group in question. </p><p>  The classification of the common rose includes a polyanthus group, which hibernates well even with minimal shelter.  These roses well decorate borders, pastures and rabatki. </p><p>  Such varieties of polyanthus roses are widely known: </p><ul><li>  Orange Triumph is a very lush and beautiful bush on which terry buds of red color bloom, with a diameter of about five centimeters.  The disadvantage of the variety is its weakness against fungal diseases. </li><li>  Fairy - has buds of pale pink color, the bush reaches a height of just over half a meter.  Each brush is capable of producing forty buds, which makes this rose look very chic. </li></ul><h2>  Description of a miniature group of roses </h2><p>  As the name implies, the bushes of this group are quite compact, it is a low plant (from about ten centimeters to half a meter).  The buds are located on the stems alone or collected in inflorescences.  The classification of roses (see the photo below) of this group includes in its composition flowers that are very much loved in Russia.  These roses are popular, first of all, with a pleasant aroma, besides the richness of the shades of the flower is amazing. </p>

    <p>  <span>Miniature roses</span> bloom very long and plentifully, almost before the onset of winter.  They grow well both on open ground and on the home windowsill. </p><p>  Such varieties look very attractive: </p><ul><li>  Little Sunset is a very small rose (not more than forty centimeters), which has small terry inflorescences of a golden color, with red edges. </li><li>  Lavender Meylandina - this variety of miniature roses reaches a height of half a meter, it differs in buds of delicate lilac color and small (about five centimeters) size. </li></ul><h2>  Description of the climbing group of roses </h2><p>  Climbing roses bred by breeders as a result of crossing Chinese, Bengal and Indian roses.  This type of roses is characterized by rather long and flexible stems, which sometimes reach six meters.  They are great for placing on a support.  Climbing roses are extremely diverse, they are both double and ordinary.  Shades and shapes of buds are also very diverse.  The classification of roses (biology, grade 7) was studied as early as the school years, however, the group mentioned above was not in the school curriculum. </p><p>  Many gardeners recognize this group as the queen of the garden, because these flowers most wonderfully fit into any landscape, they can be placed both horizontally and vertically.  Climbing roses will perfectly braid borders, fences, they will crawl well along the walls and roofs of low buildings. </p><p>  This type of roses does not require any special care, the main thing is to cut and water them in time.  They bloom almost continuously, starting from the end of May until the first frosts on the street.  And in indoor conditions, in the warmth, they delight the eye with beautiful buds all year. </p><p>  Popular varieties of climbing roses are popular: </p><ul><li>  Sympathy - stems of this variety stretch up to five meters in length and have fairly large purple buds (about ten centimeters) with double flowering.  They tolerate frosts well enough. </li><li>  Hamburger Phoenix - this variety of climbing roses has a bright raspberry shade of buds, with small white patches.  The stems stretch to a height of three and a half meters.  This plant tolerates even very severe winters, and also resists various diseases well. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Description of roses group Patio (Miniflora) </h2><p>  <span>Roses Patio</span> appeared about thirty years ago, before they were in the low-growth varieties of the Floribund group.  This group of roses also has a relatively low growth (up to half a meter), they bloom profusely and often planted both in their own gardens and on city lawns.  Patio bushes have very dense foliage, in addition, they are represented not by single buds, but by lush inflorescences. </p><p>  Roses of the Patio group have different shades: from pale white to bright scarlet.  Especially popular is such a variety of this group as Heidi Klum - a relatively small bush on which there are small (about eight centimeters in diameter) buds with bright purple petals.  It blooms quite long and plentifully. </p><p>  These roses look great both on a small border and in flower pots.  For the design of flower beds, a variety with a pleasant fragrant aroma of Baby Baccarat is excellent; for a room, a variety of Baby Bakker is perfect.  On the street, roses of the Korsnoda variety are perfectly accepted, in addition, they do not require additional warming for the winter and are well resistant to diseases. </p><h2>  Repair group of roses </h2><p>  This group (classification of roses, biology, 7th grade) was bred back in 1634.  This variety of roses was brought up by breeders in France, by crossing several species: Bengal, Asian, tea and local French.  From their predecessors, this group of roses received frost resistance, multiple flowering, a fairly powerful stem and buds. </p><p>  Repairing roses have bushes up to one and a half meters high, and sometimes even higher.  The buds of such a rose are quite large (about ten centimeters), they have a wonderful rich aroma.  Shades of roses are represented by pink and red colors. </p><p>  Remontant roses bloom from mid-summer, as a rule, in the autumn their repeated, somewhat weaker flowering is noted. </p>
