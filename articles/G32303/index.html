Familiarity with any city in the world is best to start from the main square.  After all, it is here that you can feel its taste.  And Sicily in this case will not be an exception, so the first thing to do is visit Piazza del Duomo in the town of Catania.  Here you can see the main symbol - a fountain with a black elephant.  In the same area there are other architectural monuments that will amaze with their beauty. </p><h2>  Where to go if the hotel is bored? </h2>

He is considered the most pompous in Catania.  Its facade seems unprepossessing and boring, but in the middle reveals the magnificent splendor of rich decoration.  Not far from this church is the Roman amphitheater.  Ursino Fortress was built in the 9th century.  An interesting fact is that now it is almost in its original form even without a large number of restoration work.

    <p>  The kitchen is in the room.  There is a whole range of cooking utensils.  If something is missing, you can contact the administration.  By and large, if you relax without children, then you can not use the kitchen.  Hotel Alkantara Villaggio Giardini Naxos 3 * provides breakfast and dinner.  But you need to take into account the time difference.  Dinners are here at 19:30.  In some countries it was already late at that time.  Therefore, it makes sense to dine earlier in other places.  Food is served on the menu.  An evening diet is selected at breakfast.  Dishes are served as you eat.  This also needs to be considered.  The food is very tasty and varied. </p><p>  The road to the beach takes only 10 minutes.  It is better for vacationers with children to choose another beach, since it is not a very comfortable entry into the sea.  Immediately deep.  Giordani Naxos Beach can be reached by transport.  7 minutes to the stop.  In Taormina, almost all the attractions are concentrated.  The bus schedule is at the hotel. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  A wonderful beach with white sand and a good sunset in the sea is located in a small bay.  It can be reached by bus, which leaves from the Dalmatia stop.  There is also a convenient beach in lower Taormina.  At the reception they give out umbrellas from the sun for free. </p>
