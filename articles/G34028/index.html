This company is represented not only in St. Petersburg, but also in Moscow and Yekaterinburg. </p><p>  The most important representation in her in the Northern capital is 23 objects.  In Yekaterinburg, the developer has seven objects and four more in Moscow. </p><p>  After 1997, the developer put into operation more than 420 houses, more than eight million square meters of real estate are currently at different stages of readiness - from design to construction and execution of all necessary documents. </p><p>  Currently, the real estate portfolio is more than eight and a half million square meters of housing, the market value of which is estimated at more than 185 billion rubles.  At the end of 2017, the company's revenue amounted to about 138 and a half billion rubles.  According to the feedback from the co-investors of the Civilization LCD about LSR Real Estate in St. Petersburg, this indicates that this company can be trusted. </p><p>  The company itself notes that extremely comfortable houses are being built here, the correct brick-monolithic technologies are used.  Comfort class houses use Western seamless technology.  Involved building materials of own production, which can significantly reduce the cost per square meter.  They are produced at the factories of the LSR holding, therefore their quality can be guaranteed, and the production process can be controlled at all stages. </p><p>  The company-developer has created a fundamentally new standard for finishing work.  Having studied modern foreign innovative developments, a new finishing package was formed.  Materials are purchased from partners at purchase and wholesale prices.  In residential neighborhoods, the Kind Yard concept is used, thanks to which pedestrians are given priority in courtyards.  For cars equip zoned parking and parking.  In the immediate vicinity of the houses themselves, they organize a large number of sports and playgrounds, arrange sites where there is a lot of greenery, and also set benches for relaxation. </p><p>  Much attention is paid to the safety of residents.  To do this, install modern intercom systems, create the conditions for organizing the concierge service, video surveillance. </p><p>  The company regularly confirms its status by winning prestigious awards in the construction industry.  Among them are the awards "Leader of building quality", "Consumer confidence", "Reliable builder of Russia", "Builder of the year". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lsr.ru" data-author=": "><img alt="Developer Civilization LCD" class="if uuid-2958642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2958642.jpg?1562152400"></div><h2>  Impressions of residents </h2><p>  According to reviews of the LCD "Civilization" (on the Neva), you can make a full impression of the pros and cons of this residential quarter.  The main complaints expressed by the tenants to the developer are the presence of two enterprises nearby, which <noindex>  by hypothesis, interest holders should affect the ecology of the area. </noindex>  About plants near the LCD "Civilization" in the reviews contain a lot of information.  These are the companies "Reagent" and "Pigment", as well as several other smaller companies.  The consolation in this case may be the fact that in the foreseeable future they will nevertheless be liquidated, and the areas will be allocated for development.  In particular, the construction of the Polis on the Neva residential complex is planned on the territory of Reaktiv enterprise, and Settle City will grow instead of Pigment. </p><h2>  Quality of work </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mirndv-zhk-civilizaciya.ru" data-author=": "><img alt="Residential Quarter Civilization" class="if uuid-2958637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2958637.jpg?1562152400"></div><p><noindex>  In comfort class residential complexes, the developer offers fine finishing of apartments.  Wall decoration uses textured vinyl wallpaper for painting, able to withstand several cycles of painting.  The company uses a class 32 laminate as a floor covering.  The windows are glazed with double-chamber double-glazed windows with micro-ventilation.  A complete set of sanitary ware is installed in the bathrooms and the bathroom; ceramic tiles in beige tones are used in the wall and floor cladding. </noindex></p><p><noindex>  In customer reviews in the Civilization residential complex, real estate owners note that upon acceptance, company employees eliminate minor flaws immediately on the spot, and in the absence of more complex alterations, you do not have to wait for a standard correction period of up to 45 days. </noindex></p><h2>  Prices </h2><div class="photo" data-original="spbhomes.ru" data-author=": "><img alt="Reviews from real estate investors about LCD Civilization" class="if uuid-2958636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2958636.jpg?1562152400"></div><p><noindex>  High prices are one of the claims that are sometimes presented to this developer.  The company builds houses using seamless technology, which is often called "panel".  But in fact it is very different from what used to be called a panel. </noindex></p><p>  Experts emphasize that the company is setting such high prices due to the fact that it has long and reliably been working in the St. Petersburg real estate market and has managed to go beyond this market.  Indeed, perhaps the first factor in choosing a builder in Russia is precisely its reliability, and the LSR Group has long proved that it fulfills its obligations on time, the houses are put into operation without significant delays. </p><p><noindex>  In reviews of the Civilization residential complex in St. Petersburg, potential homeowners often ask one more pressing question: where can they get timely and professional medical care if necessary.  There is a medical facility for adults on Iskrovsky Prospekt, 1.2 km from the complex, and a nursery on ul.  Dybenko, at a distance of 1.5 km. </noindex></p><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  Those who purchased an apartment in the Civilization residential complex admit in reviews that one of the determining factors was the reliability of the developer.  Even despite the rather high cost per square meter for a non-brick house - more than 83 thousand rubles. </p><p><noindex>  Finishing, according to customer reviews, typical for the "finish from the builder" quality.  White-beige lighting solutions, wallpaper for painting, laminate as a floor covering.  It allows you not to think about the repair in the near future after the purchase, but many prefer to change it over time with their own decisions. </noindex></p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Summing up and studying the reviews of mystery shoppers about RC Civilization in St. Petersburg, we can state that new buildings from this developer have both disadvantages and advantages.  The advantages include a favorable situation with infrastructure, in everything, except for clinics, a good transport interchange, a convenient and reliable purchase scheme, which allows you to take advantage of almost all possible options in this market.  There is a mortgage with state support, and interest-free installments, several banks at once, which the interest holder can count on even at the stage of construction of the pit. </p><p><noindex>  At the same time, it is often noted in the feedback from real estate investors about the Civilization residential complex in St. Petersburg that the location of this residential quarter can be considered in two ways.  So, for example, two expressways on either side of the complex will be a plus for some and a repulsive factor for others, and from the green areas within walking distance there is only a small park of Builders. </noindex></p><p><noindex>  Of course, one of the main criteria by which buyers choose LCD Civilization is the reputation of the developer.  LSR Group is one of the largest developers with a large number of already implemented projects not only in St. Petersburg, but also in other regions of Russia. </noindex></p>
