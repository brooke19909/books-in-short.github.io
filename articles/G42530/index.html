  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Suez crisis</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After the war (World War II) in the international politics of the USSR, one of the most important places was assigned to the Middle East.  <span>The Arab countries</span> received various assistance - both military, moral, and political. </p><p>  The Suez crisis of 1956 was the first test of the strength of Soviet influence in the Middle East. </p><p>  The USSR supplied military equipment, weapons, sent specialists and military advisers to countries that could (presumably) participate in the military confrontation. </p><p>  Under British control, Egypt actually remained until the mid-1950s.  In 1951, the Egyptian government terminated the treaty, according to which English troops were deployed in the country.  However, Britain not only did not withdraw them, but increased their numbers.  In response, rallies of protests took place throughout the country, and a guerrilla war broke out against the British invaders. </p><p>  In 1952, on July 23, the conflict in Egypt resulted in a revolution.  Colonel Nasser, who headed the political organization "Free Officers", having overthrown the monarchical regime, proclaimed the country a republic. </p><p>  The policies pursued by the new government greatly aggravated relations with England and Israel.  In an effort to extend the presence of its army in Egypt, Britain signed an agreement with Nasser on the withdrawal of troops for twenty months and the transfer of military facilities to the Egyptian government.  In 1955, the <span>Baghdad Pact</span> was created with the participation of Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Great Britain, and Pakistan.  Egypt was also invited to join it.  However, Nasser refused. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the Middle East, the situation was becoming increasingly complicated.  Israel, as well as the countries participating in the Baghdad Pact, were in the eyes of Egypt a hostile environment.  The Western <span>colonial system</span> collapsed.  This was evidenced by the independence of Morocco, Tunisia, Sudan, Syria.  In Algeria, a people's liberation war took place.  Along with this, favorable conditions were created for the development of Soviet influence in this region.  This, in turn, caused concern in NATO. </p><p>  It should be noted that fears had a basis.  The fact is that in 1955, Nasser turned to Western countries for help.  Egypt requested military support, but was refused.  In this regard, Nasser turned to the USSR.  The Soviet Union did not refuse Egypt.  Through Czechoslovakia, the sale of Russian weapons was secretly arranged. </p><p>  The concern of the Western countries was growing.  They did not want the presence of the Soviet Union in the Middle East.  President Eisenhower promised to provide Nasser with financial assistance in the construction of the Aswan Dam.  But after the <span>Egyptian president</span> began purchasing weapons from Czechoslovakia and established diplomatic relations with the PRC, the American government refused his offer.  As a result, Nasser was in a hopeless situation, since the collapse of the project could provoke an <span>economic crisis</span> in the country.  Assessing the situation, the Egyptian president went to extreme measures.  Nasser decided to nationalize the Suez Canal.  In 1956, on July 26, the president announced at a grand rally that the proceeds from nationalization would go to the construction of the Aswan Dam.  From this moment the Suez crisis began to develop actively. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The economic activity of Nasser, which was revolutionary in nature, was carried out against the backdrop of the development of the <span>military policy of the</span> Egyptian president.  Nasser, having received military support, began to openly claim leadership in the Middle East.  By mid-1956, with his support, the joint command of the troops of Syria, Jordan and Egypt was formed.  Preparations for the war with Israel began. </p><p>  The Suez crisis escalated.  Nasser's actions were troubled in Paris and London.  At the same time, these countries could not begin to actively express indignation, since this did not suit America. </p><p>  As a result, a secret plan was developed.  Its essence was that Israeli troops would invade Egypt.  London and Paris will propose an end to hostilities.  If at least one of the parties refuses, then the allied forces (Anglo-French) will begin to take appropriate measures to ensure the security of the Suez Canal.  After the approval of the plan, systematic preparation for its implementation began. </p><p>  The invasion began in 1965, on October 29.  By November 5, Israeli troops had occupied the entire <span>Sinai Peninsula.</span>  Subsequently, active attacks, bombing, and landing operations began. </p><p>  The USSR was able to stop the Suez crisis.  On November 5, the Soviet government sent telegrams to the heads of government of Israel, France and England.  They pointed out that the war with Nasser could go to the Third World War, in which "rocket technology" could be used.  Thus, the USSR did not exclude the possibility of a forceful <span>resolution of the conflict.</span>  The Soviet Union was ready to take extreme measures in order to eliminate the Suez crisis. </p><p>  As a result, on November 8, all hostilities were stopped. </p>
