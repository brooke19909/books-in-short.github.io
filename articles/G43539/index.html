Flocking in packs, they steal part of the grain stocks and crops.  But city dwellers can also suffer from neighborhood with some birds.  For example, voiced twitter under the window in the early morning or ‚Äúbombardment‚Äù of parking lots can become unbearable for a person. </p><h2>  Ways to control feathered pests </h2><p>  The most humane and appropriate way to deal with this problem is to scare away birds.  Today, the market offers many devices that are designed specifically for this purpose.  It can be noted that there is no universal device, and crows may not be afraid of what gulls react to.  Therefore, bird repellents differ from each other by the principle of operation and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimpact.  The main types of devices and their features are described below. </p><h2>  Ultrasonic repeller </h2>

Usually they choose it, because in the price category it is the most affordable, it is easy to install and operate.  During his work, he does not create discomfort for humans and at the same time affects birds and, possibly, rodents.  The bottom line is that animals and birds perceive a greater sound range than the human ear (up to 20 KHz), and therefore those signals that we do not hear or perceive at all have a frightening effect on birds.  The oscillation of ultrasonic frequencies causes them to fear a possible danger, and the <span>instinct of self-preservation</span> does not allow them to settle in this place.  If you turn on the device and wait three weeks, all the birds that wanted to settle here will leave these places forever.  If the device is equipped with automatic frequency switching, this will also affect rodents, as they will not be able to get used to one stable signal.

The specifics of ultrasound allows you to cover a small area.  Usually its protection extends to 600 square meters.  meters.  If this is a completely inexpensive device, the area that it protects barely reaches 100 square meters.  meters.  Therefore, the ultrasonic bird repeller is suitable for use in small garden areas, gardens, hangars, garages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bird repeller wk 0020" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1040677.jpg" width="585"></div>

    <p>  It is also important to consider the location of its installation, because ultrasound is not able to penetrate through partitions, walls and glass.  When <span>this sound</span> reaches an obstacle, it is reflected from it, therefore the device ‚Äúworks out‚Äù only open places well. </p><h2>  Modified Ultrasound Devices </h2><p>  Some <span>ultrasonic bird repellents</span> have an increased effect on ‚Äúuninvited guests‚Äù.  They are equipped with light devices and motion sensors (to save energy).  Together, light and ultrasound at short distances provide maximum efficiency.  But such devices are best purchased if people or vehicles do not often pass in the coverage area.  Although some devices have the ability to configure against false alarms or the ability to disable this feature at certain hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bioacoustic repellers </h2><p>  This type of instrument imitates the sounds of birds warning about the danger or cries of <span>birds of prey.</span>  These devices cover the territory much more than ultrasonic counterparts, since there is the possibility of the simultaneous inclusion of several emitters.  Also, the sound bird repeller has a robust construction, which allows it to be used in various weather conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sound bird repeller" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1040665.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The disadvantages include the fact that these devices are narrowly targeted, that is, they repel only a certain type of bird.  Other groups of birds may not respond at all to these sounds.  But if you find a good manufacturer, you can order an individual device from those ‚Äúpests‚Äù that prevail in your area. </p><h2>  Laser repellers </h2><p>  This type of device is mainly used in large enterprises, for example, in airports.  Their work requires the constant participation of a person, but of all these birds repellers are considered the most effective.  The bird perceives a bright, rapidly moving beam as a threat to life.  Laser handheld devices are expensive and considered professional. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bird repellers" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1040663.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are stationary installations, and they are used offline.  But in the daytime they are indiscriminate and ineffective.  Such devices are suitable for those places where ultrasonic repellers are not able to cover the territory, and the use of bioacoustic devices is unacceptable. </p><h2>  Propane guns </h2><p>  These devices scare away all birds and animals with the sound of a noisy shot.  The gun fires at the set time and works from a propane cylinder.  Although there is no need for installation, the cylinder is periodically required to be replaced.  The shots are very noisy, so these repellers are mainly used in fields and other farms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bird repellers reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1040664.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Complex repellers </h2><p>  Universal types of devices for repelling birds usually combine in their device several of the above characteristics.  Often you can see a device that, in addition to ultrasound, includes bioacoustics.  Manufacturers claim that the advantage of these repellers is the high probability that birds will not settle near your site if they do not succumb to fear from sound vibrations, perhaps they are affected by the cry of other birds.  But such devices, as a rule, have large dimensions, significant power consumption and low efficiency.  In addition, the cost of upgraded devices is much higher than that of narrowly targeted repellers. </p><h2>  Popular repellers </h2><p>  Having examined the main categories of devices for repelling birds, we can assume which type of devices is most relevant in your situation.  So, among ultrasonic devices there is a bird repeller "WK-0020".  The waves sent by this device are not captured by pets, and at the same time they are heard by birds such as starlings, crows, pigeons, and sparrows.  The device can be installed on the balcony, attic, near the garage, in a small utility room.  To work, he needs two batteries (finger-type). </p><h2>  Bird scarers: people reviews </h2>

But, unfortunately, many were disappointed, since they do not act on most birds.  For example, the LS-2001 sound bird repeller imitates the screams of a <span>hawk, an owl</span> and a falcon, but city sparrows and other daredevils, as it turned out, are not afraid of them and can sit quietly cooing near a ‚Äúsound-exhausting‚Äù device.  Therefore, for the device to be effective, it is necessary to know exactly which birds are afraid of certain predators.  For example, outside the city, starlings know what a predator is and really fall, clinging to the ground.

    <p>  Some owners also recommend a careful approach to the choice of ultrasonic devices, as they have seen from their own experience that brave pigeons are not only not afraid of these sounds, but, on the contrary, flock to them and try to sit as close to them as possible. </p><p>  If you decide to purchase a bird repeller, try to carefully approach his choice and find out more precisely which birds he acts on.  Also, do not believe the promises of advertising, since most devices are not able to drive away all types of birds. </p>
