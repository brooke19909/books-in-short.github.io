    <h2>  A few words about the manufacturer </h2><p>  The company during the launch of its low-cost box with an integrated Eleaf iStick battery made a lot of noise.  At that time, this device was presented as a replacement for the mods with low-power batteries that were already boring to almost all customers.  Of course, the new device had its drawbacks and problems, but it quickly became popular among potential owners.  After this device sold out and began to be considered successful products, the manufacturer immediately released three different modifications: iStick 30W, iStick Mini and iStick 50W.  The latter device was more popular than the previous ones, as it had very small dimensions, but a good battery capacity.  It is a capacity of 4400 mAh.  The disadvantage of this device was that some revisions were characterized by poor assembly, however, it was always possible to additionally purchase a special mod operating from 0.2 Ohm.  Among the advantages, it is noted that there is no need to spend on buying an additional external battery.  That is why this model has become more popular, moreover, it is inexpensive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eleaf istick 100w firmware" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2074094.jpg"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Related models </h2><p>  After that, another good device was released, which was called iStick TC40W.  The popularity of the model was brought by the fact that it has the possibility of thermal control.  Moreover, this is the first product from the entire range of the company, which received a removable battery.  It is rated at 100 volts.  Many owners of this device are happy with the purchase.  This is due to unpretentiousness in care, and with a small price.  This article will describe the device, which is already the ninth in the lineup from the company.  It is called Eleaf iStick 100W. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eleaf istick 100w tc firmware" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2074095.jpg"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance and Ergonomics </h2><p>  We continue the review of the Eleaf iStick 100W.  The device weighs 180 g. It uses a 25 amp battery.  And you can buy a battery that has more power.  Several operating modes are built in.  The power range varies from 1 to 100 watts.  If you use the newer firmware Eleaf iStick 100W TC, then this figure increases to 120 volts.  Support impedance up to 1.5 ohm.  If you work in the varivatt mode, then this indicator will become larger - it will rise to 3.5 ohms.  The temperature is adjustable.  The maximum range is 315 degrees. </p><p>  Sold in 3 color options.  It is about gray, black and white.  Separately, you can purchase covers in different colors.  They are easily installed on the mod.  However, there are only those shades on sale in which the device itself is presented.  That is, you can buy only the same black, gray and white options. </p><p>  The appearance of the device is very similar to its predecessors, which are already familiar to many customers.  The edges are rounded, pleasant to the touch, the screen is in the center of the case.  The differences between them are only in a removable battery.  Boxing looks pretty nice, this is due to the fact that there are no chrome inserts of a glossy type.  Unfortunately, in previous models, these parts were too easily covered with scratches, which brought unpleasant impressions to the owners.  Matte finish, slightly roughened.  In the hands of the device does not slip and fingerprints are invisible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eleaf istick 100w review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2074097.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  There are no fasteners, there are four bolts with which the body is assembled.  All of them are hidden in the battery compartments.  The design looks monolithic.  On the top of the device is a connector, as well as a lock key.  The first part does not cause any problems, the steel thread.  The connector is slightly recessed into the case, which judging by the reviews on the Eleaf iStick 100W, customers did not like it.  Most prefer the part slightly raised above the structures.  However, this is a matter of taste, and it is impossible to attribute this moment to critical minuses. </p><p>  Fire lock key mechanical type.  The first time after the purchase, it will move with effort, it may also jam slightly.  However, after a few days, the button will work stably and smoothly.  You need to make sure that she does not loose and does not go by itself.  The lock is carried out by this key due to the moving protrusions.  Thanks to them, the lid does not press a button.  However, buyers believe that this decision is a little risky.  But if you do not like such functionality, then you can turn off the device the old fashioned way.  It is about fivefold pressing a key. </p><p>  The Fire button on the Eleaf iStick 100W is a bit unusual for this company's assortment.  It is pressed thanks to the cover, which is located to the left of the display.  The move is reliable, but the key is soft.  It‚Äôs not necessary to press on the entire surface, because it works quite quickly.  It is located in the battery compartment and the lid magnet acts on it.  Therefore, it does not matter how a person holds a mod in his hand.  You can only squeeze the device a little and pressing will happen.  Key operation is always very clear.  This decision is considered by many buyers to be quite successful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eleaf istick 100w reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2074098.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Functional </h2><p>  The screen on this device is typical, standard for the manufacturer.  However, the display is as informative as possible.  All modes have a graphical display of the battery charge.  To switch between them you need to hold the menu key.  Scrolling through the interface in a circle.  One feature of the device should be noted: if the resistance of the coil exceeds 1.5 Ohms, then all modes, except for several options, will become unavailable for use. </p><h2>  Modes </h2><p>  If you switch to a varivatt, then the screen will display power, resistance, voltage and some other set indicators.  If you click on Fire, the timer will start working, it does not exceed 10 seconds.  After the expiration of the time, the power that is currently set is displayed.  The manufacturer, although talking about the limitations of 75 watts with the battery installed, you can always exceed this indicator, if necessary.  Many buyers are trying to set 100 watts.  However, the device will immediately display an error message.  If the new Eleaf iStick 100W firmware comes out, many hope that this problem will be fixed in it.  If the voltage is within 9 volts, then the power cannot be raised.  When switching to the mechmod mode, the screen will show the resistance of the spiral and the state of the battery.  It's comfortable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="box mod eleaf istick 100w" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2074099.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Impressions </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that the impression of using the Eleaf <span>iStick 100W mod is</span> ambiguous.  Owners often notice: the appearance of the device is very pleasant, the unusual key is comfortable.  The coating is quite strong, the mod will not scratch quickly, however, bare metal can be seen on the edges after a week of use.  Therefore, talking about a long-lasting paint is not necessary.  The functionality of this device is in no way inferior to top solutions from other more popular manufacturers.  Thermal control works quickly and correctly.  The fee is sometimes wrong, but most of the indicators are correct. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The box mod Eleaf iStick 100W does not have any serious flaws, but still some critical points exist.  For example, the lid button sometimes works quite poorly, in addition, the device can also heat up, while not being in operation mode.  Many buyers notice this, but experts assure that this is more like a marriage in the party, but not the pattern for this product. </p><p>  Buyers notice that with the existing shortcomings, many use this mod.  It is convenient, easy to operate and does not cause any problems.  Malfunctions are extremely rare. </p>
