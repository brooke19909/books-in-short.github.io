    <p>  In 2015, 2 transactions of sale of certificates that were not traded on the market were completed.  One profit amounted to 300 thousand rubles, and the second - a loss of 25 thousand rubles.  In this situation, the basis for calculating the tax will be the total financial result: 300 - 25 = 275 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Circulation of bills </h2><p>  The financial result from transactions with such securities is determined by the method described above: the sum of all costs is deducted from sales revenue.  According to the Tax Code, the loss from the sale of promissory notes and other securities received in the previous period may reduce the tax base for transactions with similar certificates in the current period.  It follows from this that the profit from the main activity cannot be reduced by a negative financial result from transactions with the Central Bank. </p><p>  A bill can be presented for payment ahead of schedule.  To <span>account for the financial result</span> of operations such as transactions with the Central Bank, it is necessary that the promissory notes be acquired as the Central Bank.  That is, there must be a document confirming the fact of the sale of the certificate for money. </p><p>  If the bill was received as a means of payment, then there is no financial result from operations to repay it.  Organizations cannot calculate the separately taxable base for such transactions and attribute the discount amount to losses. </p><h2>  Compensation </h2><p>  The Tax Code of the Russian Federation provides for individuals the opportunity to transfer a negative financial result to the following tax periods for the Central Bank, which circulate in the market.  Losses on operations reduce the base for <span>calculating personal income tax.</span>  Amounts not taken into account in the current year may be carried forward to the next year in whole or in part.  The same cost figure can be reduced nine times. </p>

    <p>  There are also cases where the premium is assigned separately to each group of goods.  Then the formula for calculating gross income will be: </p><p>  <em>VD = (Turnover (1) x Markup + ... + Turnover (n) x Markup) / 100</em> </p><p>  The balance of goods at the beginning of the month is 16.8 thousand rubles.  Received products in the amount of 33.2 thousand rubles.  Commodity margin is 39% on the balance of goods and 26% on new arrivals.  Sales revenue - 50,000 rubles.  (including VAT - 7627 rubles).  Cost of sales - 3000 rubles. </p><p>  Calculate the trading margin: </p><p>  - for the first group of goods: 39 / (100 + 39) = 28.06%; <br>  - for the second group of goods: 26 / (100 + 26) = 20.64%. </p><p>  Gross income for the month will be: </p><p>  16.8 x 0.2806 + 33.2 x 0.2064) / 100 = 11 564 rubles. </p><p>  We display this data in the control unit: </p><ul><li>  DT50 KT90-1 - 50,000 - revenue is reflected. </li><li>  DT90-3 KT68 - 7627 - VAT included. </li><li>  DT90-2 KT42 - 11564 - written off trade margin. </li><li>  DT90-2 KT41 - 50,000‚Äì the cost of sales has been written off. </li><li>  DT90-2 KT44 - 3000 - expenses included. </li><li>  DT90-9 KT99 - profit from sales: 50 000 - 7627‚Äì (‚Äì11 564) - 50 000 - 3000 = 937 rubles. </li></ul><p>  To calculate the NPP, you need to know the purchase value of the goods.  It is calculated based on the value of the trade margin.  But the results of calculations in tax and accounting may vary.  For example, interest on the use of credit in BU is accounted for in the cost of production, and in NU - are allocated to non-operating expenses. </p>
