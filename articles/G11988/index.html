    <p>  This corner of Samara, located in the Soviet district, has long been a rather miserable sight.  The two small lakes located here are overgrown with mud and become more like huge muddy puddles than recreation places for citizens. </p><p>  Situated around the lakes, the Chernovy Gardens, famous in the recent past, famous for their apple trees, became desolate, and the apple trees themselves went wild.  In general, the appearance of this ‚Äúcorner of the wild‚Äù was in sharp disharmony with the flowering appearance of the young Soviet region. </p><p>  It was then that the leadership of the city and the region decided to turn this site into a park of culture and recreation, timed the event to coincide with the thirtieth anniversary of the Great Victory.  True, it was not possible to meet the deadlines by 1975, but two years later the grand opening of Victory Park in Samara took place. </p><h2>  From opening to the present day </h2>

Of course, every year on the eve of the Victory Day it was redecorated, but over time this cozy green corner became more and more decrepit.  Victory Park (Samara), a photo of which at the end of the 2000s went around all local publications, was a rather dull sight. </p><p>  It was then that at the highest regional level, it was decided to radically reconstruct the entire park complex.  All work was completed on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Great Victory, when the Victory Park (Samara) was opened in a festive atmosphere. </p><h2>  Victory Park in Samara: how to get there? </h2>

    <p>  A culture and recreation park, broken in honor of the thirtieth anniversary of the Victory of our grandfathers and great-grandfathers in the Great Patriotic War, is located in a very picturesque place, which attracts residents not only from neighboring quarters, but also from the most remote areas of the city. </p><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that, despite the relative youth, the park managed to maintain the atmosphere of an ancient place, which we read with envy in the works of Oscar Wilde and Leo Tolstoy.  A huge role in creating this surroundings is played by two ancient lakes, along the banks of which ducks like to settle. </p><p>  A stunning impression is created by the magnificent <span>linden alley,</span> which leads to the very center of the park.  At the reopening on May 7, 2015, Victory Park (Samara) acquired another alley, which was planted together by the first persons of the city and region, war and labor front veterans, as well as radio and television stars and honorary residents. </p><h2>  Monuments and memorials </h2>

    <p>  Originality and originality of the Victory Park is given by the monuments and monuments located here.  Back in 1977, a memorial dedicated to the heroes of the Great Patriotic War was erected here, a memorial obelisk dedicated to the front-line soldiers of Samara and the Samara region, the Eternal Flame was lit. </p><p>  In the harsh 1990s, the leadership of the city and the region managed to find funds to erect a wonderful building right in the center of the park - a majestic monument dedicated to immigrants from the region who took part in the famous <span>Victory Day parade</span> in Moscow in June 1945, a little more months after signing unconditional surrender.  He, like all other military monuments, always has fresh flowers. </p><p>  A special attitude is observed by the Samara people to the Palace of Veterans, erected as soon as possible in 2001.  This is a three-story modern building where visitors can not only communicate with each other, but also use the services of the local library, radio center and cafe.  There is also a small museum where visitors are told about the history of the local veteran movement. </p><p>  Monuments in Victory Park in Samara include, in addition to the above-mentioned monuments, another monument to the famous general Dmitry Karbyshev, who during the years of the war, in the face of monstrous torture, was faithful to this oath and did not betray his comrades. </p><p>  There is a place in the park where tears welling themselves.  This is a memorial opened eight years ago dedicated to minors who found their death behind the barbed wire of Nazi concentration camps.  Next to this touching place is a chapel in honor of Saints Boris and Gleb. </p><h2>  Military equipment - an interesting pastime for adults and children </h2>
