The standard of living and the main attractions of the state</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Qatar is a country whose existence some inhabitants of the planet are not even aware of.  But it was she who in 2015 was recognized by the International Monetary Fund the richest state in the world.  After this news, many wondered: where, in fact, is the country of Qatar?  You will find photos and descriptions of this amazing state in our article.  In addition, we will focus on the tourist attractions of Qatar. </p><h2>  Qatar - the country of the richest people </h2><p>  Today, this state is really at everyone's hearing.  After all, it was recognized by the International Monetary Fund the richest in the world!  The level of GDP per capita here is over $ 90,000.  The inhabitants of this country themselves do not know what unemployment and poverty are.  And the name of this state is Qatar. </p><p>  Which country in the world can still boast of such economic indicators?  For comparison: even in a very prosperous UK, per capita GDP barely reaches 45 thousand dollars.  But in Qatar, according to experts, this figure will reach 112 thousand next year. </p>

    <p>  What is the secret of such wealth and prosperity?  The simple answer is in oil.  Its reserves are so large that the inhabitants of the two millionth Qatar can literally afford to swim in it.  In addition, the country is also actively producing natural gas.  Of course, all these natural riches will someday end.  Therefore, what this state will be like in 100-200 years is not known.  But today, Qatar is a rich country, the well-being of which many envy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Finding this amazing state on the map is very difficult.  Although Herodotus wrote about him in his writings.  The next section will focus on the geography of Qatar. </p><h2>  Brief geography of Qatar </h2><p>  Where is Qatar located?  The state is located in the Middle East, on the shores of the Persian Gulf.  If you carefully look at the map below, then a tiny point in the center of the black circle - this will be the state of Qatar. </p>

    <p>  Previously, this country was only one of the British colonies.  However, in 1971, it gained sovereignty.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãmodern Qatar is only 11.5 thousand square kilometers.  No more than two million people live here, with almost three times as many men as women. </p><p>  Qatar is a country with rather difficult climatic conditions.  Summer is very dry and hot, the temperature sometimes rises to + 45 ... 50 degrees Celsius.  Almost the entire territory of Qatar is a desert with a very scarce flora and fauna.  There are no natural streams with a constant flow; drinking water is obtained here by desalination of sea water. </p><p>  Qatar is an absolute monarchy, the <span>head of state</span> is the emir.  Any political parties or <span>trade union organizations</span> are prohibited here <span>.</span>  The basis of the country's economy is oil production and refining, metallurgical and chemical industries.  Agriculture is very poorly developed and does not meet the internal needs of the <span>population of Qatar.</span>  Some vegetables are grown in oases; goats and camels are bred. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The armed forces of Qatar are about 12,000.  At the same time, the country is closely cooperating in the military sphere with the United States.  One of the four overseas centers of the United States Army is stationed here. </p><h2>  Qatar's <span>standard of living</span> </h2><p>  Looking through the photographs of the cities of Qatar, it is difficult to believe that this is exactly what they look like in reality.  The ‚ÄúPearl of the Future" is often called this Arab state.  The current standard of living in Qatar can be outlined by several of the most important features.  This is first of all: </p><ul><li>  high level of well-being of citizens; </li><li>  almost zero unemployment rate; </li><li>  free education and medicine; </li><li>  very low crime. </li></ul><p>  The salaries of the local population are really very high.  True, life in Qatar is not cheap.  So, for renting small apartments here you have to pay about 3000-4000 dollars a month.  Utilities are relatively cheap - $ 200-300 per month.  Lunch in an inexpensive cafe or restaurant costs about 30-50 dollars. </p>

    <p>  Today, Qatar is actively preparing for the upcoming World Cup, the right to host which it received in 2022.  In Doha, 12 football stadiums are being built, the transport system of the city is being modernized. </p><h2>  The main tourist attractions of the country </h2><p>  The most popular tourist destination is the National Museum of Qatar, which amazes all its visitors with a huge aquarium in two levels.  Many visitors to the country book a jeep safari, which includes a visit to the real Bedouin camp.  Travelers with children must go to Palm Island or to the local Kingdom of Aladdin. </p><p>  Twenty kilometers from the capital of Qatar is the most beautiful Umm-Salal-Mohammed fort - a snow-white <span>fortification</span> with two towers and an ancient mosque. </p><p>  Another important attraction of Qatar is its national cuisine.  In this <span>Arab country,</span> you will not be served pork, but in any restaurant you can taste delicious and varied dishes from all other types of meat.  A distinctive feature of Qatari cuisine is the abundance of herbs and aromatic spices. </p><h2>  Doha - the capital of Qatar </h2><p>  Almost 90% of the country's total population lives in the capital of Qatar.  This is a traditional Arab city, but significantly modernized.  Here, a tourist can explore the ancient houses built in the Arabic style, taste delicious meat dishes or attend a colorful action - camel races. </p><p>  Special attention should be paid to the museums of the capital, among which the Ethnographic Museum occupies a special place.  It is located in a traditional Qatari building and tells about the life and life of local residents before the ‚Äúoil boom‚Äù. </p>

On them you can buy spices, dishes and souvenirs, and even exotic animals! </p><h2>  Finally‚Ä¶ </h2><p>  Qatar is a country in the Middle East whose inhabitants do not know what poverty and unemployment are.
