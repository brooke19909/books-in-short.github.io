    <p>  The hotel, which today is called St. Petersburg, was first called Leningrad.  Its construction in the period from 1967 to 1970 was a real breakthrough in the field of construction of hotels of that time.  The authors of the individual project of this building were: V. E. Struzman, N. V. Kamensky and S. B. Speransky, and the construction was carried out by Yugoslav workers who used only advanced technologies for those years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of the hotel St. Petersburg </h2><p>  During its existence, the St. Petersburg Hotel (Pirogovskaya Naberezhnaya, 5/2) has hosted a lot of celebrities.  It became the first place in Russia where new types of breakfasts were introduced: continental and buffet-style.  Also, there were many very important meetings, events and conferences. </p><p>  For example, in 1986, it was in the walls of this hotel that the second part of the world championship match was held, in which Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov competed.
