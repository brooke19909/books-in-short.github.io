And the best place in this paradise is considered to be the island of Phuket.  Its climate, nature, infrastructure give the tourist everything that is needed to complete the vacation: relaxation, entertainment, attractions.  Rest in Phuket in August has its own specifics, which we will talk about. </p><h2>  Geography </h2><p>  The Thai island of Phuket is located in the south-west of the country, it is washed from all sides by the waters of the <span>Andaman Sea,</span> which is part of the Indian Ocean.  Landscapes and landscapes are real natural masterpieces.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island is just over 540 square meters.  km  Administratively, the province of Phuket includes, in addition to the main island, an archipelago of 32 small islands.  Almost all of them are inhabited. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in phuket in august" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/1399247.jpg" width="400"></div>  The highest point in Phuket is Mai Thau Sip Song Mountain.  On its slope you can see a beautiful waterfall.  Groves of <span>rubber trees</span> and coconut palms grow on the plains.  Most of the forests on the island are cut down by man, the remaining tropical jungle is protected and are part of the national park.

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The island is located in the tropical <span>monsoon climate zone.</span>  The average annual temperature is 28 degrees heat.  Seasonal temperature fluctuations are only 3 degrees.  As in any tropical region, only two seasons stand out in Phuket: dry and wet.  The first lasts from November to April, the second - from May to October.  Most rainfall occurs in July and September, when sunshine is significantly reduced. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in phuket in july august" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/1399262.jpg" width="600"></div>  Therefore, vacation in Phuket in July-August can be complicated by rains.  The high season on the island falls on February-April, when the largest influx of tourists is observed here.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Weather in August </h2><p>  Phuket is a tropical island, so the weather here can be subject to sharp shifts at any time of the year.  So, typhoons in this region are unpredictable and not tied to the seasons.  Otherwise, the weather in August is predictable.  Despite the fact that the end of summer in Phuket is a wet season, one should not expect the same hopeless rains as in St. Petersburg.  It usually rains at night, although it can sometimes be observed during the day.  But most often it is fast and in an hour nothing reminds of it.  However, it can rain every day, but to a greater extent this is typical for July.  Thus, a vacation in Phuket in August can be quite successful, and small precipitation will not become an obstacle, because the temperature at this time is comfortable. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The island has a long history of development.  At the beginning of the first millennium, he was part of the ancient empire of Dvaravati.  Its good location on the trade routes from India to China made Phuket a permanent stopping point for ships.  Already in the Middle Ages in ship logs there were records of parking on an island in the Indian Ocean, there is also a schematic representation of it on old maps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays with children in phuket in august" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/1399261.jpg" width="500"></div>  In the second half of the 16th century, the Dutch created their own port for trade here.  In the 17th century, many European states came here for the extraction of rubber and tin.  The island is in the possession of the Thai king, but he gives part of the territories to the development of the Europeans.  Later, for several centuries, Phuket was shaken by wars for power, but the rulers of Siam almost always won.  At the end of the 19th century, these lands were flooded with Chinese workers who raised the last riot.  Since then, there has been peace and silence.  In 1933, Phuket received the status of the center of the province.

The number of sunny days reaches 300. But the island is an ideal place not only for beach holidays, but also for <span>educational tourism,</span> because over the years of long history a lot of interesting things have accumulated here.  In addition, there are various opportunities for entertainment in this place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in phuket in august what to do" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/1399248.jpg" width="600"></div>  The island is different in that it has a very high level of service.  Hotels, beaches, cafes and restaurants - all meet the highest international standards.  August refers to the low season, and at this time, prices for many services and meals are reduced, although not very significantly, but you can still save the budget.  Therefore, Phuket in August, the features of the rest on which favorably distinguishes it from the resorts of the east coast, becomes a favorite place for discerning European tourists.

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Phuket has several places worth visiting.  In addition, the island is connected to the mainland by three bridges, and you can go to the "mainland" to see local attractions.  This corner is an example of beautiful tropical nature, so most of the interesting places are reserves and parks. </p><p>  All tourists should see a magnificent aquarium with a spectacular tunnel that simulates a walk along the seabed.  Sirinat Park on the seashore combines several pleasures at once: a walk through the pristine rainforest, relaxation on a wild beach and a water park.  You can even stay here for a few days to fully experience the immersion in the virgin nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket in August vacation features" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/1399260.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To get acquainted with unusual Thai culture and traditions, you should visit the village, where various shows are held, artisans work and tastings of national dishes are held.  A separate cognitive part is a visit to Buddhist temples, the most famous of which is considered to be Wat Chalong.  Excursions will make a beach holiday in Phuket in August more interesting and informative. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  In Thailand, tourists primarily go to lie on the beach.  The coastline here is very long, sandy beaches and turquoise water - this is a real paradise for vacationers.  However, in the low season, high waves come here, and therefore in August Phuket, whose beaches are washed by the waters of the Adaman Sea, is not always suitable for a relaxing swim.  At the same time, sandy beaches and pools can always correct the situation on windy days. </p><p>  Of the 15 <span>beaches in Phuket, the</span> most famous is Patong.  It is well equipped, along the coast stretches a whole series of shops and cafes.  But there are always a lot of people here, and this reduces the pleasure of relaxation.  The most enjoyable in August is Nai Harn beach with white creaking sand and a gentle slope into the water.  There are the lowest waves at the end of summer.  Therefore, a vacation with children in Phuket in August is worth planning, counting on this particular beach.  Also, for tourists with kids, Karon and Kata beaches, the cleanest on the island, are suitable. </p><h2>  Things to do </h2><p>  When thinking about how to plan a vacation in Phuket in August, what to do on the island, it is worth remembering that there are a lot of entertainments for every taste.  This is a variety of shows, tours, water attractions and attractions.  Separately, it should be said about the local cuisine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket in August beaches" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/1400470.jpg" width="600"></div>  Tasting different dishes can turn into a real adventure, moreover, safe for the stomach.  Food in Phuket is always fresh.  Thailand is also a great place to take care of your health and beauty.  Spas, massages are simply excellent.

    <h2>  Opinions of tourists </h2><p>  Rest in Phuket in August, according to tourists, is wonderful, you just have to tune in advance that it can rain and there can be high waves.  But almost all hotels have pools where you can swim with no less pleasure.  Travelers note that in August there are fewer people on the island, and this allows you to enjoy a secluded vacation at lower prices. </p>
