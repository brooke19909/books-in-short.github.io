The last month of autumn can be a great start to the holiday season.  Especially when it comes to Sri Lanka.  Here at this time is the height of the tourist season.  But not all of Sri Lanka's coast is suitable for relaxing in late autumn.  In some areas it can rain, in others rainfall is much less common.  Nevertheless, the resorts are always a huge number of tourists.  Rains in the tropics tend to end quickly.  They are immediately replaced by the gentle sun. </p><h2>  Features of rest in November </h2>

    <p>  Sri Lanka in November is an ideal place for a budget holiday.  At this time, the season here is just beginning, so prices have not yet managed to rise. </p><p>  In some countries, November is already very cold and dank, but not in Sri Lanka.  It is hot and sunny.  But this is a completely different heat, not scorching and not burning.  Nevertheless, the temperature can reach 30 degrees. </p><p>  The hottest on the west coast.  This is where many beautiful resorts are located.  But in these places the heat will not cause inconvenience.  Tourists are saved from it by sea breezes. </p><p>  The Indian Ocean is famous for its warm waters at any time of the year and on any coast.  Water temperature fluctuates within 28 degrees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to do in autumn in Sri Lanka </h2>

    <p>  What do those who happen to be there say about the Serendipity Hotel Beach?  Opinions of tourists differ, but they are all more positive than vice versa.  In any case, it all depends on the subjective idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa person about a comfortable rest.  Guests at The Serendipity Hotel Beach 3 liked its location near the beach.  Just a few minutes walk - and you will find yourself in a clean, well-groomed beach area.  Within walking distance there is a supermarket and a kiosk with local fruits.  Those who like to skip a glass of fine wine at lunch or dinner will be happy, because just a few steps from The Serendipity Hotel Beach (Unawatuna) 3 * there is the Weinstor store. </p><p>  Tourists say that in the main building the rooms are much more spacious and comfortable.  Special thanks to The Serendipity Hotel Beach (Sri Lanka) are expressed by opponents of nicotine.  After all, there are separate rooms for them.  You can book excursions on site.  There is a bureau on site.  So it will be much cheaper than arranging an excursion tour through a tour operator. </p><p>  With small children it is better not to go here.  There are no conditions for children's recreation.  The hotel is ideal for a romantic trip or a family relaxing holiday.  Active entertainment is also not here.  A three-star hotel is more like a guesthouse, but it does not spoil it at all, on the contrary, there is a pleasant atmosphere of home comfort and warmth.  The staff is polite, but practically does not speak Russian. </p><p>  When checking in, they require a deposit, when leaving the hotel they give it.  Teenagers from 16 years old can register on their own. </p><p>  The hotel is not easy to find.  It is located a little in depth, but locals know him well and will gladly tell you its location.  To avoid wasting time searching, you can order a transfer from the airport to the hotel, which is available around the clock. </p><p>  Sri Lanka is an island of tropical paradise.  The end of autumn is especially beautiful here.  Do not postpone the trip until next year.  Even in November, you can have a wonderful vacation on the warm sea coast. </p>
