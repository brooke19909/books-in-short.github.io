    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  The massif is divided by the saddle of the mountains into the South Demerdzhi, located at an altitude of 1,239 m above sea level, and the North Demerdzhi, whose area is much larger and the height is 1,356 m. It is interesting that the geological structure of the two "neighbors" is different.  The northern mountain consists of the so-called marble-like limestones.  South is multilayered and composed of limestone and conglomerates, which are rocks cemented over millions of years, consisting of pebbles, sandstones, clay, rock fragments.  But what is of particular interest to scientists is the droplets of small stones of red granite and quartzite in these rocks.  Their age is determined by about a billion years, while clay, limestones, and sandstones arose about 140‚Äì180 million years ago. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Title </h2><p>  Such an interesting object, which later became known as Mount Demerdzhi, has an older name - Funa, which is translated from Greek as "smoking".  Over time, it was forgotten, and people gave her a new one - Demerdzhi - "mountain blacksmith."  Under the influence of natural elements, stones break away from the massif, and when they fall, they create sounds very reminiscent of blows with an iron hammer.  The medieval ruins of a fortress located on a hill at the foot of the southern side of the mountain bear the same name. </p>

    <h2>  Settlements </h2><p>  Initially, there was a Christian settlement in the first half of the 9th century, located on the path of caravans and wanderers.  And the fortress and temple of St. Fyodor Tiron appeared later, approximately in the 15th century, and they were part of the defensive fortifications of the <span>Principality of Theodoro.</span>  The fortress was destroyed by the Turks, and the temple stood for a long time, until it finally collapsed.  This happened in the 20th century after the famous Yalta earthquake. </p><h2>  Great stone chaos </h2><p>  Mount Demerdzhi, the photo of which is contained in the article, has interesting places, and one of them is an impressive natural phenomenon - the so-called Great Stone Chaos.  It is a pile of multi-ton stone blocks, hiding the lower part of the huge, dotted with cracks, rocks.  The current appearance of the slope gave a powerful collapse that occurred in April 1894.  Limestone with pebbles and boulders, water, wind and time are the invisible builders of amazing stone "sculptures" located in the Ghost Valley on the southern slope, which is considered the main attraction of Demerdzhi. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The height of the mountain constantly challenges climbers.  The kingdom of stone is striking in its bizarre and diverse forms, reminiscent of an alien landscape.  It is especially interesting here on foggy days, and if imagination is played out, then for a few moments the pillars come to life and take the silhouette of either a person, or a fabulous animal or bird.  The higher up the hill, the figures have an increasingly unfinished look.  The most famous of them is the rock "Head of Catherine", named after Catherine II.  Although she actually has nothing to do with the image of the empress and has more to do with a man‚Äôs head.  Here is a paradise for artists and painters, because during the day the color background of the slope in the sun changes several times. </p>

    <h2>  The Broken Ghost </h2><p>  Another rare natural occurrence is the Broken Ghost.  It can be observed at sunrise from the side of such an object as Mount Demerdzhi.  It appears on both the north and south sides.  This phenomenon is unique.  From the side, it looks like a huge shadow that rises above the clouds. </p><h2>  Vegetable world </h2><p>  A variety of meadow vegetation prevails at the foot, and on the slopes there is a steppe with islands of forest, representatives of which are mainly long-stemmed pines, hornbeams and beeches.  From early spring to frost here, almost everything is covered with a carpet of various colors.  You can even meet the prickly tragacanth inherent in conglomerates.  The relief has karst forms, so karst cavities, fields, wells or funnels are often found. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  You can not miss the ancient cave of MAN, located on the northern slopes of Demerdzhi.  It is an old pagan altar.  Only on <span>the summer solstice the</span> light of the setting sun penetrates the cave entrance, revealing an amazing view of a niche in the middle of which is a stone in the form of an altar.  A cross and a pattern resembling a human face are scratched above it. </p><p>  Mount Demerdzhi will delight tourists with a beautiful waterfall.  It is located at an altitude of more than 800 m. This waterfall is called Jurla.  Its clear waters sparkle in the sunshine, revitalizing gloomy rocks.  But in the summer, especially in dry years, the waterfall almost dries up and a small stream remains. </p><p>  The Ulu-Uzen Vostochny river flows through the Hapkhal gorge, forming the Jur-Jur waterfall hidden from human eyes.  When you contemplate how water flows in huge streams, it seems that it breaks out from below by foamy streams. </p><h2>  Interest in grief </h2><p>  The diverse nature of the Crimean peninsula is easily recognized in many domestic films.  So, most episodes of the ‚ÄúCaucasian Captive‚Äù were filmed in the tract of such an object as Mount Demerdzhi.  Climbing a huge boulder (to which a staircase is carefully placed), you can try yourself in the role of Natalya Varley, singing the famous song called "Somewhere in the World".  Probably, everyone remembers Stepan from the film "Sportloto-82", which spoiled the pointer in this place.  Here grows the six-hundred-year-old tree ‚ÄúNikulin Nut,‚Äù from which the hero of Yuri Nikulin fell.  And wandering around the Valley of ghosts, you can recall the footage from the movie "Hearts of Three." </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  There is a pearl on the Crimean peninsula that attracts not only travelers from all over the world, but also scientists, researchers, film crews and photographers.  And she is called Demerdzhi (mountain).  How to get to this unique place?  You can come here by buses that depart from the bus station of Alushta, Partenit, Simferopol.  It is also proposed to travel by the picturesque trolleybus route No. 52 along the Simferopol - Yalta highway and get off at the stop ‚ÄúLuchisty Village‚Äù.  After passing through it, any tourist will be at the foot of South Demerdzhi, where the trek to the mountain begins.  Throughout the journey there are signs placed on trees and stones. </p>
