    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The city began to be built in 1734.  Initially, it was conceived as a fortress by the river Or, and it gave the name to the city.  A few years later he was moved to a new place, and then did it again.  People say about Orenburg that he was "conceived three times, born once."  Not every city in Russia can boast of this.  The final construction began in 1743, and it is considered the year of foundation.  At the end of the XVIII century it was besieged by the troops of Emelyan Pugachev. </p><p>  At first, the city was a fortress protecting other settlements from raids, but soon it also became a trading center between Russia and Central Asia.  And at the beginning of the 20th century, however, only a few years, was the capital of the Kyrgyz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. </p><h2>  Sights of Orenburg </h2><p>  The famous downy shawls and the story "Captain's Daughter" by A. S. Pushkin glorified the city throughout the world.  But there are many interesting places that worthily compete with the historical places of the central cities of Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

A cafe with national cuisine was built near each courtyard. </p><p>  And finally, <span>Gostiny Dvor</span> (Orenburg).  The trade monument is located in the city center, now it is one of the largest shopping complexes.  Its construction began simultaneously with the city.  The courtyard was a fortress surrounded by a stone wall.  Inside it were more than 100 shops and barns.  Trade was carried out at any time of the year, but the busiest was in the summer.  A large number of diverse products lured robbers from all nearby places.  No constipation, locks, security did not save the situation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the 20th century, the Bank of Russia issued a coin in denominations of 3 rubles, on which you can read "Gostiny Dvor, Orenburg". </p><p>  More than 200 meters in length and almost the same in width - this is the size of the most famous trading place of the city in ancient times, and now. </p><p>  Gostiny dvor (Orenburg) offers to attend various events: an exhibition of animals or agricultural production achievements.
