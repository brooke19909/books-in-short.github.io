Vacation Reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Tofinis Hotel (Cyprus), the reviews of which we will provide below, is actually a city Quartet.  It is located almost immediately near the center of Ayia Napa, and at the same time ten minutes walk from the sea.  Despite the fact that the hotel does not position itself as a luxurious palace, where tables break from dishes from morning to evening (only half board is practiced here), it is popular with people who come to rest.  Let's see how they characterize the Tofinis Hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel tofinis cyprus reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/307208.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Cyprus ... Reviews about this island, especially young people, always infect with positive.  And if we are talking about such a "party" resort, like Ayia Napa, and even more so.  Needless to say, the hotel, which is not so far from all the attractions - for example, the famous "Bridge of Lovers" - and at the same time at a sufficient distance from the never-falling clubs and discos, deserves praise.  And in the center, and in nature, among the greenery - this is how you can briefly describe the location of the hotel.  Even the fact that you had to go up the stairs to the beach did not bother vacationers in the Tofinis complex. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel (Cyprus, which is often mentioned by stones and cliffs, does not always please guests with sand) has a large, well-groomed shore, which is very rare in Ayia Napa.  And the very places for swimming were no worse than the advertised Nissi Beach.  Although this is an ordinary municipal sandy beach.  And, of course, the insanely beautiful color of the local waters leaves no one indifferent.  And the fact that the hotel is located on a hill means that from the windows of the rooms you can observe the famous Cypriot landscapes.  Some tourists even write that drinking soft drinks or tea on the balcony, from which you can see Cape Cavo Greco, where they take excursions, is one of the greatest pleasures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tofinis hotel cyprus reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/307213.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  What else is the Tofinis hotel good for?  Cyprus - reviews of vacationers are almost unanimous in this regard - it is famous for its cuisine.  And despite the fact that the guests here are mostly waiting for dinners and breakfasts, you can fully enjoy all the dishes that the island is famous for.  What is meat and vegetables - and salads seasoned with real extra virgin olive oil?  What about shrimp, oysters and lobsters?  What about <span>strawberries with cream</span> and croissants melting in your mouth?  In a word, vacationers in all seriousness claim that they left the restaurants not only well-fed, but also happy.  And we were glad that we arrived at the Tofinis Hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus Ayia Napa Tofinis Hotel" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/307721.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <p>  Cyprus - reviews about the beautiful and historical places of the island are whole odes - of course, worth a visit.  And this hotel is a convenient starting point for a variety of excursions.  Not far away is Protaras with its amazing fountains and the place where, according to legend, the goddess of love emerged from the sea - Paphos, which is on the list of the heritage of mankind.  Excursions, by the way, are advised to take from an urban travel agency, and not at a hotel - this is cheaper and more interesting.  A storm of delight is usually caused by donkey riding followed by a tasting of local wine. </p><p>  If we talk about living in the hotel itself, then the rooms are characterized as large and at the same time comfortable.  There you can relax after a noisy party, and after a gambling shopping, and after a tiring sun.  And the people here are lovely, good-natured, smiling.  Therefore, there are so many positive reviews about the trip to <span>Cyprus (Ayia Napa).</span>  Hotel Tofinis is often called a pleasant place where you want to return. </p>
