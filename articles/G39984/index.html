At different times they had a diverse look.  Knitted leggings can be both warm and openwork (from thin threads). </p><p>  Such an accessory is created quite simply.  It can be knitted with either knitting needles or crochet.  Leggings can be monotonous (from one thread) or colored.  When knitting, you can add various patterns.  Knitted leggings can be decorated with brooches, ribbons, pompons, beads or bugles. </p><p>  In the article you will be offered several options for schemes for creating a beautiful accessory in various ways. </p><p>  The first option is knitting.  Leg warmers can be knitted with either two or five knitting needles.  If you use two, then you will have one or two seams, and five - the leggings will be seamless. </p><p>  Scheme number 1 </p><p>  Seamless leggings. </p><p>  For knitting you will need: </p><p>  - knitting needles four millimeters thick; </p><p>  - a hook three millimeters thick; </p><p>  - yarn one hundred and fifty grams (black or any other). </p><p>  To start knitting leggings, you need to dial the required number of loops.  Forty-eight are enough for this scheme.  After a set of loops, you should distribute them on four knitting needles.  Each should have twelve.  How to do it?  After you have scored loops, from the very first row you start knitting an elastic band (two x two according to the scheme) and, thereby, distributing the loops over the knitting needles.  You should form a square of knitting needles with turns.  Given the first row (lashing), a total of one hundred rows of such a gum should be tied.  Then you need to knit a row with the addition of loops (for each knitting needle three pieces - a total of twelve).  This line is knitted with facial loops. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After adding, continue knitting gaiters with a hollow elastic band.  How to knit this way? </p><p>  The first row is knitted, like a simple gum, only according to the pattern (one x one).  The second is knitted as follows: the front loops are knitted like face coils, and the wrong ones are removed.  The thread that is being pulled must be in front of the work. </p><p>  Tritium and the subsequent rows are knitted as follows: the turns that are stretched are knitted with facial loops, and the knitted ones are stretched. </p><p>  Such knitted leggings can be decorated with openwork crochet ligature.  The first row is formed of dense single crochet, the second - every two single crochet, to which you need to add three air loops.  Third row - four <span>double crochets</span> (in place of the air loops from the previous line) and one air loop are knitted.  So to the end of the row. </p><p>  Scheme number 2 </p><p>  Leg warmers with one seam. </p><p>  On the knitting needles fifty loops.  A canvas is made in which one hundred to one hundred twenty rows should be obtained.  Knitting pattern: two faces on two wrong threads.  After the canvas is ready, it must be moistened with water and dried to shrink.  After that, it can be sewn.  This accessory can be decorated with a bright ribbon with bows in the place of the seam, so that it is less noticeable. </p><p>  As previously written, such stockings can also be crocheted.  You are offered one way to create an accessory. </p><p>  Scheme number 3 </p><p>  Openwork leggings. </p><p>  The required number of air loops is gathered (so that they can grasp the shin).  Cling to the ring. </p><p>  All rows fit like this: </p><p>  - three <span>columns with two double crochets</span> ; </p><p>  - three air loops; </p><p>  - three columns with two double crochets; </p><p>  -air loop. </p><p>  And so on until the end.  Thus, you need to act until your product acquires the desired length. </p><p>  In order for crocheted leggings to hold and not slip - you need to complete them with dense columns without crochets (ten centimeters). </p><p>  Each fashionista can tie her leggings on her own.  Knitting leggings takes very little time (two or three days).  But if it is simply not there, and an accessory is needed to complete your image - knitted leggings can be purchased at any women's clothing store. </p>
