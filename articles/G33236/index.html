Overview of the most popular Xiaomi smartphone models</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Xiaomi is a manufacturer of smartphones, the popularity of which is growing daily, despite their limited distribution outside of Asia.  Today, the company ranks fifth in the production of telephones in the world.  This fact can be called a great achievement, since the brand began to sell devices outside of China a short time ago.  The reviews about Xiaomi smartphones (Xiaomi) are impressive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="valuenomad.com.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mi4" class="if uuid-2971787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2971787.jpg"></div><p>  Everything indicates that Xiaomi intends to equal brands such as Apple and Samsung, rising to the highest circles of the phone market.  The company overtook Samsung and became one of the main brands in India in 2017, and is now gradually moving to the Russian and European markets.  What kind of company is this?  What are the unique qualities of the manufacturer of smartphones ‚ÄúXiaomi‚Äù (‚ÄúXiaomi‚Äù)? </p><h2>  Xiaomi is the fastest growing manufacturer in the world </h2><p>  As early as the first quarter of 2014, Xiomi (Xiaomi) released only 11 million smartphones, and almost all of them (97%) went on sale to China.  Today the company is a leader in many countries of Asia, and occupies a significant percentage in the smartphone markets in Russia and Europe.  The share of its products is increasing every year.  Therefore, Xiaomi can be called the fastest growing manufacturer of phones in the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  This is a young company founded by experienced professionals. </h2><p>  Xiaomi was founded just a few years ago, in April 2010.  It was created by eight partners, including Jun Lei, CEO and President of Bin Lin.  He was previously an employee at Kingsoft, the Chinese representative office of Microsoft-esque in China, and also led the company as CEO for a successful IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. </p><h2>  The secret of success is in upgrading the Android platform </h2><p>  One of the biggest differences between iOS and Android is that Android is open source software.  This means that any developer or company can freely use the main code base and modify it in different ways, while maintaining compatibility with hundreds of millions of Android applications.  For example, the Amazon's Fire tablet operating system is based on a highly modified version of Android.  Similarly, Xiaomi developed Android software called MIUI, and in October 2011 released its first M1 smartphone on this platform.  Unlike a small set of Android changes, a new version of MIUI is sent every week to a group of core testers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knowyourmobile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="good budget xiomi smartphone" class="if uuid-2971796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2971796.jpg"></div><h2>  Variety of products </h2><p>  Xiaomi has quickly diversified its product offerings, and is currently releasing a huge number of devices, including three different line-ups of Xiaomi models of smartphones: Redmi, Redmi Note, and Mi 3 (which was replaced by M4). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The company actively sells its products on the Internet, often releasing them in fairly small quantities.  This model means that a new batch of phones can be sold in seconds, creating hype and excitement around you.  This is especially noticeable compared to new releases of Apple products. </p><p>  Xiaomi has learned to intensively distribute advertising through social networks and spend much less on marketing than other manufacturers (for example, ‚ÄúXiaomi‚Äù (‚ÄúXiaomi‚Äù) allocates only 1% of advertising revenue versus 5% in Samsung).  This tactic allowed the company to supply high-quality smartphones at prices that middle-class users can afford. </p><h2>  Originality lies in the name of the company. </h2><p>  Officially, representatives of Xiaomi claim that their logo ‚ÄúMI‚Äù means ‚Äúmobile Internet‚Äù, or even ‚ÄúMission Impossible‚Äù, but this may be an advertising move.  In Chinese, Â∞èÁ±≥ (xiao mi) literally means ‚Äúsmall rice‚Äù or ‚Äúmillet‚Äù.  Some say that this is a reference to the famous leader Mao, in which the Communist Party, armed only with "millet and guns," sought to win.  This is a good analogy for a company that has made such a breakthrough in the market. </p><p>  Xiaomi has a reputation for budget devices that are extremely simple, without premium features.  If you are interested in acquiring a device of this brand or just want to learn more about the brand, you should study the popular models of Xiaomi smartphones (Xiaomi). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Xiaomi Mi A2 </h2><p>  This device was released in July 2018.  Thus, this is one of the newest Xiaomi smartphones.  The Mi A2 model is augmented last year's Mi A1 device, which was the first Xiaomi phone to offer Android One.  It is equipped with many improvements, including a cleaner Snapdragon 660 chipset and 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiomi smartphones specifications" class="if uuid-2971788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2971788.jpg"></div><p>  But the main attraction of this device is the camera.  Their characteristics are in the Xiaomi Mi A2 smartphone. With their 12MP + 20MP setting at the back, Mi A2 can be called one of the best camera phones in the budget category.  The camera takes excellent photos both in daylight and in low light conditions.  The front camera has a portrait mode with AI support, which works especially well for selfie lovers. </p><p>  As for the battery, the 3000 mAh battery ensures the use of the device throughout the day without any problems.  In this device you get the standard version of Quick Charge 3.0.  Mi A2 also plans to introduce an Android update to 9.0 Pie by the end of the year. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S </h2><p>  Released in March 2018, Mi Mix 2S is the first flagship of this company in 2018.  This Chinese smartphone ‚ÄúXiaomi‚Äù (‚ÄúXiaomi‚Äù) has the same design as the Mi Mix 2, but has key updates in both software and hardware.  The device runs on Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 10nm 845 chipset, and also has 8 GB of RAM, 256 GB of internal storage and global LTE tapes. </p><p>  There is also a variation with 6 GB of RAM and the ability to store 64 GB and 128 GB, however these versions are not equipped with global LTE connectivity.  The highlight of the Mi Mix 2S is the dual camera device on the back, equipped with two image sensors, each 12MP. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.xuehua.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiomi new smartphone" class="if uuid-2971791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2971791.jpg"></div><p>  The phone has its own options for shooting in daylight, and also copes well in low light modes.  Many of the features of the camera are related to the new features supported by AI.  This gives the smartphone the opportunity to choose the most suitable shooting mode, given the lighting conditions. </p><p>  AI functions apply to the present portrait mode.  This provides the ability to set the severity of the background blur and even enliven the background bokeh. </p><p>  The characteristics of the Xiaomi smartphone (Xiaomi) of this model are unique in terms of software.  On the software side, Mi Mix 2S is the first Xiaomi gadget to be released with Android 8.0 Oreo by default.  It offers the latest MIUI iteration - 9.5, and its interface as a whole looks more advanced. </p><p>  With MIUI 9.5, you can also restore settings and applications from a previous Android phone or using your Google account.  Previously, users were limited to choosing recovery options from Xiaomi's own Mi Cloud account, and this last step makes MIUI a more attractive option for customers. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro </h2><p>  Released in February 2018, it is the best budget smartphone ‚ÄúXiaomi‚Äù (‚ÄúXiaomi‚Äù) to date.  Many of the options that make Redmi Note 5 Pro so comfortable to use come down to its hardware.  This is the first mobile device in the world equipped with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 636.  Therefore, the performance of the device is simply amazing.  According to reviews of the Xiaomi smartphone (Xiaomi) of this model, even 3D games can be easily launched on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiomi smartphone review" class="if uuid-2971789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2971789.jpg"></div><p>  Snapdragon 636 is a closed version of Snapdragon 660, which is installed on devices three times more expensive than Redmi Note 5 Pro.  Another feature includes 4 or 6 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage.  In addition, on the rear panel you can see the dual camera settings.  She is one of the best in the low-cost segment. </p><p>  Among the devices worth 13-14 thousand rubles there are really no analogues offering the same functionality. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 </h2><p>  This gadget became available for sale in October 2017.  The ultra-thin frame of the case in combination with its ceramic design made it an attractive option for lovers of the unusual.  The phone has the same basic design as the Mi Mix, but has a smaller 5.99-inch screen and a more rounded design, which makes it much more convenient. </p><p>  One of the main positive characteristics of Mi Mix 2 is the global LTE connection with 42 bands.  Like the previous model, the front camera was moved to the bottom panel, which decreased in size.  The camera module itself became smaller, and it was darkened so that it merged with the frame, providing a seamless front view.  Xiaomi developers retained the ceramic back of the case, but added an aluminum mid-frame.  There is a version with a fully ceramic case, but this particular model is exclusive to China and is sold in limited quantities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techradar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiomi smartphone models" class="if uuid-2971793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2971793.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews of the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 smartphone, in terms of hardware properties it is also not inferior to more expensive devices.  It is equipped with Snapdragon 835 RAM with a capacity of 6 GB or 8 GB, internal storage of 64, 128 GB or 256 GB, 12 MP cameras at the rear and 5 MP at the front, Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi with MIMO, and a 3400 mAh battery.  One of the main shortcomings of last year's Mi Mix was the main camera, but this time the developers added functionality and settings to it, as in the Mi 6 model. As a result, images made using Mi Mix 2 look incredibly high quality. </p><p>  With the release of Mi Mix 2, Xiaomi has made its original design available to a wider audience. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi 6 </h2><p>  Released in April 2017, Mi 6 was the first mobile phone costing up to $ 500 (22 thousand rubles), which runs on the Snapdragon 835. It also differs in that it does not have a 3.5 mm jack.  A distinctive feature of the phone is the installation with two cameras on the rear panel, which includes a 12-megapixel standard wide-angle lens, as well as an additional telephoto lens that provides a twofold increase without compromising on quality. </p><p>  The design has undergone significant modernization compared to last year's Mi 5. Its body is distinguished by rounded corners and two pieces of glass, clamped by a stainless steel frame.  In addition, Mi 6 has promising specifications in the form of 2.45 GHz Snapdragon 835, Full HD display 5.15-inch, 64 or 128 GB of internal memory, 6 GB of RAM, 8-megapixel front camera, Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi ac, NFC and USB-C. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expertreviews.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chinese xiomi smartphone" class="if uuid-2971794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2971794.jpg"></div><p>  Removing the 3.5 mm headset jack allowed Xiaomi to place a large 3.350 mAh battery in the device - this is 15% more than the battery in the Mi 5, and also ensured its splash resistance.  What can be connected to the Xiaomi Mi 5 (Xiaomi) smartphone if its design is so different from others?  In fact, the headphones can be synchronized with the device in any other way. </p><p>  Mi 6 is offered in a variety of color options, as well as a ceramic version (limited edition) and a silver version with a mirror finish.  However, keep in mind that the device does not have global LTE ranges, unlike Mi Mix 2. You get 1/3/5/7/838/39/40/41 bands, but if LTE connection in these ranges is available in in your area, Mi 6 is a great option. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi A1 </h2><p>  Released in October 2017, the Mi A1 is groundbreaking in terms of software.  The phone was the first in the Xiaomi line that does not launch MIUI.  In this model, the Chinese manufacturer interacts with Google using the Android One platform.  Ultimately, the user gets a device with the Xiaomi design language and software from Google.  The fact that the gadget costs less than $ 200 (11 thousand rubles) is reflected in many positive reviews about the Xiaomi smartphone (Xiaomi) of this model. </p><p>  The Mi A1 has a great design with metal stripes running along the lower and upper back of the phone, and the aluminum case makes it look great.  The smartphone also has two rear 12-megapixel cameras with the same options as in Mi 6: a wide-angle lens together with a telephoto lens for double optical zoom. </p><p>  Other specifications are presented in the form of a Snapdragon 625, a 5.5-inch Full HD display, 4 GB of RAM, 64 GB of internal storage, a microSD slot, a 5-megapixel front camera, a 3.5-mm connector and a 3080 mAh battery, charged via USB C. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi 5A </h2><p>  Released in November 2017, Redmi 5A stands out because it is the cheapest and most affordable Xiaomi phone today.  Its cost is 7 thousand rubles.  Xiaomi developers have achieved great success with Redmi 4A, and therefore have not greatly changed the configuration in the subsequent model.  You get exactly the same basic equipment, but a small price indicates that the device is available to a wide range of users. </p><p>  Features Redmi 5A presented Snapdragon 425, a 5.0-inch 720p display, RAM 2 or 3 GB, 16 GB / 32 GB of internal memory, two SIM card slots and a microSD slot, a rear 13-megapixel camera and a 5-megapixel front and a 3000 mA battery.  What swings software, the smartphone uses MIUI 9 by default. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi Max 2 </h2><p>  Released in May 2017, the Mi Max was unexpectedly popular last year.  Therefore, the manufacturer released an updated model with an improved design and improved internal elements.  A large 6.44-inch screen combined with a powerful battery makes the Mi Max 2 an entire multimedia powerhouse. </p><p>  In the new version, the developers switched to a single design with metal lines at the back and made the edges rounded, which makes it easier to hold the device in their hands. </p><p>  The hardware capabilities of the Xiaomi smartphone (Xiaomi) are as follows.  Mi Max 2 is equipped with a Snapdragon 625, a 6.44-inch Full HD display, 4 GB of RAM, internal storage of 64 or 128 GB, a microSD slot, a rear 12-megapixel camera and a front 5-megapixel camera, as well as an excellent 5300 mAh battery. which provides at least two days of use. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi 4 </h2><p>  Imitation and copying is a hot topic in technical circles, but few manufacturers act like "Xiomi" ("Xiaomi").  Xiaomi Mi4 is arguably the best-known replica phone you can find on sale.  It looks almost the same as the iPhone 5 or 5S.  But despite the blatant plagiarism, Mi4 is arguably one of the best Android devices of 2014.  He manages to combine incredible power with impeccable build quality and excellent software.  Moreover, at the time of the start of sales, its price was approximately 15 thousand rubles.  Currently, it can be bought for a much lower cost. </p><p>  It is equipped with a metal case, consisting of Gorilla Glass and equipped with a plastic back panel.  Below you will find one speaker - similar to that present in the iPhone 5, and a rather strange USB port.  The phone uses MicroUSB-B, while all other mobile devices (except iPhones) use MicroUSB-A.  However, a USB-B connection will still work. </p><p>  The 5-inch IPS display is also striking and impressive, as it has a Full HD resolution of 1080x1920 pixels and deep viewing angles.  It is also easy to view in direct sunlight. </p><p>  Specifications of the device provide a quad-core Snapdragon 801 chipset with a clock frequency of 2.5 GHz.  This is backed by 3 GB of RAM, which provides a sleek user interface and amazing performance. </p><p>  There is no Micro SD slot, and internal storage is between 16 and 64 GB.  Xiaomi MIUI platform (pronounced ‚ÄúMe-You-Eye) is based on Android.  In the case of MIUI 5, which comes with Xiaomi Mi4, you get a strong resemblance to Android 4.3.  However, unlike other manufacturers (for example, Sony and Samsung), Xiaomi offers a rather peculiar interface.  So, there is not a single pre-installed Google service, but there is a Google Installer application that allows you to download everything you need.  Often, users need instructions on the Xiaomi smartphone (Xiaomi) to understand its interface. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The above review of Xiaomi smartphones (Xiaomi) shows that this manufacturer offers devices with excellent features at an affordable price.  Moreover, some of the proposed devices are equipped with options presented in devices of a higher price category.  Few developers manage to copy the functionality of premium devices, while offering budget-friendly products.  Starting with MI4, Xiaomi is confidently catching up with leading brands in this market segment. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the following.  The company seeks to occupy a leading position in the market, although it is somewhat behind other manufacturers. Samsung -      ,     ¬´¬ª  Xiaomi Huawei       . </p>
