Hairstyles have always reflected social processes and changes in society.  This means that the way of life of the soldiers inevitably left an imprint on how they laid and braided their hair. </p><h2>  Viking hairstyles: why they were so </h2><p>  Vikings are an association of warrior groups led by a leader.  Many are mistaken, considering them a separate nation.  The Viking forces included Swedes, Norwegians, Danes, and representatives of other peoples who joined them on campaigns.  The Vikings gathered in an army to capture the western lands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="viking hairstyles" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10671/1272722.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Vikings had a rule: wash every Saturday and carefully comb their hair and beard daily.  In England, for the love of cleanliness and accuracy in clothing they were called cleanlings.  Such cleanliness was due to quite practical goals, since the tribes were at war with each other, it was impossible to allow the settlements to be easily located, including the smell of unwashed bodies.  The British during the first conflicts and clashes with the northerners were amazed at how they quickly find their camps.  The answer was simple - by smell. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical evidence of Scandinavian cleanliness </h2><p>  I would like to pay special attention to the Viking hairstyles.  To do this, it was not enough to wash and comb the hair or grease it with fat, as the French and English did at that time.  Neat and proper styling is mandatory - this is the main rule of the Viking hairstyle.  The second distinctive feature is multiple braids and comb.  Slavic and Scandinavian hairstyles are similar due to the mixing of cultures as a result of numerous trade and military contacts between these peoples. <br>  History confirms the cleanliness of the Vikings by the following facts recorded in the annals: </p><ul><li>  On the ship "Iceberg", sunk in Norway in 834, a three-dimensional drawing of the image of the head of a Viking was found.  The hair is parted and braided in braids, the neck and back of the head are shaved, and the long beard is also carefully and neatly braided in a braid. </li><li>  In an old letter from England, the author claims that his brother will only follow the Anglo-Saxon fashion, and not repeat the hairstyles of the Vikings with their long hair on the crown and beard. </li></ul><p>  Thus, men's Viking hairstyles also included weaving and implied the presence of long hair.  In many ways, this was a tribute to ancient traditions and mythological beliefs. </p>

    <p>  The Scandinavians believed that it was in the hair that lies the strength of a person and the biggest insult is to cut prisoner of war hair. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Everything new - well forgotten old </h2><p>  Currently, the hairstyles of ancient warriors are very popular among young people.  After watching the series ‚ÄúVikings‚Äù, many guys and girls decided to change their hairstyles, imitating the heroes of the film. </p><p>  The most popular among young children is the hairstyle of Ragnar Lodbroka.  Throughout the film, the main character appears in front of the viewer in different images.  In some series, this is a very short haircut, while in others it is a thick long braid.  Looking more closely, we see, in principle, a similar style.  Men's Viking hairstyles are very reminiscent of a modern haircut - anderkat.  Hair grows, starting from the crown of the head, and forward to the forehead. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hairstyles viking women" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10671/1272720.jpg" width="564"></div>  The nape and whiskey are daily shaved smoothly.  Many women who dream of long hair would envy the Vikings.  Men's hairstyles of ancient warriors included the mandatory weaving of long strands.  The braid began at the crown of the head, and the back of the head remained bare.

    <p>  So there is nothing complicated in doing Viking hairstyles, except for the problem of growing hair from childhood. </p><h2>  What age - such a hairstyle </h2><p>  The movie also features other Viking hairstyles.  Photos of the actors of the series show that the scriptwriters seriously approached the issue of historical authenticity.  So, the son of the main character in childhood wears a very unusual hairstyle.  From childhood, the nape of the child is shaved, while the front part grows freely.  Moreover, they cut along the oblique from the crown of the head to the temple, and the hair line itself passed over the ear.  Later, when the hair on the crown of the head and fontanel grew to a certain length, they were collected in a bun, and the temples and neck were still shaved.  Modern young people are happy to wear such bunches on their heads and believe that it is stylish, fashionable and modern.  They do not even realize that they are copying the hairstyles of the Vikings a thousand years ago. </p><h2>  And what about the fair sex? </h2><p>  And what were the women of the Vikings?  They were also warriors, and along with men participated in military campaigns.  Having studied many artifacts, including female skeletons, scientists concluded that women were also strong and hardy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="viking hairstyles pics" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10671/1272714.jpg" width="600"></div>  Some of the skulls of women look very courageous, which confirms the previously expressed theory that the Scandinavians fought with men.  Therefore, the hairstyles of Viking women also had certain features.

    <h2>  Women's hairstyles: ribbons, braids and shawls </h2><p>  Viking hairstyles for women necessarily suggest the presence of long hair.  The strands are divided into two parts and tied at the back of the head in a knot.  The decoration of the hairstyle is multi-colored ribbons woven into it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hairstyles viking girls" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10671/1272710.jpg" width="600"></div>  Bright scarves and hats could be used as decorations, but this refers to a much later period.  In the early Middle Ages, the hairstyles of Viking girls included various braids and ribbons.  So, girls and girls braided their long hair in braids, and tied a ribbon around their forehead.  Married women braided their braids and covered their heads with scarves.

    <h2>  Create a hairstyle for the northern warrior </h2><p>  Judging by historical sources and drawings in the annals, women's Vikings hairstyles are complex and accurate execution.  Do not think that these secrets are lost.  Fortunately, hairdressers today know how to make Viking women's hairstyles.  Consider one of the options.  All hair on the head is divided into four parts of equal volume: the occipital, two temporal and the parietal.  Long hair is needed, just below the level of the shoulder line.  Temporal parts are carefully braided with <span>French braids</span> vertically.  This creates the effect of <span>shaved temples.</span>  The parietal part is divided in half: the top opens and combes, creating volume, and several braids are woven from the lower strands towards the back of the head.  Clearly, near the crown of the head, part of the hair is collected in a neat bundle, and braids are wrapped around the hair.  With interwoven ribbons, all this is fixed, while the occipital part remains free.  The hairstyle is ready and looks really royal! </p>
