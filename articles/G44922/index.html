Then be sure to visit the Railway Museum.  This is a great option if you do not know where to go in Brest.  The development of the railway industry in the city began at the end of the 19th century.  The city has become an important transport hub on the border of Russia and Belarus.  The decision to open a museum with railway equipment was made by the city administration in early 2002.  Visitors will be able to see more than 50 models of various steam locomotives here, some exhibits are even used during the filming of historical films.  During the tour, you can get into the salon of the legendary trains of the Great Patriotic War, pull the levers and press the buttons of the control panel, like a real engineer.  You can also learn interesting facts from the history of the development and formation of the railway in Brest.  The museum is open to visitors any day from 10:00 to 18:00, except Mondays.  Ticket prices can be checked at the box office. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="railway museum" class="if uuid-3218946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/3218946.jpg"></div><p>  Address: Masherova, 2. </p><h2>  Winter Garden </h2><p>  The bewitching world of paradise flowers and strange plants is available to all visitors to this place.  Only after crossing the threshold, you will find yourself in an amazing tropical world that occupies the entire first floor of the Winter Garden.  Huge ferns and orchids with an amazing smell grow here.  The second floor is divided into two zones.  The first is the desert zone, here visitors can see many unique and funny cacti, African agaves and other exotic plants.  The second part of the floor is a real subtropical paradise.  Visitors can admire the trees with the fruits of lemon and pomegranate.  If you want to see something unusual and memorable, but don‚Äôt know where to go to Brest, we recommend that you visit the Winter Garden. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="belhot.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="winter garden in Brest" class="if uuid-3218949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/3218949.jpg"></div><p>  Address: Mitskevich, 28/1. </p><h2>  Wrought Iron Alley </h2><p>  Want to spend an unforgettable, romantic evening with your loved one?  The best option would be a walk under the moonlit sky along the forged lantern avenue.  This is one of the youngest attractions in the city.  The forged lanterns alley appeared in the very center of the city (in Gogol Lane) in 2013.  City Hall of Brest decided to open it in honor of the liberation of the city from Nazi troops.  The only thing they did not want to invest in the city budget.  The administration asked for help from entrepreneurs who supported this idea.  In this creative project, they were able to fully express their imagination.  The first lantern is located next to the Brest Fortress.  It looks like a watch, in the center is a large dial.  The next lantern resembles an unusual loom, the idea was filed by Brest sewing factories.  It is difficult to look away from the Angel‚Äôs lantern and the treble, bronze clef (its authors are the collective of the city‚Äôs music school).  Forged Lanterns Alley is one of the most beautiful and interesting sights of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourgrace.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tours to Brest" class="if uuid-3218953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/3218953.jpg"></div><h2>  Museum of Saved Values </h2><p>  Another option where to go in Brest is the Museum of Saved Values.  It is unique, because in Russia there are no more.  The museum is located in the central part of the city, so there will be no problems with how to get to the object.  Many buses, minibuses and trolleybuses go here.  The exhibits of the museum gathered for a fairly long period of time.  At the moment, visitors will be able to see here a lot of ancient icons, as well as other unique things. </p><p>  Oddly enough, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãopening such an unusual museum arose among customs officers.  Brest is a city located on the border of Poland.  In the 20th century, unscrupulous citizens tried to remove valuable prohibited items from our country.  However, vigilant border guards were very careful to prevent this.  Confiscated icons, copyright manuscripts and jewelry, antique jewelry were collected in one place.  Soon it was decided to open the Museum of Salvaged Values ‚Äã‚Äãhere, which everyone could visit.  Visitors will be able to visit the following rooms: Russian Iconography, Japanese Art, Soviet Jewelry, and others.  Do you want to expand your horizons and see the unique collections?  Then run to the Museum of Saved Values! </p><div class="photo" data-original="museums.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Brest sights" class="if uuid-3218957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/3218957.jpg"></div><p>  Address: Lenin, 39. </p><h2>  Military relic </h2><p>  Nevertheless, the main attraction of the city is the Brest Fortress.  Her defenders at the beginning of the war proved to be courageous and selfless soldiers.  For a long time they managed to restrain the fascist invaders at the cost of huge human losses.  The fortress is highly respected by both local residents and visitors.  If you find yourself in a city, you are simply obliged to go on a sightseeing tour of the Brest Fortress.  You can see St. Nicholas Garrison Cathedral, several monuments and obelisks, as well as the Museum of Exhibits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="solnechny.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go in Brest" class="if uuid-3218945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/3218945.jpg"></div><p>  Address: Heroes of Defense of the Brest Fortress, 60. </p><h2>  The best cafes in Brest </h2><p>  Now let's talk about places where you can have a great meal at affordable prices.  So: </p><ul><li>  In the city center, on the street.  Moscow, 275 a, is one of the most popular cafes in Brest - "Mario".
