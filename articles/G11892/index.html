Its sonorous name Zvartnots has two interpretations: "Temple of the Vigilant Force" or "Temple of the Heavenly Angels." </p><p>  Armenian architects have long been famous for their non-trivial approach to the construction of religious buildings.  No wonder the Armenian architect Trdat was invited to restore the collapsed dome of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="40.16527019999999" data-lng="44.342783300000065" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/9/5/6/8956.png"></div><h2>  Construction history </h2><p>  The construction of the majestic Zvartnots temple for those days began in 641 and lasted about twenty years.  The initiator of this large-scale construction was the Catholicos Nerses III the Restorer, who wished to erect a unique structure near his palace.  This building was intended to overshadow all existing ones with its scale and magnificence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Columns of the Zvartnots Temple" class="if uuid-2827786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2827786.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the Temple of Heavenly Angels began in a turbulent time for Armenia.  Only a split occurred with the Georgian church, and almost immediately the country fell under the influence of Byzantium.  That is why the Byzantine emperor personally arrived at the opening and consecration of the temple in 652.  An ancient Armenian legend says that a beautiful temple impressed the sophisticated emperor so much that he wanted to build one in his capital.  Only the death of the architect who created Zvartnots prevented these visionary plans. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Temple tending up </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Girls in national costumes" class="if uuid-2827787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2827787.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, today there is very little left of the church in Armenia.  However, the surviving fragments give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe great intent of its creators. </p><p>  Once a structure, a bit like ziggurats in ancient Babylon, consisted of three tiers.  According to the plan, the building was a cross with rounded edges.  It was unusual that the architect of the temple Zvartnots also erected an external round wall. </p><p>  The building seemed to be stretched up to heaven.  The entire massive structure rested on four columns about twenty meters high.  The second tier of the church was through and also relied on powerful columns.  The building was crowned by a high multifaceted dome, which believers could see from afar. </p><p>  In the very center of the temple, opposite the stone altar, archaeologists found the remains of a large swimming pool, in which they performed the baptismal rite.  Behind the altar was found the entrance to the underground sacristy. </p><h2>  Amazing finish </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.advantour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fragments of the carvings of the columns of the temple" class="if uuid-2827793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2827793.jpg"></div><p>  The walls of the temple, the columns supporting its arches, openwork windows and the altar itself are decorated with bizarre carvings.  It is amazing how skillful and talented the masters of those ancient times were. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the decoration of the temple, traditional geometric ornaments smoothly intertwine with images of grapes, pomegranate leaves.  The preserved sculptural images of people were found, allowing to present the appearance of the inhabitants of medieval Armenia.  Ancient stone cutters surprisingly accurately conveyed the details of clothing and the unique features of each person.  This is a kind of ancient portrait gallery. </p><h2>  Not only the walls of the temple </h2><div class="photo" data-original="yerevancard.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zvartnots temple ruins in Armenia" class="if uuid-2827790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2827790.jpg"></div><p>  Few people know that the surviving ruins are not only the Zvartnots temple itself, there were several buildings for various purposes.  For example, archaeologists are sure that the ruins of the walls on the south side of the excavations were Roman baths, although no water pipes or special ceramic tiles, which decorated the baths, were found here. </p><p>  Even on the ruins of the Zvartnots temple, the remains of a more ancient basilica dating back to the 5th century AD are found. </p><p>  In the complex, archaeologists have discovered one of the earliest storages for wine.  Large stone gutters for the drain of the drink leave no doubt about the purpose of this building.  In addition, today it is considered one of the largest in the Caucasus. </p><p>  In the western side of the excavations, the remains of three once richly decorated halls were discovered.  It is believed that these are the ruins of the palace of the Armenian patriarch, in which he was safe in those turbulent, troubled times. </p><h2>  The stele of the ancient king </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stone stele with inscriptions" class="if uuid-2827792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2827792.jpg"></div><p>  Armenian archaeologists who excavated the Zvartnots temple in Armenia in the early twentieth century, unexpectedly discovered more ancient cultural layers under the ruins of a medieval structure dating back to 685-639 BC.  This is the heyday of the state of Urartu, partially located on the territory of modern Armenia.  Its ruler was King Rus II, who was engaged in strengthening the state, building irrigation canals and increasing the area of ‚Äã‚Äãorchards and fields. </p><p>  The story of his glorious deeds was knocked out by ancient masons on a large stele found in the ruins of Zvartnots.  Scientists managed to translate the ancient cuneiform inscriptions, and today the translation of the text is next to the stele itself. </p><h2>  The fate of the sanctuary </h2><p>  Amazing in its beauty and grandeur, the temple stood for a very short time.  An error crept into the calculations of the architect who was engaged in its construction, and the building was destroyed by a powerful earthquake that occurred in 930.  The power of the shocks was so great that the sturdy columns of the temple cracked, and the structure was completely destroyed.  Scientists believe that they did not try to restore the structure. </p><p>  For many centuries, a high hill has grown over the ruins of an ancient temple and nothing reminded of a sacred temple that stood here earlier.  The first excavations at this site were carried out at the beginning of the 20th century by the Armenian archaeologist Toros Toramanyan.  Almost immediately after the first finds, it was decided to restore the ancient sanctuary. </p><p>  Nowadays, the first tier of the temple has been completely reconstructed; an archaeological museum is working in it.  Scientists plan to continue the reconstruction and completely restore Zvartnots. </p><h2>  Figurine of the ancient king </h2><p>  The plans for the revival of the sanctuary can be realized thanks to an interesting find made by archaeologists in the ruins of the Zvartnots temple.  A small statuette of the Armenian king Garik was found.  The figure held in its hands a miniature copy of the Temple of the Vigil Forces. </p><p>  In addition to this sculptural image, the remains of carved columns, capitals, many church utensils that once adorned the temple were found.  Guests arriving on a tour to Armenia can see them at the museum, which began its work back in 1937. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelbunny8.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Exhibits of the Zvartnots Museum" class="if uuid-2827808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2827808.jpg"></div><p>  Even on the territory of Zvartnots, an ancient sundial, made in the form of a giant stone fan, was excavated.  And on the ruins of a formerly operating winery, the ancient vessels for wine and products found here are exhibited.  All this makes the museum complex of the temple very interesting for visiting curious tourists.  Weather permitting, you can wander among the ancient ruins for hours. </p><h2>  How to visit </h2><p>  Given the fact that the complex is located very close to Yerevan, it‚Äôs not difficult to get into it.  How to get to the Zvartnots temple? </p><p>  You can take the bus going to Vagharshapat.  Drivers know this place and, although there is no official stop, passengers are disembarked at the request.  The gates of the temple with a large stone eagle are visible from afar, so it is difficult not to notice them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="migtour.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fragment of a carved column" class="if uuid-2827809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2827809.jpg"></div><p>  Buses run only in the morning and in the evening, so in the daytime it is better to use the services of numerous taxis. </p><p>  The museum begins its work at 10 am, on Monday - a day off.  Entrance to the complex is free, but you will have to fork out for the opportunity to take photos, although no one is strictly monitoring this. </p><p>  When planning a tour to Armenia, you can combine a visit to the ancient Zvartnots with a visit to the nearby church of St. Hripsime, Etchmiadzin Cathedral and the city of Vagharshapata, in which the residence of the Catholicos is located. </p>
