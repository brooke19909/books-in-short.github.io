  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Malaya Istra": reviews, floor plans, infrastructure, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Probably there is no such person who does not want to have their own comfortable housing.  Today, the primary residential real estate market is full of various offers, so buyers have plenty to choose from.  At the same time, in the capital of our Motherland, new houses, residential complexes and even whole microdistricts do not stop being built.  On the one hand, having a huge offer is good, because each person will be able to choose the ideal option when buying a home, but, on the other, many mistakes can be made. </p><p>  As a rule, <span>residential complexes</span> are being built in already built-up areas.  Old houses are demolished, the land is cleared and new high-rise buildings appear on this site.  This is very convenient for developers, since all communications have already been completed, and there is already a good infrastructure around.  However, in some cases, construction projects are not implemented in the city itself, but in its district.  It has become very fashionable to build residential buildings in ecologically clean regions, for example, near the forest.  One of these is the Small Istra LCD, whose photo looks just amazing.  Let's try to figure out what it represents, how relevant it is to buy an apartment in it and how much housing costs today. </p><h2>  general information </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroyki.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Small Istra" class="if uuid-2751087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2751087.jpg"></div><p>  Due to the fact that today progress does not stand still, the construction industry is developing more and more every year.  Therefore, at the moment in our country, everyone has the opportunity to purchase comfortable housing in equipped complexes.  LCD "Malaya Istra" is a separate microdistrict consisting of 33 four-story houses.  It consists of: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  33 four-story houses; </li><li>  2 kindergartens, each of which is designed for 240 places; </li><li>  one school with 1200 places; </li><li>  children's and adult clinics; </li><li>  26 playgrounds; </li><li>  17 sports facilities; </li><li>  one sports complex with a swimming pool; </li><li>  4 covered parking lots; </li><li>  shopping and entertainment center; </li><li>  4.3 km long bike paths; </li><li>  18 km of walking paths. </li></ul><p>  The total project area is 45 hectares of land.  The main advantage of the residential complex "Malaya Istra" (reviews will be considered at the end of the article) is that everything is done in it for human comfort.  Despite the fact that the <span>residential complex</span> is located outside the city, almost in the middle of the forest, nevertheless it can exist autonomously, since all social structures are located on its territory. </p><p>  Construction began in 2013, and the completion of the project and its commissioning is planned for 2020.  The construction is carried out on a monolithic-brick technology.  A separate boiler room has already been built and launched on the territory of the residential complex, and water is supplied from separately drilled wells.  It is worth noting that the project is being implemented in stages, so one part of the houses has already been completed and people live in them, while the other is waiting for verification and commissioning. </p><p>  LCD "Malaya Istra", apartments in which are quite inexpensive, refers to new-class budget buildings.  It got its name from the fact that it is located in the Istra district near Moscow.  The construction of the complex is carried out by the company "Promservice".  Much attention is paid to infrastructure.  The developer seeks to ensure that people can live normally and do not need anything at the same time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Among the main features of the LCD are the following: </p><ul><li>  low-rise houses; </li><li>  relatively low cost; </li><li>  loggias up to 12.6 square meters; </li><li>  good environmental conditions. </li></ul><p>  Residential complex "Malaya Istra", the reviews of residents in most cases are positive, designed for people who are tired of the bustle of the city and want to live in more quiet and calm conditions.  Due to the fact that the residential complex is located in the middle of the forest, it has very clean air.  Moreover, despite the fact that Moscow is only 30 kilometers from the village, the apartments in it are very cheap, so they are available for mass consumption.  Odnushka in "Small Istra" will cost from 1.3 million rubles. </p><h2>  Location of the complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.kvmeter.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="equipped residential complex" class="if uuid-2751116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2751116.jpg"></div><p>  So, are you planning a home purchase and want to look at the Malaya Istra residential complex?  How to get to it?  You can do this on your own car, moving from the Moscow Ring Road along the Volokolamsk Highway to 33 kilometers.  Not far from the highway you will see a residential complex.  It is being built on the site of the village of Vysokovo, whose population is only 100 people.  Around it there is nothing but a dense forest, due to which, in fact, this area is attractive.  People will certainly enjoy the clean environment and stunning natural landscapes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Where can I buy an apartment? </h2><p>  If you want to buy housing in the residential complex "Malaya Istra", an initiative group of interest holders will allow you to save some good money.  However, as practice shows, this way of buying a home is very risky, since not all developers finish the project to the end, as a result of which many people lose their investment.  Therefore, it is best to purchase an apartment in a house that has already been commissioned. </p><p>  The sales center is located on the first floor of the sixth house.  There you can not only familiarize yourself with the prices and get more detailed information about the residential complex, but also study the layouts of the settlement and the location of the houses, as well as look at the show room for interior decoration options.  In addition, familiarization tours of the facility are regularly held, by visiting which you can plunge into the unique atmosphere of Little Istra.  There are a lot of people who want to visit them, so it‚Äôs better to book a trip in advance by phone or on the official website of the developer.  The doors of the main office are open from 9 to 21 hours. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get to the residential complex "Malaya Istra" (customer reviews claim that the location of the complex is very well chosen), you can use your own car or public transport.  A one-way trip will take approximately 40 minutes if you travel to the property by car, and about an hour and a half by bus.  But here it all depends on whether there will be traffic jams on the highway, which are commonplace for Moscow.  Therefore, if you are a busy person and do not have much free time, carefully plan your trip. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.9101207" data-lng="36.92356050000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/0/5/9/8059.png"></div><p>  You can get along the Volokolamsk or Novorizhskoe highway.  If you do not have your own vehicle, then from Art.  Tushinskaya metro direct bus leaves.  From the stop to the residential complex only 800 m. In addition, you can get from the Riga station by train to the station.  "Istra 1" or "Manihino".  In this case, you will reach your destination much faster, since you do not have to stand in traffic jams.  However, at least two km from any of the stations to the complex. </p><h2>  Construction progress and estimated dates </h2><p>  Let's dwell on this in more detail.  As mentioned earlier, the implementation of the project is carried out by Promservice Company LLC.  SK is engaged in its activities relatively recently, it was founded in 2003, however, despite this, she has extensive experience.  Today, the organization has already completed seven completed projects, among which there are large ones. </p><p>  As for the residential complex "Malaya Istra", the reviews of people about him are very contradictory.  As stated at the beginning of the article, the implementation of the project is divided into four stages.  On the official website of the developer, it is indicated that it will be fully completed in 2020, but today there are shifts in terms.  Some houses were put into operation a little later than was originally planned.  According to some estimates, the holiday village will be completely completed with a delay of approximately 1.5 years.  Why so, it's hard to say, because the company does not provide any specific information.  Most likely, the delay is due to a lack of funding and some problems with regulatory state authorities.  Therefore, if you are interested in a housing complex and you plan to acquire housing in it, then be very careful.  This is especially true of participation in shared construction.  To minimize the associated risks, it is recommended to buy apartments in already completed or pending commissioning houses. </p><p>  The developer of the residential complex "Malaya Istra" has a dubious reputation and the trust in it among people is not always at a high level.  As for the construction progress, out of 33 planned houses, only 8 have been completed so far. Five are already living in people, and another 3 have been submitted to the inspection bodies.  If everything is in order with the technical condition of the buildings and it begins to satisfy all the norms and requirements, then they will also be put into operation. </p><h2>  Placement and storage of vehicles </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mosnovostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apartments in small istra" class="if uuid-2751096" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2751096.jpg"></div><p>  In the Malaya Istra residential complex, webcams at a construction site allow you to monitor the progress of work, a parking place for each apartment is provided.  As for parking, they are also there and are free of charge.  Guests and residents of the residential complex will be able to leave their cars on them.  However, getting into the territory of the residential complex will be a bit problematic, since free access is closed as part of improving the level of security and comfortable living.  The nearest public parking is two kilometers from the complex, but walking such a distance on foot is a very long time.  There is also a shopping and entertainment complex. </p><h2>  Construction technology </h2><div class="photo" data-original="msk.novostroy-gid.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="parking for cars" class="if uuid-2751118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2751118.jpg"></div><p>  What is its feature?  Despite the fact that the LCD ‚ÄúMalaya Istra‚Äù, video reports are available to everyone, it belongs to the budget segment, nevertheless, all buildings and structures are erected using monolithic-brick technology.  Thanks to this, the housing is very warm and reliable.  The term of use of such houses is at least 100 years.  For external cladding, Porotherm brick from the European brand Wienerberger is used, which has high quality and excellent performance.  Its main advantage is that there are no gaps or cracks between the blocks, due to which the heat loss is not so significant, and the sound insulation is also increased.  Thus, the residential building meets all modern international standards, and is also well adapted to the climatic conditions of the region. </p><p>  The houses are equipped with ordinary metal-plastic doors with glass inserts, which is understandable, because housing belongs to an affordable price category.  In front of the entrance is a vestibule without designer decoration.  You can get to the upper floors through two stairs.  In some buildings there will be an elevator, but in which, it is better to check with the representatives of the construction company.  Garbage chutes are not provided, and waste products can be disposed of in containers located near the house.  In principle, everything is thought out and done for a normal comfortable life, so buying an apartment in a residential complex is justified and will be a good investment. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  The houses in the residential complex "Malaya Istra" (Moscow is close to the settlement, so you can easily get to work in the capital every day) are located according to the classical principle of a typical square building.  The buildings are divided into several multisectional groups with various configurations.  As for the appearance of the houses, it is made in a neutral style.  There is no concrete architectural concept, but the buildings look very modern and attractive.  The facades are lined with bricks made of special clay with yellow and terracotta colors.  The floors are separated by white horizontal stripes running around the entire perimeter of the buildings.  Each apartment has white metal-plastic windows, and on the loggias - panoramic glazing, allowing residents to enjoy the beauties of the surrounding nature. </p><p>  The courtyards are between the houses, therefore they are protected from the environment, so that mothers can safely walk with their children in a quiet and relaxed atmosphere.  Also provided for children and sports grounds, equipped with all necessary elements.  However, according to the residents, the courtyard spaces lack landscaping, which is why they look somewhat empty.  Since the trees were planted recently, it will take at least five years to grow. </p><h2>  What choice is available to customers? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mskguru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="courtyard in small istra" class="if uuid-2751106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2751106.jpg"></div><p>  In the residential complex "Malaya Istra", the secondary housing does not yet offer much choice, several types of apartments are available, which differ not only in the number of rooms, but also in size and cost.  The budget option is a 25 square meter studio, the purchase of which will cost approximately 1.3 million rubles.  They are designed for the mass consumer, since absolutely anyone with a source of constant income can afford such housing. </p><p>  For standard average families, in which, in addition to parents, there are also two children, the developer offers three-room apartments of 109 squares.  They will have to pay 5.2 million rubles.  This figure may seem very high, but in a residential complex this is one of the lowest prices per square meter for today. </p><p>  As for the choice, the following housing options are available in the microdistrict: </p><ul><li>  studio - from 25 to 33 square meters.  m .; </li><li>  1-room apartments - from 51 to 59 square meters.  m .; </li><li>  2-room apartments - from 45 to 52 sq. M.  m .; </li><li>  3-room apartments - from 78 to 109 square meters.  m </li></ul><p>  Each person can independently choose for themselves in the residential complex "Malaya Istra", customer reviews about the complex in most cases are positive, whether the housing will have a rough finish or not.  As practice shows, the second option is best, since developers never make normal repairs in new buildings, but in this case there are additional financial costs.  In addition, it is possible to order a "turnkey repair".  Its cost is approximately 600,000 rubles, but you can order a specific interior design design project and monitor the progress of its implementation.  It includes the cost of all materials, communications and payment for work.  Buyers are offered four finishes, but they are practically no different from each other, since they are made in the same shades. </p><h2>  Layout of apartments </h2><p>  Individual design projects in the residential complex "Malaya Istra", reviews of which confirm the practicality of the location of the buildings and good infrastructure, will significantly diversify the layout options.  Even when buying a house without decoration, all the floors will already be erected in it, so if you yourself want to change the layout, you will have to dismantle them first. </p><p>  The living space has a thoughtful and practical organization.  The average living area of ‚Äã‚Äãa studio and odnushka is about 15-18 square meters.  A bathroom can be both combined and separate.  Loggias deserve special attention.  They are very spacious and have panoramic glazing, so they can successfully implement a recreation area. </p><h2>  Commercial premises </h2><p>  What are they?  LCD "Malaya Istra" involves not only private housing, but also premises for business.  They have a free purpose, therefore, they are suitable for opening small grocery stores, cafes, hairdressers, beauty salons, pharmacies and offices of various companies.  As elsewhere, the ground floors will be reserved for them, and all communications necessary for normal functioning will be brought to them. </p><p>  However, individual entrepreneurs who want to conduct business in this settlement should take into account that commercial property cannot be bought yet, and the first sales were announced at the end of 2018.  The exact date is still unknown, since managers themselves do not have more specific information.  It is worth noting that non-residential facilities do not imply the presence of storage facilities and parking lots, therefore this should be taken into account when creating the project. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and environmental component </h2><div class="photo" data-original="-." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="residential complex construction" class="if uuid-2751120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2751120.jpg"></div><p>  Many people want to get their own housing in the residential complex ‚ÄúMalaya Istra‚Äù, the reviews of the residents fully confirm this, due to a well-developed complex of service structures and a very clean environment.  As mentioned earlier, the settlement is located in the middle of a forest two kilometers from the motorway, so there is always clean air and silence that violates, perhaps, the singing of birds. </p><p>  In addition, a well-thought-out infrastructure will contribute to comfortable living, including the following: </p><ul><li>  kindergartens; </li><li>  educational institution; </li><li>  hospitals and pharmacies; </li><li>  shopping and entertainment complex and small shops; </li><li>  playgrounds; </li><li>  places for sports and recreation. </li></ul><p> All service facilities will start operating from mid-2019.  Until this moment, residents will have to travel for food and other business to the city of Istra, which is located near the residential complex.  It will be possible to get to it in just a few minutes along the federal highway on your own car.  In addition, mobile points of sale with products arrive on the territory of the residential complex every day, so everything you need can be bought right on the spot.  See how the current situation is, help the camera.  LCD "Malaya Istra", although still far from the stage of full implementation of the project, nevertheless today it is fully suitable for comfortable living, so you can safely buy an apartment. </p><p>  As for the environmental component, then everything is just wonderful.  The remote location from the noisy capital provides many advantages.  Within a radius of two kilometers in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe residential complex there are no motorways, factories and factories, so it is incredibly quiet and clean here.  Around the buildings is a large deciduous forest, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich exceeds 500 hectares.  Also, more than 20 kilometers of trails for cycling and hiking are laid in the village, so supporters of a healthy lifestyle will have a place to play sports.  If you want to enjoy the beauties of the surrounding nature right now or to watch the life of the yard, then webcams will help.  LCD "Malaya Istra" really has a very good location. </p><h2>  What do residents say about the residential complex? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="advancerealty.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="small Istra with high" class="if uuid-2751114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2751114.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to get inexpensive housing in a picturesque and environmentally friendly area, then the best way to do this is to buy an apartment in the residential complex "Malaya Istra".  The reviews of people who have already managed to settle in and live a certain amount of time fully confirm this.  Ideal conditions are created in new buildings and the service sector is well established.  As for the shortcomings, then for such a price they simply can not be.  Therefore, while housing is still there and its cost is low, then buy apartments and do not even think about it.  So the new settlers advise.  Do not deny yourself good housing, because your comfort depends on it. </p>
