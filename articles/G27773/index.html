It plays a huge role for the population.  Citizens are trying to find out as much information as possible on how to find out tax arrears for an apartment, as well as <span>how to pay</span> it.  In reality, understanding all this is not so difficult.  What you need to know about apartment taxes in Russia?  What features of the process pay attention? </p><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth paying attention to what constitutes a <span>tax on a privatized apartment.</span>  This is an annual <span>mandatory payment that is due to</span> all property owners.  It is called property tax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="privatized apartment tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1468756.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is charged for property of the following type: </p><ul><li>  apartment; </li><li>  room; </li><li>  house; </li><li>  country house; </li><li>  structure; </li><li>  shares in the specified property. </li></ul><p>  Since 2016, new tax calculation rules have been in force in Russia, as well as <span>notifications to the public</span> about debt.  But about them a little later.  First, pay attention to some fairly common issues related to property tax.  Which ones? </p><h2>  Sales Taxation </h2><p>  For example, is a privatized <span>apartment taxed on sale?</span>  This question worries both sellers and buyers.  It is not as difficult to answer as it seems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The thing is that in this situation, you will have to pay several taxes, but not on an ongoing basis.  The first is property.  It will now be paid by the buyer after the registration of the property.  Calculation and payment procedure is exactly the same as before the sale of the apartment.  That is, the payment is an annual "character." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="whether a privatized apartment is taxed upon sale" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1468759.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Is a privatized apartment taxed upon sale?  Yes.  And in addition to property recovery will have to pay another tax fee.  But the seller will already do it.  It's about income tax.  It in Russia is 13% of the funds received.  It is paid only 1 time from each income.  Is a privatized apartment taxed?  Yes, and several. </p><h2>  Accrual rules </h2><p>  It is also worth paying attention to the fact that in Russia since 2016, citizens will pay property tax according to new calculations.  Which one?  How is the tax on a privatized apartment calculated? </p><p>  The thing is that from now on, the <span>cadastral value of</span> real estate will be taken into account in the calculations.  That is, in different regions of the country, apartments of the same size will require the payment of various amounts of cash. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order not to understand the principles of calculation for a long time, taxpayers are advised to use a special calculator.  It is located on the website of the Federal Tax Service.  For example, you can try the services: </p><ul><li>  nalog.ru/rn33/service/nalog_calc (rn33 must be changed to rn and the code of the region of the Russian Federation); </li><li>  213.24.58.228/fiz_calc/. </li></ul><p>  Here you will have to type information about the property and the owner of the apartment.  You can calculate the tax on any property.  After the end of automatic calculations, the amount due for payment will appear on the screen.  Another way to obtain information about the amount of tax fees for an apartment is to search for information on a payment system sent by tax authorities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how the tax on a privatized apartment is charged" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1468758.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  New alert system </h2><p>  It has already been said that from 2016 in Russia taxpayers will be notified about the need to pay taxes for apartments under the new system.  How exactly?  From now on, the country provides for 3 types of information. </p><p>  Among them are: </p><ol><li>  The standard way.  The tax on the privatized apartment will be sent to the home address by mail.  It is expressed by a receipt of payment. </li><li>  Personal alert.  Every citizen has the right to apply to the tax service at the location of real estate with an official request for debts.  Usually employees of the Federal Tax Service print out a payment and give it to the owner. </li><li>  Virtual information.  A new way to alert the public.  It is used when a citizen has a profile on the public services portal.  In this case, the payment will come in a letter through the site in electronic form. </li></ol><p>  As practice shows, as long as there is no personal account at State Services, a standard citizen notification is used.  Is a tax on a privatized apartment paid?  Yes, it is charged annually to all property owners.  And what if the payment did not come? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax inspection privatized apartment tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1468753.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  No receipt </h2><p>  There are several scenarios.  The thing is that in Russia payment orders for property are sent no later than 30 days before the tax payment deadline.  Typically, receipts for an apartment are sent in September-October.  In 2016, property tax is required to be paid until December 1, inclusive.  Accordingly, until the beginning of November, you can safely wait for a payment. </p><p>  And if the tax on the privatized apartment does not come, what should I do?  First, remember if a citizen has an account on the State Services portal.  If so, then you don‚Äôt need to wait for a payment by mail.  She will not come.  Instead, it is recommended that you check the profile on the portal.  There should be receipt in electronic format. </p><p>  Alternatively, you can call the regional Federal Tax Service and find out why the receipt did not come.  Or personally go to the tax office.  In the second embodiment, usually a receipt is issued on the spot.  In any case, you should not panic before the beginning of November. </p><h2>  About benefits </h2><p>  Another nuance is the benefits of property tax.  Many are interested in what happened to them due to recent changes in legislation.  Fortunately, nothing.  The tax on the privatized apartment for pensioners and other beneficiaries has been fully preserved. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that privileges are not provided for property that costs more than 300,000,000 rubles.  In all other cases, deductions are allowed to reduce the amount of tax fees on existing property. </p><p>  The benefit for pensioners is provided as a decrease in the cadastral value of real estate by a certain indicator.  For apartments, this is a deduction of 20 square meters. </p><p>  To make it clear, we can consider the situation by example.  The apartment of 50 square meters belongs to the pensioner.  Then the tax will be calculated from the amount of cadastral value of the apartment in 30 "squares".  That is, suppose not from 500,000 rubles (if 1 square meter costs 10,000 rubles), but from 300,000. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to pay tax on a privatized apartment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1468755.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Bank help </h2><p>  Now you can find out about methods of paying property tax.  As already mentioned, there are a lot of options.  Each citizen chooses a payment method.  Suppose that the tax inspectorate sent a tax on a privatized apartment by mail.  What's next? </p><p>  You need to pay a receipt.  The first and most popular way among the population is to contact the bank.  For example, in Sberbank.  A citizen must take with him an identity card and a receipt with money, then come to the cashier of the bank, present documents and cash.  After checking the information, the bank employee will have to transfer the money to the account of the Federal Tax Service, and give the citizen a receipt with a payment receipt. </p><h2>  ATM </h2><p>  However, this is only the first scenario.  How to pay tax on a privatized apartment?  The next tip is to use an ATM.  A very good way for those who prefer cashless payments. </p><p>  What should be done?  We have to follow the proposed algorithm of actions: </p><ol><li>  Insert bank plastic into the ATM.  Dial a pin code. </li><li>  In the machine menu, select "Payments and transfers" (or something like that, the labels may differ) - "Search for the recipient by TIN". </li><li>  Next, from the payment receipt, you need to dial the TIN of the recipient's taxpayer and search for the organization. </li><li>  Select the desired branch of the tax authorities (if there are several), as well as the type of tax.  Following the instructions of the system, you must provide information about the payer and the amount of tax collection.  Sometimes ATMs automatically find the relevant data. </li><li>  Check the correctness of the data about the payer, payee, amount and type of tax. </li><li>  Confirm payment.  For example, in Sberbank, a citizen will receive a confirmation code on a mobile phone. </li></ol><h2>  Payment terminal </h2><p>  How else can I pay tax on a privatized apartment?  The next way is to use payment terminals.  They are in the Federal Tax Service (not everywhere), and in banks.  The principle of action is exactly the same as when working with ATMs.  The only difference is that instead of a bank card, cash will be used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="whether the tax on a privatized apartment is paid" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1468757.jpg"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  It is worth paying attention to some payment terminals and ATMs.  Sometimes it‚Äôs enough to bring the payment to a special reader, as all the tax information will be displayed without additional manipulations.  To do this, select the option "Recipient search by barcode". </p><h2>  Portal "Public services" </h2><p>  Through the portal "State Services" you can pay taxes.  And not only property.  It is enough to adhere to some algorithm of actions.  A short note - the use of this method is possible only when the citizen has an active profile.  Otherwise, it is not recommended to use the State Services. </p><p>  You can act as follows: </p><ol><li>  Log in to the site "Public services". </li><li>  Type ‚ÄúTaxes‚Äù or ‚ÄúFTS Debt Check‚Äù in the service search bar.  Next, in the menu that appears, the necessary item is selected. </li><li>  When the information about the tax debt for the apartment appears on the screen, you need to click on "Pay". </li><li>  Choose the appropriate payment method.  Usually a bank card is selected.  In the specially designated fields, you need to enter the data of bank plastic, and then confirm the operation. </li><li>  Print or save a tax receipt. </li></ol><h2>  Internet banking </h2><p>  And you can pay the tax on a privatized apartment through Internet banking.  For example, through the Sberbank Online system.  How will the payment be made? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="privatized apartment tax for pensioners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1468754.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Everything is simple.  It is required: </p><ol><li>  Log in to your account in the Sberbank Online service. </li><li>  In the search line for services, type "Check <span>tax debts."</span>  Select "Search by TIN" or "By last name" there.  Depends on how convenient the user is. </li><li>  Find the tax payment and click on "Pay". </li><li>  In the window that appears, write recipient information. </li><li>  Check the accuracy of the data and confirm the payment.  It is recommended that you print a receipt of payment. </li></ol><h2>  Online wallet </h2><p>  Another method of payment is using an electronic wallet.  The principle of operation is exactly the same as with Internet banking.  The only difference is that in the previously proposed method, money is transferred to the FTS account instantly.  And in the case of using electronic wallets, you will have to wait 2-3 days. </p>
