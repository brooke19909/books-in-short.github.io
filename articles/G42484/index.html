    <h2>  Cons of the slow cooker </h2><p>  Unfortunately, this device, in addition to the positive aspects, has several negative points.  Let's look at them. </p><p>  There are no ordinary watches in a multicooker.  This is not to say that this is too significant a drawback, but it is more convenient to work when they are built in.  The inner lid cannot be removed; this makes the washing process difficult.  Condensate is difficult to collect.  This is due to the fact that there is no container for it.  In the event that a power outage occurs, you will have to start the cooking process first and control the time.  The creators did not provide for a short-term lack of power, because of which the ability to memorize the mode was not built-in. </p><p>  <span>The power of the</span> Redmond RMC-02 multicooker is 400 volts.  This can not be unequivocally attributed to the pros or cons, but there is a technique of the same class that consumes much less electricity.  Difficulties may lie in finding this device in stores or online resources.  This is due to the fact that the crock-pot was released three years ago.  Unfortunately, now it is delivered in small quantities to the warehouses of various stores.  However, if you try, you can, of course, find. </p><p>  Sometimes problems are inadequate instructions.  It describes all the options for setting up the device.  But when in the process of cooking the Redmond RMC-02 crock-pot generates errors, it becomes clear - the instructions do not provide all the solutions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crock-pot redmond rmc 02 white" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1448973.jpg" width="498"></div>
