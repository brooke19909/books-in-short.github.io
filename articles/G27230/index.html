Today there is such an opportunity, since we will discuss the Russian tablet Wexler Tab 7T.  In many reviews, it is compared with the American untwisted computer <span>Asus Nexus 7. There</span> really are a lot of similarities - simple appearance, Nvidia Tegra 3 processor, low cost.  In the article we will describe our product, and readers will simply conclude on their own how much the device resembles an ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  With the appearance of the <span>Wexler Tab 7T,</span> everything is not as rosy as we would like.  We see that the case of the device is left from the previous generation Tab 7i, which did not suit many users for a number of reasons.  In particular, this is a large thickness of the case (about 13 millimeters), rough right angles, a thick frame (2.3 cm on the sides, if you hold the device horizontally).  All this creates not the most technologically advanced look for the tablet - it seems that it was produced in the USSR.  Well, all right - we will recoup on the filling. </p><p>  The developers originally approached the placement of navigation keys.  If we are used to the fact that the sound adjustment and screen unlock buttons are located on the right side edge, then on the Wexler Tab 7T 8Gb they are located on the rear panel and are placed so that it is convenient to reach them while holding the device horizontally. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On this occasion, one can argue endlessly - is it convenient to work with a computer in this format.  Therefore, just keep this in mind before buying.  Take the same <span>Nexus 7</span> - it has a vertical orientation by default. </p><p>  The front panel has an integrated front camera.  Again, it is located on the side field of the edging, which indicates adjustment for horizontal placement. </p><p>  The back cover, like the entire case, is made of rough black plastic, which, thanks to the matte texture, fits comfortably in your hand in any situation. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The first thing that catches your eye on any mobile device is the screen.  The Wexler Tab 7T has a seven-inch display that runs on IPS technology with a resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels. </p><p>  As the reviews on the device show, the picture on it is transmitted quite distinctly, thereby allowing you to watch movies in the highest quality, play colorful games and so on. </p>

    <p>  If you believe the technical characteristics, the screen itself is covered with tempered glass, so it is not so easy to damage it even with shock caused by a fall.  But, as many buyers of the device complain, it‚Äôs too easy to leave a fingerprint on it.  The problem is solved with the help of a matte protective film, which can be purchased at one of the online stores of accessories for mobile devices. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The brightness of the tablet is enough for everyday work, the only comment we managed to find in the reviews is to brighten the picture when you turn the tablet, tilt the device itself. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  On the ‚ÄúRussian Nexus‚Äù is installed, as already noted above, the Nvidia Tegra 3 processor. Its clock frequency in that particular modification, which stands on the Wexler Tab 7T 3G, is 1.2 GHz.  For this device, equipped with a screen of 7 inches, this processor is fully suitable for the volume of tasks.  That is, all the functions that may become necessary for the user device, the tablet will perform at the highest level. </p>

    <p>  As the reviews on the device show, even on the most bulky games, the Wexler Tab 7T tablet demonstrates its abilities excellently - this is the reproduction of any 3D-graphics in good quality without braking, jumping or other troubles.  As stated in the technical description of the device, the tablet is able to support displaying video in Full HD quality. </p><h2>  Communication options </h2><p>  Wexler Tab 7T supports everything with different communication formats: the device is capable of transmitting and receiving files via Bluetooth, working with Wi-Fi (at a fairly high connection speed, as the tests showed), and also receiving a signal via 3G (actually, this indicates part of the name of the tablet).  It should also be noted that Wexler, which is aimed at a low-budget customer, does not support work in LTE networks.  This, of course, is a flaw - but perhaps not critical.  For comfortable Internet surfing, 3G capacities are quite enough, especially on a small tablet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For navigation, <span>a GPS module is</span> installed in the device <span>.</span>  Tests conducted as part of this review show that it finds several satellites at once immediately after launching the application.  That is, no complaints about this can arise. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  As we have already indicated, the Wexler Tab 7T 8gb 3G has two cameras (which is traditional for such devices).  The resolution of the main one is 5 megapixels, while the front one has a 0.3 megapixel matrix.  Of course, you don‚Äôt have to expect that the pictures on the tablet will be in excellent quality.  Yes, technically, autofocus is provided here as a function, which allows you to sharpen the subject you are photographing.  However, as our tests have shown, it is applied (at the program level) incorrectly, often an erroneous object is selected for concentration.  Thus, taking pictures on the Wexler Tab 7T 3G tablet is possible only under ideal conditions - with enough light and after a short ‚Äúgame‚Äù with the settings on the device. </p><p>  By the way, given that the shell here is from Android, those who have already worked with this OS will be able to master the camera without problems. </p><p>  In addition to <span>taking</span> pictures, there is also a <span>panoramic shooting</span> function and support for video in 720 p. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  By the way, in the framework of this review, in addition to the characteristics of the device, it would also be necessary to give a description of the software platform.  This, as you can see from the official description, Android 4.1.1 (at the time of the start of sales).  Now, most likely, the tablet will be updated to 4.4.4 KitKat - the latest modification from the fourth generation.  Perhaps soon Wexler will launch the fifth generation of Android on its devices. </p><p>  The set of programs that the tablet buyer sees is slightly different from the standard.  So, in particular, here you will not be able to find such standard applications as Gmail or Google Drive.  But we see some (obviously sponsored) games, as well as programs for reading books, navigators and the second application store (besides Google Play) - TegraZone.  Thus, worrying about the lack of content is not worth it - as always, there are a lot of it. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  A very important role in the issue of device autonomy is played by its battery.  As the review of the Wexler Tab 7T 16Gb 3G tablet shows, the device works quite well - probably with the most active use it will last for 5-6 hours.  Normal mode allows you to talk about 8-9 hours of continuous operation.  This is an excellent indicator for a 7-inch tablet, which has a minimum amount of space inside the case. </p><p>  If you believe the technical specifications, the battery capacity is 4500 mAh.  For comparison, the American ‚Äúcompetitor‚Äù from Google (meaning the 7th generation Nexus) has 3500 mAh.  Probably, due to the powerful battery, combined with the right approach to optimizing battery consumption, the developers expect to get around the Asus tablet in the key to battery life. </p><p>  User reviews - perhaps the most objective source of information about any gadget, however, indicate an insufficient level of autonomy of the tablet.  Perhaps the technical parameters are too high or the system is not optimized properly.  But what we have in practice is clearly at odds with theory.  Why so - it's hard to say, but in fact the gadget's stamina is no different. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Another important nuance is memory.  Since we are comparing it with the Nexus, the Tab 7T has an internal memory of 16 GB.  The Asus product has two modifications - 16 and 32 GB.  At the same time, the domestic tablet is able to work with a memory card (this is also plus 64 ‚Äúpotential‚Äù gigabytes);  whereas the tablet from Google does not have such a function. </p>

    <p>  Thus, the ability to expand the capacity of the device up to 76 GB is an excellent indicator for a compact device.  Any of your series or film can be at your fingertips due to this. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  We have already provided user recommendations regarding the speed of the device and its autonomy.  Now I would also like to provide information about the overall assessment of the tablet, especially in the key of its shortcomings.  Indeed, no one will write about them, in contrast to positive qualities, in the technical description. </p><p>  So, in general, most of the recommendations (as shown by a number of large Internet sites with reviews) about the device are positive.  This is a good sign that customers, or rather, most of them, are satisfied with the work of the gadget.  Those who looked closely at the device, it can not but rejoice.  However, about Wexler Tab 7T (the price of which, by the way, was about 8 thousand rubles at the time of going on sale), there are negative characteristics.  We will talk about them in this section. </p><p>  The first thing that caught my eye was a series of messages from the owners about the identified defects.  In particular, it could be a faulty Wi-Fi module;  a battery that discharges too quickly;  broken accelerometer.  You can deal with this in one way - check all systems (if possible) even at the stage of buying a gadget. </p><p>  The second is a series of uncomfortable interface elements.  For example, the rectangular (even sharp) edges mentioned at the very beginning of the article, the thick frame around the display - all this is unusual for the user, whom other manufacturers ‚Äúpamper‚Äù with smooth, thin and graceful forms of devices.  An inconvenience should also include a plug, which is designed to close several functional holes at once (charging and headphones), which causes some discomfort. </p>

    <p>  The third category of negative characteristics about the tablet is poor-quality sound recording and playback systems, as well as a weak camera.  There can be no complaints in this matter - the device was initially presented as a budget one, therefore sensitive sensors and sensors cannot be installed on it.  Therefore, of course, from this point of view, it is not necessary to compare the gadget with the same Nexus 7.  Regarding the camera, everything is the same - only some users agree with the opinion that it would be better if they did not install it at all (since it is unlikely that it will be possible to remove anything in normal quality on it). </p><h2>  About firmware </h2>

    <p>  Of course, there are other negative aspects in the assembly and functionality of the tablet, but they are less discussed by users, so we will not mention them.  Some flaws were fixed by the firmware carried out on Wexler Tab 7T from 4.1.1 to version 4.2.2.  To do it, you need special software and, of course, certain skills.  If you don‚Äôt have such experience, it‚Äôs better to contact a specialist and clarify what features the Android device flashing has. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The tablet has both a number of disadvantages and strengths.  Therefore, everyone who thinks about its acquisition, just have to weigh both those and others.  And, of course, to make the most rational choice - whether such accessibility and performance of the gadget will suit it or whether the details of the assembly, implementation and device functionality are more important. </p>
