    <p>  Do-it-yourself products can be created using lightning.  The process is as follows: </p><ol><li>  It is necessary to divide the zipper into three identical parts, the length of which should completely fit the wrist with a certain margin. </li><li>  Clamp the edges of the fitting with a special fastener. </li><li>  Carefully braid parts of the lightning into a braid. </li><li>  It is necessary to clamp the second edge with the same clamp. </li><li>  5After that, you should attach the lock to the clips - and the <span>fashionable bracelet is</span> ready.  If there is no lock, you can use a thin satin ribbon. </li></ol><p>  Hand-made bracelets for hands using simple zippers can combine a variety of colors.  It all depends on which shades are available.  If you need a product of a specific color, which is perfect for an outfit or accessory, then you can go to the store and purchase all the required elements of a certain tone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Handle Bracelet </h2><p>  To make a bracelet, you need to collect a few pieces of fabric, a handle from an old bag, old rhinestones from a blouse and other various jewelry, focusing on your preferences.  In general, you can take everything that you do not need that you planned to throw away.  After that, you can start creating your own bracelets.  The patterns of this process can be varied.  But in this review, an optimal solution is given as an example. </p><p>  First, you need to cut a piece of the handle so long that it can wrap around your wrists.  Then, the resulting incision must be applied to the previously selected tissue and using a pencil to make marks.  The length of the material should be equal to the length of the handle plus one centimeter from each end.  The width should be about twice as large. </p><p>  We sew a piece of fabric from the inside and turn out so that the seam is located inside.  After that, we insert a piece of the handle from the bag.  We bend the edges of the fabric and sew it carefully.  In order to achieve maximum beauty, you can attach to the edges of the ring, removed again from the purse.  Then we begin to sew on rhinestones, beads and pearls.  It is desirable that they match the overall color scheme.  It should be noted that the pattern can be varied.  In this case, everything depends on the imagination. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2><br>  Beautiful do-it-yourself bracelets </h2><p>  In order to build a stylish gold bracelet for a guy with your own hands, you will need a golden chain, gold beads and a not very thick wire.  Cut the chain into three pieces so that the majority, folded in half, fully matches the length of the outside of the wrist.  The length of the other two parts, in general, should correspond to the remaining length of the inner part of the wrist. </p>

Fold it in half, attach each end to the short part of the chain.  Next, cut the wire into several smaller pieces.  One large piece should fit 5-6 beads, the next two in pairs - 3-4 beads, etc. It is necessary to do everything until you get pieces that will fit only one bead.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition to the bead, each segment should also have a small supply of free space, which is necessary for their fastening directly to the bracelet.  The longest piece of wire with beads is attached to the middle of our double chain.  On each side are smaller segments.  And so on to decrease.  The result is a diamond shaped bracelet. </p><p>  When everything is ready, you will need to attach a clasp to one of the edges of the chain.  Having shown a little imagination, based on this method, you can make bracelets for lovers. </p><h2><br>  With our own hands we make a woven bracelet </h2><p>  First of all, you need to decide what the cord will be.  It is desirable that he was bright and fit under clothes.  The first type of knot should be tied, as on a hook.  Creating the first two or three nodes will be a bit complicated, the rest will turn out better.  The main thing is to make sure that the size of each nodule matches the previous one. </p><p>  More attention should be paid to the length of the cord.  You must choose a very long element, because due to the nature of the nodes, the overall dimension is greatly reduced.  Such a nuisance can happen that the bracelet is small.  When the length reaches a satisfactory level, the edges of the bracelet should be equipped with a special cap.  A lock is attached to the plugs.  After all the steps have been completed, you can wear the bracelet yourself or give it to a loved one. </p>

    <h2>  DIY products will always please </h2><p>  A beautiful bracelet for a hand will always delight you not only with its originality, but also with the realization that it was obtained as a result of your own efforts.  And this can lead to the creation of other, more beautiful and original products that can act as the perfect gift for friends or loved ones.  Over time, when your skill improves, more complex elements can be made.  For example, a do-it-yourself bracelet for survival will be much easier if you have a certain skill. </p><h2>  Create a watch bracelet on your own </h2><p>  Most people simply do not tolerate monotony.  They always want to modify something in their old elements of clothing or in accessories.  In addition, the modern world does not have any formed and firmly entrenched canons of fashion.  Therefore, everyone can dress as he wants and wear what he wants. </p>

The master class of this process is given below. </p><ol><li>  You will need to put a wire on the loop of the dial.  It will have to be bent exactly in the center. </li><li>  In order for the bend point not to be visible, it is necessary to extend the bead cup immediately through the two ends of the wire. </li><li>  Beads will need to be prepared so that they are enough for a bracelet equal to the circumference of the wrist.  Beads will need to be put on the cable and secured with cups and clamping parts. </li><li>  At the end of the wire, you will need to fix the ring for the lock.  After that, you need to stretch the ends through the clamping beads in order to fix them more tightly. </li><li>  Using thin-nose pliers, tighten the ends of the cable.  This needs to be done so that the beads are pressed closer to each other.

In the end, you only need to attach the lock stick, pull up the wire and clamp it. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself bracelets for lovers" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18274/368144.jpg?1396772553551" width="451"></div></li></ol><h2>  Result </h2><p>  If everything was done as described above, with a competent and accurate approach, you get a chic bracelet for watches.
