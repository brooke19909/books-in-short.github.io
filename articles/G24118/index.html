    <p>  And only later, as adults, did people realize that the creator of the world's first workers' state passed away at a fairly young age, he was only 53 years old.  Of course, there are frequent cases when men become grandfathers, exchanging the sixth dozen, but apparently they can still be attractive, and they rarely correspond to the image of an elderly bent old man. </p><p>  They talked about how Lenin died more briefly than about his love for children.  The main version is the consequences of a serious injury by a poisoned bullet fired by a terrorist Kaplan.  The fact that almost six years have passed from the time of this attempt to the death of the leader was taken into account, but the explanation for this was also quite logical.  Pathological changes in the vessels of the brain accumulated, there was a gradual liming of the circulatory system and, as a result, three strokes in a row, the last of which turned out to be fatal. </p>

    <p>  In the winter of 1924, in Gorki, where Lenin died, doctors made stubborn attempts to reanimate him.  The events took place at six in the afternoon of January 21, a medical device was connected to the patient, which at that time was very rare, but he did not help.  An autopsy showed that the brain was indeed in an extremely painful state, which developed, apparently, for more than one year.  Thus, a conclusion was drawn about the mental state of the “genius of revolution”, which was later formulated by Nobel laureate professor Pavlov, the author of brilliant works on reflexology.  According to him, a coup in Russia was conceived and realized by a mentally ill person who suffered from an advanced form of syphilis that penetrated the brain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  About how Lenin died, and about the circumstances preceding his death, the general public became aware only in the nineties.  A widespread version of Stalin's involvement in the death of Vladimir Ilyich arose in the second half of the fifties.  It was based on vague hints of the then First Secretary, N. S. Khrushchev, who sought to impress upon everyone that he knew something about how Lenin died, and how Kirov was killed, and something else ... </p><p>  The goal was simple: to further demonize the image of his predecessor with the goal of his own whitening.  There was simply no sense in the physical elimination of a helpless, slurred speaker and broken by a merciless ailment, and the notorious “Letter to the Congress”, despite all its “top secret”, was no secret to anyone in the Central Committee. </p>

    <p>  Another version of the cause of death of the leader, defined as a genetic predisposition, was also expressed.  What caused Lenin to die, namely a brain hemorrhage, was the cause of the death of his father, <span>Ulyanov Ilya</span> Nikolaevich, Samara inspector of education.  His age was also not at all advanced, only 54 years old.  However, the difference was that the respected state councilor, even in his last days, did not suffer from dementia or pathological cruelty to people of all ages. </p><p>  The circumstances of how Lenin died and the general symptoms do not contradict Pavlov’s version.  As often happens, the cause of death could be a complex of destructive factors, including injuries and the unlucky visit of a 32-year-old political emigrant to a Parisian woman of easy virtue, and unhealthy heredity.  But all of them in some way explain the cruelty that this "good grandfather" showed, writing orders to destroy hundreds of thousands of people, the colors of the people of Russia. </p><p>  In fairness, it should be noted that this version has not received official confirmation.  In addition, the outstanding German neurologist M. Nonne who examined Lenin in 1923 later denied it, claiming that he did not find any signs of neurosyphilis in the patient.  Therefore, disputes about the causes of death of the leader of the world proletariat are likely to be waged for many more years. </p>
