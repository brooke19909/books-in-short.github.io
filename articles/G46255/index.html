Nuclear power</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cold <span>fusion</span> can also be called cold fusion.  Its essence lies in the possibility of realizing a nuclear fusion reaction occurring in any chemical systems.  It is assumed that there is no significant overheating of the working substance.  As you know, conventional <span>nuclear reactions</span> during their creation create a temperature that can be measured in millions of degrees Kelvin.  Cold fusion in theory does not require such a high temperature. </p><h2>  Numerous studies and experiments </h2><p>  The study of cold fusion, on the one hand, is considered pure fraud.  No other scientific areas in this are comparable to him.  On the other hand, it is possible that this field of science has not been fully studied, and at all cannot be considered utopia, and even more so fraud.  However, in the history of the development of cold thermonuclear fusion, if not liars, then they were probably crazy. </p><p>  The recognition by pseudoscience of this direction and the reason for the criticism to which the technology of cold nuclear fusion was subjected was the numerous failures of scientists working in this field, as well as falsifications made by individuals.  Since 2002, most scientists believe that work to resolve this issue is futile. </p><p>  At the same time, some still try to carry out such a reaction.  So, in 2008, a Japanese scientist from the University of Osaka publicly demonstrated an experiment performed with an electrochemical cell.  It was Yoshiaki Arata.  After such a demonstration, the scientific community again began to talk about the possibility or impossibility of cold thermonuclear fusion, which nuclear physics can provide.  Some scientists qualified in nuclear physics and chemistry are looking for justifications for this phenomenon.  And they do this in order to find not a nuclear explanation for him, but another, alternative.  In addition, this is also due to the fact that information on neutron radiation is not available. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nuclear fusion" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38335/1087622.jpg" width="600"></div>

It all started on March 23, 1989.  It was then that Professor Martin Fleischman with his partner Stanley Pons gathered a press conference at the University of Chemistry in Utah (USA).  Then they stated that they had carried out a cold fusion reaction by simply passing an electric current through an electrolyte.  According to chemists, as a result of the reaction, they were able to get a positive energy output, that is, heat.  In addition, they observed nuclear radiation resulting from the reaction and coming from the electrolyte. </p><p>  The statement made literally made a splash in the scientific community.  Of course, low-temperature nuclear fusion, performed on a simple desk, could radically change the whole world.  Complexes of huge chemical plants, which also cost a huge amount of money, are no longer needed, and the result in the form of obtaining the desired reaction when it comes is not known.  If everything was confirmed, Flashishman and Pons would have an amazing future, and humanity would have a considerable reduction in costs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="low temperature fusion" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38335/1087620.jpg" width="339"></div>

And, who knows, perhaps the most important.  The fact is that in the scientific community it is not customary to make any statements to the media about their inventions or discoveries before information about them is published in special scientific journals.  Scientists doing so instantly receive criticism, it is considered a kind of bad manners in the scientific community.  According to the rules, a scientist who made a discovery is secretly obliged to notify the scientific community about it first, which will decide whether this invention is truly true, whether it should be recognized as a discovery at all.  On the legal side, this is considered an obligation to fully maintain secrecy about what happened, which the discoverer must observe from the moment of submitting his article to the publication and until its publication.  Nuclear physics is no exception. </p><p>  Flashman and his colleague sent such an article to a scientific journal called Nature, which was the most authoritative scientific publication worldwide.  All people associated with science know that such a magazine will not publish unverified information, and moreover will not print anyone.  Martin Fleishman at that time was already considered a fairly respected scientist working in the field of electrochemistry, so the submitted article was due to be published shortly.  And so it happened.  Three months after the ill-fated conference, the publication was published, but the hype around the opening was already in full swing.  Perhaps this is why Nature‚Äôs chief editor, John Maddox, already in the next monthly issue of the magazine published his doubts about the discovery made by Flashman and Pons and that they had obtained the energy of a nuclear reaction.  In his note, he wrote that chemists should be punished for his premature publication.  There they were told that real scientists would never have allowed their inventions to be publicly disclosed, and those who do this can be considered ordinary adventurers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After some time, Pons and Fleischman suffered another blow, which can be called crushing.  A number of scientists from the American scientific institutes of the United States (Massachusetts and California Technological Universities) conducted, that is, repeated the experiment of chemists, creating the same conditions and factors.  However, this did not lead to the result declared by Flashman. </p>

    <h2>  Is it possible or impossible? </h2><p>  Since that time, there has been a clear division of the entire scientific community into two camps.  Supporters of one convinced everyone that cold fusion was an invention that was not based on anything.  Others, on the contrary, are still convinced that cold fusion is possible, that the ill-fated chemists still made a discovery that could ultimately save all of humanity, giving it an inexhaustible source of energy. </p><p>  The fact that if the invention of a new method does happen, with which cold fusion reactions will be possible, and, accordingly, the significance of such a discovery will be invaluable to all people on a global scale, attracts more and more scientists to this scientific direction, part of which can actually be considered fraudsters.  Entire states are making significant efforts to build just one fusion station, spending huge amounts of money, while cold fusion is able to extract energy in absolutely simple and fairly inexpensive ways.  This is what attracts those who want to cash in by fraud, as well as other persons with mental disorders.  Among the adherents of this method of generating energy, one can find both. </p><p>  A story with cold fusion simply had to get into the archive of so-called pseudoscientific stories.  If you look at the method by which the energy of nuclear fusion is obtained with a sober look, you can understand that it takes a huge amount of energy to combine two atoms into one.  It is necessary to overcome electrical resistance.  In the currently under construction International <span>Thermonuclear Reactor,</span> which will be located in the city of Karadash in France, it is planned to carry out the connection of two atoms, which are the easiest of the existing in nature.  As a result of such a connection, a positive energy release is expected.  These two atoms are tritium and deuterium.  They are isotopes of hydrogen, so nuclear hydrogen synthesis will be the basis.  To make such a connection, an incredible temperature is needed - hundreds of millions of degrees.  Of course, this will require enormous pressure.  For this reason, many scientists believe that cold fusion is not possible. </p>

    <h2>  Success and failure </h2><p>  However, to justify this synthesis under consideration, it should be noted that among his fans there are not only people with crazy ideas and scammers, but also quite normal specialists.  After the performance of Flashman and Pons and the failure of their discovery, many scientists and research institutes continued to do this.  Not without Russian specialists, who also made corresponding attempts.  And the most interesting thing is that such experiments in some cases ended in success, and in some cases failed. </p><p>  However, everything is strict in science: if a discovery occurs and the experiment is successful, then it must be repeated again with a positive result.  If this is not so, such a discovery will not be recognized by anyone.  Moreover, the repetition of a successful experiment could not be done by the researchers themselves.  In some cases, they did it, in others - no.  Because of what this is happening, no one could explain, there is still no scientifically based reason for such inconstancy. </p><h2>  The present inventor and genius </h2><p>  The whole story described above with Flashman and Pons has the other side of the coin, or rather, the truth carefully concealed by Western countries.  The fact is that Stanley Pons was previously a citizen of the USSR.  In 1970, he was part of an expert team developing thermionic installations.  Of course, Pons was initiated into many secrets of the Soviet state and, having emigrated to the United States, tried to realize them. </p><p>  The true pioneer who achieved some success in cold fusion was Ivan Stepanovich Filimonenko. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cold fusion reactor" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38335/1087618.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <h2>  Brief information about the Soviet scientist </h2><p>  I.S. Filimonenko died in 2013.  He was a scientist who almost stopped the entire development of nuclear energy, not only in his country, but throughout the world.  It was he who nearly created the nuclear fusion plant, which, unlike <span>nuclear power plants,</span> would be safer and very cheap.  In addition to this installation, a Soviet scientist created an aircraft based on the principle of antigravity.  He was known as a revealer of the hidden dangers that nuclear power could bring to mankind.  The scientist worked in the defense complex of the USSR, was an academician and an expert on <span>radiation safety.</span>  It is noteworthy that some of the works of the academician, including the cold nuclear fusion of Filimonenko, are still classified.  Ivan Stepanovich was a direct participant in the creation of hydrogen, nuclear and neutron bombs, was engaged in the development of nuclear reactors designed to launch rockets into space. </p><h2>  Installation of the Soviet academician </h2><p>  In 1957, Ivan Filimonenko developed a cold fusion power plant, with which the country could save up to three hundred billion dollars a year by using it in the energy sector.  This invention of the scientist was initially fully supported by the state, as well as such well-known scientists as Kurchatov, Keldysh, Korolev.  Further development and bringing the invention of Filimonenko to a ready state was authorized at that time by Marshal Zhukov himself.  The discovery of Ivan Stepanovich was the source from which pure nuclear energy was to be extracted, and besides this, with its help it would be possible to obtain protection from nuclear radiation and eliminate the effects of radioactive contamination. </p>

    <h2>  The removal of Filimonenko from work </h2><p>  It is possible that after some time the invention of Ivan Filimonenko would be carried out on an industrial scale, and humanity would get rid of many problems.  However, fate in the person of some people decreed otherwise.  His colleagues Kurchatov and Korolev died, and Marshal Zhukov resigned.  This was the beginning of the so-called undercover game in the scientific community.  The result was a halt in all the work of Filimonenko, and in 1967 he was dismissed.  An additional reason for this treatment of a distinguished scientist was his struggle to stop testing nuclear weapons.  With his works, he constantly proved the harm done to nature and directly to people, many projects to launch rockets with nuclear reactors were stopped from its supply (any accident on such a rocket that occurred in orbit could threaten radioactive contamination of the whole Earth).  Given the arms race, which was gaining momentum at that time, Academician Filimonenko became objectionable to some high-ranking officials.  His experimental installations are recognized as contradicting the laws of nature, the scientist himself is dismissed, expelled from the Communist Party, stripped of all ranks and generally declared to be a mentally abnormal person. </p><p>  Already in the late eighties and early nineties, the academician's work was resumed, new experimental facilities were being developed, but all of them were not brought to a positive result.  Ivan Filimonenko proposed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing his mobile unit to eliminate the consequences in Chernobyl, but it was rejected.  In the period from 1968 to 1989, Filimonenko was removed from any tests and work in the direction of cold thermonuclear fusion, and the designs, diagrams, and drawings themselves, together with some Soviet scientists, went abroad. </p><p>  In the early 1990s, the United States announced successful trials in which they allegedly obtained nuclear energy as a result of cold fusion.  This served as an impetus to the fact that his state again remembered the legendary Soviet scientist.  He was reinstated, but this did not help either.  By that time, the collapse of the USSR began, funding was limited, respectively, and there were no results.  As Ivan Stepanovich later said in an interview, seeing the ongoing and at the same time unsuccessful attempts of many scientists from all over the world to obtain positive results of cold nuclear fusion, he realized that without him no one could finish the job.  And, indeed, he was telling the truth.  From 1991 to 1993, American scientists, who got the Filimonenko installation, could not understand the principle of its action, and even a year later they completely dismantled it.  In 1996, influential people from the United States offered Ivan Stepanovich one hundred million dollars just to give them advice, explaining how the cold fusion reactor works, to which he refused. </p>

    <h2>  The essence of the experiments of the Soviet academician </h2><p>  Through experiments, Ivan Filimonenko established that, as a result of the decomposition of so-called heavy water by electrolysis, it decomposes into oxygen and deuterium.  The latter, in turn, dissolves in the palladium cathode, in which nuclear fusion reactions develop.  In the process, Filimonenko recorded the absence of both radioactive waste and neutron radiation.  In addition, as a result of his experiments, Ivan Stepanovich established that his nuclear fusion reactor emits indefinite radiation, and it is this radiation that greatly reduces the half-life of radioactive isotopes.  That is, radioactive contamination is neutralized. </p><p>  There is an opinion that Filimonenko at one time refused to replace nuclear reactors with his installation in underground shelters prepared for the top leaders of the USSR in the event of a nuclear war.  In those days, the Caribbean crisis was raging, and therefore the possibility of its beginning was very high.  The ruling circles both the USA and the USSR stopped only that in such underground cities pollution from nuclear reactors would still kill all living things after a few months.  An activated cold fusion reactor Filimonenko could create a safety zone against radioactive contamination, therefore, if the academician agreed to this, then the probability of a nuclear war could be increased several times.  If this was true, then the deprivation of all his awards and further repression find their logical basis. </p><h2>  Warm fusion </h2><p>  I. S. Filimonenko created a thermionic hydrolysis power plant, which was absolutely environmentally friendly.  To date, no one has been able to create a similar analogue of TEGEU.  The essence of this installation and at the same time the difference from other similar units was that it did not use nuclear reactors, but nuclear fusion plants, which occur at an average temperature of 1150 degrees.  Therefore, such an invention was called the installation of warm nuclear fusion.      ,   ,   3  .        ,   .     12,5 ,       .        ,  ,         !          ,  ,           . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="   " class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38335/1087619.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p> Thus, at present it is not known for certain whether the cold fusion has the right to exist or not.  It is quite possible that if it were not for the repression against the real genius of science Filimonenko, then the world would now be different, and the life expectancy of people could increase many times over.  After all, even then, Ivan Filimonenko stated that radioactive radiation is the cause of aging people and soon death.  It is radiation, which is now literally everywhere, not to mention megacities, that violates human chromosomes.  Maybe that‚Äôs why the biblical characters lived for a thousand years, since at that time this destructive radiation probably did not exist. </p><p>  The installation created by academician Filimonenko in the future could rid the planet of such killing pollution, in addition, providing an inexhaustible source of cheap energy.  Whether it is true or not, time will tell, but it is a pity that this time could already come. </p>
