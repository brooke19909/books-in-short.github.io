Each has its own advantages, and sometimes it‚Äôs not so easy to choose.  PocketBook Pro 602 is a good model, characterized by both quality and multifunctionality. </p>

    <h2>  Two models </h2><p>  In fact, it is not unique.  The brand has two very similar models: 603 and 602, the latter has the only significant difference - it is a touch screen. </p><p>  The case of PocketBook Pro 602 is made of durable plastic and is pleasant to the touch.  The back cover is magnesium.  The device is convenient and lightweight, it allows you to read for several hours, because the hands do not numb and do not get tired.  Management is carried out by mechanical buttons: a five-way joystick, page turning buttons, a content button, an access button to the main menu and a button to return to the previous menu. </p><p>  As in many other e-books, the Pro 602 has no difficulties with glare and image distortion depending on the angle of view, so the text will be clearly visible even in very bright light.  Also in the settings there is a function to enable the update mode without dimming the screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As in many other models, the power button is located on the upper side of the case.  The Wi-Fi switch is also on the side. </p>

    <h2>  Connectors and Software </h2><p>  At the bottom there is a MicroSD slot for connecting additional memory, a USB connector for connecting to a computer and exchanging data, a standard headphone input, a charge indicator and a reset button. </p><p>  One of the strong features of almost all models of this brand, and in particular PocketBook Pro 602, is the battery.  It gives a charge of 7 thousand pages.  Even with intensive reading, the battery charge will last for a long time, so you can not take an extra charger on vacation.  However, it is worth remembering that the inclusion of Wi-Fi gives an additional load on the battery and can greatly reduce its operating time.  You can turn off the wireless network in a couple of moments using the switch on the side. </p><p>  The software functionality of the PockketBook Pro 602 is surprising.  In addition to the flexible settings of the book itself, stylization of reading, increasing and changing the font, external design, the ability to connect to a wireless network, there are all standard functions: reading many formats of books and photos, listening to music. </p>

    <h2>  Multitasking </h2><p>  The built-in gyro sensor allows the text to flip on the screen automatically (the function can be turned off), and the flip happens quite quickly, without "glitches".  In addition to the ability to connect additional memory, the book also has a built-in, 2 GB in size.  This figure has already become the standard for e-books. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After this model, several new ones have already been released, however, it is the first in which there was a multitasking function.  This e-book allows you to run multiple applications at the same time and switch between them, like on a computer.  A useful feature for those who need to separately view drawings or illustrations and consult several documents and books. </p>

    <h2>  Orientation </h2><p>  Often in readers there is such a drawback as the lack of support for some text encodings.  However, the PocketBook Pro 602 e-book supports many formats that are popular among the reading population of Russia.  The device sees all Cyrillic encodings, so you can be sure that any book will be displayed correctly. </p><p>  The manufacturer also implemented voice reading of the text, although the pronunciation, as expected, is not the best.  However, the function itself is able to turn a regular book into an audio book.  Font size is easily adjustable by pressing the five-way joystick.  A font can be selected from dozens of options, although there are only a few significant differences, but this is an advantage over other models in which the choice is between two or three fonts.  There is even anti-aliasing of fonts, changing line spacing and page margins, as well as bookmarking, switching to the desired page and working with the dictionary.  All this gives a great advantage to PocketBook Pro 602. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many owners are happy with their purchase.  Most note the quality assembly and design, as well as the ability to choose between black and white colors (the book comes in two colors).  The number of readable formats is also noted by users as a virtue.  The battery lasts really long. </p><p>  But the manufacturer can tell all the pros, but what about the cons?  They are also in the book, although it does not belong to the category of budget.  Buyers note that the book starts to run slower when the memory is fully loaded.  You should not count on the speakers: they are quite quiet, so listening to music is still better on devices designed specifically for this.  The screen does not respond to fingers, and the response from the stylus is not instant (after all, this is not a tablet). </p><h2>  Mail and Reset </h2><p>  According to the owners, the device can be used to check mail, but the page loading will have to wait a long time. </p><p>  Many note the numerous superfluous functions as the main drawback of the book.  Case for Pocketbook 602 Pro comes with the kit. </p><p>  When connecting to a computer, the device must first be turned off.  If this is not done, it may freeze, only the Reset key will help. </p><p>  At the time this e-book reader was announced, touch E-ink screens were quite rare, but now there are models from the same price category, but with a touch screen.  These include the older model, Pro 912. However, the Pro 602 remains relevant because of the quality and functionality. </p>
