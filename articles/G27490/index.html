How to draw up, receive, activate, check the balance or close the MTS Money card?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Probably, each of us has a mobile phone, and two out of ten residents of Russia are subscribers of the MTS mobile operator.  They are potential customers of MTS-Bank and, having visited one of the operator’s numerous communication salons, they can become owners of the <span>MTS</span> Money <span>credit card</span> .  This card has many nuances, so those who decide, without delving into anything, just take a card, can only sympathize.  The reason for this is that it is very easy, without thinking about anything, to get into debt with her, and then to be frankly dissatisfied with the quality of service and conditions, scribbling negative reviews on the Internet.  For full and proper use of the card, it is best to study the many nuances and try to thoroughly deal with all the subtleties of service. </p><h2>  About tariffs and conditions </h2>

    <p>  First, you should familiarize yourself with the rates and terms of service provided by the bank, on which you can use the card.  Looking only at them, you can conclude for yourself whether you want to draw up a MTS Money card or not.  Pay attention to all the items in the tariff table, because any of them may be decisive in your choice.  It: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Credit limit amount. </li><li>  The interest rate on the loan. </li><li>  <span>The grace period of the</span> loan. </li><li>  Minimum monthly payment. </li><li>  <span>Penalties</span> for default on debt. </li><li>  Fee for skipping the minimum payment. </li><li>  Release fee. </li><li>  The cost of annual maintenance. </li><li>  The cost of reissuing a card before the expiration date. </li><li>  The cost of reissuing a card at the initiative of the bank (upon expiration). </li><li>  Commission upon receipt of own funds at an ATM. </li><li>  Commission for obtaining credit at an ATM. </li><li>  Commission upon receipt of funds at the cash desks of MTS-Bank OJSC without a card. </li><li>  Commission for online banking. </li><li>  Commission for a mobile bank. </li><li>  SMS informing. </li></ul><p>  Many people do not speak well of such a banking product as MTS Money.  A map, reviews of a negative nature about which you can read, is not so bad and has its advantages.  The reasons for customer dissatisfaction are often associated with the fact that they inattentively read the terms of the service contract, and sometimes sign it without looking at all.  At the very least, you should familiarize yourself with the tariffs and conditions for servicing cards in order to soberly assess what you should expect and whether you need this card at all. </p><h2>  What is the line of MTS Bank cards </h2><p>  "MTS Money" is a card, the base of which is the international payment system MasterCard, issued in several versions.  You can choose between a debit card (“Basic” tariff), a classic MasterCard Standard credit card, which is represented by two tariffs: “Plus” and “Extra”, and a MasterCard Gold credit card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Debit Card "MTS-Bank" </h2><p>  Speaking about the <span>debit card,</span> there is only one plus.  If you are a MTS subscriber, then 1% is returned to your mobile phone account from a monthly turnover on the card.  However, those few who already have a MTS Money debit card did not appreciate the conditions of this kind. </p>

    <p>  Judge for yourself: an annual card maintenance costs 300 rubles, in order to make purchases by bank transfer, it is necessary to constantly replenish it.  If you transfer from another card, then a commission is taken, and you can replenish it in the salons of communication, bank offices and terminals completely free of charge.  Here we will not talk about additional services, such as SMS-informing or insurance.  However, simple mathematics speaks for itself: spending, using a card, for a month, for example, 20,000 rubles, you will receive only 200 on your mobile account. Of course, a trifle, but rather pleasant than vice versa.  Therefore, we hope that MTS Money is a card that will still find its holder. </p><h2>  Credit cards </h2><p>  It will be interesting to talk about credit cards that MTS Bank offers to its customers.  Reasoning sensibly, one can say that a Gold credit card is just as dubious as a debit card.  Annual service is no less than 1,500 rubles, which is three times more expensive than servicing a classic card, and despite the fact that the choice of tariffs is the same for both.  In addition, there is no information about this card except in the tariff table.  What to do with it in this case and what is its advantage over the usual?  This, apparently, will remain a mystery, so we did not talk about this map above and will not talk further, but we will turn to those that have already been mentioned. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  As we said earlier, the MTS Money credit card is a card that has two service tariffs - Plus and Extra.  The main difference is that the Plus tariff does not provide for a grace period for crediting - one of the most important bonuses of any full-fledged credit card, which makes it possible to use the credit for free for a certain period, in our case 50 days.  There is such an advantage in the Extra tariff. </p><p>  Therefore, if you make a purchase using the MTS-Bank card with the Plus tariff, you will immediately begin to accrue interest on the loan, which is very expensive.  Therefore, choose a card with a grace period, that is, the Extra tariff.  It is he who will be aggressively offered by sellers, but not because they care about the benefits of their product to the client, but because it is beneficial primarily to themselves. </p><h2>  Card receipt and closing procedure </h2><p>  Many are interested in the question of how to get a MTS Money card.  Believe me, this is not a big deal, and you will try to impose it in every possible way if you are between 18 and 60 years old and have a passport with you.  If all these conditions are met, right in the MTS salon, for a maximum of half an hour you will receive a credit card with a limit of up to 100 thousand rubles.  If you want to increase it, you will have to provide a certificate of income.  At the same time, you do not need to confirm your solvency if you are a citizen of Russia and are registered in any region of the country, not even where you get the card. </p>

    <p>  If you don’t know how to activate the MTS Money card, upon receiving it you will be instructed what to do.  You will receive a welcome text message on your mobile phone that says the current two days from the moment you received the temporary control code.  By calling the toll-free number 8 (800) 250-08-90 and following the instructions received from the autoinformer, you must come up with and form your own PIN code.  Remember that various security checks occur during such operations, so be prepared to provide the last 4 digits of the card or CVC2. </p><p>  Remember that you can immediately get only an unnamed card, and personalized cards with PayPass technology (contactless reading of information from the card) and a chip are made for at least 5 days.  If you read what they write for those who need a registered “MTS Money” card, reviews are unlikely to please, because judging by them, it is impossible to immediately issue such a more secure card.  You need to get an unnamed one, and then pay for a reissue and get a chipped one. </p><p>  In this case, if possible, insist on getting the card you need, and the best option would be to call the bank and find out if you can immediately get a name card bypassing the nameless one. </p><p>  If for some reason you no longer need a card, you need to know how to close the MTS Money card correctly.  To do this, you must necessarily pay off all available at the time of the decision to close the debts on the card.  After this, you should personally go to a communication salon or bank office and write a statement about closing the account, indicating in it that you refuse to reissue the card in your hands and receive a new one. </p><h2>  Deposit, cash withdrawal and account management </h2><p>  Many have problems regarding how to replenish the MTS Money card.  Make it easy.  You can deposit cash without paying a commission and in a matter of seconds, at the cash desks of MTS storerooms and bank offices.  A good option would be a wire transfer from a bank account of any bank or replenishment through the terminals “Cyberplat” and “Eleksnet”. </p><p>  You can withdraw cash without commission from MTS-Bank ATMs and banks that are members of the United Settlement System.  More information about it and the addresses of ATMs can be found on the official website. </p><p>  Having become the holder of the MTS Money banking product, you can check the card balance by connecting services such as mobile and Internet banking, as well as SMS informing.  This will make it possible to control the state of the account, wherever you are, at any time of the day or night. </p><h2>  Cash bonuses </h2><p>  If you receive a card, you have the opportunity to use the various paid bonuses that come with it.  This is the MTS Bonus program, a set of paid options, receiving discounts from bank partners and the “Successful Purchase” bonus program, a bonus program from the MasterCard international payment system. </p><h2>  MTS Bonus </h2><p>  It's no secret that MTS returns bonus points for this program to the card, where 1 point is equal to 30 rubles spent on the card.  As a new customer, you will receive 1,000 welcome bonuses if you pay with your card for goods and services totaling 3,000 rubles.  Points under the program are credited twice a month - until the 10th or 25th day of each month, depending on the time of purchase. </p>

    <p>  Also, MTS subscribers can exchange points for minutes of calls within the network, Internet, SMS and MMS.  Also, if the possibility of paying bonuses for subscriptions to popular media. </p><p>  It should be remembered that points are not awarded for every operation on the card.  You can read more about this on the official website of MTS-Bank, as well as find out the balance of the MTS Money card along with information on bonuses. </p><h2>  Paid options.  Mobile program </h2><p>  If you are a MTS subscriber, then when paying 300 rubles a year every month 3% of the amount of purchases made by credit card will be returned to your mobile account, but not less than 3,000 rubles.  If you are a debit card holder, you get 1%, but this option will be free for you. </p><h2>  Paid options.  Shopping Program </h2><p>  Paying 1,200 rubles annually, you will also receive 3% of the card turnover per month in net money, but not more than 5,000 rubles per month.  Moreover, to receive bonuses you must make purchases and pay by bank transfer in the amount of 15,000 rubles per month. </p><h2>  Paid options.  Accumulative program and Travel program </h2><p>  Paying 700 rubles every year, you will receive from 5% (if the amount does not exceed 20,000 rubles per month) to 8% (if the turnover exceeds 20,000 rubles) each month under the terms of the Cumulative bonus program. </p><p>  The Travel option, which costs 1,300 rubles a year, makes it possible to receive bonus points and compensate for the cost of buying air tickets, booking hotels and renting cars.  Spending 20 rubles in Russia, you get 1 point; by purchasing something abroad, you get 2 points for the same amount.  1 point = 0.5 rubles, funds are debited from the bonus account to the main card account automatically after accumulating 3000 points.  The maximum number of accumulated bonuses is 6000. </p><p>  However, there are a few points you need to know about: </p><ul><li>  You can connect only one bonus program from the number offered. </li><li>  If you decide to switch to another, the balance of unused funds for the old will not be returned to you. </li><li>  If the bank, at its discretion, disables you any option, it is obliged to return to you the balance of unspent funds. </li><li>  Money for a paid option, as written in the contract, is withdrawn from the cardholder’s own, and not from the credit account.  In fact, funds are written off from where there is a sufficient amount of money, and this can be either a credit or a debit account.  Therefore, you need to track all expenditure operations in order to know where you calculate the cost of the service. </li></ul><h2>  The “Successful purchase” program.  Discounts from partners of the bank </h2><p>  This is the most standard bonus program that most banks have.  You have the opportunity to receive discounts from partner stores when purchasing on a card.  There are not so many of them and information about them and current promotions can be obtained on the MTS official website. </p><h2>  Bonus program of the international payment system MasterCard </h2><p>  Few people know about this opportunity, but international payment systems also have their own customer reward programs.  To get information about bonuses, just go to the site of the MasterCard payment system. </p>

    <h2>  People says </h2><p>  It’s not a secret for any of us that there are so many people, so many opinions on any occasion.  Like any banking product, MTS Money is a card whose reviews vary, but have a more negative connotation.  All of them are based mainly on human errors: they did not carry out the card closing procedure properly, did not follow which paid services were connected, and did not disconnect unnecessary ones, inattentively read the service agreement or did not read it at all, did not thoroughly study the tariff table, lost PIN- code and paid money for reissuing a card and much more. </p>
