    <h2>  Why visit Canazei </h2><p>  The best places for winter outdoor activities are the <span>ski resorts of Italy.</span>  Canazei is perhaps the best of them.  What is the famous Sella Ronda - a complex of lifts that encircles several peaks of the Dolomites. </p><p>  Convenient location is another plus of the resort.  It is located very close to the three mountain passes (Sella, Pordoi and Fedaya).  This allows vacationers in one or two weeks to try out not only the local slopes, but also the tracks of neighboring resorts.  For example, the Campitello complex, located two kilometers from Canazei. </p><p>  Italy is famous for its ski mini-region - Val di Fassa.  It includes all the resorts of the Dolomites: Campitello, Canazei, and other small settlements.  This Italian region is considered one of the most glamorous places for a winter holiday.  This is where classic wooden chalets blend with bohemian clubs and night bars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ski slopes Canazei (Italy) </h2><p>  The total length of all ski slopes of the resort reaches 150 kilometers.  They are here for every taste and skill level. </p><p>  For those who ride quite confidently and easily, there are practically no difficult tracks here.  Professionals will surely enjoy off-piste skiing, the conditions for which are ideal in Canazei.  There are very wide slopes, which allows you to go to the virgin lands from any place.  Calm relief is simply created for "their" tracks.  So you can return to the knurled track only near the ski lift.  The most suitable slopes for such skiing lie around the top of the Belvedere.  Great places on the slopes of Col Rodell.  However, here they are much smaller, and some areas are avalanche hazardous.  The most difficult slopes are in the Chiampak ski area.  Conquering these slopes is a business card for any professional skier or snowboarder. </p>

    <p>  Mid-level skiers will feel complete expanse here.  In Canazei there are a lot of interesting gentle slopes, which are very nice to go down.  You should definitely visit the stadium located between Passo Sella and Col Rodella.  It is full of long slopes that are equipped with the latest ski lifts.  Interesting tracks in the Belvedere slope. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For those who are just learning to ski or snowboard, the most suitable place is Canazei (Italy).  Reviews of newcomers about this resort are only positive and enthusiastic.  All tracks are excellently serviced, on all lies pure snow without ice.  Lifts are fast and reliable.  Almost all the main tracks located between the peaks of Col Rodell and Belvedere are designed just for newly-made skiers.  These are the descents of the ‚Äúblue‚Äù level.  Although some of them are indicated on the map as ‚Äúblue-red‚Äù.  Most of the slopes at the starting point are pretty steep, but then, as you descend, the track becomes more even.  Such a bias is interesting not only for beginners, but also for mid-level skiers, as it allows long traverses.  And for those who are poorly skiing, this is a good workout. </p><h2>  Accommodation in Canazei (Italy) </h2><p>  Hotels, ski houses, fabulous chalets, family hotels, luxury apartments and spa hotels - everything you want is at your service.  It all depends on the taste and financial capabilities. </p>

    <p>  However, despite such an extensive range of housing, there are still problems with its reservation.  It also happens that there are simply not enough places!  Therefore, many begin to book accommodation for the winter months in September.  In this case, there are significantly more chances to get apartments near the ski lifts and slopes. </p><h2>  The best places in the resort </h2><p>  Local cafes, bars and restaurants are in great demand among vacationers.  In addition to the restaurants of Canazei, those located in the nearby villages of Pe√±a and Alba di Canazei are also popular. </p><p>  The resort's most famous and visited bar is HC Fassa, which is located in Alba di Canazei.  Music is booming throughout the district, and dancing does not stop until the morning. </p><p>  The much more relaxed Lieber Augustin bar, located in the city itself, is in no less demand.  Its warmth and comfort warms the cold and tired skiers. </p><p>  Pasticceria Peter, Paradis and Gelateria Ladin are well-known establishments that are also worth a visit.  They will surely surprise you with their color. </p><p>  Fast food lovers will discover the Wurstelstand Pippotto and Pizza Shop.  And those who prefer plentiful lunch-dinners, it is better to visit Wine &amp; Dine or El Pael. </p>

    <h2><br>  How to get there </h2><p>  The direct route to Canazei is from the airport of Bolzano.  It is located 44 kilometers from the resort.  Next, it is best to rent a car (there is a rental point at the airport) and get to the place in just 40 minutes.  To get to Canazei, you need to move to the northern exit from the city, and then along the SS-241 highway, which will lead you to the Dolomites. </p><p>  If you do not want to rent a car, there is another way to get to the resort - a bus.  It takes a little longer, but less fuss.  You can buy tickets both at the bus station and from the driver. </p><p>  Be sure to visit Canazei.  Italy and its ski slopes are waiting for you! </p>
