It was a power controlled by <span>Alexander the Great.</span>  Now the ruins of Babylon, which has long lost its greatness, are the hills located nearby El Hill, a city in Iraq. </p><h2>  History of babylon </h2><p>  Babylon existed for about two millennia.  Its occurrence dates back to the third millennium BC.  A thousand years after the founding of the city, the Amorites took over, who began to found their dynasty.  During the reign of Hammurabi, Babylon becomes the political center in the country.  He maintained this position for another 1000 years.  The city personified the "abode of regality", and even its god Marduk received an honorable place in the pantheon of patrons of all of Mesopotamia.  From the second millennium BC  there was a noticeable upsurge - there was a development of trade and crafts, the population increased sharply.  The outward appearance of Babylon also flourished - areas were being built up, fortifications were being updated, streets were being laid. </p>

    <h2>  The year of the capture of Babylon by the Persians </h2><p>  Mid 6th century BC  has become a time of significant change.  King Cyrus II led his Persian troops to the city with the goal of conquering Babylon.  His army was equal to the Assyrian - excellent archers and cavalry were selected.  No help came from Egypt, and Babylon had to meet the brutal and determined conquerors on their own. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The year of the capture of Babylon by the Persians - 539 BC  Cyrus troops besieged the city.  Residents who were once forced to relocate from their lands did not want to defend Babylon.  Their intentions were transparent - if the old power falls, then, perhaps, the Persians will not hold them, and they will be able to return to their native lands.  Thus, the conduct of an aggressive policy was reflected in the aggressive attitude of the city residents.  Even among the Babylonian nobility there was talk that Cyrus II could become the best king.  The priests opened the gates of the army in the hope of gaining a more significant status before the people and the new government.  So the Persian kingdom has a new capital - Babylon. </p>

    <h2>  The last Babylonian king </h2><p>  The Persian conquest of Babylon did not take the capital by surprise.  During the attack, the city had a large food supply and could still hold the siege for a long time.  Tsar Belshazzar (historians have many doubts about the authenticity of his name) arranged feasts to show that he was not afraid of Cyrus.  The tables were lined with precious vessels that served as drinking bowls.  They were taken from conquered peoples.  Among them were vessels from the temple in Jerusalem.  The rulers glorified the Babylonian gods, whom they trusted their fate, because they believed that luck would not leave them this time, despite the efforts of Cyrus and his associates in the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The fate of Belshazzar </h2><p>  During one of the celebrations, where there were many nobles and nobles, according to legend, a man‚Äôs hand appeared in the air and began to slowly output words.  The king was dumbfounded with horror at the sight of this picture.  Wise men were gathered, but this language was unknown to them.  Then the queen advised to call Daniel, an elderly prophet who, even under Nebuchadnezzar, was known as a wise adviser.  He translated the phrase from <span>Aramaic.</span>  Literally, it read: "Calculated (the end of your kingdom), weighed and given to the Persians."  That same night, the Chaldean ruler overtook death. </p>

    <h2>  How Babylon was taken - versions </h2><p>  Different sources describe different subjugation options.  The year the Persians take the city of Babylon is fraught with many ambiguities.  The biblical story says (more is assumed) that the capital after the siege was taken by an attack (or by cunning).  According to this version, King Belshazzar died during a clash with enemies at night.  Herodotus tells in detail about the military trick Cyrus showed. </p><p>  The clinical record tells another story - Persian troops defeated the Babylonians during a battle in an open field.  Then Cyrus freely entered the city.  However, there is ambiguity in this story.  It can also be understood as follows - the city lasted 4 months, and then the Persians entered it. </p>

    <h2>  Government of Cyrus </h2><p>  The year of the capture of Babylon by the Persians showed that the new king began to restore order.  Images of deities that were removed during previous reigns were returned to the cities.  The restoration of the <span>Jerusalem Temple,</span> destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, began.  Jewish exiles were able to return to their homeland.  Cyrus planned to fight Egypt and strengthened the borders of his possessions.  Under his rule, Jerusalem became a self-governing temple city, like Babylon, Nippur and others.  For some time, Cambyses, his son, helped lead the new king.  Cyrus adopted the royal titles of Babylonia.  Thus, he showed that he intended to continue the established policy.  Cyrus became the "king of countries and kings", which says a lot about the state itself. </p>

    <p>  The year of the capture of Babylon by the Persians brought many changes.  After the city was conquered, the Western countries had no choice but to submit to the new powerful ruler - Cyrus - to the borders with Egypt. </p><p>  Reunification in one large state was beneficial to trading groups and merchants who had previously feared attacks on the roads.  Now the entire intermediary market between East and West was in their hands.  The history of Babylon speaks of the new capital of a great power and the annexed countries as "Babylon and the District." </p><p>  The city grew stronger and revived, became a very important political center of the new state.  Cyrus not only thought about the expansion of the territories of his kingdom in Egypt, but also carefully watched that the borders of his power remained impregnable, for example, for nomadic Scythians. </p>
