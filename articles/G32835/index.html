    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Staccoli 3 * hotel is located within walking distance from the sea.  The beaches here are municipal, so you will have to pay for renting sunbeds and umbrellas.  However, you can stay free of charge in the territory not occupied by sun loungers. </p><h2>  Entertainment and infrastructure </h2><p>  Since Stakkoli is a very small hotel, it cannot provide any special entertainment for guests.  Mostly people who come to Rimini spend little time in the walls of the hotel.  So, tourists relax here on the magnificent beaches, make walks, make purchases and, of course, go on excursions to numerous attractions. </p>

    <h2>  Room price </h2><p>  As for the cost of accommodation in Staccoli, it is more than attractive.  So, a day in a single room will cost you from 1400 rubles, and a double - from 1800 rubles. </p><h2>  Staccoli 3 * (Italy): reviews of tourists from Russia </h2><p>  In order to make your impression of the Stackoli Hotel more complete, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the opinions of our compatriots who have already been here.  Looking ahead, we note that, as in the case with most other hotels, you can find both positive and negative reviews.  According to experienced tourists, the poor impression of a three-star hotel of economy class is due to extremely high expectations.  Indeed, it is simply impossible to count on a luxurious room and service of the highest level, while paying a ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù amount of money.  But we offer to understand everything in more detail. </p><p>  As for the rooms of the Staccoli 3 * hotel, the reviews of our compatriots basically repeat each other.  So, tourists found the rooms and bathrooms small, but quite suitable for placement.  The furniture here, of course, is not new, but comfortable and in good condition.  It also has a modern plasma TV and air conditioning.  Using the latter, by the way, is possible for an additional fee.  Rooms are cleaned regularly.  Bed linens, according to travelers, were changed once a week in the rooms, and towels twice a week. </p><p>  Very pleased with the tourists the location of the hotel.  So, close to it there are a lot of entertainment venues, restaurants, bars, shops, shops.  Also, twice a week, a market arrives in Rimini where you can cheaply buy fresh fruits and vegetables.  At first, some travelers were confused by the proximity of the Staccoli 3 * hotel to the railway.  However, gradually all fears were dispelled, since the trains in Italy are modern and move almost silently.  Therefore, they did not deliver any discomfort to hotel guests.  Pleased travelers and the proximity of the hotel to the sea.  So, according to them, the nearest beach can be reached in a leisurely step in just seven minutes.  Also, experienced tourists advise those wishing to save money to go a little further along the coastline to accommodate on free sections of the beach.  Here you do not need to pay for the rental of sunbeds and umbrellas, and you can sunbathe comfortably on towels or special <span>beach mats</span> you have taken with you <span>.</span>  The beaches here, by the way, according to our compatriots, are simply excellent.  The fine sand, cleanliness, azure water, gentle entry into the water and the presence everywhere masses of restaurants and bars where you can eat and treat yourself to any drink, did not leave anyone indifferent. </p>

    <p>  As for the hotel staff, almost all travelers mentioned the owner of this establishment named Simon.  According to them, this is a very pleasant and friendly woman who speaks excellent English and is always happy to help her guests.  You can always turn to her not only for questions regarding hotel accommodation.  She will be happy to advise you where to go on an excursion, which store to go to and which restaurant or bar to visit.  With the rest of the hotel staff (maids, cooks and other staff), guests had to deal with much less often than with the owner.  However, our compatriots also had a very pleasant impression of them.  In general, tourists note that almost all Italians are extremely friendly and pleasant people who will always be happy to not only help, but simply chat with travelers from other countries. </p><p>  The issue of food at the Staccoli 3 * hotel is quite controversial.  So, someone found the food in the hotel too monotonous.  However, some tourists claim that you should not expect a menu like a luxury hotel from a cheap three-star hotel.  Therefore, if you are unpretentious in food, then local cuisine will not be disappointed.  For gourmets, experienced tourists recommend not saving on accommodation and checking into more expensive hotels of four- and five-star categories. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that in general, our compatriots considered the three-star Hotel Staccoli, located in Rimini (Italy), very worthy.  Here is a pretty good combination of price and quality.  Tourists recommend it as a accommodation for travelers who want to save money and plan to spend a minimum of time at the hotel, visiting the beach and going for walks in the surroundings and trips to local attractions. </p>
