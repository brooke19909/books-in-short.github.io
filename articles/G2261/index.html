It is located in the south-west of the Krasnodar Territory, on the banks of the <span>Tsemess Bay</span> (better known as the Novorossiysk) of the Black Sea.  On September 14, 1973, he was awarded the honorary title of a hero city for the stamina and courage shown during the defense of Novorossiysk during the Great Patriotic War. </p><p>  Thanks to the clearly arranged work of carriers, the stations of Novorossiysk annually receive thousands of tourists who come here as transfer points to the nearest resort towns of the Black Sea coast. </p><h2>  About Novorossiysk </h2><p>  Conventionally, the city can be divided into an industrial zone, where the main industrial enterprises and the seaport are located, and into residential areas. </p><p>  The city has a lot of places of recreation, green corners, beautiful streets, interesting architectural buildings, historical and modern buildings.  Hospitable residents will always help and advise how and from which station of Novorossiysk you can get to places of interest. </p><p>  It is difficult to call Novorossiysk resort: almost all access to the sea is occupied by moorings, mass production of cement is ongoing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiatrek.org" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="stations of Novorossiysk" class="if uuid-2229286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70335/2229286.jpg"></div><p>  Today the city is a major transportation hub.  Here is the largest port complex, highways: M4-Don, originating in Moscow, M25 - route Novorossiysk - Simferopol, railway station, bus station. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of the railway station </h2><p>  In 1889, the Novorossiyskaya station received its first train.  The station building itself was erected according to the plan of engineer-architect Viktor Piotrovsky only after 9 years, in 1898. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiatrek.org" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="train station Novorossiysk" class="if uuid-2229287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70335/2229287.jpg"></div><p>  During the Second World War, the railway station in Novorossiysk was almost wiped off the face of the earth, but as soon as the Nazi invaders retreated, the inhabitants actively set about restoring the former look of the station. </p><p>  In 1944, Valentin Silvievich Danini was appointed the chief architect of the city.  It was he who insisted on the restoration of the station building in its old place in its original form and took into account all the existing architectural elements. </p><h2>  What about today? </h2><p>  Novorossiysk is famous not only for the port.  The pride of the city is also the railway station and bus station, because they are the most important transport hubs in our country.  They successfully receive a huge passenger flow, cope with a huge amount of imported and exported cargo. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.7361121" data-lng="37.77291379999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/1/6/216.png"></div><p>  Railway station Novorossiysk is located at: st.  Zhukovsky, 16. Five tracks and three platforms provide round-the-clock uninterrupted running of trains of all directions and categories.  Passengers can use the comfortable lounges, and if you wish, go to the paid hall of increased comfort.  Two floors of the station are equipped with the latest equipment, free Wi-Fi is distributed to passengers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All information about the arrival / departure of trains is displayed on an electronic display and is constantly updated. </p><h2>  The main directions of the railway station </h2><p>  From April to October, many cities in Russia and Belarus can be reached through Novorossiysk.  In the winter season, the number of departing passenger trains is usually reduced, but this does not mean that travelers will have difficulty purchasing tickets.  However, before traveling, study the information on the site in advance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="opusteno.rs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stations of Novorossiysk" class="if uuid-2233495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70335/2233495.jpg"></div><p>  Long-distance trains through Novorossiysk go to <span>Moscow, Voronezh,</span> Saratov, Perm, Vladikavkaz, St. Petersburg, Murmansk, Chelyabinsk, Nizhny Novgorod, Nizhny Tagil, Tver, Rostov-on-Don, Ryazan, Vorkuta, Arkhangelsk, Gomel and many others. </p><p>  By electric trains you can get to Krasnodar. </p><h2>  Bus station </h2><p>  All intercity buses of Novorossiysk are based at the bus station at the address: st.  Tchaikovsky, 15 - almost in the center of the city.  A small two-story building for a year copes with 500,000 passengers, which indicates the well-coordinated and properly built work of the bus station. </p><div class="photo" data-original="andreyplumer.livejournal.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Novorossiysk station Bus station" class="if uuid-2233510" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70335/2233510.jpg"></div><p>  For the convenience of users in the building there are several ATMs.  Tickets are purchased at 24-hour ticket offices, on the side of the main entrance.  Constant video surveillance of the entire territory of the station guarantees the order and the proper level of security. </p><p>  In 2017, information was received from the mayor of the city, Igor Dyachenko, that the bus station will soon be moved outside of Novorossiysk.  The head said that the investor, ready to sponsor the construction and the new location of the bus station, has already been identified.  Currently, the administration of the Krasnodar Territory is considering and agreeing on a project to transfer the station closer to the Vladimir terminal.  Experts are working on access routes to the new station. </p><p>  In the summer, buses run more often, and in the winter, their number is reduced according to the demand of travelers. </p><h2>  Popular destinations </h2><p>  Buses daily make international routes to Sukhumi, Chisinau, Odessa.  You can fly to Astrakhan, Anapa, Armavir, Vladikavkaz, Gelendzhik, Yeysk, Kislovodsk, Krasnodar, Maykop, Makhachkala, Nalchik, Tuapse, Sochi, Sevastopol, Yalta, and in the summer to Moscow in the country with regular flights. </p><p>  A detailed schedule can be found in the building of the bus station and on the official website of the carrier. </p><h2>  How are the bus and train stations of Novorossiysk related? </h2><p>  Every year, thousands of our compatriots come to rest on the Black Sea coast.  Most choose vacation in Russia because there is no need to change rubles for currency, it can be explained to everyone in their native language, and for many it‚Äôs just a matter of habit. </p><p>  The route Novorossiysk Station - Bus Station is of interest to every tourist arriving here as a transfer point to the nearest resort towns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiatrek.org" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stations of Novorossiysk" class="if uuid-2233534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70335/2233534.jpg"></div><p>  While the bus station is in its old place, you can get to it in this way: </p><p>  1) From the bus stop "Railway Station", take the intercity bus No. 199 and get off directly at the bus station </p><p>  2) By public transport - trolley bus number 6 will take you to Kutuzovskaya after 5 stops, you will only have to walk 200 meters to the bus station. </p><p>  3) Taxi - do not forget that in any city, private drivers want to get the maximum benefit for a minimum trip.  So bargain well with the taxi driver before you get into his car. </p>
