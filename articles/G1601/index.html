This wonderful paradise of Crimea is really worth a visit.  And, as a rule, the one who has been there once, is drawn there again and again.  What is interesting about the history of the village?  And what sights of the New World (Crimea) have attracted tourists there for how many years?  But first, where exactly is this unforgettable place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New World, Crimea: Attractions (Falcon)" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32211/863628.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  This village is hidden in the vicinity of Cape Kapchik (the southern coast of Crimea, near Sudak) and is protected by mountains from the north, west and east.  Thanks to the surrounding mountains, the New World retained its pristine beauty, because for a long time the way there was accessible only from the south, from the sea.  Now an asphalt road to the village has been laid from Sudak: some 10 minutes by car - and amazing landscapes and sights of the New World can be seen.  <span>The cities of Crimea are</span> unique in their own right, and the village of New World is a true miracle. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of the New World (Crimea)" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32211/863626.jpg" width="509"></div>

Winters are mild, warm, almost always with positive temperatures, snow rarely falls.  Already at the end of February, spring comes to the New World (Crimea). </p><p>  Attractions here are rare tree species: curved Crimean and Sudak pine.  There are also whole groves of juniper. </p><h2>  History of the New World </h2><p>  The fact that this fabulous corner was inhabited in the Middle Ages is evidenced by the Genoese chronicles.  During the reign of the Italians, there was a village on the peninsula.  Although recently found archaeological evidence that people lived here at least as early as the 8th century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New World (Crimea): attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32211/863615.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If we talk about the time when Crimea already belonged to the Russian Empire, then these lands often passed from hand to hand.  The first owners of the New World did not quite realize their happiness in owning such a paradise, therefore they did not stay there for long and did not develop the village.  No sights of the New World (Crimea) have yet attracted a high-society.  Unless its first name Paradise (translated as "paradise", "garden"), the village owes the nobleman de Galera, who received these lands as a gift from Empress Catherine the Second.  But who really played a crucial role in the development of this resort was Prince <span>Lev Sergeyevich Golitsyn,</span> who acquired this estate in 1878. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Winemaking is a specialized industry </h2><p>  This descendant of a noble princely family, who studied wine production in France, put his whole heart into a new possession.  He decided to develop winemaking there, as the climate was more than favorable for this.  He began by planting European grape varieties on his land in order to observe how the Crimean sun affects the quality of wine.  The prince built a factory, invested almost all of his money in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights and history of the New World (Crimea)" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32211/863631.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <h2>  Crimean champagne </h2><p>  Since 1882, Golitsyn puts quite successful experiments on the production of champagne wines. </p><p>  After ten years of experimentation, they determined the best grape varieties for these purposes;  they were Pinot Gray, Pinot Black, Aligoté, Chardonnay and Murdver.  Winemakers also reached the optimal percentage of each grade in sparkling wine.  As a result, the creation of such famous brands of Crimean champagne as “Paradise”, “New World”, later called “Coronation”, is created.  Both workers (the prince sold wine at very affordable prices) and the world community (Golitsyn wines participated in the Paris World Exhibition in 1900) could appreciate their taste. </p><h2>  Victory at the exhibition </h2><p>  It was there that the champagne of the Coronation brand of 1899 received the Grand Prix.  In this regard, one cannot fail to mention the funny misunderstanding that took place at the gala dinner in honor of the end of the exhibition.  As always, competitors were treated to wine, which received the main awards.  The chairman of the tasting commission, Count Chandon, raising a toast to the winner, was sure that it was his wine, and therefore loudly gave glory to his winemakers.  But in reality, he was holding a glass of champagne of the Coronation brand in his hands, and Golitsyn thanked everyone for free advertising of his production.  It is thanks to this drink that other sights of the New World (Crimea) became known. </p><p>  Emperor Nicholas II, resting with <span>Prince Golitsyn,</span> tasted the champagne of its manufacture.  They say that he said the phrase: "Now I see life in a new light," and this name was assigned to the village.  Is it so, it's hard to say. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novyi Svet (Crimea) at sea: attractions" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32211/865396.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Factory today </h2><p>  After a 30-year period of stagnation (1906-1936), the plant resumed operations and in 1936 presented the world with “Soviet champagne”, recognized even by the French, which are still being produced.  Since it is made not by the bottle method, but by the reservoir method, the same French do not require replacing the word "champagne" (that is, produced in the province of Champagne) with "sparkling" in the name. </p><p>  And recently (in 1997), the Novosvetsky plant repeated the success of the Golitsyn wines at the Paris exhibition - again the Grand Prix.  Now, 10 types of sparkling wines are being released here. </p><h2>  New World (Crimea): attractions </h2><p>  Of course, thousands of tourists come here to see firsthand capes of a bizarre shape, bays with clear water, mountains, shape resembling figures of people and animals.  Although many amazing places were created by people, it is precisely the landscape richness of nature that is the main reason that people strive for the New World (Crimea) at sea.  Attractions that cannot be missed are as follows: </p><ul><li>  <span>Mount Falcon.</span>  In shape, it resembles a huge bird with folded wings.  This mountain, by its origin, is a coral reef, and the largest in Europe, therefore it plays with different colors in different lighting conditions - from white to pink-purple.  It can be seen in almost all photographs depicting the New World (Crimea).  The sights of the Falcon Mountain is that from its top the entire village is visible in full view. </li><li>  Cape Kapchik.  Its elongated shape resembles the body of a large dinosaur.  Approximately in the middle it is pierced by a cave 77 m long - Through Grotto. </li><li>  Mount Karaul-Oba ("guard mountain").  It is so named because from the top you can see the entire coast - from Meganom in the east to Ayudag in the west. </li><li>  Gorge "Hell" with a stream of icy air. </li><li>  "Adam's bed" - the intermountain, entwined with a carpet of ivy. </li><li>  Taurus paths are steps carved into the rock. </li><li>  <span>Golitsyn trail.</span>  This is a rock-hewn road that leads from Green to Blue Bay.  In the middle of the route is the Chaliapin Grotto - a natural niche with excellent acoustics.  Here were stored the most unique samples from the collection of Golitsyn wines. </li><li>  Museum of winemaking.  He is in a house similar to a medieval castle in which Prince Golitsyn lived with his family.  Here you can learn about the personal life of the prince and his role in the development of the wine industry in the Crimea.  And in the cellars there is a tasting room where you can try the legendary varieties of wines. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of the new world of the city of crimea" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/866760.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  And these are just some of the sights of the New World (Crimea).  Among others, you can mention the Blue Bay, the Royal Beach, the Gates of Paradise, <span>Scylla and Charybdis,</span> Anastasia source. </p><p>  Sights and the history of the New World (Crimea) impress absolutely everyone.  There are fewer and fewer corners with such untouched nature on the planet. </p>
