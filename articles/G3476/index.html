  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Key sociology methods used in science and management.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p><br>  Sociology is a doctrine that examines the life of society as a whole.  The founder of this science is Auguste Comte, who constructed the term ‚Äúsociology‚Äù itself from two languages: Latin and Greek.  Translated from them, the term means "study society."  O. Comte believed that society should be considered as a single organism with many elements, and each cell should be considered from the side of the <span>public good.</span> </p><p>  At present, sociology means a rapidly developing science that studies the specifics of society and social relations.  By the way, the latest definition of this discipline is: it is a science that studies the processes of development, the organization of people's lives.  Tools and methods of sociological science are borrowed to study other social sciences: economics, demography, law.  Sociological methods allow you to get accurate quantitative estimates of the characteristics of the processes of development of society.  Sociology as a science can be defined in terms of the object of sociology and the <span>subject of science.</span> </p><p>  <span>Objects of sociology</span> can be: social organizations, social institutions, social interactions, social phenomena, social processes, social relations, social communities, social subjects. The subject of sociology is a set of basic properties and laws that characterize the essence of the object of sociology, its internal definition, mechanism of manifestation and the functioning of phenomena, social processes and relationships.  One of the main places in the structure of sociology is methodology. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Methods of sociology - a system of rules and techniques of a theoretical and practical orientation for the study of social objects.  Sociological methodology is a system of all applied methods in sociology.  The following methods of sociology are distinguished: General (analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, analogy, abstraction, generalization, classification, average statistics) General scientific (system principle, principle of objectivity, principle of historicism) Special methods of sociology (methods of general sociology, cross-cultural analysis, comparatively - correlation analysis). Methods of sociology as a science should be considered separately.  The tool of knowledge in this case is a sociological study, which includes two main parts: </p><p>  Theoretical part. </p><p>  The main method of sociology includes: the development of research programs, the choice of goals and objectives, the formulation of hypotheses and stages of research. </p><p>  Instrumental part. </p><p>  The research procedure includes: the choice of tools for collecting information, determining the method of collecting information, processing information, obtaining the characteristics of the state of the investigated object. </p><p>  Sociology of management is a separate theory of sociology, specializing in the consideration and implementation of management processes in individual types of societies, organizations, institutions.  These processes are carried out to maintain and ensure the sustainable development of the relevant system.  This theory has its own methods of sociology of <span>management, objects,</span> functions and subject.  The subject is considered to be the study, evaluation and improvement of management processes.  The object is management processes taking place in individual subsystems of society. </p><p>  The methods of <span>management sociology are</span> given below: </p><p>  Organizational - administrative.  This includes the system of legislative acts of the country, the system of regulatory documents, the system of plans, programs being developed, and the operational management system. </p><p>  Economic - tax system of the country, credit - financial mechanism, wage system, social - psychological mechanisms. </p><p>  All methods of the sociology of management and science are focused, first of all, on the creation of effective management schemes and motivation for creation, this is the very tangible <span>economic effect</span> of their application. </p>
