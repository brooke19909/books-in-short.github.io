Many go to Vinogradovo in order to touch history, admire the old Dolgiy Pond, take a walk along the alley that runs along the entire estate.  But is it possible to use the definition of "preserved" in relation to Vinogradovo?  The estate (expert reviews sound the alarm) is actually in a deplorable state.  The future of the estate by lovers of antiquity is predicted much more sad than the present, if its restoration does not begin in the near future.  But enthusiasts have little hope for this. </p>

    <h2>  Excursion: about the owners </h2><p>  For about 400 years, the Vinogradovo estate has been hiding its secrets.  Who just did not visit these ancient walls.  The first information about the estate dates back to 1623.  Vinogradovo is a manor owned in the 17-18 centuries by representatives of the Pushkin family, then the estate passed to the Benckendorf family.  The last mistress of the estate was a certain Emma Banza.  Prominent cultural figures of the Enlightenment - Gavriil Derzhavin, Ivan Krylov, Nikolai Karamzin, loved to visit Vinogradovo. </p><h2>  Pushkins </h2><p>  Vinogradovo is a manor that once belonged to the Pushkins.  The <span>Pushkins owned the estate for</span> about a hundred years, from 1623 to 1729.  The first owner of the estate was Gabriel Pushkin, a duma nobleman, a great falconer and one of the close associates of False Dmitry I. The poet's ancestor was a cunning politician who could easily cross over to the side of the enemy.  The outline of the preface to the drama Boris Godunov contains the words of A. S. Pushkin, in which he confesses that a member of their surname is depicted as one of the conspirators in his work. </p><p>  After the death of the first owner, the estate of Vinogradovo in Dolgoprudny passed to his heirs.  Subsequently, one of them will be hanged, and the other will be sent to Siberia for participating in the rebellion of archers.  The first wooden church of the Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God was built in Vinogradovo by the sons of Gabriel Pushkin - Gregory and Stepan.  The estate has become a village. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Over the next 50 years, its owner was Matvey Pushkin.  In 1696, the Vladimir Church was rebuilt by him in stone.  But, despite the successes in the service, the ending of the life of Matvey Pushkin was also tragic.  Due to disagreement with the sending of young nobles to study abroad at the behest of the sovereign, he was exiled.  And his son Fedor Peter I was executed as a member of the Streletsky riot.  A.S. Pushkin spoke about these events in his family tree. </p><p>  After the death of Jacob, brother of Matthew Pushkin, distant relatives - Peter and Ivan Pushkins began to own their state.  From the Pushkin period, only the foundation and the Long Ponds, which gave the name to the Moscow Region city and some streets of the capital, have survived in the estate. </p><h2>  Vyazemsky </h2><p>  In the eighteenth century, the estate belonged to Prince Vasily Dolgorukov.  In 1729, the estate was resold to them.  Princess Maria Vyazemskaya became the new owner.  It was with her, as historians note, that the heyday of the village began. </p><h2>  Glebov </h2><p>  The next owner of the estate was Attorney General Alexander Glebov.  With him, a new house in the classical style appeared in the estate, a park on the shore of the pond, and the church was also rebuilt. </p><p>  Gleb paid much attention to the estate.  With his light hand in the middle of the century an architectural ensemble appeared here, separated by a pond and Dmitrievskaya road.  On the left bank, not far from the church, a one-story wooden house was built with it, a fruit garden was built.  On the other side, a new Vladimir Church was built, which has an unusual triangular shape.  Nobody knows the name of the architect.  According to rumors, the author of the project was either Kazakov or Bazhenov.  Near the church a bell tower, a chapel and an almshouse for the elderly were built, forming an equilateral triangle with the temple. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Literary estate near Moscow.  Benkendorf </h2><p>  After the Glebovs Vinogradov began to own E.I. Benckendorf.  Vinogradovo is a manor, which was readily visited by prominent writers of that time: Kheraskov, Annenkov, Nikolai Karamzin, Gabriel Derzhavin, Venevitinov.  And also Tatishchev, Vyazemsky, Ivan Krylov.  The fabulist stayed away for a year and devoted Sophia, the young daughter of the owner, the fable ‚ÄúThe Legible Bride‚Äù and ‚ÄúOak and Cane‚Äù.  But his muse died at an early age (buried near the Vladimir Church). </p><p>  In addition to the house and the outbuildings in Vinogradovo, there were all the buildings necessary for the economy: <span>greenhouses, greenhouses,</span> barns, a horse carriage, a farmyard, etc. In 1812, during the war with Napoleon, the French stood on the estate for about two weeks, with which Vinogradovo was brutally plundered.  According to the owner, Akim Pavlov, the mistress, the temple, the manor house, the garden, and the whole house were damaged.  Upon their return, Benkendorf put things in order in the estate, after which they lived here for another half a century.  The couple died almost simultaneously, with a difference of only a few months.  They are buried next to the grave of their daughter. </p><p>  And the son of A.I. Benkendorf became the heir to the estate.  Members of his family loved to relax in the manor in the summer.  They even published their own magazine here.  When the children became adults, the estate was empty.  After the owner‚Äôs death, it was sold to the Buchumov merchants. </p><h2>  Buchumovs </h2><p>  Merchant Mikhail Buchumov acquired the estate at the end of the 19th century.  He launched active construction of summer cottages here.  Part of the land was leased to peasants.  During the execution of the transaction, the previous owners did not specify the fate of things on the estate.  They believed that they sold exclusively real estate.  As a result, the merchant‚Äôs property turned out to be portraits of ancestors, documents, <span>heirlooms</span> and other values ‚Äã‚Äãthat did not interest the new owner and soon disappeared. </p><p>  Cottages appeared on the shores of the lake.  On enslaving terms, the Buchumovs rented to the peasants fields and forests.  He paid for his greed in 1905: the house was burned down, only the church and gravestones remained from the estate. </p><h2>  Banza and Herman - the last owners </h2><p>  Before the revolution, in 1911, the landowner, a German by birth, the widow of E. M. Banza, became the last owner of the estate.  She ordered to demolish the cottages.  With her, a neoclassical-style wooden house grew up here.  The house included architectural features such as a half-ton of front porch, an open stone terrace, and a staircase to the park.  The building is known as the Banzah House. </p>

    <p>  It was the last mistress who restored the manor, carried out a significant reconstruction in the style of eclecticism and neoclassicism.  Flower beds were set up in the estate, a fountain was built.  The income-generating nature of the estate was determined by the scale of the economic complex, which included, along with new spacious buildings, horse and cattle yards, as well as a cinema club with 40 seats for hired workers.  In addition, a guardhouse building, an entrance gate with a bridge, and numerous outbuildings appeared on the estate. </p>

    <p>  The plastered wooden house of Banzi was erected in 1911, and the house of her son-in-law German - in 1912.  The author of the house project for Rudolf Vasilievich German, the son-in-law of the owner, was the architect I.V. Rylsky.  The building is a prime example of eclecticism.  A glazed passage connected a wooden two-story house with a kitchen-wing, the belvedere tower was decorated with imitation of a clock, the hands of which always showed 11:51. </p><h2>  Through the crucible of war and revolution </h2><p>  During the First World War, R. Herman set up a hospital for the wounded and tuberculosis patients on the estate.  In the manor house for the peasant and yard children, Christmas parties were held.  The peasants were very fond of their landowners.  During the revolution of 1917, they saved the mansion‚Äôs houses from being destroyed by revolutionary workers from the village of Khlebnikovo.  At night, the owners of the estate fled abroad. </p><p>  They said that, leaving, the landowner threw a precious ruby ‚Äã‚Äãring into the local pond.  During the cleaning work in the 1950s, the pond was drained.  Locals tried to find the ring, but did not find it. </p><h2>  Nationalization </h2><p>  After the revolution, nationalization turned Vinogradovo into the Long Ponds state farm.  In the manor house they organized a children's bone tuberculosis sanatorium.  For some time there was also a departmental house for rest of railway workers. </p><h2>  Modern history </h2><p>  During the Great Patriotic War in Vinogradovo was the headquarters of local partisans.  In 1959, the regional children's sanatorium - cardiorematism - reopened here. </p><h2>  Nowadays </h2><p>  Children were allocated premises in Banzah‚Äôs house.  Most of Herman‚Äôs house today is empty and inexorably destroyed.  Doors and windows are boarded up, the roof is leaking.  A symbolic sign hangs on the facade of the building: ‚ÄúMonument of architecture.  It is protected by the state. ‚Äù </p><h2>  What is preserved? </h2><p>  The estate of the Virgin of Our Lady, the chapel with bells, the almshouse built in the 18th century, are preserved on the estate.  The buildings of the early nineteenth century - the Dutch house on the coast and the chapel - have also survived. </p>

    <h2>  Be silent, sadness ... </h2><p>  The disadvantage of the estate is called its numerous destruction and desolation.  Vinogradovo, according to tourists, seems to be beyond recovery.  Most likely, the estates will soon be gone. </p><p>  The authors of the reviews state that the impression of the desolation seen is very sad.  Someone calls the situation when historical monuments in Russia are destroyed, terrible. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Currently, a whole layer of unique wooden manor and country houses of the early twentieth century is rapidly losing. </p><p>  On the verge of destruction are many valuable buildings in the estate of Vinogradovo.  There is every reason to believe that in a few years from the centuries-old estate culture, descendants will only have its idealized image on the pages of specialized sites.  I really want to hope that this forecast is still too pessimistic. </p>
