    <h2>  Great writers of Karelia </h2><ol><li>  Antti Timonen.  A folk writer who dedicated his life to folklore, was born in 1915 in the Kalevala region.  The writer's surroundings could not but affect his work.  Rune singers and storytellers were only a small part of the writer‚Äôs acquaintances.  The honorary citizen of Karelia began to engage in literary activities in the 30s of the XX century.  The first printed work was released in 1933. </li><li>  Outstanding citizens of Karelia are also talented poets.  The most famous of them is Vladimir Morozov.  Despite the short life, which lasted only 26 years, the poet left an indelible mark on modern literature.  Collections of his poems are issued to this day, as all the works are filled with deep meaning, incredible sensuality and passion. </li></ol>
