    <p>  Kizhi Island, located in <span>Lake Onega,</span> is known far beyond the borders of the country due to Kizhi Pogost.  This ensemble of wooden architecture is unique and inimitable, and many tourists come to see it with their own eyes. </p><p>  <span>Kizhi Pogost</span> is a nature reserve recognized as an object of national heritage of the Russian Federation.  In addition, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The ensemble has important historical significance and tells about life on the island in the distant past. </p><p>  <span>The Kizhi Museum-Reserve</span> consists of several buildings, the construction date of which is the 18-19th century.  The ensemble includes a bell tower and two churches.  They are fenced with a special wooden fence that mimics the traditional fortifications erected in those days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kizhi reserve" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15653/292220.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1966, a large number of traditional buildings from other settlements were brought here, after which the Kizhi Museum was founded on the territory.  The sights, buildings and structures in it reflect the unique traditional architecture of the region.  The skill of the carpenters who created the buildings of this ensemble was unusually high, but by now, unfortunately, it has practically been lost. </p><p>  Kizhi Pogost, whose sights are famous all over the world, is famous for its unique Transfiguration Church.  This building is considered one of the most outstanding in the ensemble.  It was built according to old technology, without the use of nails, only with the help of an ax.  In fact, this is not entirely true, there are nails in the building, but they were used only for the construction of domes. </p>

After which it was rebuilt due to a fire from lightning.  The height of the structure is more than 30 meters, the peak consists of 22 chapters.  The church premises are not heated and are used for services only in the warm season.

    <p>  The church consists of several tiers, each of which is decorated with chapters of different sizes and shapes.  Inside there is a four-tier iconostasis, on which a total of more than 20 icons of various degrees of antiquity are located. </p><p>  Other buildings in Kizhi Pogost are no less remarkable.  The sights of this place really delight not only with their unique designs, but also with their organicity.  The Church of the Intercession was built warmer, and divine services are held there during the winter colds.  They erected it later than Preobrazhenskaya.  In this regard, the design and decoration completely complement the main ensemble, without distracting attention from the main building.  The hipped bell tower, preserved to our time, was built in 1862 on the site of the old one.  But the wooden fence was not preserved. </p><p>  Summer is undoubtedly the best time to visit the island of Kizhi, whose attractions will leave an indelible mark on the memory of everyone who has been here. </p>
