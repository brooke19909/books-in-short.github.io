Hotels, resorts, reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It will be a mistake to believe that the last month of autumn in Russia is endless rain, slush and damp.  Do not judge the whole country by what is happening outside your window.  Indeed, in Russia there are two continents, eleven time zones, three geographical zones and six climate types at once.  With such a generous ‚Äúassortment‚Äù that our native country offers us, we do not need either a ‚ÄúTurkish coast‚Äù or sunny Africa.  This article is intended to help you choose a place <span>where to relax in November</span> in Russia will be most pleasant.  We took into account the recommendations and reviews of tourists who like to travel in the so-called off-season.  And they claim that November has many undeniable advantages over the summer months.  Let's list them briefly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in November in Russia" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1025050.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pros of rest in November </h2><p>  First of all, the last month of autumn pleases with a variety of weather conditions.  Well, think, if you go on vacation in July, then everywhere in the country (except perhaps the Arctic) will be hot.  And in the last month of autumn, you are free to choose what you like best: summer, winter?  Based on this, it is already possible to decide where to relax in November in Russia.  A striking contrast of weather conditions with the climate of your city is provided to you.  Secondly, reviews say that traveling around the country is much easier in the off-season.  Tickets are available in all directions.  In museums and attractions in the open air tourists are not teeming with ants.  You can slowly inspect everything and make beautiful photos.  And finally, the prices.  In most resorts, hotels, pensions and motels in search of rare guests reduce the cost of their services.  Finding housing is not a problem.  And this is especially true for the private sector. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours in Russia" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15252/860279.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  <span>Holidays at sea</span> in November in Russia </h2><p>  If you want the summer not to end longer, go to the southern regions of our country.  You can still sunbathe in Sochi, Anapa, Tuapse, Gelendzhik and other resorts of the <span>Black Sea coast of the Caucasus</span> !  And the most seasoned can even make a small swim.  Are you afraid of cold water?  Reviews of tourists assure that in Sochi, where the best vacation in November in Russia awaits you, there are a lot of hotels with heated pools.  And the water there is not chlorinated, but sea!  Such, for example, is the Sochi Zhemchuzhina Hotel.  If housing prices in hotels do not suit you, you can settle in the private sector and go to the pool to swim and sunbathe.  For a small bribe, of course.  And the weather in those parts in the last month of autumn is wonderful.  Sometimes it can rain, fog can descend, but for the most part November days resemble the past summer.  At the beginning of the month, the daily temperature reaches +20, and closer to December, it drops to +10.  But the sea does not cool for a long time.  Its temperature off the coast of the Caucasus can reach +17 degrees. </p><h2>  Wellness rest </h2><p>  In our country there is no shortage of sanatoriums, which are located in ecologically clean areas, nearby healing springs or therapeutic mud.  But in the last month of autumn, these institutions also offer the lowest rates.  If health leaves much to be desired, the place where to relax in November in Russia is determined by the profile of the sanatorium.  Among the most popular resorts where you can not only have a good time, but also heal, reviews mention Essentuki, Zheleznovodsk, Kislovodsk and Pyatigorsk.  But in principle, good sanatoriums are available in every region of Russia.  Residents of the capital will not even need to leave the suburbs in order to improve their health and have a good rest.  Moreover, not all people with poor health benefit from a sharp change in climate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays at sea in November in Russia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1025052.jpg" width="500"></div>

The Caucasian resorts "Dombai" and "Elbrus" have already opened the season!  Tourists are still few, and the prices pleasantly surprise.  The natural snow cover at these ski resorts, coupled with the gentle warming sun, will give you a lot of positive emotions.  More severe climatic conditions await tourists in the Khibiny and the Urals, where it will also be inexpensive to relax in Russia in November.  Fans of <span>winter fun</span> should pay attention to Eastern Siberia.  There frosts are already cracking.  You can ride on the crust on dog or <span>reindeer sledding</span> or use cross-country skiing.  And if you are interested in fishing, then welcome to Karelia.  Altai with its healing air or the unique pearl of Siberia, Lake Baikal are also wonderful places of rest in the last month of autumn. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best vacation in November in Russia" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1025057.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursion programs </h2><p>  Surely at summer resorts you were sometimes tormented by the dilemma: to stay at the sea to sunbathe and swim or go on a trip to the surroundings?  And often the choice was inclined to a beach holiday.  Excursions in the heat?  Shaking in a stuffy bus?  Wandering around in the sun with crowds of other sweaty tourists?  Well, I do not!  But then comes a feeling of late repentance: to be in Sochi and not see the waterfalls, New Athos and other famous sights ... There is time to <span>catch up</span> in November!  Tours in Russia make it possible to go to places where I did not have time to visit in the summer.  Here, for example, a weekly excursion program "Abkhaz Rhapsody."  The tour starts and ends in Adler.  For a week, tourists will visit Gagra, New Athos, Ritsa, Sukhumi, Kamana, Otap, Mokva, Otkhara and Pitsunda. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in November in Russia is inexpensive" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1025056.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays with children in November in Russia </h2><p>  Little travelers only discover the world.  Show them your homeland.  Children's rest can be made informative and fun at the same time.  In the capital and in <span>large cities of Russia</span> there are not only zoos, circus shows, oceanariums or water entertainment towns.  In them you can find interesting museums of a children's orientation (such as chocolate in Pokrov Vladimir Region).  There are tours for little tourists.  This is a trip to "Viper Vasilyevna" with an interactive program that plays up the tale "About the Gray Goat."  For three days, children will visit ancient villages and towns near Tver.  And on the ‚ÄúLand of Masters‚Äù tour, small excursionists will learn the basics of Palekh painting, will visit the South, Kholuy, Gorodets-on-Volga, Semenov, Gorokhovets and Kovrov.  You can go with your child to Veliky Ustyug, where Santa Claus lives year-round.  And at the end of November, in the winter capital of Karelia Olonets, competitions of these white-bearded wizards are held. </p><h2>  Ancient cities of Russia </h2><p>  True beauty does not fade under the November clouds.  Tours in Russia take place in comfortable buses, and weather conditions will not spoil your vacation.  The most popular destination reviews are called trips along the Golden Ring.  Tours can either take a weekend or stretch for a whole month.  You can limit yourself to Suzdal, Yaroslavl, Pereyaslavl-Zalessky, Rostov and Sergiev Posad, or to extend the inspection of ancient cities.  Another popular tour is to Amber Land.  The Kaliningrad region with its Prussian buildings seems to take you to the atmosphere of Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays with children in november in Russia" class="if" height="499" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1025040.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Museums </h2><p>  Moscow, St. Petersburg and other big cities can provide tourists with many interesting sights that are not dependent on the season.  But the halls of the Hermitage or the Tretyakov Gallery will be free from crowds of tourists and you can see the masterpieces near and without too much fuss.  Peterhof, Kolomna, Novgorod or Moscow Kremlin - all these attractions also do not experience the influx of tourists in the described time.  In the capital and St. Petersburg in recent years, the number of hotels has increased significantly.  Many hostels have opened that can provide you with a cheap vacation in November in Russia. </p>
