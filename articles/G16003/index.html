The best developmental, gaming and educational tablets for children from 5 years old</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A tablet is a modern gadget that has gained a strong position in the market of goods and equipment.  Now even the smallest ones know how to handle it.  True, for parents this is a huge problem.  Especially when it is time for the child to acquire this technique.  Today, kids have been given such a gadget since 3-4 years.  Therefore, it is important to know which tablet for children from 5 years old is worth giving.  True, there are several nuances.  What kind of tablet are you talking about - gaming or educational?  This fact should be considered when choosing.  And we will do it.  Perhaps we will begin <span>to choose a tablet for</span> children from 5 years old from real, "adult" gadgets.  After all, all kinds of educational toys for a modern child are no longer as interesting as before. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet for children from 5 years old" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/945846.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Screen sizes </h2><p>  To begin with, an important factor when choosing a real tablet for a baby is the diagonal of the technique.  As a rule, 10-inch models are popular among adults.  But for a preschool child, a 7-8-inch is quite suitable. </p><p>  If you select a diagonal of less than 7, it will be difficult for the child to perceive the information on the screen.  More than 8 - it's hard to hold and handle the gadget.  Thus, a tablet for children from 5 years old is a very difficult choice.  Especially when it is real, and not just developing.  And it is for this reason that we will devote the ‚Äúlion's‚Äù share of time to this topic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, it is worth considering that the size of the tablets plays an important role for the reason that it will not be especially convenient to play on the big screen.  Especially in different educational games.  Why?  Keeping such a technique, as already mentioned, is extremely difficult.  Therefore, you have to constantly proceed from convenience.  Choose tablets no more than 8 inches for your child. </p><h2>  CPU and RAM </h2><p>  Another important element is processor power.  After all, the most interesting and cool games will require quite a lot of resources.  And for a preschool child to have a tablet and not play on it is like buying a horse and just looking at it.  That is, in fact, there will be no sense in the tablet as such.  A tablet for children from 5 years old should be quite powerful.  Not the same as in adults, but, nevertheless, he is obliged to launch the latest interesting gaming news. </p><p>  What average power should a children's tablet have?  In truth, enough for 1.2 GHz.  This will be enough to play quite powerful and colorful games.  Just what is interesting to any modern baby.  But not only this parameter is important. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet for children from 5 years" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/945845.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  It is also worth paying attention to such a moment as RAM.  If it is too small, then you can not hope that your preschool child will enjoy the gadget.  Children are now much more versed in technology than some adults.  Therefore, buy a tablet with at least 1 GB of RAM.  In general, the larger it is, the better.  But it is worth considering that this characteristic very much affects the cost of equipment in general. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Naturally, regular memory on the tablet is an extremely important parameter.  Perhaps, after the power of the processor and the "RAM" it is he who is able to make the child abandon the gadget.  Remember that you buy a kid a tablet mainly for games.  And this means that there should be quite a lot of memory on it. </p><p>  How much specifically?  In truth, it's up to you.  But a good tablet for children from 5 years old should have at least 8-16 GB of space on the "hard drive".  This place is enough for many toys, including educational ones.  And you will not need to remove any applications. </p><p>  You can take a tablet with more memory.  Only this parameter, along with the "RAM", extremely affects the price.  Especially when the memory surpasses 16 GB.  In principle, you can take a more powerful tablet, given that your child will use it for a long time. </p><p>  Also, pay attention that your gadget has a Wi-Fi connection and a connector for connecting it to a USB socket on a computer.  Noticed that there are no such features?  Then it‚Äôs better to abandon such charms.  But which tablet should a child of 5 years specifically choose? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="developmental tablet for children from 5 years old" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/945844.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Price and Model </h2><p>  In truth, the <span>price tag on the product</span> still plays an important role here <span>.</span>  To be honest, many parents, having seen him, begin to doubt their purchase.  And this is normal.  In order to develop the baby, a training tablet is enough.  But we will talk about them a little later.  To begin with, let's try to choose the best tablet for a child of 5 years old from real gadgets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The price will help us in this choice.  On average, a good tablet costs about 10,000 rubles.  If you expect that the baby will have to use it at school for a long time, then you will have to give about 15,000. In principle, a good investment.  It is only worth considering the fact that the child will spend a lot of time with this technique.  And there is no guarantee that he will really start to learn with her.  Rather, just play different games that do not help development. </p><p>  Therefore, you should pay attention to such a brand as Lenovo.  At this company, almost all tablets are suitable for a child.  The main thing is simply pick up the diagonal.  The characteristics of modern Lenovo models are almost the same.  And the price ranges from 10 to 14 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Want some specifics?  Which is better to take a tablet for children from 5 years old?  It all depends on what exactly you want to purchase - a practical and cheap model or brand.  If the answer is second, then pay attention to: </p><ul><li>  Apple iPad 3 16Gb Wi-Fi (16 000 rubles); </li><li>  Apple iPad 4 16Gb Wi-Fi (18 000 rubles); </li><li>  Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 SM-T311 16Gb (15 000 rubles). </li></ul><p>  But in those cases when the brand is not important to you, you can use quite interesting and cheaper models.  For example, pay attention to Acer or, as already mentioned, to Lenovo.  This manufacturer may offer you a tablet for children from 5 years old, but in some cases it will be better than adult gadgets.  Take a look at the models: </p><ul><li>  Acer Iconia Tab A1-810 16Gb (8 000 rubles); </li><li>  <span>Lenovo IdeaTab A3000</span> 4Gb 3G (7 000 rubles). </li></ul><p>  In truth, the list goes on for a very long time.  But we have provided examples of the most suitable options.  Such children's tablets for children from 5 years old are a pretty good choice for the next couple of years.  There is only one category that we have not yet recognized.  There are educational tablets in the world.  Let's try to figure out which educational gadget is worth buying. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="educational tablets for children from 5 years" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/945843.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is it? </h2><p>  A children's tablet from 5 years old, which you can find in any modern toy store, is a technique that can educate your child.  Yes, this is not a real computer or gadget that will be multifunctional.  You can‚Äôt run any games on it (besides the built-in ones), go online, chat, and so on.  The child will be able to carry out only the built-in functions, that is, to learn. </p><p>  A developmental tablet for children from 5 years old, as a rule, should prepare the baby for school.  That is, it is designed for approximately 2 years of use.  It will already be more expedient for the student to buy a real tablet.  Let not the most powerful.  A little advice: if you want to buy educational tablets for children from 5 years old, then it is better not to introduce the child to a real gadget.  Otherwise, your toy will roll on the sidelines idle.  Let's think about what such a tablet can teach, and then try to choose the most suitable model with you. </p><h2>  Speech development </h2><p>  A good developmental tablet for children from 5 years old should, as a rule, teach language and speech development.  To be honest, such toys for preschool children contain Russian alphabet.  And some foreign one.  Often English.  That is, the child will be able to learn Russian and a foreign language.  Extremely comfortable. </p><p>  Also, training tablets often have a function for playing sounds.  You no longer need to hire a tutor to work out with the baby, and also prepare him for school.  It is enough to just give the child a tablet for children from 5 years old, reviews about which you liked the most, and then wait.  Show the child where certain functions are located, and then watch the game development of the baby.  In truth, this is a very good approach to preparing for school.  Sometimes not every kindergarten will teach this. </p><h2>  Maths </h2><p>  Another pretty important point that should be in any good learning tablet is math problems.  Yes, there are options without them.  But only in this case, the child will have to mathematically develop additionally.  Do you need it?  It is better to initially choose tablets for girls of 5 years and boys of the same age with numerous functions.  This approach will provide you the maximum result from the use of toys. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="children's tablets for children from 5 years" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/945842.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For children from 5 years old, in this gadget there are different mathematical problems, as well as geometric games.  During them, the child will learn to count a little (or improve his skills), and also understand what geometry is.  In addition, modern <span>gaming tablets</span> have a built-in multiplication table.  Every kid can learn it in a simple playful way.  That is, the tablet will definitely prepare it for the first class. </p><h2>  Additional functions </h2><p>  Reading, speaking and counting should be taught by any gaming gadget.  But in modern models, special attention is paid to additional functions.  Without them, often, even the most beautiful tablet will not be interesting to the baby.  Especially when you consider the fact that there are so many adult and powerful gadgets around a child.  For example, a computer. </p><p>  Therefore, in a good tablet for children from 5 years old there should be built-in functions.  To begin with, often such a toy acquaints preschool children not only with school subjects, but also with real tablets, adults.  So, these toys will have similar functions.  For example, a pin code to activate the work process.  Children really like it. </p><p>  Also, attention should be paid to models in which there is a built-in function for children's television.  That is, the gadget will store cartoons that kids of any age like so much.  You can do without this function, but often parents pay attention to tablets with cartoons.  Or a built-in memory card, where numerous cartoons have already been downloaded. </p><h2>  Price tag </h2><p>  Another important element is the price of the toy.  Often, she just rolls over.  That is, sometimes it is more advisable to buy a normal, adult tablet for a child than to give exactly the same amount for an ordinary educational toy.  But here it‚Äôs better to play it safe again - modern children only play games using real equipment.  So, you can forget about the development and preparation for school. </p><p>  The average cost of a good training tablet is approximately 5,000 rubles.  And for this price you will get not only a place for training, but also a "clearing" of entertainment.  All tasks and tasks are presented in game forms.  Bright, colorful and creative.  They are so attracted to children! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet for children from 5 years old reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/945841.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Choose a model </h2><p>  Since you and I have chosen specific models of "adult" tablets, the same thing should be done with educational gadgets.  The thing is that this issue is even more complex.  Yes, there are no characteristics in toys.  But there is functionality.  And so you have to try pretty hard to achieve the maximum result, as well as find your best tablet for your baby. </p><p>  Pay attention to the EvoPad.  This option is suitable for children from 2 years old to 7. That is, it has many functions: drawing, reading, learning languages, counting and so on.  Also in this model there is children's television with Soviet cartoons.  There is even a place for a memory card.  Such a toy is worth 5,000 rubles.  In principle, not very expensive. </p><p>  Also pay special attention to the Kurio 7S.  Here you will find a lot of interesting features.  For example, learning to play the guitar, a developing station, e-books, as well as children's TV.  Also there are various educational programs, textbooks, creative assignments.  Such a station costs already 7,000 rubles. </p><p>  You can stay on the option "Masha and the Bear."  This is a real <span>children's computer</span> that will develop your baby and prepare him for school along with your favorite characters in the animated series.  There are not many functions here: speech development, languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Russian and English), mathematics, puzzles, geometry.  But there are cartoons about Masha and the Bear.  Such a toy is several times cheaper - about 2 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  What is better to take </h2><p>  Since we were talking about toy tablets and real gadgets, now is the time to decide which option is best for a 5 year old kid.  To be honest, this is a very important issue.  And behavior, as well as the development of the child, can depend on it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablets for girls 5 years" class="if" height="456" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/945840.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In general, if you do not want the baby to become <span>addicted to gadgets,</span> then it is better to choose a gaming tablet.  But with all this, the child will have to be kept away from the real one.  So he learns to develop, and also will not receive a blow to the psyche due to addiction. </p><p>  In the case when the child is already "from the cradle" talking with a real tablet, you have to buy a real gadget.  After all, the game will not be interesting.  Yes, and hysteria when selecting a real tablet can not be avoided.  So decide for yourself what to buy.  This is a purely individual question.  Just keep in mind that for your baby, or rather for its development, a children's game developing tablet is more suitable. </p>
