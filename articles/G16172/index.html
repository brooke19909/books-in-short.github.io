Usually, the Yabloko wittyly retort the release of a much more advanced model.  So it happened this time.  The Koreans released the <span>Samsung Galaxy Note 8,</span> whose <span>specifications are</span> really impressive.  The company from Cupertino confused them with all the cards by announcing the iPhone X, which looks much more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù from Samsung.  And what do the Koreans do now?  No doubt, the smartphone turned out worthy.  And in order to verify this, we will consider its main characteristics and understand what it is.  But for now, let's talk a little about the company itself. </p><h2>  A little bit about the company </h2><p>  Samsung was founded in 1938.  Then she was engaged in the import and export of pasta.  However, twenty years will pass, and they will talk about the manufacturer as one of the largest suppliers of household appliances and other electronics.  The launch of mobile phone production brought the company even more revenue.  In the days of the dominance of ‚Äúbutton handsets,‚Äù many simply dreamed of receiving a Samsung phone as a present.  In the era of smartphones, the company quickly redesigned its production and became one of the most famous smartphone manufacturers in the world. </p><p>  I must say that it was Samsung that released the first smartphone on Android right after the announcement of Apple's first iPhone.  Since then, the confrontation between Koreans and the guys from Cupertino begins.  It does not end to this day.  Moreover, they say that competitors are ready for anything for leadership.  However, in war all means are good.  But the Koreans managed to release the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, whose characteristics are impressive, without any interference with Apple.  Now consider this interesting gadget in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  So what about the design of the Galaxy Note 8?  We will leave specifications and reviews for later.  At first glance, you can confuse it with the S8 Plus.  Indeed, there are very few differences.  Especially on the front panel.  This is the same standard "eight".  But on the rear panel there are a lot of differences.  The first thing is the camera.  It is dual and is not located as it is in modern smartphones: it is slightly biased towards the center.  Next to the camera is a two-section LED flash and a heartbeat sensor.  Behind these sensors is a fingerprint scanner.  In addition to the connector for charging and the speaker grill, there is also a stylus slot on the bottom end.  And at the top there is a headphone jack.  The power and volume buttons are located on the side faces of the device. </p><p>  The device itself is made of a single piece of aluminum of the 7000 series.  The front and rear panels are covered with the latest generation of tempered Corning <span>Gorilla Glass</span> .  The back panel, by the way, collects much less scratches this time. </p>

    <h2>  Screen specifications </h2><p>  This is a separate story.  The screen is really interesting in Galaxy Note 8. Characteristics and review suggest that this is one of the best displays in the modern mobile market.  It uses a Super AMOLED matrix with improved performance.  Thanks to this, it turned out to improve color reproduction almost to the ideal result.  Screen size is 6.3 inches.  But, thanks to the non-standard aspect ratio, the gadget does not look so bulky.  Screen resolution - QuadHD + (1440 by 2960 pixels).  This means that you will not see individual pixels on it.  No matter how hard you try. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What else can be said about the display of the new flagship?  It has a very high-quality anti-reflective coating.  It cannot be used as a mirror.  There is also an <span>oleophobic coating</span> that prevents fingerprints from appearing on a flat screen surface.  It also helps to easily remove these "artifacts" from the glass.  The screen has a frameless design, and its side faces are slightly curved.  On them you can place some commonly used applications.  So it will be easier to get to them. </p>

    <h2>  Hardware platform features </h2><p>  To date, the most productive smartphone is the Galaxy Note 8. Its characteristics are such that the device cannot be loaded with anything "to the eyeballs."  Judge for yourself.  The device has an eight-core Samsung Exynos 64-bit chip manufactured by Samsung.  Four of the eight cores operate at a frequency of 2.35 gigahertz.  And four more have a slightly lower clock frequency - 1.9 gigahertz.  But in any case, this is significant power.  The smartphone is equipped with 6 gigabytes of dual-channel, energy-efficient RAM.  This makes the device unrealistically fast.  For the graphics meets the advanced Mali G71 chip.  Even the most demanding games will not interfere with this smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also, a very interesting sensor is installed in the gadget, which allows you to unlock the phone after scanning the iris.  Unlocking by scanning the user's face is also possible.  The device supports the latest generation LTE communication standard, is equipped with a Bluetooth transmitter version 5.0, a Wi-Fi module with the ability to work in 5 GHz networks and an NFC chip.  The amount of internal memory is 64 gigabytes.  It can be expanded with Micro SD memory cards up to 128 gigabytes.  SIM card slot combined.  That is, you can install a memory card in it.  There is the possibility of wireless and fast charging. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras (main and front) </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the most interesting.  What about cameras in the Galaxy Note 8?  Characteristics and photos indicate that this device has no problems with cameras.  The main camera is represented by two modules at once.  Each has 13 megapixels, a sophisticated optical system and advanced focusing.  All modules are fast and wide-angle.  Two modules are needed in order to provide high-quality zoom and blur the background.  And the device copes with these tasks with a bang. </p><p>  There are many camera settings in the proprietary application.  You can also turn on fully manual mode and feel like a real photographer.  And what is most valuable - photos can be saved in RAW format.  For subsequent processing.  The front camera has a fast wide-angle module of 8 megapixels.  There are possibilities of decorating photographs and other unnecessary tinsel.  But it removes this miniature module perfectly.  Even in low light conditions.  Many experts agree that Note 8 has one of the best cameras on the market.  And to argue with this fact is difficult.  Takes a gadget really wonderful. </p>

    <h2>  Software platform </h2><p>  We continue to disassemble the smartphone Samsung Galaxy Note 8. The characteristics of the software platform in turn.  The gadget is running the latest Android operating system version 7.1.1.  However, the system is not simple, but flavored with a proprietary ClenUI shell.  The developers tried to make the shell as light as possible.  And they did it very well.  Nevertheless, there are those who do not like the standard interface. </p><p>  A very interesting feature of the software platform is the Bixby voice assistant.  Its implementation is still very lame (on both legs), but the manufacturer wants to do something with its own artificial intelligence (like Siri from Apple).  In the meantime, the assistant can work only as everyone knows Google Now.  Agree, this does not add interest.  But when the developers make a full version - then there will be a completely different conversation. </p>

    <h2>  Stylus Pen S-Pen </h2><p>  This component is an indispensable attribute of Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Its characteristics are really impressive.  It should only be noted that he is able to distinguish between 4096 degrees of depression.  This allows him to more accurately practice gestures.  This "nano-pen" is completely protected from moisture (like the whole device), has a pleasant to the touch structure and original design.  There is also a kind of "protection against the fool": to insert the stylus into the device the wrong end will not work.  This is a very thoughtful decision. </p><p>  What can I do with the S-Pen?  Yes, anything.  You can write SMS by hand, draw, colorize, leave the necessary notes and more.  Not for nothing that the device has the word Note in its name, which translates from English as ‚Äúnotepad‚Äù.  This is really a notepad.  Only technically advanced and never paper. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  And how is the device doing with performance?  A non-removable 3300 mAh lithium-ion battery is installed here.  For such a device, it seems to be not enough, but do not forget about optimizing the software shell and hardware platform.  Thanks to this, the gadget can live peacefully when playing high-definition video at maximum brightness for as long as 12 hours.  This tells us that Samsung engineers know their stuff well.  For a device of such power to have such autonomy!  This is on the verge of fiction.  In normal use, charging the gadget is enough for the whole day.  This is a pretty good result.  Some of his "colleagues", similar in hardware characteristics, are not enough for a day.  Therefore, with the autonomy of the device, everything is in order. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  As a rule, the owners of such gadgets leave their comments after purchasing the device.  What do people say about the Galaxy Note 8?  Specifications and reviews about this device prove that the device turned out to be almost perfect.  Everyone who purchased this gadget to this day is in wild delight.  They like everything. </p><p>  Most praised the screen and both cameras.  This is exactly what users on other devices lacked.  True, some say that you still need to get used to such a screen.  Unusual when the display is so huge.  They are used to devices of a completely different design.  But you quickly get used to the good.  Therefore, no one should have problems with the screen. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we reviewed the new flagship Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Its technical characteristics suggest that it is the most powerful device to date (until the iPhone X came out).  This gadget is perfect for those who need the presence of all the latest technological advances in their device.  But you need to be prepared to pay a fairly large amount for these "innovations."  Be that as it may, a mobile phone is clearly worth the money.  It will work for a long time and will remain relevant for another three years. </p>
