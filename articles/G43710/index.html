There are preserved buildings of past centuries, narrow cobblestone streets.  And just a little distance high-rises rise, new housing estates and industrial zones.  But this is not the capital of Bashkortostan Ufa.  "Where is the city center?"  - the amazed tourist asks, going to the forecourt.  Even on the train or on the way from the airport, he notices a large monument, towering on the banks of the river, representing a proud rider.  <span>This is a monument to</span> Salavat Yulaev - the national hero of the <span>Bashkir people.</span>  In general, the city stands between the banks of two rivers.  The capital of Bashkortostan got its name from Ufa.  And the second river is called Agidel, which means simply Belaya.  This article will be useful to those tourists who came to Ufa for one day.  Many attractions of the city are located away from the historical center.  We have developed a route that will allow you to explore the key places of interest for tourists in one day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ufa Center" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1678246.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Ufa: hotels</span> in the city center </h2><p>  In order to take a walk, see the sights and return to a warm shelter without any problems, you need to look for housing in the historical part of the capital of Bashkorstan.  But where is the center of Ufa?  This city is known as an industrial center.  And there are really many factories in Ufa.  Despite the fact that the city was founded in the second half of the sixteenth century, it has a modern look.  The few wooden buildings are slowly deteriorating and every year they are becoming smaller.  But the place where the Kremlin once stood was left.  If we want to be closer to key attractions, we will choose Ufa hotels in the city center.  For budget tourists, we can recommend the Aristol Hotel (one thousand four hundred rubles a room).  Posadskaya is also located in the historical center of the city.  For discerning tourists, you can recommend the Hilton Garden hotels on the high bank of the river, the Holiday Inn or the President.  Those who appreciate family comfort and a homely atmosphere will surely enjoy the Emotium mini-hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Center g ufa" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1678249.jpg" width="584"></div>

It not only symbolizes the friendship of the Russian and Bashkir peoples.  The monument was erected on the site of the ancient Kremlin.  The monument began to be built in 1957 (but it was opened only in 1965) and was dedicated to the four hundredth anniversary of the entry of Bashkiria into the Russian Empire.  Even if you travel without a guide, you can easily guess what this monument symbolizes.  Two women in national costumes - Russian and Bashkir.  Between them is depicted a dagger, sheathed - a symbol of voluntariness of joining the empire.  The place on which the Friendship Monument is erected is very picturesque.  From the high shore overlooks the water surface of Agidel.  Interestingly, the monument was built taking into account the turbulent seismological situation of the Bashkir region.  The monument is wide at the base, and therefore stable during a possible earthquake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ufa where the city center" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1678240.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  St. Sergius Cathedral </h2><p>  From <span>Pervomaiskaya Square</span> we set off for Ankylosing spondylitis.  There rises a cathedral dedicated to St. Sergius.  The wooden church was built in eighteen sixty-eight.  Of course, this is not an ancient building, but the temple was erected on the site of an unsaved sixteenth-century chapel.  And it was founded by the first Orthodox settlers - gunners and archers, who defended the Kremlin (the center of Ufa).  It is noteworthy that during the years of militant atheism, St. Sergius Church was not closed.  On the contrary, she was given the status of the cathedral (main) cathedral of the city.  The temple is still valid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ufa hotels in the city center" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1678248.jpg" width="600"></div>

The center of Ufa, along with the Orthodox Cathedral, adorns the <span>Muslim temple.</span>  The mosque is located at 52 Tukaeva Street. This building, which is simple in external decoration, was built on the voluntary donations of the townspeople in the year 1880, that is, it is older than its Christian counterpart.  The mosque is a two-story building under a green dome with one minaret.  Like St. Sergius Cathedral, it was never closed by the Soviet government.  Even more: during the years of the USSR, it was the only mosque in the territory of Ufa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ufa hotels in the city center" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1678247.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  House S.T.  Aksakova </h2><p>  How can the center of Ufa do without museums?  The house of S.T.Aksakov is located near the First Mosque, on Z.Rasuleva street, 4. This is a small museum, but it does not lack visitors.  It was opened in 1991.  The museum exhibits almost two thousand exhibits.  And all of them are connected with the life and work of a famous Russian writer.  Sergei Timofeevich Aksakov spent his childhood in this old mansion of the eighteenth century.  He lived continuously with his maternal grandfather along with his parents and sister from 1795 to 1797.  Children's impressions of Ufa, and especially about the huge house, upholstered by tes, influenced the writer's work.  In 2008, the Crafts House was opened on the territory of the museum, where you can take a master class in sewing, wood carving or national embroidery. </p><h2>  Monument to Salavat Yulaev </h2><p>  After passing through a very beautiful park named after Aksakov, we get to the promenade.  On it stands the object of all postcards and magnets, showing how beautiful the center of Ufa is.  This is a monument to Salavat Yulaev, the national hero of Bashkiria, an associate of Yemelyan Pugachev.  Equestrian monument is the largest in Russia.  Its height is ten meters.  And he is cast from cast iron. </p>
