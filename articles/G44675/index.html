This huge country in South America stretches from north to south for three thousand seven hundred kilometers.  Technological transformations have not yet spoiled its natural landscapes.  The country is extremely picturesque, and the virginity of its nature is protected by 29 National Parks, among which, as a pearl of the first magnitude, Iguazu National Park stands out.  Argentina, whose photo <strong> </strong>  demonstrates <strong> </strong>  this phenomenon takes care of its unique natural treasures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iguazu National Park Argentina" class="if" height="81" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1536141.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  UNESCO protected </h2><p>  Three protected areas: Los Glaciares in Patagonia in the south, Talampaya along with Ischigualasto in Kunyo and Iguazu in the northeast are UNESCO heritage sites.  This is a world heritage.  Surrounded by a subtropical rainforest, the Iguazu National Park Argentina has established in the northern part of the province of Misiones.  Three <span>rivers</span> flow in it <span>: Parana,</span> Uruguay and Iguazu, which formed the natural borders of the province.  This interfluve is called Argentine Mesopotamia. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Guarani tribes have lived in this area forever.  Today, their lives are concentrated in a small, poor community.  They do not know how to speak Spanish, and they consider whites to be conquerors and invaders.  Only for them there is an unhindered entrance to the Iguazu National Park.  Argentina feels its guilt before the indigenous people and helps them, and shows respect.  Only some advanced ones know Spanish and conduct tours of the National Park.  They learned it at the school, which is available in their village.  A guide can make money on a bicycle or even a motorcycle.  Their pride can hit anyone.  It is a plow and a cart.  But in every home there is a TV.  They get electricity for him from the solar panels that the government gave them.  They do not hunt, they only cultivate the land and grow watermelons, potatoes, pineapples, corn, as well as animals (for food).  In their free time, young people play soccer and volleyball. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Iguazu National Park in Argentina and Description of the Waterfalls </h2><p>  Where three countries border - Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil, Iguazu Park is located.  In Argentina, it covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã550 square meters.  km, and smoothly passes into the eponymous National Park of Brazil.  This is a view of the waterfalls in the National Park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iguazu Falls National Park Argentina" class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1536151.jpg" width="600"></div>  The photo successfully shows the National Park, Iguazu Falls in Argentina.  The border is a natural river barrier - the Iguazu River, which the Guarani Indians called ‚Äúbig water‚Äù.  The legend of the Guarani Indians tells us that God wanted to marry a beautiful girl.  She ran away with a young and strong man on the river in a kayak.  In fury and anger, God divided the river into waterfalls, causing the beloved to fall forever.  The length of the river is 1.32 thousand km.  Iguazu flows in a winding stream, which replenish about thirty tributaries.  It is constantly cut off by waterfalls, the number of which ranges from 150 to 300, depending on the water level.  The view from space is simply magnificent. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iguazu argentina national park tourist attraction" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1536176.jpg" width="543"></div>  During floods, its drain becomes seven times larger than <span>Niagara Falls.</span>  About half of the river‚Äôs stream flows into a narrow and long abyss, a cascade of fourteen waterfalls called the Devil's Throat.  It has a U-shape.  All waterfalls are located mainly on the Argentine side.  Therefore, in order to get to know them better, it is better for a tourist to visit the Iguazu National Park.  Argentina with its waterfalls is considered an amazing game of nature in the modern world. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iguazu argentina national park photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1536153.jpg" width="600"></div>  The largest of them on the southern continent is shown in the photo and is called ‚ÄúCataras del Iguazu‚Äù.  Its width ranges from three to four km.  Usually, to approach the waterfalls, they use three ways: lower, upper and distant.  It is in this sequence that they inspect the park.  Below, the waterfalls look more interesting.  On the bridges the visitor walks right under the water for about an hour and a half.  Do not miss the Bosetti Falls.  This is part of a story about Iguazu National Park, Argentina: a description of its individual waterfalls.

Then the path passes along the bridges, and butterflies, herons, jays flutter around.  Attention is riveted to them, but the rumble of the waterfall is more audible. </p><p>  This Creator pearl has two hundred seventy-five cascades.  Niagara fades in front of him.  Its width is 3.3 km.  The waterfall erupts from a height of more than 80 meters and is surrounded by a no less powerful cloud of spray and often a rainbow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iguazu argentina national park reviews" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1536155.jpg" width="600"></div>  Narrow bridges lead to many of its parts.  They are laid under falling water.  A tourist will be given a cloak for passage underneath.  You can inspect almost everyone at close range.  The greatness of the water imperceptibly addictive, and it is easy not to notice how it flies all day. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iguazu argentina national park description" class="if" height="241" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1536167.jpg" width="573"></div>  This magnificence is almost always compared to the <span>Victoria Falls</span> in Africa.  It is wider than the African one, but is divided into separate sections, while Victoria is a single whole.  It is impossible to get close to her.  Only a helicopter flight will help.  Therefore, with full conviction, we can assume that the Iguazu National Park (Argentina) is a tourist attraction that has waterfalls that are beyond competition.  Having finished a walking trip, you can transfer to a speedboat and enjoy the green shores and islets.  He will give a ride very close to the waterfalls, and the tourist will not remain dry unless he first removes his clothes and securely hides it in a rubber bag, remaining in a swimsuit or swimming trunks.

    <h2>  Animal world </h2><p>  Now we will talk a little about some of the seventy species of mammals that live in the tropical jungle of the park.  First of all, it is necessary to clarify that it is simply impossible to go off the laid route.  After all, Iguazu National Park is famous not only for waterfalls.  Argentina has created a reserve for wild, rare species of animals.  A spotted panther that does not have a tail, that is, a jaguar, is very dangerous.  Guarani called him "the one who kills with one leap."  The tropics are its permanent habitat, but the insidious beast is also found on the ocean coast.  He searches for eggs of turtles and feeds on them.  Ocelot is also a cat.  The beast is smaller than the jaguar.  Life spends only in a dense forest.  Deer Mazamas, about which almost nothing is known to zoologists, live on the plains surrounded by forests.  Tapirs also prefer the plains.  During the day, the beast sleeps in the jungle, and at night it leaves to feast on plants.  Here crocodiles, more precisely, caimans, cougars and jaguars, are waiting for them.  A man is also his enemy, but he is not afraid of tapir in the National Park.  Capybaras are harmless herbivores.  Guarani they are beautifully called "lord of herbs."  On the ground, they move slowly, but they float excellently and quickly.  Outwardly resemble a very large guinea pig. </p><h2>  Vampire Bat </h2><p>  We highlight it separately.  A vampire flies up at night to smell the sleeping beast, and then slowly approaches it.  There are painkillers in his saliva, so the beast does not feel a bite in the neck or behind the ear.  To the wound, the vampire substitutes the tongue through which the blood of the animal flows.  In about half an hour he eats up.  He is able to bite a person.  A vampire is dangerous as a peddler of rabies and plague.  The animal also eats the blood of pets with pleasure.  In the countries of Latin America they are waging a relentless struggle.  Since because of it there is a death of cattle from bleeding or disease. </p><h2>  Bird kingdom </h2><p>  Four hundred species of birds live in the park.  There are several types of parrots, as well as harpies and hummingbirds.  Harpy is an eagle that uses monkeys, sloths, anteaters for food.  And if they are not, then he does not shun reptiles, snakes and birds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iguazu argentina national park how to get" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1536168.jpg" width="600"></div>  A very beautiful parrot, the Winnierax Amazon, will survive if there is no illegal capture and destruction of its natural habitats.  But the selva are cut down, so there is only hope for the National Park.  The lime green tirik parrot is not in such a distress.  He easily tames and learns to pronounce words, but in the cells he screams unbearably loudly.  In the park you can take a picture with him.

    <h2>  Flora </h2><p>  Forests in the park are multi-level.  The highest place is called "canopy".  Trees are covered with vines.  Then they are reduced to shrubs, near which mate grows.  Tea is brewed from it, which is now familiar in our country.  Orchids do not need to be searched.  They grow nearby in trees. </p><p>  The plant world is represented by protected species of rare trees - aspidosperm.  Their fruits are edible, so they were cut down.  Now this plant can only be found in the park.  Cabbage palm trees give delicious berries.  They are added to ice cream or made from them drinks.  Leaves are used for salads.  Araucaria (evergreen conifers), bromeliads and orchids live with us ‚Äútamed‚Äù on the windows in beautiful flower pots, and there - in the wild. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iguazu national park argentina tourist reviews" class="if" height="455" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1536172.jpg" width="600"></div>  In the photo above you will see a small plantation of epipodium orchids growing directly on the ground.  It is the unusualness of this shot (such growth is not peculiar to orchids) that made him appear in the text.

    <h2>  Iguazu National Park, Argentina: how to get there </h2><p>  Famous waterfalls are located between Argentina and Brazil, so they can be visited from any country.  From the <span>capital of Argentina</span> to the town of Puerto Iguazu it is more convenient (faster and half cheaper) to fly by plane ($ 70) than to travel by bus ($ 200).  Then drive to the center (7 km from the airport) by bus (if you have time) or by taxi.  The park is only 18 km away.  There is regular transport from the bus station.  After 30 - 40 minutes, the tourist arrives in the park and, having bought a ticket, gets on the train. </p><h2>  Iguazu National Park, Argentina: traveler reviews </h2><p>  A lot of Russian tourists visited the great and powerful waterfalls.  All write only brief enthusiastic notes.  They probably got such impressions that they cannot express in words.  All post only photos that depict the Iguazu National Park (Argentina).  Reviews succinctly report that this is a miracle of nature, a dream and a fairy tale, an amazing sight.  No one was indifferent to the "Bird Park", which is an integral part of the National Park.  All take away unforgettable impressions that will not fade over time, and a sense of happiness and fullness of life. </p>
