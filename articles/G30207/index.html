    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  <span>For the first time as a settlement, the current Kotlas (Arkhangelsk region) was mentioned in 1379.</span>  <span>Then on this earth lived the Komi tribes.</span>  <span>It was through this settlement in the <span>XIV century</span> that trade routes from Siberia, Arkhangelsk and the central regions of the country passed.</span>  <span>But even the excellent location of the city did not contribute to its development and prosperity, Kotlas for a long time remained a tiny and almost invisible town.</span> </p><p>  <span>A turning point in the history of the city was steam shipping, which contributed to its development.</span>  <span>And with the construction of the Kotlas railway in the region, it completely turned into a developed transport hub.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
