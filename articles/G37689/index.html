You can offer your child to make such a butterfly out of paper with his own hands.  In this work, it will be necessary to use imagination and fine motor skills.  So the child will definitely find such an activity fascinating.  For the <span>manufacture of postcards</span> you will need a dense cardboard.  We knock it in half and choose the half on which we will cut the butterfly.  Now draw the outline of the insect.  You can copy the picture from the sample attached above, or draw your own sketch.  When the image is ready, you can start cutting.  You should cut out the wings, the ornament on them, as well as the head and body.  But you need to leave a thin strip on the sides of the body.  Thanks to her, the butterfly will be attached to the base of the card.  Rhinestones or beads can be glued to paper insects on wings. </p><h2>  Postcard </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper butterflies" class="if uuid-2263375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2263375.jpg"></div><p>  To create such a butterfly from paper with your own hands, you will need not a half, but a whole sheet of paper.  To make such a card, you should properly prepare.  You need to buy thick paper, you can tinted.  In this case, the butterfly will be well fixed, and the card will retain its original appearance for many years.  How to make such a craft?  Print the sample above.  You need to print on a pre-prepared sheet of paper.  We arm ourselves with scissors and cut out the butterfly along the contour.  And at the same time we make slots on the sides.  Now you need to bend the insect so that it becomes voluminous.  It remains to decorate the butterfly.  You can stick various accessories on the card or paint it with colored pencils. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Butterfly curtain </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper butterflies" class="if uuid-2263379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2263379.jpg"></div><p>  Do you need to zone a room?  Or maybe you want to create a curtain on the door or window?  In this case, butterflies from paper with your own hands will be simply necessary for you.  They can be threaded and evenly distributed on a pole or bar.  Creating such a curtain will not take much time, and the result will pleasantly amaze you and your guests.  Let's start manufacturing.  First, pick up tinted paper.  You can take something with a print.  It is desirable that the color of the paper fit the color scheme of the room.  Now print the template above.  Cut out the pattern of the butterfly, and then duplicate it on the prepared paper.  Now you should cut each billet and bend in half.  We take the thread, and on both sides of it we glue the butterfly.  The effect should be that insects sit on the thread on both sides. </p><h2>  Origami butterfly </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper butterflies" class="if uuid-2263385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2263385.jpg"></div><p>  For the manufacture of such crafts, we need tinted paper.  Now you need to make a square out of a sheet.  Origami butterflies from paper with their own hands will be made precisely from this geometric figure.  We take the workpiece and bend it first vertically, then horizontally, and then along two diagonals.  Now turn the square over and bend the top side down so that the square turns into two triangles.  Detailed instructions in the picture are located above.  Now you need to bend the two lower corners of the triangle up, and then turn the workpiece to the other side.  We bend the bottom corner up and turn the figure over again.  Now you need to fold the blank in half, and the butterfly will be ready.  You can make many of these insects and make a curtain of them by stringing the figures on a thread. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Butterflies on the wall </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper butterflies" class="if uuid-2263397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2263397.jpg"></div><p>  Thinking of refreshing the interior?  Do-it-yourself paper butterflies on the wall will help you with this.  Above is a template, thanks to which you can quickly and easily decorate any surface.  You should print the pattern and cut it.  Now prepare sheets of thick colored paper.  It can be bought at any store for creativity.  We cut the blanks on a stencil.  Do-it-yourself paper butterflies are ready.  Now they need to be glued somewhere.  You can attach them to the wall with double-sided tape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper butterflies" class="if uuid-2263402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2263402.jpg"></div><p>  One of the interesting options is given above.  On the wall, draw a tree, and instead of leaves on the branches place colorful butterflies.  You can experiment with sizes and textures.  For example, take gold paper or textured sheets. </p><h2>  Butterfly on a glass </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper butterflies" class="if uuid-2263407" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2263407.jpg"></div><p>  Such decor will be appropriate for a party.  Butterflies can decorate glasses with drinks or glasses with wine.  If you cut colored insects, then they can decorate children's circles.  The child will be happy to drink milk at night or take a not very tasty medicine.  How to make such an interesting decor?  You should take a dense sheet and draw a butterfly silhouette on it.  You can use templates or draw your own unique design.  The lower edge of the body of the butterfly needs to be made a corner.  Thanks to this, the fastening will turn out to be good, and the decorative figure will not fall off even when a person drinks from a glass. </p><h2>  Butterfly for pencil </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper butterflies" class="if uuid-2263414" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2263414.jpg"></div><p>  You can decorate stationery with decorative elements.  To do this, print the attached template above.  Do-it-yourself paper butterflies are very simple.  A stencil is cut out and a silhouette of a butterfly is drawn from colored paper on it.  For this purpose, you need to use thick sheets or take colored cardboard.  Your paper must be double-sided.  You can use sheets with a small print, for example, stripes or polka dots.  Cut out the insect.  Now in the body you need to make two horizontal incisions.  They are more convenient to create with a clerical knife, rather than scissors.  The butterfly is ready.  She can decorate both pencils and pens. </p><h2>  Corrugated Paper Butterfly </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper butterflies" class="if uuid-2263416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2263416.jpg"></div><p>  This decor will be the perfect complement to any background for photos.  For example, you can create a photozone from flowers, and decorate its butterflies from corrugated paper.  With your own hands to create such figures will be very simple.  We select the appropriate material in pastel or bright colors.  Now you should cut a long rectangle.  The edges of this geometric shape should be shaped like a wave.  Now with scissors along two edges you need to make small cuts.  Fold the rectangle in half, and then double again.  Now we wire the blank in the middle with a wire.  The antennae should be made from the remaining ends of the clamp.  They can be wrapped with thread or painted with acrylic paint.  Also, the body of the butterfly can be decorated with beads, beads or rhinestones. </p><h2>  Decorative mobile </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper butterflies" class="if uuid-2263422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2263422.jpg"></div><p>  Such a decorative element will fit perfectly into the nursery.  To create this craft, you should stock up with thick double-sided paper or cardboard.  We cut out figures of butterflies of different sizes from it.  It is desirable to make insects in one color scheme.  We take a thread and attach two butterflies.  We glue them together with bodies, passing a rope between the blanks.  Two or three figures can be strung on one thread.  From white cardboard we create clouds.  One of them should be big - this will be the basis of the mobile.  The four others should be smaller.  Between themselves, clouds can also vary both in shape and in size.  Glue the blanks in the middle in pairs.  Now we attach the threads to one big cloud.  As a result, we get a mobile with butterflies fluttering in the clouds. </p>
