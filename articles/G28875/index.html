  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitted uggs: description with photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One can safely say that knitted ugg boots are a secret or explicit dream of many girls.  Having once won worldwide recognition and love, comfortable and soft boots still remain at the peak of popularity.  Despite the fact that some lovers of glamor do not recognize the very principle of such a model, in the winter you can see hundreds or even thousands of very different types on the streets. </p><h2>  Knit or buy? </h2><p>  Knitted uggs (handmade) is, of course, beautiful and stylish, but not very practical.  Firstly, such shoes will in any case be softer than factory shoes, and secondly, it will instantly get wet from rain or snow.  Therefore, the craftswoman should carefully weigh the pros and cons to avoid disappointment. </p><p>  It is worth mentioning that knitted uggs will be very warm and attractive.  Especially if you use thick yarn with a high wool content.  Regardless of how the product is made (using knitting needles or a hook), the knitting will turn out to be voluminous and embossed.  For the manufacture of shoes you should not spend money on 100% wool, you can use blended yarn with acrylic or cotton. </p><h2>  What to do with the sole? </h2><p>  Today, designers decorate ugg boots in all known ways and offer to wear them with jackets, fur coats and coats.  However, one detail is unchanged: the sole always remains quite thick, and the seam connecting it to the fabric part does not hide inside the product, but remains outside. </p><p>  This should be considered for those who are going to make knitted uggs (knitting or crocheting).  The sole can be obtained in several ways: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Just buy (fortunately there are shops for needlewomen). </li><li>  Sew independently from several layers of felt or leather (if you plan to create ugg boots for the home). </li><li>  Use the sole from old boots. </li></ol><h2>  Crochet ugg boots with description and photo </h2><p>  At this point, two master classes are proposed, using which you can connect ugg boots for a child, an adult, or for a doll. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet ugg boots with a description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1505158.jpg" width="500"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The only moment that the designer did not take into account is the embossed seam between the sole and the upper part.  A craftswoman can do it when the product is completely ready, for this it is enough to perform one row of single crochet columns (SB) in the appropriate place on the outside of the boots. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting uggs with needles" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1505160.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Work sequence: </p><ol><li>  Run a chain of air loops (VP), its length will correspond to 2/3 of the length of the sole. </li><li>  Next, this chain should be tied in circular rows.  To get rounded edges, in the first row it is necessary to perform 5-7  at the ends of the chain of VP.  In the next rows, these columns need to be doubled, that is, two should be knitted from one.  The rest of the CHF need to be knitted as usual (from one getting one). </li><li>  When working on the toe, it is required to use double crochet (), and when moving to the heel - .  Thus, you get the part of the desired shape. </li></ol><h2>  Next stage </h2><p>  If the craftswoman decided to use a ready-made sole, then she needs to dial a chain of VP, the length of which will be equal to the perimeter of the selected part.  You can then use the description below. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  <span>The canvas is knitted</span> exactly to a height of several centimeters.  If you knit a row, winding the hook not under both ‚Äúpigtails‚Äù of the column of the previous row, but only under the outer one, you will get a volumetric hem.  This technique is often used to separate one part of the canvas from another.  Moving from knitting soles to a flat area, it is also advisable to apply this method.  In the photo with beige boots, the border between these details is clearly visible. </li><li>  To knit a sock of the desired shape, they begin to cut the columns (one of two turns out to be one).  These actions must be performed on the bow of the boot.  The figures show very clearly how the part should look. </li><li>  Next, pagolenko form: a section of a flat canvas.  There are no clear instructions, as it can be decorated as you wish.  Most often, the craftswomen provide the ugg boots with a clasp to make it easier to put on and take off. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting uggs with needles with a description" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1505161.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  You can also not suffer with circular rows and separately knit all the details. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet ugg boots master class" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1505159.jpg" width="465"></div>

    <h2>  How to warm boots? </h2><p>  In the case when the knitter plans to use knitted uggs as a full-fledged shoe, she can sew a dense lining inside.  Sheepskin full of knitwear, faux or natural fur (for example, trim from a fur coat or sheepskin coat) is perfect for this purpose. </p><p>  Samples of patterns are presented in the following photo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet uggs" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1505157.jpg" width="314"></div>

    <p>  It should be borne in mind that knitted details should be slightly larger than the lining elements (one or one and a half centimeters wider).  It is best to first cut and sew the fur, and then get to knitting.  To make the ugg boots comfortable to wear, the lining should be sewn tightly to the main fabric.  It is worth fixing not only at the top of the pagolenka, but also along the seams.  Then the uggs will be whole and tougher. </p><h2>  Heat treatment and washing boots </h2><p>  Quite often, knitting instructions recommend blowing off the finished fabric with steam from the iron or washing it in warm water.  When working on boots, this should not be done, as these measures are intended to soften the product. </p><p>  Uggs need to be knitted as tightly as possible, preferably at the end of the work soak in starch.  Of course, sooner or later they will have to be washed, but then it will be necessary to re-starch.  The washing should be postponed until the last, doing dry cleaning, because the boots can stretch or run away after water procedures. </p><p>  In addition, fur-lined uggs take a very long time to dry. </p><h2>  Knitting needles </h2><p>  Those who are not suitable for crocheted ugg boots will be interested in items made with knitting needles.  Using these tools, you can make canvases with a variety of patterns: English gum, braids, ‚Äúrice‚Äù, ‚Äúcheckerboard‚Äù and others.  Needless to say, that such products are primarily associated with winter snow days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted uggs" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1505156.jpg" width="461"></div>

    <p>  The photo shows high knitted uggs with knitting needles.  A description of the problems should not arise, because it is enough to knit and sew the details according to pre-printed patterns.  The designer suggests stitching a piece of genuine leather on the heel so that it does not wrinkle. </p><h2>  Features of high boots </h2><p>  Products with wide lapels look quite impressive.  In addition to aesthetic appeal, these elements also fulfill a practical function: fitting tightly to the foot, they retain more heat. </p><p>  Ugg boots with tall pagolenki will be more practical if you place a regular linen elastic in the lapel fabric.  Otherwise, the part will stretch rather quickly, and will slide. </p><p>  As an alternative way, you can consider the zipper sewn along the entire boot.  This will allow you to put on and take off your shoes without stretching the narrowest areas.  True, to carefully sew in a zipper, you have to work hard.  It will be easier to complete the task for those craftswomen who have a sewing machine.  However, if the knitted fabric and the lining are too thick, you still have to work with your hands. </p><h2>  How to wear knitted uggs </h2><p>  When planning to use handmade boots, you need to understand that you should be extremely careful when combining them with knitted hats and scarves.  In the heat of excitement it is easy to turn into a Christmas tree, on which they put "all the best at once."  The ideal set would be crocheted uggs (a master class on their manufacture is proposed above) and a scarf-snood from yarn of the same color.  It is advisable not to use knitted bags, coats, skirts and tunics. </p>
