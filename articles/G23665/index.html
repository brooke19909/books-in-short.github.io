    <h2>  Local beaches </h2><p>  The resort's climate is quite typical for the Catalan coast of the Mediterranean Sea: summers are quite hot here, and the average temperature is more than +30.  In winter, the temperature does not drop below +5 degrees.  Snow and hail in this region is a fantastic phenomenon.  But it rains in the fall quite regularly. </p><p>  The resort is famous for its coast.  Pineda de Mar beach stretches for almost three kilometers, and in width it reaches 40 meters.  Here you can see a small silvery sand and a larger yellow-golden.  Although the beach is quite long, it is very well equipped.  It operates rental boats, deck chairs, umbrellas, catamarans. </p><p>  Pineda de Mar beach annually receives a blue flag from UNESCO.  Rescue workers are on duty around the clock, and special descents are equipped for the disabled.  It is thanks to the landscaping that the coast is so highly rated among European beaches. </p>

    <h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Pineda de Mar is divided into two parts: historical (old) and tourist (new).  The ancient district is located around the church of St. Mary, which was built in 1079.  The facade of the building is made in the Baroque style and looks very unusual.  A dumb witness to past years is the Can Can Jally Palace, which was built in the 15th century.  The city also has archaeological artifacts.  One of them is the watchtower of Sant Jaume, the Devil's Bridge, the ruins of the ancient Roman aqueduct.  Montpalau Castle, which is partially preserved in the city, is no less interesting to tourists. </p><p>  Local funds hold one of the best graphic collections in the world.  The local library holds many events and exhibitions on the schedule throughout the year. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Relaxing in Checkin Pineda 3 * (Costa del Maresme), you can visit many excursions to see the nearest attractions, or travel on your own.  From Pineda you can very easily get to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãTarragona and Girona, and there you can visit the most popular tourist places.  The journey to the <span>capital of Spain</span> takes no more than 50 minutes by bus or train.  From May to October, a special tourist train runs to Pineda de Mar.  As a rule, vacationers also tend to visit small French cities, where you can see stunning historical places and simply picturesque views. </p>

    <p>  In Pineda de Mar, there are many shopping centers and souvenir shops where you can buy gifts for relatives.  Of particular interest are grocery stores where you can buy national dishes, cheeses, sherry, sangria and traditional Spanish drinks. </p><h2>  Checkin Pineda 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I certainly want to pay attention to the reviews of vacationers who have recently visited it.  Checkin Pineda (Pineda de Mar) 3 * is a budget hotel on the coast of the famous resort. </p><p>  The complex has a good location, being a five to seven minute walk from the beach and the railway station.  According to vacationers, the hotel has completely different rooms.  If you are not lucky and you were placed in apartments that you do not like, then at the reception you can always solve this issue.  Most of the rooms are spacious and decorated in a classic style.  Furniture and plumbing are good and in good condition.  Quality cleaning is done daily.  Linens and towels are not washed and regularly change according to the schedule.  The apartments have a TV, but, unfortunately, there are no Russian channels in the list of programs. </p><p>  As for the service staff, it is worthy of all praise.  The maids are always friendly and smiling, doing their job perfectly.  Reception workers are also very helpful in the settlement and are ready to help in the future if you need anything. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, the hotel does not have a left-luggage office.  And she is often needed: if you, for example, are going to leave later than the appointed time, then the bags can be left near the reception.  During check-in, duty officers settle very quickly, even if you arrive late at night. </p><p>  Checkin Pineda 3 * (Pineda de Mar) offers its guests excellent food.  Local chefs cook tasty and satisfying, it is noticeable that they are trying hard.  Of course, there is no restaurant variety of dishes on the menu, but it is difficult to set such requirements for a three-star hotel.  Guests of the complex have the right to choose an acceptable food option: half board or full board. </p><p>  There is also the opportunity to take advantage of All Inclusive.  However, experienced tourists are not advised to purchase such tours, because there is no that familiar understanding of "all inclusive", which we are used to in Turkey and Egypt.  Anyway, certain restrictions will be imposed.  For example, bartenders pour drinks very reluctantly.  Therefore, in this hotel it makes no sense to pay "all inclusive".  For those vacationers who love to travel, half board is an ideal option. </p><p>  The beach is not far from the hotel, to reach it, it will take no more than seven minutes.  The local coast is very clean and well equipped.  On the way to the beach there are many cafes, restaurants and shops.  Near the hotel there is an excellent supermarket where you can buy groceries.  In general, the city is full of interesting places to wander around. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has a children's and adult pool with a well-equipped relaxation area.  There is a mini club and a playground for children.  There is very little animation in the daytime, but in the evenings there are daily entertaining shows and shows.  The territory of the complex is clean and well maintained.  The hotel itself is not new, but it is clear that they are trying to maintain it in a normal, well-groomed condition. </p><p>  According to tourists, the hotel is sometimes very noisy in the evenings due to music coming from the street.  Yes, and in the rooms themselves the insulation is very poor, the walls between the rooms are very thin, sounds are heard in the corridor and the neighboring apartments.  The most noisy rooms are those that overlook the pool.  This is not surprising, since adults and children squeak during the day, and entertainment programs take place in the evenings.  But in such rooms a beautiful view and large terraces, all this compensates for certain disadvantages. </p><p>  Most of the guests are Europeans (French, Germans, English).  There are very few of our compatriots.  Sometimes large groups of children or people with disabilities come to the hotel. </p><p>  Experienced tourists are certainly advised to diversify a beach holiday and devote part of their time to trips to neighboring cities.  A must-see place should be Barcelona.  This stunning city with incredible fountains is worthy of attention. </p>
