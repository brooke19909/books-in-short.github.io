    <h2>  Increased comfort </h2><p>  As you can already understand, the Royal Apollonia Beach 5 hotel, reviews of which will be considered a little later, provides literally all the services that you may need at any time on vacation.  But that is not all.  If a person needs a safe, then he will be provided with him.  Need to buy something from the products?  No problem, there are various shops on site.  Can't the guests smell tobacco?  Then they will be accommodated in non-smoking rooms!  For guests who like to smoke a cigarette or two, there are separate places designed for this.  If a guest has limited physical abilities, then a room with amenities for guests with such features will be specially offered for him.  And the last thing I would like to note is heating.  Yes, rooms at this hotel can be heated! </p><h2>  Sociability </h2><p>  By the way, another interesting point should be noted regarding the service at this hotel.  The staff, which has already been mentioned several very voluminous phrases that characterize it on the good side, speaks four languages, among which there is Russian.  Also, employees can talk in French, English and, of course, in Greek.  Everyone knows how hard it is for guests from another country when they find themselves in a different language environment.  It is quite difficult to navigate in a place where everything is somehow called, not in Russian.  Royal Apollonia Beach 5 understands this, which is why the staff speaks four languages.  By the way, many visitors say that a lot of Russians are resting in the hotel.  And this is a clear sign that this place really deserves attention. </p>
