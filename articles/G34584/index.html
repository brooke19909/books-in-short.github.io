Bank Card Fraud Types</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sberbank takes care of the protection of bank cards.  But he can not 100% protect customers from the activities of scammers.  Employees of the bank and government agencies regularly encounter requests from customers who have lost money from a Sberbank card.  In order not to become a victim of scams, you need to know the tricks of modern scammers.  Ways to protect Sberbank cards are presented in the article. </p><h2>  Methods of stealing funds from a credit card </h2><p>  Every year, new schemes for deceiving Sberbank customers appear, as more than 70 million Russians use the issuer's cards.  What are the theft methods? </p><ol><li>  Internet theft, or phishing. </li><li>  Carding, in particular, skimming. </li><li>  Phone Fraud.  Calls to cardholders are implied. </li><li>  Theft of funds from plastic proximity cards. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="realnoevremya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to steal money from a card" class="if uuid-3238154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3238154.jpg"></div><p>  Scammers can use one or more options.  If you suspect a possible attempt on personal data or Sberbank card funds, it is recommended to contact employees, check the credit card balance or issue a reissue. </p><h2>  Phishing - what is it?  Protection methods </h2><p>  The term "phishing" comes from English <em>fishing,</em> that is, "fishing".  The meaning of the words is identical: the hunt for prey, which for fraudsters is a bank card of Sberbank clients.  In the banking sector, the meaning of the word is a type of fraud in which cardholders become victims in the process of using any Internet resources. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sberbank credit cards (Visa Gold, Master Card) become an object for scammers more often than debit ones.  Only every third owner uses a credit card limit, and 98% of Russians withdraw cash from debit cards. </p><p>  How to steal money from the card during the phishing process: </p><ol><li>  Through social networks. </li><li>  Using sites free ads. </li><li>  Email spamming. </li><li>  Theft and use of Internet banking passwords. </li></ol><h2>  Social Media Scams </h2><p>  The kidnappers hack into customer accounts by sending a notification to friends.  In the message, they ask you to transfer cash to their account or card as a debt.  The scheme is valid for 15-60 minutes, but during this time scammers can turn to 30 or more contacts. </p><p>  Clients or relatives often notify that their page has been hacked.  But some acquaintances do not understand that a fraudster communicates with them on behalf of a friend, and they willingly transfer from 500 rubles to 10,000 "in debt." </p><div class="photo" data-original="r.search.yahoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank credit card visa gold" class="if uuid-3238141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3238141.jpg"></div><p>  The problem also lies in the fact that after the fact of fraud is discovered, deceived acquaintances may demand to return the debt from the person to whom they allegedly transferred cash. </p><h2>  Financial scammers in the world of ad sites </h2><p>  When selling or buying a product, service, Sberbank card holders may encounter Internet fraudsters.  After placing the advertisement, they insist on transferring the advance payment or the entire amount, often offering 2-3 times more, to the client‚Äôs card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lost money from a sberbank card" class="if uuid-3238140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3238140.jpg"></div><p>  After receiving the card number, they try to enter Sberbank Online, convincing the owner of the need to say the codes sent via SMS.  If the client agrees to provide information, from all his accounts within 2-5 minutes the money will be debited to the scammers. </p><h2>  E-mail card thief scheme </h2><p>  Upon receiving a letter with a malicious code, Sberbank customers may lose their credit card information immediately after clicking on the link.  Internet burglars are encrypted under well-known brands, banks, utilities and government agencies to arouse the trust of the recipient. </p><p>  Sometimes following a link is not enough to lose money from a Sberbank card.  There are cases when citizens transferred payment to the "fake" tax service or mobile operators. </p><h2>  Access Online Banking </h2><p>  Having obtained in any way the data for entering Sberbank Online, the scammers are trying to transfer all the clients' money to their accounts.  But this type of fraud does not work if there is no access to the current mobile phone number.  On it, the cardholder receives one-time passwords to confirm transfers. </p><p>  As soon as a fraudster gains access to a mobile number or a client voluntarily provides him with such information, money is immediately debited from the client‚Äôs credit card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to protect against phishing </h2><p>  Methods of theft using phishing are constantly updated.  To prevent unauthorized debiting of funds from the Sberbank card, you should: </p><ol><li>  Exercise caution when making transactions on the Internet.  Payment of vouchers, goods, services only after confirmation of the fact of the transaction: conclusion of the contract on the official website of the supplier. </li><li>  Do not provide personal data (full name, phone) to strangers.  If the owner of the credit card tells the card number to scammers, they can try to log in to Sberbank Online using the registration method on the site (without receiving a login in the terminal). </li><li>  Do not give passwords from number 900. Scammers can be introduced by anyone, including relatives and bank employees, requiring them to tell the codes to confirm the transfer.  It is recommended to ignore calls from suspicious persons and in no case call one-time passwords. </li></ol><h2>  Carding, or How scammers steal at ATMs </h2><p>  Carding is a method of stealing data or money from a credit card, in which the transaction is performed using a payment instrument or its data.  The term has a broad designation, including the more common concept in Russia - skimming. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.toledoblade.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card fraud statement" class="if uuid-3238188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3238188.jpg"></div><p>  Theft of data or funds on a bank card using special equipment for self-service devices is called skimming. </p><p>  How the circuit works: </p><ul><li>  a fraudster installs a fake, camera, or other method of obtaining data or the credit card on the device; </li><li>  the client performs the operation without noticing the trick; </li><li>  a scammer gains access to data, money or a plastic card. </li></ul><p>  Sberbank Visa Gold credit card is one of the most popular goals for skimming installers.  The limit of up to 600 thousand rubles allows attackers to rely on a solid jackpot in case of a successful scheme. </p><p>  Depending on the type of carding, the owner of a credit card may face: </p><ol><li>  With an overlay on the panel for entering a PIN code. </li><li>  Magnetic stripe reader.  The patch is installed on the card reader - the place where the Sberbank bank card is inserted. </li><li>  The camera.  In this case, the abductors receive the credit card information, which allows you to make a copy of the payment instrument and enter the PIN code set by the client. </li></ol><h2>  How to protect yourself from carding? </h2><p>  Using ATMs and terminals outside the bank's service area is one of the types of risk for credit card holders.  Attackers who prefer carding as access to bank cards, in 9 out of 10 cases, choose machines that are remote from the offices of Sberbank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="read-protection card case" class="if uuid-3238185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3238185.jpg"></div><p>  This increases the chances of success: there is no protection near such terminals, and customers are forced to use the services of the machine, since the nearest device is located at a distance of at least 300 meters.  One of the ways to protect a Sberbank card from carding is to use a credit card only in terminals near branches. </p><p>  In order for the money from the Sberbank card not to be lost due to skimming, you should: </p><ol><li>  Give preference to new ATMs.  The bank's system is regularly updated, and fraudsters need time to come up with a fake for the new terminal interface. </li><li>  Pay attention to the card reader, camera and panel for entering a PIN code.  If there are suspicious details on the device, the paint is leaving, the bank signs are incorrectly located, there are noticeable differences from other terminals, you should not risk a credit card. </li><li>  Use your hand to cover the numbers while entering the PIN code.  This will protect the camera from reading information and the ability to find out information to other clients. </li><li>  Block a credit card in case of suspicion of skimming.  To perform the operation, you should call 900 or block in Sberbank Online. </li></ol><h2>  Card Fraud by Phone </h2><p>  The Internet is not necessary for obtaining information on the card: attackers can deceive citizens using a mobile or home phone number of customers.  The protection of the Sberbank card in this case completely depends on the activities of the owner, since the fraud is built on the trust of citizens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.maybank.com.ph" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="visa sberbank" class="if uuid-3238183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3238183.jpg"></div><p>  Variant of the scheme: an alleged employee of Sberbank calls the client and offers favorable conditions for the deposit.  For this, the owner must provide the card details and code so that the manager confirms the identity of the client.  After receiving the information, the false employee requires a password to be used to "transfer" money to the deposit at the maximum rate. </p><p>  With this scheme, fraudsters do not care if the card of a Sberbank client is Visa or MasterCard.  They are ready to transfer cash if they get access to the Internet bank.  This requires a card number, password and verification codes. </p><p>  In fact, the client himself informs the attackers about the data, hoping for profit or other favorable conditions (a loan with a reduced rate). </p><h2>  How to protect the card from scammers? </h2><p>  Keeping track of cybercriminals using a telephone is difficult because they use one-time numbers.  If the fraudster called the credit card holder before the money from the Sberbank card was lost, you should: </p><ul><li>  refuse all offers that require registration by phone or via online banking.  Sberbank managers call and invite to the office, rather than inviting cardholders to buy banking products by phone; </li><li>  Do not disclose personal information, data of documents or cards, do not give the address of registration or residence; </li><li>  specify from which office the employee is calling and his full name  If the real employee of Sberbank is in touch, he should introduce himself by stating the position and number of the additional office.  The swindler is unlikely to be able to correctly indicate the branch or refuses to continue the conversation. </li><li>  stop chatting.  The best way to avoid contact and save a bank card. </li></ul><h2>  How to steal cash from contactless cards? </h2><p>  It is more difficult to save money for cardholders with payment without entering a PIN code.  There is a device that allows you to write off money from a credit card when contacting at a distance of 1-10 cm. </p><p>  Such a scheme is used by fraudsters in the subway, buses, minibuses, where there is always close contact between passengers.  Approaching the victim, the attacker expects 1-5 seconds to be written off.  After the theft, as a rule, the scammer leaves the vehicle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mybroadband.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="by what methods is the theft of funds" class="if uuid-3238186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3238186.jpg"></div><p>  How to save cash on a contactless credit card: </p><ol><li>  Purchase a read-only card case.  Its cost is 500-1500 rubles.  It does not allow you to pay without entering a PIN code and thus protects cash on the card. </li><li>  Do not carry the means of payment in the pocket of a shirt, jacket or trousers, the compartments on the front of the bag.  The best places to store bank cards are in wallets inside the bag, under other things of the client.  If you need quick access to a means of payment, it is better to put it in the back pocket of your luggage, zipped up. </li><li>  Do not lean on the card storage area with other passengers.  If it is impossible to completely avoid contact, you need to make sure that no one tries to get closer to the credit card at a distance closer than 10 cm. </li><li>  Transfer money from card to account through online banking.  This will solve all the problems, since with this method of fraud it is impossible to steal cash from a deposit or savings account. </li></ol><h2>  Missing money from Sberbank card: what to do?  Instruction manual </h2><p>  If you could not save cash on a credit card, you should: </p><ul><li>  block and reissue a card; </li><li>  write a statement to the police; </li><li>  contact the office of Sberbank. </li></ul><p>  Blocking is the first thing a victim should do.  If the card is active, an attacker could try again to complete the operation.  After blocking you should reissue a credit card.  The operation is available at the bank‚Äôs office, in Sberbank Online, a mobile application, using SMS services and a contact center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="penzanews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank card protection" class="if uuid-3238151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3238151.jpg"></div><p>  To draw up a complaint at a bank branch, a client must first write a bank card fraud statement.  The document is issued by the police.  A passport, card, application for opening an account or an agreement is required. </p><p>  When compiling a statement on the fact of fraud, the cardholder must detail the terms of the scam, describe the amount of damage.  With a copy of the document you need to visit the branch of Sberbank. </p><p>  Managers will help draw up a refund request and advise on the timing of the review.  In 67% of cases, the bank returns cash if the client immediately asked for a solution to the problem. </p><p>  Refusal to return funds is possible if the bank has suspicions about the honesty of the card holder or does not fulfill financial obligations (has delayed loans). </p>
