Kazan, where she is located, opened it with the aim of training qualified personnel.  There is <span>a railway</span> since August 2007. It is located on the territory of the Lebyazhye forest park zone. </p><h2>  History of the opening of the road </h2><p>  A proposal for the construction of a children's railway in Kazan came from Russian Railways in early 2004. The project was planned to coincide with the 1000th anniversary of the capital of Tatarstan.  Until 2005, a place was chosen.  There were two options: in the Gorky park or near Lake Lebyazhye. </p><p>  In March 2005, the preparation of project documentation began.  The deadline for putting the facility into operation was set for 2006. Then the date changed to 2007. It was planned to manufacture five passenger trains and three diesel locomotives, of which one was supposed to be a battery electric locomotive. </p>
