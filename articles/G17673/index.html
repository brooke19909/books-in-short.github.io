They are proud of their culture and traditions, even despite the fact that the worldview and lifestyle of the islanders are very different.  For example, in the north of Cyprus, Turkish culture, customs, cuisine dominate, Islam is practiced here.  The peoples of the south adhere to Greek traditions, national dishes, lifestyles, Orthodoxy.  So if you decide to go to the New Year in Cyprus, it is better to visit the Orthodox areas. </p><h2>  Christmas and New Year in Cyprus </h2>

    <p>  If you plan to come to Cyprus on <span>New Year's holidays</span> and at the same time celebrate Christmas, then consider that the Cypriots are Catholics.  Christmas is celebrated on December 25th.  Accordingly, it is better to come to the island in advance, at least on the 23rd.  In Nicosia, a Christmas tree is being set up on Eleftherias Square on December 1, and a festive spirit has been hanging here for a month.  If you came to Cyprus on New Year's Eve, you can admire the beauties of pre-holiday Nicosia, rising above the city in a balloon.  Its pier can be found on the Venetian wall. </p><p>  Unlike European countries where most businesses do not work at Christmas, many restaurants and cafes are open in Cyprus.  Fascinating programs featuring artists are featured here.  On December 25, everyone gives each other a variety of gifts, unpacking holiday boxes that were prepared the day before. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before Christmas, a poinsetia blooms in Cyprus.  This flower is called the <span>"Star of Bethlehem."</span>  Very often they decorate their homes, as well as traditional spruce.  Christmas December 25 opens a whole series of New Year holidays.  New Year is celebrated, as in Russia, on January 1. </p><h2>  How to celebrate?  Traditions of the local population </h2><p>  On Christmas Eve, Christmas Eve, children singing from everywhere: they congratulate everyone and they sing carols.  This tradition has been around for hundreds of years.  Caroling is supposed to give gifts, pre-cooked sweets. </p>

    <p>  On December 25, all believers go to the service, take communion there, wish each other good, congratulate them on the holiday, and then go home to the festive table.  There is a tradition - to enter the house from the right foot, then the whole year will be successful.  So Christmas opens a whole series of holidays, the next of which is the New Year. </p><p>  For all tourists who visited <span>Cyprus</span> during this period <span>, their</span> New Year's <span>holiday</span> will remain in their memory for a long time.  Indeed, they will have incendiary dances, bright fireworks, various dishes and a symbol of celebration - Agios Vasilis, he also presents gifts to children.  Yes, that‚Äôs exactly the name of the local holiday host.  Cypriots are not waiting for Santa Claus, not Santa Claus, but Vasilisa.  Who is this?  The grandfather's prototype was St. Basil - Archbishop of Caesarea of ‚Äã‚ÄãCappadocia.  On New Year's Day is celebrated.  He lived hundreds of years ago.  Throughout his righteous life he helped the poor, built hospitals, schools, shelters, and even created a charity village.  He performed, in a word, charitable deeds.  After death, he was canonized.  No wonder now he is a symbol of justice and kindness. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dishes served to the table </h2>

    <p>  There is a legend that during the time of persecution of Christians, local residents gave them to Vasilis to save their savings.  When the threat receded, he rolled all the coins into the dough and distributed the baked buns to the poor.  And the tradition to bake Vasilopitou for the New Year was preserved.  The owner of the house cuts it and distributes it to all gathered guests.  Anyone who gets a piece of a coin will be the happiest.  Another piece of the cake should be taken to the church and distributed to all the poor. </p><p>  Once in Cyprus on New Year's Eve, you should not miss the opportunity to try all the traditional holiday dishes of the Cypriots.  In the Christmas holidays, every housewife except Vasilopita prepares a <span>Christmas cake</span> - with dried fruits, nuts, orange zest.  They also bake melomacaron from sweets - these are delicious cookies with honey, as well as kurabies - almonds, sprinkled with sweet powder. </p><p>  <span>Christmas turkey</span> is the main course.  It is baked on charcoal, stuffed with fruits, raisins and served with potatoes or vegetables.  Also traditional on the Christmas table here are kleftika - a meat dish, aphelion - pork in red wine, moussaka - a vegetable casserole with minced meat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What is the weather in Cyprus for the New Year </h2>

    <p>  At the beginning of the year, fairly cool weather is established in Cyprus, they don‚Äôt come here to enjoy a beach holiday.  In the afternoon, the temperature reaches only +14 ... + 15 <sup></sup> , the water in the sea is also cold - only +17 degrees.  So the weather in Cyprus on the New Year is good for those who want to just have fun, plunge into the atmosphere of the holiday, go to museums, go on excursions.  For these purposes, the temperature is quite comfortable.  If in the summer, because of the heat, rarely anyone wants to go on long excursions, then the <span>winter vacation</span> is the time for this.  A ski resort in the Troodos mountains was popular in January: the snow cover allows skiing and snowboarding here.  Do not forget only about the bright sun: be sure to grab a protective cream and glasses. </p><h2>  Cyprus Resorts </h2>
