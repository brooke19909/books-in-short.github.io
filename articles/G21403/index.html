Someone prefers vacuum ("plugs"), and someone chooses full-size models.  Given their abundance in the market, it is very difficult for the average user to decide.  In addition, most buyers want to get a good sound, giving their money.  Of course, no one wants to pay money, but in the end "enjoy" a low-quality product.  Therefore, in the article we will analyze the best <span>large headphones</span> and their advantages over the "gags". </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of Big Headphones </h2><p>  Of course, there are those who disagree, but big headphones have many advantages over vacuum ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù: </p><ul><li>  They have a large aperture, due to which the music sounds louder, deeper and more voluminous.  Their smaller brothers have a maximum diameter of 9 mm, while they have 30 mm or more.  It is safe to say that the sound in them will be much better (Chinese "crafts" do not count). </li><li>  Larger earphones are more comfortable and do less harm to the eardrum.  Due to the design, the diaphragm is located far from the hearing organs, which can not be said about the ‚Äúgoggles‚Äù that have to be placed directly in the auricle. </li><li>  They are distinguished by good sound insulation.  By the way, large <span>headphones for a phone</span> or computer do much better with external sounds.  Even cheap models boast this feature. </li></ul><p>  The disadvantages of large headphones are also many, and the main among them is the size.  They are much larger than the "plugs", therefore, carry them less convenient.  However, this drawback will not be relevant for all users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, highlighting the key strengths and weaknesses, take a look at which of the large headphones can be considered the best. </p><h2>  PHILIPS FIDELIO X2 </h2>

    <p>  An excellent model of headphones from a well-known manufacturer that will definitely satisfy the demands of audiophiles.  FIDELIO X2 fixes the flaws of the previous version, adds the ability to change the ear pads.  The main plus of the headphones is a deep, clear sound.  They cope with almost any frequency, give a good bass and reliable sound of musical instruments.  It is better to listen from a personal computer or a high-quality player in order to feel all their power. </p><p>  We used high-quality manufacturing materials, which is not surprising for the flagship model.  Thanks to them, these large headphones sit well, do not crush.  The only negative that can be distinguished is the open type.  You hear others well, and they know about your musical preferences. </p><h2>  BEATS STUDIO 2 </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="big earphones for phone" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1438357.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Great model from a well-known brand.  They can be connected via a wireless interface, which makes them a great option for use with a smartphone. </p><p>  Of course, the first thing you pay attention to is appearance.  And he is amazing.  In principle, as with other Beats models, Studio 2 is distinguished by its versatility - they can be used without and with a wire.  Attention is drawn to the generous equipment, which makes it clear that the user bought an expensive thing.  Have these big earphones and good noise reduction. </p><p>  Of the minuses - the price.  Despite all the advantages, the cost of the model is too high, which is facilitated by the brand and proper marketing of the company. </p><h2>  SENNHEISER HD 201 </h2>

    <p>  The named company is able to please music lovers by releasing cheap headphones with good sound and design.  They are made full-size, with a closed design.  Despite the budget, they sound good.  It is quite loud, deep and saturated.  There is, of course, not enough bass, but this minus cannot be called fatal.  The style of the model is also quite good.  He is not too striking, but not quite faded.  The large headphones described are pleasing and convenient, which allows them to stay in them for a long time. </p><p>  The disadvantages include low sensitivity and a short wire.  If you take into account the price, then you quickly forget about the shortcomings. </p>
