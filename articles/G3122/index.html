IPhone, like other mobile gadgets, has a predefined number of standard sounds.  Any of them can be set to alert various events, such as SMS, notifications or incoming calls.  But many people prefer to listen to their favorite melody during a call.  In the iPhone, the installation of third-party sounds is slightly different from other phones.  There are some nuances in this process.  You can get detailed instructions on how to put a ringtone on an iPhone, and also find out all the possible ways by reading this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to put a ringtone on iPhone via iTunes?" class="if uuid-2942289" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2942289.jpg"></div><h2>  Installation methods </h2><p>  There are various ways to create and install ringtones on your phone.  In ordinary smartphones, it is enough to transfer the melody via Wi-Fi, transfer it from the computer through the program for synchronization, or simply download it from the Internet.  The process of creating and setting a ringtone for a call in iPhones is slightly different.  There are several ways to put your favorite ringtone on Apple gadgets.  You can buy a ringtone in the store, create it yourself, or use the standard application for synchronizing your iPhone and computer - iTunes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ringtone preparation </h2><p>  How to put a ringtone on an iPhone and set the music to ring?  In order for the phone to recognize and play a passage of a song during a call, you must first convert it.  As you know, ringtones in such smartphones should be of a special format - m4r.  Such files are smaller due to special data compression methods.  In addition, compression loss is minimal.  That is why they are considered the best ringtones for iPhone phones. </p><h2>  Third party programs </h2><p>  How to set any ringtone to your iPhone ringtone?  One way is to use special applications for editing music files.  It can be such famous programs as Wave Editor or Audacity.  Any of them can be downloaded free of charge on the Internet.  Open the necessary file in the program, select the passage you like and cut the song.  After that, save the melody in MP3 format.  Next, the file must be converted to M4R.  To do this, you can also download a third-party application or convert online on a website. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="create ringtone" class="if uuid-2942280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2942280.jpg"></div><p>  You can also go the simpler way.  In this case, you need to download a program that can create and convert ringtones to the desired format for the iPhone.  For example, NowSmart Cut.  It is also free and available for download.  After the melody is created and transformed, it must be transferred to the phone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Web search </h2><p>  How to put a ringtone on iPhone via iTunes?  If you do not want to waste time cutting and converting melodies, you can download the finished ringtone in m4r format.  To do this, follow these steps: </p><ul><li>  Create the appropriate query in the search engine. </li><li>  Listen and choose your favorite segment. </li><li>  Download the music file. </li><li>  Then transfer the sound to iTunes and save to iPhone. </li></ul><h2>  Phone Sync </h2><p>  Earlier, in older versions of iTunes, in order for an iPhone to recognize a ringtone, it was necessary to perform a large number of actions.  Now with the update these steps are no longer necessary.  To add an already converted melody to an iPhone, it is recommended to do the following: </p><ul><li>  Open iTunes. </li><li>  Connect your phone via USB cable or Wi-Fi. </li><li>  Go to the "Sounds" tab in the pop-up menu of the phone in the program. </li><li>  Transfer the finished sound file by holding down the right mouse button. </li></ul><p>  After performing these steps, the selected melody will appear in the list of phone ringtones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="List of ringtones in iPhone." class="if uuid-2942258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2942258.jpg"></div><h2>  Buy ringtones </h2><p>  How to put a ringtone on iPhone via iTunes?  If you do not want to set one of the standard sounds available in the iPhone by default, this method can be simple and useful.  The iTunes Store has a huge catalog of tunes created by both professionals and amateurs.  After downloading one of them, you can change your ringtone to 8-bit performance of any song you like.  For example, the Game of Thrones theme or the Hedwig's Theme rock ballads from the Harry Potter series. </p><p>  To buy a ringtone, launch iTunes and go to the ‚ÄúStore‚Äù tab.  Next you will see the sorted tunes, select your favorite and make a purchase.  The cost of such a ringtone is low. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="ITunes ringtone catalog." class="if uuid-2942276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2942276.jpg"></div><h2>  ITunes </h2><p>  However, if you don‚Äôt want to pay for a 40 second passage of the song, there is a way to add new sounds to your phone for free.  How to put a ringtone for iPhone using iTunes?  To do this, you must use the program installed on the computer.  In it you can add the necessary melody you like, convert it to a ringtone and subsequently set it to a call.  Below, we‚Äôll look at several ways to put a ringtone on an iPhone via iTunes, depending on the software version.  To find out which release of the program is installed on your computer, you need to click the "Help" context menu and select "About iTunes." </p><h2>  Creating a sound file </h2><p>  How to put a ringtone on iPhone via iTunes?  You can convert any song or sound clip to a ringtone in a few simple steps.  Here is a detailed instruction on how to put a ringtone on an iPhone via iTunes: </p><ol><li>  Run the program. </li><li>  Check the version and update it if necessary. </li><li>  In the list of songs, right-click on the melody and select "Song Information".  If the required track is not in the iTunes library, click "File" - "Add File to Library." </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Information about the song." class="if uuid-2942271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2942271.jpg"></div><ol><li>  In the pop-up window, select the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab. </li><li>  Set the start time and end time to create a section of the song that you want to set as a ringtone.  Make sure the ringtone lasts no more than 40 seconds.  If you use other methods, for example, create a sound file for a call by third-party programs, you can make the passage longer.  Although most often this is not necessary, since usually almost everyone picks up the phone after a few seconds.  And such a long melody will not have time to lose completely. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Creating a piece of melody." class="if uuid-2942273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2942273.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Right click on the song.  Then click on "File" in the context menu.  From the drop-down list, select "Convert" - "Create version in AAC format."  At this point, iTunes automatically extracts the specified part of the melody that you marked in the previous step.  After that, the ringtone will appear in the library. </li><li>  Next, you need to right-click and select "Show in Windows Explorer."  Thus, you will find the converted melody in m4a format. </li><li>  Rename the file extension from m4a to m4r. </li><li>  Next, you need to transfer the resulting ringtone to the iTunes sound library.  To do this, select "Add file to library" in the "File" context menu. </li><li>  Sync iPhone. </li></ol><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Many users who purchase an iPhone do not want to set new ringtones instead of standard ringtones, since they think that it is difficult and time-consuming.  In fact, as follows from the above, there are a lot of ways.  And if you look, there is nothing complicated in this process.  Choosing the most suitable for yourself is not difficult.  Whether you decide to create ringtones yourself in iTunes, whether you use third-party programs, download on the Internet or purchase a ready-made melody in the store, it does not matter.  Regardless of the method chosen, as a result, you can implement your plan and enjoy a beautiful melody during an incoming call.  And after reading this article, now you know all the ways to put a ringtone on an iPhone via iTunes. </p>
