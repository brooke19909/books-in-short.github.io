At that time, Empress Catherine II ruled.  By her decree, the customs, which stood at the mouth of the Temernik River, were rebuilt into a fortress, calling it Rostov.  Due to its convenient location and foreign merchants, the economic level has grown rapidly here. </p><p>  In 1863, the districts of Rostov-on-Don became subordinate to the <span>Region of the Don Army.</span>  However, already in 1920, Soviet power was established in the territory.  After that, industry began to appear in the city.  In 1927 the largest factory was built - Rostselmash.  A little later in the city there will be a chemical enterprise and metalworking industry.  Such a rapid growth of industry led to the fact that Rostov began to quickly turn into a large center, which, of course, contributed to its economic development.  At present, large areas of Rostov-on-Don are Kirovsky, Voroshilovsky, Zheleznodorozhny, Leninsky and others, which we will describe in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostov-on-Don regions" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1190598.jpg" width="600"></div>
