She has been engaged in the production of electronics, game consoles and various high-tech products for a long time.  In addition to the manufacturer of gadgets, the company is a media conglomerate.  But we'll talk about Sony Xperia smartphones.  The lineup of these gadgets has been known since 2012 and has already presented users with a huge number of high-quality devices. </p><h2>  Who are they? </h2><p>  Previously, Xperia was a separate trademark, which in 2008 launched the first gadget.  Then it was Sony Ericsson with the Windows Mobile operating system.  Initially, it was under the control of such an OS that smartphones of this line were to be produced.  But in 2010, the announcement of a device with the Android OS took place. </p><p>  After the success of the Xperia X10, it was decided to leave the idea with Windows Mobile.  By May last year, 56 smartphones of this line were released.  In its devices, the company is trying to create the maximum number of proprietary features and applications.  All models have preinstalled programs that extend the options of the smartphone.  Thanks to them, the use becomes more comfortable.  Of course, such a marketing technique allows you to keep the buyer near you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia lineup" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1549155.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The lineup of Sony Xperia replenished every year.  The company has grown this line and created several generations of smartphones.  In addition to updating the operating system, branded applications also improved. </p><p>  At first glance, the Sony Xperia line seems perfect.  Everything seems to be finished and quite perfect.  Each model improves the previous one.  In fact, everything is somewhat different. </p><h2>  Distributions </h2><p>  Fans of the brand know that depending on the letter, you can determine which group the smartphone belongs to.  For example, Sony Xperia Z is a flagship lineup.  E are budget devices.  C - are the middle group, which focuses on the front.  M - a line of phones protected from moisture.  Series X also appeared this summer, but we'll talk about it a bit later. </p><h2>  Those that are cheaper </h2><p>  So, the Sony Xperia launches a range of budget devices.  Roughly, these smartphones cost from 9-15 thousand rubles.  This includes phones with the E index. Among others, the Sony Xperia E4 model stands out most.  It was released in several variations.  The screen has 5 inches and a low resolution of 560 x 940 pixels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lineup sony xperia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1549161.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There were also models with a 4.7-inch display.  All phones in this segment are powered by Android.  Some of them have support for two SIM cards.  On average, these are phones that have 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of internal memory.  They also have an 8 megapixel main camera and a 5 megapixel front camera.  Otherwise, this line is unremarkable.  Such phones are suitable for those who need a good high-quality ‚Äúdialer‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Between heaven and earth </h2><p>  The next lineup of Sony Xperia has indices M and C. These are average smartphones that can not be attributed to either budget or flagship.  Therefore, they occupy such a place in the Sony niche.  The most popular models here are <span>Sony Xperia M4 Aqua</span> and its "twin", but with two SIM cards. </p><p>  This model has a 5-inch display with a good resolution of 1280 x 720. The RAM here is still 1 GB.  But the built-in choice: either 8 or 16 GB.  In these models, there is also an improved 13MP main camera.  The main feature of this line was certified protection against dust and moisture.  Later, models with the M5 index were released.  They turned out to be quite high quality, therefore they are more likely to be flagships. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia z lineup" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1549157.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Also, the Sony Xperia model range of mid-range phones is occupied by devices with the C index. These include the Sony Xperia C4 models and, again, the dual-SIM ‚Äútwin‚Äù.  They also have a five inch screen.  Its resolution has improved to 1920 x 1080 pixels.  There is more RAM here - 2 GB.  The internal is 16 GB, but there is a slot for a memory card. </p><p>  The trouble was the company's lie about these devices.  Initially, they were positioned as selfie smartphones.  But in reality it turned out that the front camera is 5 megapixels, which is a rather mediocre indicator for the current time.  So it is safe to say that the Japanese are dishonest and cunning marketing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Champions </h2><p>  Well, at the end of last year and the beginning of this, the Sony Xperia had a range of flagships.  Of course, such a name is quite loud.  The thing is that some models of this line practically do not differ from the middle segment.  Here the Japanese trick is already manifest.  The company believes that the user should overpay for the brand. </p><p>  Nevertheless, in this lineup there were still real champions.  The most famous are devices with the Z index. In general, the history of this line is very dramatic.  It all started with the Sony Xperia Z, along with the Z1 and Z Ultra.  The Z Compact was later released.  These smartphones have become a real ‚Äúboom‚Äù in the market.  They really turned out to be very strong, high-quality and, of course, stylish. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia phone lineup" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1549160.jpg"></div>

    <p>  But the Sony Xperia lineup could not work without flaws.  And the company began to release a new series almost every month.  Following were presented Z2, Z3, Z4 (only in Japan) and, finally, Z5.  The main failure turned out to be that correcting the previous mistakes, the developers made the following.  Therefore, there were more and more dissatisfied.  Fans were waiting for the perfect series smartphone.  But they did not wait. </p><p>  As practice shows, the most successful of all was the Sony Xperia Z3 Plus.  It is this model in Japan called the Z4.  The diagonal of the device has increased relative to other models to 5.2 inches.  The smartphone was endowed with as much as 3 GB of RAM, also launched on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 platform. They left protection from dust and moisture. </p><p>  For those who required a larger display, the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra was introduced.  The device has a 6-inch screen, very thin frames.  Both cameras received 13 megapixels.  RAM 2 GB, built-in - 16 GB. </p><h2>  Innovations </h2><p>  Five years have passed since the moment the Sony Ericsson Xperia lineup was established.  After all the setbacks, the company decided to release an updated line of X. These devices marked the rebirth of smartphones from Sony.  They turned out really very successful, but also very expensive.  The youngest device here is considered the Sony Xperia XA. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony ericsson xperia lineup" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1549159.jpg"></div>

    <p>  This device has opened a new round of concern development.  Many believe that the main feature of the new gadgets from the Japanese is the appearance.  Many smartphones in this line have received mirrored panels, which looks very nice.  Also moved some buttons, narrowed the screen frames, redid the back panel.  The Xperia XA Ultra was later released. </p><p>  The second smartphone of this line was the Sony Xperia X. This is a five-inch phone.  There is an option for one SIM card, there are two.  Resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels.  The camera has become already 23 megapixels with a proprietary module, which are now used by other companies.  The front-end received 13 megapixels, which is also quite a lot. </p><p>  The processor has as many as 6 cores and runs on a Snapdragon 650. Adreno 510 is responsible for the graphics. All this works quickly, thanks to 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal memory.  Also, the Japanese did not miss the fashion on the fingerprint scanner.  It is located on the side power button. </p><p>  Another interesting object of this line was the Sony Xperia X Performance.  It was equipped with a very strong processor and graphics chipset.  Also placed 3 GB of RAM.  The phone runs on the new Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow OS.  He also has two cameras: the main - 23 megapixels, the front - 13 megapixels.  There are models that support two SIM cards.  The main feature of this model is its appearance, which is very attractive and unusual relative to others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony ericsson xperia lineup photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1549158.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Total </h2><p>  The company has come a long way.  Already few remember the old Sony Ericsson Xperia (lineup).  Photos of some devices are even hard to find on the Internet.  Nevertheless, many remember the Sony Ericsson Xperia X10, which was very popular and at one time was a real flagship.  Famous <span>Sony Ericsson Xperia Ray</span> with an improved screen and compact design. </p><p>  Now on the market there are a huge number of smartphones from Sony.  Their Xperia lineup is a whole story that will be replenished with new flagships, perhaps not always successful, but definitely sensational and popular. </p>
