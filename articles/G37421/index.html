After all, it really looks more like a real sea, and not like an artificial pond!  The reservoir was created in the years 1967-1970.  The dam of the <span>Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric station</span> was able to block the channel of one of the largest and most full-flowing rivers of Russia - the Yenisei.  And it occupies a reservoir second place in Russia in terms of full-flow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnoyarsk reservoir" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1170943.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Briefly about the reservoir </h2><p>  <span>The Krasnoyarsk reservoir</span> (map below) has a very impressive size.  Its length reaches 388 km, and the width in some places can be estimated at 15 km.  In some places, the depth of the reservoir is about 105 m (maximum value). </p><p>  The reservoir was built to control the water level in the river so that no obstacles interfere with navigation.  The <span>Krasnoyarsk Sea</span> is also used for industrial purposes, in particular, for rafting timber.  The shores of the reservoir are very different.  It can be sandy beaches, and muddy dams, and piles of rocks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnoyarsk reservoir map" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1170938.jpg" width="600"></div>

One of them is Tubinsky.  It is located closer to Minusinsk, the distance from it is only 18 kilometers.  The bay is very picturesque and suitable for recreation to many people.  Here the vacationer will be greeted by sandy beaches framing the shores of pine and a smooth increase in depth.  Nearby, Mount Tepsey resembles a giant lying mammoth.  Also in its environs and the mouth of the Tuba River you can find petroglyphs - rock <span>paintings of ancient people.</span> </p><p>  Lovers of sailing can be advised by the Gulf of Hum.  There is a yacht club called Admiral.  Club yachts sway gracefully on the waves, decorating this place.  The hype is the most popular bay in the entire Krasnoyarsk Sea. </p><p>  Next to it is the second large bay - Biryusinsky.  It is famous for its picturesque cliffs.  Further downstream, they pass into a dense and impenetrable taiga.  The best way to get to it is to swim in a motor boat, crossing the Krasnoyarsk reservoir.  A land route also exists, but it will require a lot of effort and time.  Well suited for those who like complex category trips. </p><p>  Good sandy beaches can provide others and the bay, located near Primorsk.  There are also a lot of vacationers, but not like in Shumikha.  Perhaps this is due to the remoteness of Primorsk from Krasnoyarsk.  Go to him for about three and a half hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bays of the Krasnoyarsk reservoir" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1170937.jpg" width="600"></div>
