The island is worth seeing the fort of Bordj el Kebir and the pottery workshops of the town of Gellala. </p><p>  Djerba boasts the most beautiful flamingo birds, which can be seen here in natural habitats. </p><p>  The island is incredibly beautiful and romantic, a large number of legends were composed about it.  It was first inhabited by the Phoenicians in the seventh century BC.  A good location, rich nature, and non-decreasing reserves of fresh water - all this attracted representatives of various nations who were eager to win a small piece of paradise. </p><p>  Djerba is an exquisite resort.  Thanks to the mild climate, vacationers visit the island almost all year round.  Palm, olive and fig groves, fruit plantations, lotus placers make Djerba a stunningly beautiful place.  The island has long intertwined the ancient traditions of different nations. </p><h2>  Tours and activities </h2><p>  In the capital of the island of Houmt Suk, there is an old city located behind the fortress wall with numerous mosques.  Walking along the medina along the white Arab houses, you can walk to three mosques: Jamaa-Ettruk, Ekh-Sheikh, Jamma-al-Gorba. </p><p>  On the island is the famous crocodile farm. </p><p>  The soul of the island is the old Jewish district of Riyardh, seven kilometers south of the capital, Djerba.

    <p>  Vacationers seeking to learn the culture of the local population can visit the enographic museum of Guelala.  It presents a variety of displays of household items and utensils of Tunisians, which talk about wedding customs and family life.  In addition, this place is considered the city of potters, where you can cheaply buy beautiful dishes, vases, figurines.  I must say that all the villages of the island are engaged in some crafts, so tourists can buy not only souvenirs at affordable prices, but also useful items.  Djerba, for example, is famous for blankets, carpets, silver jewelry and wickerwork. </p><p>  Have a good time at Djerba Golf.  In addition, the island has the largest African casino and diving center.  Relaxing on Djerba, you can take riding lessons, see the island from a bird's eye view, visit fish taverns, which prepare the best dishes of fresh fish and other seafood. </p><p>  Nature has endowed this region with beautiful sandy beaches with large palm trees and a turquoise sea.  The best beaches are in the north-east of Djerba. </p><h2>  ClubHotel Riu Palm Azur: reviews </h2><p>  Having a conversation about the hotel, I want to turn to the reviews of tourists in order to make up for myself a more real impression of the complex.  According to guests, ClubHotel Riu Palm Azur (Tunisia) has a fairly good territory, unlike other hotels.  She is not very big, but clean and well maintained.  It is noticeable that the staff cleans it daily.  A large amount of greenery and flowers on it deserve special attention, which in itself looks like a miracle in the conditions of heat and sand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel clubhotel riu palm azur" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1482970.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel rooms are quite decent for a four star hotel.  All equipment in working condition there are no problems with plumbing.  The room has a mini fridge, air conditioning and a free safe (only this hotel on the island offers free use of a safe).  The furniture is good, without defects. </p><p>  Room cleaning schedule is standard.  Maids change towels daily, decorating them in the form of swans, even leaving fresh flowers on the beds.  There are no complaints about cleanliness.  It is pleasant that for using towels in this hotel they do not take a deposit in large amounts, which they often sin in other hotels, putting the usual household items in the category of especially valuable items.  Every day, bottled drinking water is left in the apartment, if it is not enough, then you can get another portion at the reception. </p><p>  Dining at ClubHotel Riu Palm Azur 4 * (Djerba) deserves special attention.  In general, it is this point that causes the most heated debate among tourists, no matter how chic the hotel may be.  Our complex in this regard is no exception, as some tourists complain about the uniformity of food.  However, most vacationers believe that the all-inclusive meals are organized at a decent level in accordance with the status of the hotel.  At the buffet there are dishes of tuna, different types of meat, there are seafood.  The restaurant even provides a menu (separate section) for vegetarians.  Fruits are served in sufficient quantities, here you can enjoy: watermelons, bananas, plums, oranges, apples.  Local chefs prepare delicious desserts and pastries.  In the morning you can enjoy delicious croissants.  Halva, honey, cakes, jams deserve special praise ... </p><p>  Hotel guests can sit on the outdoor terrace or inside the restaurant.  But eating in the open air surrounded by such beauty is much nicer.  The waiters serve well.  In addition, the hotel has two more √† la carte establishments.  Once a week you can visit one of them.  Tunisian restaurant is very good.  It is very cozy and has only ten tables.  As part of the all-inclusive system, hotel guests are offered ice cream every day, it is very tasty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="clubhotel riu palm azur reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1482978.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  ClubHotel Riu Palm Azur has its own beach, which is led by a path with a flashlight, luminous in the evening.  The coast itself is sandy, but there are a lot of stones in the water, so tourists, as a rule, bathe on neighboring beaches, where the entrance to the sea is more equipped.  This is not to say that the situation is so bad that it is impossible to enter the water.  Just a little uncomfortable.  However, such a trifle cannot cause any big problems.  On the whole island there are gentle descents into the water, which is quite convenient.  It is necessary to walk a few meters to a depth, there is no sharp cliff.  Algae appear in the sea every day.  In the mornings, hotel workers pull them out of the water.  These are the features of nature.  There are a large number of umbrellas and sunbeds on the beach, it simply makes no sense to pre-occupy places. </p><p>  The sea is always warm.  Weather on the islands is always two to three degrees warmer than on the mainland. </p><p>  The overwhelming majority of holidaymakers at the hotel are French, a little less Russian here, there are also local residents.  The hotel staff is very attentive and helpful.  At the reception upon arrival, they settle quickly, offering cocktails and fruits from the road.  There is no language barrier in the complex.  The staff knows the basic necessary phrases in Russian, you can always explain. </p><h2>  Services and entertainment: reviews </h2><p>  The hotel has a good animation team.  They pay attention not only to small vacationers, but also to adults.  Morning begins with a charge.  Then you can visit water aerobics, shaping, shoot archery, play volleyball or do Pilates.  Every tourist can find something for everyone.  Animators are so passionately inviting to their programs that it is simply impossible to stay away and not take part in sports events.  In the evenings, show programs, foam parties, fire shows, discos, karaoke programs and much more are also organized.  Sometimes they even dance on the beach in the light of the lights.  Animators also devote a lot of time to children, attracting them to interesting activities.  It can be seen that the guys are trying and give all the best for one hundred percent. </p><p>  The hotel features free Wi-Fi.  He doesn‚Äôt always catch in rooms, but there are places in the complex where he is pretty good.  If you really need Internet, then you can buy a local SIM card, which will cost about ten dollars. </p><p>  If you want to see local attractions, then local guides will offer you the most popular excursion routes.  The overview program on the island of Djerba will help to understand the life and lifestyle of the local population.  With children it is interesting to visit a crocodile farm.  You can do this yourself by taxi, so as not to depend on the group. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="clubhotel riu palm azur tunisia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1483035.jpg"></div>
