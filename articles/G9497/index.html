    <p>  The rooms in the hotel are simple enough, without frills.  However, they are spacious, they have everything you need for a comfortable stay: TV, air conditioning, comfortable furniture, refrigerator, and some have a kitchenette.  In the event that some kind of malfunction occurs, after contacting the Kavros Garden 3 * reception, the master will quickly solve the problem.  Clean the rooms regularly and well.  Maids also regularly change towels and bedding, replenish supplies of toiletries.  In general, our compatriots had no complaints about the quality of room service. </p><p>  Exceptionally positive reviews from tourists relate to the location of the hotel.  So, according to them, ‚ÄúKavros Garden‚Äù is surrounded by numerous shops, taverns, bars, souvenir shops.  There is a bus stop near the hotel from where you can get to Heraklion, Rethymnon or Chania.  Nightlife enthusiasts also note that there is a nightclub within walking distance of the hotel. </p><p>  As for the hotel infrastructure, our compatriots assure that there is everything necessary for a comfortable stay.  Tourists liked the presence of two pools, each of which has a bathing area for children.  The only drawback was the fact that the Wi-Fi signal on the part of the hotel is rather weak.  However, this is not critical.  According to tourists from Russia, there is no special animation in Kavros Garden Hotel 3 *.  So, here it is only sometimes offered to guests to play volleyball, water polo or do water aerobics, as well as entertain children.  In the evenings, a mini-disco for kids is held.  Also, experienced travelers recommend that all vacationers in Crete go on excursions around the island, as there are a lot of amazing places and interesting sights. </p><p>  Most of the positive comments from the hotel guests received his staff.  So, according to our compatriots, the hotel staff are very friendly and pleasant people who are always happy to help you and do their job well.  However, it is noted that not all hotel workers speak Russian.  But you can always communicate with staff in basic English or German. </p><p>  As for food, this topic, as in the case with most other hotels, has caused a lot of bipolar reviews from tourists.  So, some hotel guests found the food offered by them in Kavros Garden 3 * (Georgioupolis) monotonous and not very tasty.  However, most travelers note that there is no point in counting on an excellent five-star hotel menu, going to a three-star economy class hotel.  According to them, the dishes offered at Kavros Garden were of very good quality and quite diverse.  So, there are always a choice of several types of side dish, meat and fish dishes, fresh vegetables and fruits.  However, experienced travelers recommend that tourists when booking a room choose the option ‚Äúhalf board‚Äù rather than ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù.  In this case, you will have the opportunity to dine in the nearby taverns, which will allow you to try a variety of local dishes. </p><p>  Our compatriots also had positive impressions from their own beach at the Kavros Garden Hotel.  So, it is sandy and very clean.  Entering the water is gentle and comfortable even for children.  There is a narrow pebble strip near the shore, but you can get around it if you wish.  The only negative tourists considered an insufficient number of sun loungers on the beach.  Therefore, if you want to spend a day by the sea, it is recommended to take a sunbed before breakfast. </p><p>  Summing up, we can confidently say that Kavros Garden 3 * is a good hotel that is fully consistent with its category and offers the best combination of price / quality.  Our compatriots who had a rest here, for the most part, were satisfied with the choice and were ready to recommend this hotel to friends and relatives. </p>
