Advantages of a Flexible Screen Phone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The appearance of a modern mobile phone is firmly ‚Äústuck‚Äù in the minds of most people.  If we are asked to imagine a modern device, we are likely to see something like the latest models of Apple or Samsung - a rectangular <span>thin phone</span> with a wide touch screen.  If you think about it, then this is really so.  We do not even imagine that the phone may be different.  What it can go beyond these rectangular large displays and case, as thin and light as possible.  For example, ideas have long appeared in the minds of developers that you can release a phone with a flexible screen.  They tried to do this a few years ago, and Samsung and LG got involved in the battle for such technology. </p><h2>  <span>What is a flexible</span> screen? </h2>

This means that such a screen can easily be rolled up into a tube, or even folded in half.  The phone, on which such flexible LED screens will stand, can be safely reduced in size by bending in half.  This is so unusual for us, given our experience with exceptionally ‚Äúhard‚Äù touch-sensitive phones, which, at first glance, it‚Äôs hard to name the first and most obvious advantages that such devices will have.  And they are, and quite thorough.

It is not in vain that we are accustomed to working exclusively with stooped phones, which is why picking up a device that can be bent in any direction convenient for us is an unusual experience.  And obviously, this will interest buyers.  In turn, the presentation of such a device could provide a sharp jump <span>in the sales volume of</span> the company that will launch such a device first.  This explains the fierce struggle waged by LG and Samsung for leadership in this sector of the market.  By introducing such a display, you can repeat Apple's success in the market of touch phones. 
      <br>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Next, it should be noted the expansion of the functionality of a mobile phone, which has a flexible screen.  After all, it can be folded, say, to make more convenient pictures.  Also, with an elastic screen on the phone, you can view pictures and videos from a completely different, unprecedented angle, bending them, again, at your discretion.  The picture on such a display, simply speaking, will be many times more realistic and better than on conventional panels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Finally, another advantage that fading displays are capable of demonstrating is screen protection.  It's no secret that the <span>touch screen</span> is the most vulnerable place not only phones, but also tablets.  If a device with such a screen falls, then, with a high probability, its monitor will become cracked if it does not stop working at all.  The same applies to cases where, for example, the iPhone 5S screen bent in the back pocket of jeans due to the pressure that constantly acted on the device.  If the screen on the phone was flexible, this would not have happened. </p><h2>  The first models with a screen that can be bent </h2>

In fact, at least two devices were introduced in the world that could please their owners with such a ‚Äúchip‚Äù as a folding screen.  Samsung introduced a device like the Galaxy Round, while LG introduced its G Flex model.  These two devices became the first phones with a flexible display in the world, and introduced them in 2013.  Their peculiarity is that they are curved in the shape of an arc, so it‚Äôs more convenient to work with them (it‚Äôs easy to reach the curtain with your finger), and it‚Äôs much more interesting to watch video and photo content - all videos come out ‚Äúmore lively‚Äù than on a flat screen.  However, despite the debut, there was no ‚Äúboom‚Äù in sales of these phones.  It is possible that the audience simply missed the release of these new products for the reason that the phones did not show any revolutionary changes.  It is still impossible to bend the device, giving it an arbitrary shape, because of the rigid case and battery.  Here, only a flexible screen can change its shape, but an ordinary user cannot do this.  As promised by Samsung, for example, they are going to use the technology further by installing the same display on their new advanced Galaxy S6 model.  Other phone manufacturers are not yet interested in flexible screens.

Manufacturers, promoting such devices, expect, first of all, hype among gadget lovers and ordinary users who are interested in <span>an unusual phone.</span>  And users expect that they will be offered not just some new product that differs insignificantly in functions from other models, but such a phone that will be of high quality and inexpensive.  Samsung, LG and others are still working on this.
