    <p>  In the Law "On Education" the very concept of "education" is interpreted as a <strong>focused process of training and education</strong> aimed at the formation and upbringing of the individual while respecting its interests, as well as the interests of the state and society.  In this case, both concepts - the "educational" and "pedagogical" process - are identified.  But, it should be noted that, although they constitute an essential unity, they are still not completely identical. </p><p>  The educational process should always be understood as educational.  The educational process, on the contrary, is not always pedagogical, because a person can successfully develop without the participation of a teacher. </p><p>  The education process acts as a unity of educational, self-educational and educational processes that are aimed at the development and education of the individual. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, the educational process itself is composed of two components - training and education.  In this regard, the <strong>purposeful process of training and education</strong> consists in the fact that the elements of education are used in the learning process, and the educational process is inconceivable without training the foster children.  Both the one and the other processes contribute to the <span>development of the personality,</span> have an impact on her emotions, consciousness, behavior. </p>

    <p>  It can be argued that the <strong>purposeful</strong> <strong>process of training and education</strong> has its own specifics: if the content of training consists in obtaining scientific knowledge about the world, then in the educational process the main place is given to rules, norms, ideals, values.  Education has an impact on the development of intelligence, education - on the need-motivational field and personality behavior. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, the <strong>focused process of training and education</strong> combines features that are characteristic of both education and upbringing: </p><p>  - bilateral cooperation between the student and the student; </p><p>  - the main goal of the process is the formation of a personality, comprehensively developed and harmonious; </p><p>  - the substantive and technological aspects of the process are closely interconnected; </p><p>  - <span>educational goals, the</span> very <span>content of education, the</span> means to achieve the objectives, the end result - all the structural elements of education are in close unity; </p><p>  - the process provides for the implementation of three educational functions - developmental, educational and educational. </p>

    <p>  <strong>Learning optimization as one of the aspects of the educational and educational process</strong> </p>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In order for <span>education and upbringing to</span> be purposeful, one should also consider such an aspect as <strong>optimization of the learning process</strong> .  It provides for the mutual cooperation of the teacher and students, which will make learning as effective as possible.  In this case, neither the teacher nor the students should be overworked.  If the teacher masters all the ways that contribute to the effectiveness of the learning process, he will be able to achieve high results, spending the same amount of time that the school curriculum provides. </p><p>  In order for the <strong>optimization of</strong> <strong>the learning process to</strong> be effective, the teacher must consider the following: </p><p>  - The tasks assigned to the educational process should be concretized, and the planning of educational material integrated; </p><p>  - the content of the educational material and its structure should be optimal and rational; </p><p>  - the selection <span>of teaching methods and means</span> should be directed to stimulating and motivating training; </p><p>  - the general class, individual and differentiated approaches to pupils should be combined; </p><p>  - It is mandatory to analyze the time spent on training and the results achieved. </p>

    <p>  <strong>The essence of the literacy process</strong> </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>  An important part of both primary and secondary school education is <strong>the literacy process</strong> .  The methodology of this type of training is constantly working on finding effective techniques for mastering writing skills. </p><p>  <span>Literacy of preschoolers,</span> as well as primary and secondary schoolchildren, provides such directions in the development of children: </p><p>  - mastering literacy - reading, writing, listening and speaking skills; </p><p>  - assimilation of the grammatical structure of speech, enrichment of the dictionary - potential, active and passive; </p><p>  - mastery of spelling and punctuation literacy skills; </p><p>  - the formation of linguistic instinct. </p><p>  The goal of <strong>the literacy process</strong> is laying the foundations for the formation of a literate person who is aware of herself as a native speaker, ensuring the improvement of the development of speech and the language development of the student. </p>
