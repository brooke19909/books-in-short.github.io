But eyewitnesses claimed that the generalissimo, whose name is known throughout the world, truly cherished only one distinctive sign, which he wore at all official events. <strong> </strong></p><h2>  Various conjectures about numerous medals and awards </h2><p>  When Stalin was in power, not even the most courageous person would have dared to express his doubt out loud that some <span>orders, medals</span> and titles were not deservedly received by the Commander-in-Chief of the USSR.  But after the end of his authoritarian rule, such statements could be heard more and more often.  One of the versions voiced regarding the awards of Stalin was the statement that he specially wrote various military awards to himself in order not to look in an unfavorable light in the eyes of his subordinates.  It is worth noting immediately that some military leaders of these same awards often happened much more than Stalin. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many awards did Stalin have" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1877473.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <p>  In addition, today you can read a lot of authoritative evidence that confirms that Stalin, the man who ruled the Soviet Union for about 30 years, remained modest until the end of his life and preferred an ascetic lifestyle.  He did not like to particularly brag about material wealth and achievements, so it is really difficult to imagine that such a person could specially award himself with something to look worthy next to military commanders. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Stalin's special attitude to his awards </h2><p>  In his memoirs, books and memoirs, people who had the opportunity to personally communicate with Stalin, and also spent some time with him, note that he had a modest attitude to awards.  He never liked to brag about them and did not flaunt it.  Even the <span>medal "For the victory over Germany</span> in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945."  he wore very rarely. </p><p>  Given this, it can hardly be assumed that Joseph Vissarionovich specially wrote himself awards and put forward his candidacy for receiving state ranks.  Why did the Generalissimo need orders and medals, which he did not intend to brag about, and did not even consider it necessary to wear them at various official events? </p><p>  Despite how many awards Stalin had, with him always without exception there was only one gold medal ‚ÄúHammer and Sickle‚Äù. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="awards of stalin" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1877472.jpg" width="503"></div>

    <p>  A gold medal depicting a sickle and a hammer was awarded to Stalin in 1939, by a decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Council for his special merits in building the socialist society of the USSR, maintaining friendly relations between peoples and for his merits in organizing the Bolshevik party.  Many did not understand why it was this award that Stalin treasured so much.  But authoritative historians and biographers say that this award, like no other, reflected the meaning of his life - work for the development and prosperity of the socialist Fatherland. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Reproach to Marshal Zhukov </h2><p>  It is worth noting that some of his awards, which were received by him even before the war, Joseph Vissarionovich still rarely wore.  Those that were handed over during the war years, Generalissimo donned very rarely.  But those awards of Stalin, which were presented after the war for the Great Victory, to see on it was almost impossible. </p><p>  It can be assumed that he believed that most of these medals were issued undeservedly.  And perhaps Stalin considered them deserved, but received a disproportionately high price.  In favor of such thoughts, one can cite the situation described by Yu. Mukhin in one of his books. </p><p>  According to the author, at a banquet organized for the high command in honor of the Victory, Zhukov was sitting at the same table with Stalin.  In this case, no expected laudatory odes in honor of the First Marshal of Victory Zhukov did not sound.  It seemed strange to the Marshal and some of those present.  Zhukov decided to take the initiative into his own hands and say a toast. </p><p>  He began with the fact that the most difficult time he had to endure during the entire Second World War was the defense of Moscow.  Stalin, after listening to all this speech, confirmed that the time was difficult and in many respects crucial for the subsequent outcome of the war.  He mentioned that many defenders of the capital did not receive well-deserved awards, because, having distinguished themselves in battles, were seriously injured or remained disabled.  Then Stalin struck the table hard with his fist and noticed that those who did not need to be rewarded with these awards were not forgotten, got up from the table and left without returning to the banquet. </p><h2>  The first awards of young Stalin </h2><p>  Despite the specific attitude to the For Victory medals, Stalin nevertheless cherished his first awards.  In addition to the star of the Hero of Labor, these include the following: </p><ul><li>  The Order of the <span>Red Banner</span> was awarded in 1919 for the final capture of Tsaritsyn by the red troops. </li><li>  The Order of the <span>Red Banner</span> was awarded in 1937 for the merits shown at the front of the social structure. </li><li>  The medal "XX years of the Workers 'and Peasants' Red Army" was issued in 1938. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Awards received during the war years </h2><p>  Since Joseph Vissarionovich was the commander-in-chief of the USSR troops, during the Second World War he was awarded with medals and orders: </p><ul><li>  by decree of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR awarded the Order of Suvorov I Art.  for the brilliant leadership of the operations of the Red Army against the German invaders in 1943 <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="honorary titles of stalin" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1877476.jpg" width="495"></div></li><li>  The Order of the Red Banner ‚ÄúFor 20 Years of Impeccable Service‚Äù was issued in 1944. </li><li>  The Order of Victory No. 3 was issued in 1944 for the development of offensive spacecraft operations, which led to the defeat of the Nazis. </li><li>  <span>The medal "For the Defense of Moscow" was</span> received in 1944. </li></ul><h2>  Orders and medals received in the post-war period </h2><p>  Medals issued precisely in the post-war period were not particularly popular with Stalin.  These include: </p><ul><li>  Medal "For the victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945."  received in 1945 <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Medal for the victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War of 1941 1945" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1877475.jpg" width="303"></div></li><li>  The Order of Victory No. 15 was received in 1945 for services to the organization of all the USSR Armed Forces and their skillful leadership during the war. </li><li>  "Golden Star" - a medal received in 1945 for the leadership of the spacecraft in difficult days for the homeland and the capital. </li><li>  <span>The medal "For the victory over Japan" was</span> received in 1945. </li></ul><h2>  Awards issued by various republics </h2><p>  In addition to state awards, JV Stalin also had awards received for his services from other republics.  These include: </p><ol><li>  Awards issued by the Czechoslovak SSR: two Military Crosses of 1939 (the first was awarded in 1943, the second in 1945) and two Orders of the White Lion (1st century and ‚ÄúFor Victory‚Äù) were awarded in 1945. </li><li>  Order received from Tuva HP: the Order of the Republic of TNR was issued in 1943. </li><li>  Ranks, medals and orders of the Mongolian HP: a medal issued for the ‚ÄúVictory over Japan‚Äù (1945);  order to them.  Suche-Bator obtained in 1945;  Awarding the title of Hero of the Mongolian Republic with the receipt of the "Golden Star";  medal dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the Mongol revolution, issued in 1946 </li><li>  The Order of the Red Star issued by the Bukhara Soviet Republic, Stalin was awarded in 1922. </li></ol><h2>  Received titles </h2><p>  After the victory at Stalingrad in March 1943, a new military rank was awarded to Stalin - Marshal.  After the end of the Second World War, there was more and more talk in close circles about the fact that the Commander-in-Chief should be awarded the title of Generalissimo.  But the honorary titles of Stalin were not interested, and he refused for a very long time.  Unexpectedly, a letter from K. Rokossovsky was able to influence him, in which the author, turning to Stalin, remarked that they were both marshals.  And in the event that once Stalin wants to punish Rokossovsky, he will not have enough authority for this, because their military ranks are equal. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="military rank of Stalin" class="if" height="495" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1877471.jpg" width="407"></div>

    <p>  A similar argument turned out to be quite reasoned for Joseph Vissarionovich, and he gave his long-awaited consent.  This title was awarded to him in June 1945, but until his last days, Stalin refused to wear a uniform with <span>epaulets of the Generalissimo.</span>  He considered her too elegant and luxurious. </p>
