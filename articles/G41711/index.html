Large banks of Russia: list</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, many banks have been deprived of licenses, went bankrupt or closed for any other reason.  Naturally, no one was informed of ordinary people about such a turn, now they have to prove for a long time and tedious that their financial organization had their funds, and try to get them back.  To avoid such situations, it is necessary even before the money is entrusted to the bank, to study its <span>financial indicators,</span> level of reliability, read reviews and, of course, find out if it is included in the largest banks in Russia.  The rating of such financial organizations, presented below, will make it faster and more efficient.  It should be remembered that if the bank of an individual client is not included in the list, this does not mean that it is worse than the specified ones or will soon go bankrupt.  Only the 10 largest banks appear in the lists below in terms of official data. </p><h2>  Rating calculation </h2><p>  The rating of banking organizations proposed below is presented in two versions.  In the first, there are large Russian banks, the list of which is sorted by assets.  For the calculation, the information posted on the website of the Central Bank of Russia was used.  It includes assets with high liquidity, interbank loans, funds invested in stocks, bonds, bills, as well as those involved in the formation of capital of other organizations, <span>fixed assets,</span> loans to individuals and legal entities, intangible and other assets. </p><p>  The second list, which also includes large <span>commercial banks in Russia,</span> is presented in the context of individual deposits and will be of interest primarily to potential investors.  Despite the fact that the information is given specifically about the deposits of individuals, legal entities will be able to draw the right conclusions from the presented list.  All information is as of April 2015. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The largest banks in Russia: assets </h2><p>  The list below is current as of April 2015.  Banks are located as the amount of assets decreases, that is, the higher the bank is in the list, the greater the amount of its assets, and vice versa. </p><ol><li>  Sberbank of Russia. </li><li>  VTB. </li><li>  Gazprombank. </li><li>  VTB 24. </li><li>  Russian Agricultural Bank. </li><li>  FC Discovery. </li><li>  Alfa Bank. </li><li>  Bank of Moscow </li><li>  National Clearing Center. </li><li>  UniCredit Bank. </li></ol><p>  It should be noted that in this list appear exactly the largest banks in Russia.  Similar organizations of other countries are not taken into account, despite the fact that some have representative offices and <span>subsidiaries</span> abroad.  Thus, in fact, a larger banking network that has not yet conquered the market of the Russian Federation, despite the fact that it may not be inferior to other banks in the list in terms of reliability and stability, will not be marked in it. </p>

    <h2>  The advantages of cooperation with large banks </h2><p>  As you can see, banks, especially at the tops of both lists, are the same.  Cooperation with them gives increased guarantees of the reliability of deposits, the safety of funds in accounts and in <span>deposit boxes.</span>  In addition, the larger the financial institution, the more branches it has and, as a result, the higher the level of comfort for customers who are not required to go to the other side of the city to get to the desired service point.  Also, large Russian banks often offer a larger list of services and products (both credit and deposit) than others, which also increases the influx of customers. </p>

    <h2>  Cons of cooperation with large banks </h2><p>  The main disadvantages of cooperation with such large organizations are conditions, rates and tariffs.  More often in a smaller bank you can find more favorable conditions for both lending and deposits.  However, it should be borne in mind that such a level of reliability and safety of money, as in large banks, is no longer anywhere.  Chasing more favorable conditions, you can lose everything at all.  The decision to work with a particular bank, of course, is made by each individual citizen or organization independently, based on many different factors, however, if it is possible to choose, it is recommended to use banking services exactly where greater security and reliability are guaranteed, albeit at the expense of less profitable tariffs.  It should be remembered that any financial institution that offers cooperation and at the same time relies on incredibly favorable tariffs / interest / rates / payments, etc., which differ significantly from the average market ones, can be a fictitious office engaged in fraudulent activity. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Based on the foregoing, it can be noted that the large banks of Russia, located on the first lines of the list, have been located there for a very long time, which indicates their constant development, attention to customers, the introduction of the latest types of services and increasing the comfort of using existing ones.  In most cases, being a client of a large bank, there is no need to visit its branch at all times, since a huge number of services can be obtained simply by using Internet banking.  This applies to both individuals and legal entities.  If you still need to visit bank branches, then in this option a large bank is more preferable, as it simply has more service points for the population and legal entities than other similar organizations. </p>
