  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Clothes for a doll: knitting, description with photos, work technique and tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every girl has a favorite doll.  It can be Baby Bon, Barbie, baby doll, Tilda or any other.  The baby perceives her favorite as a daughter, and wants to surround her with the best.  Of course, the ward can not do without clothes.  But buying a wardrobe for a doll is not always wise.  It is much more interesting to make clothes with your own hands.  This will help family members get even closer, because everyone can take part in the creative process. </p><p>  Not all parents know how to sew, knit, embroider, but when a daughter appears in the family, one has to master needlework skills.  This article provides several step-by-step instructions for knitting clothes for dolls. </p><h2>  Blouse </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.linmaryknits.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="we knit for dolls" class="if uuid-3236034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3236034.jpg"></div><p>  To tie this wardrobe item for your pet, you must: </p><ol><li>  Prepare yarn and knitting needles corresponding to the thickness of the thread. </li><li>  Measure the doll‚Äôs chest circumference (A) with an elastic centimeter and the distance from the shoulder to the lower edge (B). </li><li>  Loop so that the width is 1/2 of parameter A. </li><li>  Tie a fabric whose length is equal to parameter B. </li><li>  Close the center hinges for the gate and restore them in the next row, knitting aerial. </li><li>  Connect the canvas, focusing on parameter B. </li><li>  Close the loop.  If desired, add sleeves by typing in the right place with a loop hook. </li><li>  Connect the product at the side seams.  Decorate at your own discretion. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, knitting <span>clothes for dolls with knitting needles</span> does not require special skills and knowledge from the needlewoman. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Skirt with a blouse </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress for barbie" class="if uuid-3236032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3236032.jpg"></div><p>  Having knitted a blouse according to the principle described above, but using different shades of yarn, it will be possible to complete the first part of the kit shown in the photo above.  Well, to make a skirt, and at all, will not be difficult!  To do this, we offer step-by-step instructions for this piece of clothing for dolls.  The description of knitting also involves simple manipulations: </p><ol><li>  Measure the hip circumference (A) and the estimated length of the skirt (B). </li><li>  Dial the number of loops, focusing on parameter A. </li><li>  Distribute them into 3-4 loops.  Knit, moving in a circle. </li><li>  Close the loop. </li><li>  Carefully skip the knitting thread along the upper edge with a hook.  This will be a belt that will be able to tighten the skirt so that it does not fall. </li></ol><h2>  A bag </h2><p>  In the framework of this article, it is worth paying attention not only to knitting clothes for dolls, but also to making accessories.  In particular, a fashionable bag.  Consider the features of the work on the example of the model shown in the photo above.  The instruction is simple: </p><ol><li>  Tie 3 identical squares.  This can be done with knitting needles or crochet. </li><li>  The first square is the bottom, the other two are the sides.  Sew the parts together. </li><li>  Add a bag handle.  Decorate the product to your liking. </li></ol><h2>  Dress and coat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clothes for dolls" class="if uuid-3236033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3236033.jpg"></div><p>  Again, taking the instructions for the blouse presented in the first paragraph as the basis, you can make a spectacular coat.  This requires: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Prepare yarn and knitting needles.  Since you will be carrying out clothes for Barbie dolls that are designed to be worn in cold weather, it is worth taking tools a little thinner than a thread. </li><li>  Measure the distance from the shoulder to the estimated lower edge (A) and the circumference of the hips (B). </li><li>  Knit from the back.  Dial loops, guided by 1/2 parameter B. </li><li>  Tie the canvas to the shoulders (parameter A), close the hinges for the gate.  In the next row they need to be restored, but then you have to knit 2 separate shelves.  Therefore, first add air for one half and tie the front of the coat to the end.  Then do the same to complete the second shelf. </li><li>  Tie the sleeves. </li><li>  Dial the loops for the collar, tie it and close the loops. </li><li>  Sew the product at the side seams. </li><li>  Add buckles or a belt as desired. </li></ol><p>  To make the dress shown in the photo above, it is not necessary to study the long description of knitting clothes for dolls with knitting needles.  After all, the principle of operation is very simple: </p><ol><li>  Measure the hips (A) and the length of the product (B). </li><li>  Dial the loops based on the value of A. Distribute them into 3-4 loops and tie the ‚Äúpipe‚Äù, moving in a circle and gradually reaching the desired length (B). </li><li>  Now sew or tie the belt.  And you can put on your favorite new thing. </li></ol><h2>  Beret </h2><p>  Very interesting and, most importantly, dolls look fashionable, on the heads of which this accessory flaunts.  To do it yourself, you need to perform basic manipulations: </p><ol><li>  Measure the circumference of the doll‚Äôs head (A) and the distance from the left ear to the right through the crown (B). </li><li>  You can knit with knitting needles and crochet.  In any case, you should move in a circle, starting with a set of loops (parameter A). </li><li>  Then smoothly expand the circumference of the beret, making sure that the number of rows does not exceed 1/4 of parameter B. </li><li>  After the circumference, it is necessary to reduce to 3-4 loops.  Break and fasten the thread so that the beret does not blossom. </li></ol><h2>  Summer kit </h2><p>  According to many needlewomen, crocheting clothes for dolls is best.  And the reason lies not in the convenience of working with this tool, just quite often, due to the incorrect selection of yarn and knitting needles, a too holey product is obtained.  That is, the clothes are transparent and even vulgar.  The hook also allows you to tie a denser fabric.  In any case, when choosing a tool, study the label on the yarn.  Often, there are indicated recommended parameters for knitting needles and hook. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.villagersatwar.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="outfit for barbie" class="if uuid-3236039" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3236039.jpg"></div><p>  Look at the photo, do you like doll outfit?  If so, then you can do it yourself.  For this: </p><ol><li>  Measure the circumference of the hips (A) and chest (B), the length of the top (C) and the skirt (G). </li><li>  Dial the loops for the top (B) and tie the ‚Äúpipe‚Äù of the desired length. </li><li>  Skip the thread along the top edge to make it easy to pull off the top.  If desired, you can use a beautiful lace to tie it around the neck. </li><li>  The skirt is made on the same principle.  Only the number of starting loops will be large - parameter A. Then, also tie the ‚Äúpipe‚Äù of the desired length and add a thread for the screed. </li></ol><h2>  Broad-brim </h2><p>  This is another important accessory without which the wardrobe of Barbie dolls will not do.  Crocheting clothes for a pet seems to many to be much simpler than doing this little thing.  However, such a judgment is erroneous.  And then you can see this: </p><ol><li>  First you need to draw a circle on a piece of cardboard.  This is required in order to outline the width of the fields.  Now gently draw a slightly smaller circle next to it.  Cut out.  Did you get the letter "O"? </li><li>  Measure the circumference of the doll‚Äôs head (A) and the distance from one ear to the other in the same way as in one of the previous master classes - through the crown (B). </li><li>  Dial loops, focusing on parameter A. Distribute into 3-4 knitting needles and knit 4-6 rows without increases or decreases. </li><li>  Next, begin to smoothly reduce the circumference by knitting 2 loops together. </li><li>  Through the remaining 4 loops, you need to skip the thread and tighten it securely from the wrong side. </li><li>  Now take the hook and tie the prepared paper letter "O". </li><li>  In the next row, dial the loops and distribute them into 3-4 knitting needles.  Knit gradually reducing loops, trying to reach the circumference of the previously made hat. </li><li>  When the desired result is achieved, tear the thread and sew 2 parts together.  After that you can put the hat on the doll. </li></ol><h2>  Pantsuit </h2><div class="photo" data-original="indulgy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting for dolls" class="if uuid-3236042" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3236042.jpg"></div><p>  You can connect the shirt shown in the photo in the same way as the top described earlier.  But since there is a cut in this product, you need to knit not in a circle, but back and forth.  Add straps at the end.  Nothing complicated! </p><p>  Completely different thing - the implementation of panties.  Although thanks to the instructions there will be no problems with this thing: </p><ol><li>  Measure the circumference of the hips (A) and legs in its widest part (B), determine the length of the trousers (C). </li><li>  Dial the loops, focusing on parameter A. Tie the "pipe" of the desired length. </li><li>  Divide the total number of loops by 2 and then knit each leg separately, also moving in a circle. </li><li>  On the upper edge of the finished trousers, skip the tie rope.  That's all! </li></ol><h2>  Hat with ears </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hat for dolls" class="if uuid-3236035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3236035.jpg"></div><p>  A huge number of girls love Tild.  And they are usually worn in rather funny clothes.  At this point, we propose to consider an interesting hat.  To execute it, you must: </p><ol><li>  Make the necessary measurements and tie the base.  The essence of the work is described in the instructions for the hat. </li><li>  Then, using a hook or knitting needles, knit 2 leaflets - ears.  An important secret: they need to be starched before being sewn. </li></ol><h2>  Snud </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pinosy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tilda clothes" class="if uuid-3236036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3236036.jpg"></div><p>  The technology for knitting blouses and hats has already been described previously, so we will skip this briefing.  To make a snood, you need to knit a regular long scarf, and then sew the ends together. </p>
