Here the whole point is that for the price that is asked for the "apple" apparatus, you can buy nearly a dozen 7-inch Digma tablets.  The latter can be found on popular Internet sites for less than five thousand rubles, so there is something to understand. </p><p>  So, the hero of today's review is the Plane 7502 4G model, a Digma tablet.  The characteristics of the device, its advantages and disadvantages, as well as the appropriateness of the purchase will be considered in our article.  We take into account the opinions of experts in this field and the reviews of ordinary users of this model. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  In the world of mobile devices, size is one of the defining values.  Tablets, in turn, confidently hold a niche between smartphones and full-fledged laptops and noticeably squeezed the once-popular segment of netbooks. </p><p>  As such, the class of 7-inch gadgets is largely the merit of the venerable Asus company, which in time took the market into its own hands with the sensational EEPC series.  We see a similar solution in the 7-inch Digma tablet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In fact, this is the best option for a universal gadget.  It fits easily in a bag or backpack and always helps out in almost any specific situation.  So the manufacturer made the right choice of form factor. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Black color is a real scourge for neat and aesthetes, but the manufacturer did not further aggravate the situation and completely abandoned glossy as well as easily soiled materials.  Reviews on the Digma tablet are unambiguous in this regard: matte, and besides, graphite-colored plastic clearly contributes to the careful attitude and long life of the device case. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mcgrp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="digma tablet design" class="if uuid-2447249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2447249.jpg"></div><p>  The exterior of the gadget is not much different from a bunch of other budget models.  Here we have a thick frame framing the screen, and behind is the usual peephole of the camera on top and the logo in the middle.  The latter distinguishes the device from hundreds of others.  It is also worth clarifying that there is no cover in the kit with the Digma tablet, therefore, in order to maintain its marketable appearance, it is better to immediately take care of purchasing it. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  The location of the interfaces is the same universal: the power button and the volume rocker on the right side, and the slots for an external drive and mobile phone cards are under the top cover.  The latter, by the way, is very tightly removed, and on this occasion, users leave far from flattering reviews about the Digma tablet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.olx.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet connection" class="if uuid-2447252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2447252.jpg"></div><p>  To access the slots you need to have either sharp and durable nails, or a tool under your side.  But this point can hardly be called critical, because the cover, as a rule, is not removed every day, and most likely not every month. </p><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  With the choice and quality of the material, the company clearly did not fail.  Judging by the reviews on the Digma tablet, users are delighted with the stylized plastic for metal, which is also pleasant to the touch and not brands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="digma.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet interfaces" class="if uuid-2447253" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2447253.jpg"></div><p>  Consumers have no complaints about the build quality.  Nothing creaks, does not play, does not crunch.  In general, the model can not be called frankly budget.  Yes, plastic is felt, but the solid structure and high-quality material inspire confidence.  There were also no problems with the button and volume rocker: if the Digma tablet does not turn on, then the matter is probably not in the mechanics, but in the ‚Äústuffing‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  For a minimum screen <span>diagonal</span> of 7 inches for <span>tablets, the</span> device received a very sensible, and most importantly, a bright IPS-matrix, which is very rare in the budget segment.  And it comes to the point that the screen settings of the Digma tablet have to be reset below average values, which is especially true in dark rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="proshivkis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet screen" class="if uuid-2447258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2447258.jpg"></div><p>  The matrix has a resolution of 1024 by 600 pixels, which is enough for comfortable work with almost any application.  Reviews about the Digma tablet are mixed.  On the one hand, it might seem that the resolution is too modest, and some might even imagine pixelation, but on the other hand, all interface elements are perfectly readable and perceived: the icons are large and the text is clear. </p><p>  IPS technology has greatly contributed to increasing viewing angles, and everything is in order with them.  You can flip through a photo or watch a video in the company of two, or even three, like-minded people.  The picture begins to dance only if you turn the gadget well. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  It is becoming increasingly difficult for manufacturers to surprise consumers with some new products and ‚Äútricks‚Äù.  As a rule, there is a gap between the marketing specification for the product and the actual technical characteristics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.2cm.com.tw" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet performance" class="if uuid-2447251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2447251.jpg"></div><p>  Marketers go to different tricks and tricks, if only to capture the attention of the client.  In general, you can put at least an 8-core processor in a mobile device and add 8 GB of RAM in addition, but there is no guarantee that it will work faster and more stable. </p><p>  In our case, we have a rather attractive set of chipsets in the face of the 4-core Spreadtrum sc9830 processor.  The latter proved to be excellent on board the Taba from Samsung and has no critical complaints from both experts and users.  This is a time-tested processor - moderately productive and moderately gluttonous. </p><p>  One gigabyte of RAM is enough for the interface to work flawlessly: no twitching, lags or friezes.  But here we are talking about the basic version of ‚ÄúAndroid 5.1‚Äù with the prefix ‚ÄúLolipop‚Äù.  If you got any other modification, for example, from a mobile operator, or an older version of the platform, then it is difficult to guarantee stability and smoothness of the interface. </p><p>  Judging by user reviews, the stock firmware of the Digma tablet remains as the iron method for eliminating lags and friezes.  It can be found on the official website of the company, if you want to do everything yourself, or you can take the device to a service center and, after paying 500-700 rubles, get a turnkey system. </p><p>  For surfing the Web, the Digma 3G tablet is perfect.  Problems begin during the launch of "heavy" toys and other serious applications.  Arcade programs from "Google Play" go off with a bang, but demanding shooters or full-scale strategies begin to terribly slow down.  Resetting the graphics settings to a minimum, as a rule, helps, but sometimes you just have to refuse such software. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  If smartphones with two SIM cards do not surprise anyone, then a tablet, and even a budget one, with such features is a gimmick.  There are no complaints about the communication quality of both modules: everything works stably, and if the signal reception bar jumps, it is only through the fault of the mobile operator, not the tablet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tech2ai.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bluetooth and wifi" class="if uuid-2447250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2447250.jpg"></div><p>  There is also support for wireless protocols.  There are no questions about bluetooth, but Wi-Fi works stably both at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, which is good news.  The regular GPS-module proved to be very good, so the gadget can be safely used as a navigator in the car. </p><h2>  Standalone time </h2><p>  The device received a relatively modest 2800 mAh battery.  Its capacity is enough for three hours of operation in 4G mode and for "heavy" toys for the same time.  The Wi-Fi wireless protocol will drain the battery in 8 hours, and if you watch the video in high resolution, the battery will drain in about five to six hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bgr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet battery" class="if uuid-2447254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2447254.jpg"></div><p>  The indicators are not the most inspiring, but if you shift all these maxima to the usual measured day, then for a day or even a couple of tablets should definitely be enough.  If you look in the direction of competing counterparts, then a good half of the budget segment gadgets cannot offer this.  So here we have a solid middle peasant. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The scope of this tablet is difficult to determine.  It will look great in the hands of a child, will fit perfectly as an entertainment center into the car interior, and will also help to spend home leisure watching a video or reading books.  So the tablet for the most part turned out to be universal, and it is impossible to limit its use to any specific group of users. </p><p>  What owners liked: </p><ul><li>  good looks; </li><li>  high-quality, non-marking materials along with excellent assembly; </li><li>  ease of construction; </li><li>  bright screen with good viewing angles, giving a juicy and understandable picture; </li><li>  flashlight; </li><li>  work on high-speed 4G protocols; </li><li>  support for two SIM cards; </li><li>  built-in and sensible GPS module; </li><li>  good performance for its price category; </li><li>  high-quality accessories in the package; </li><li>  more than a democratic price tag for the available features. </li></ul><p>  What did not like: </p><ul><li>  access to the slots of SD-drives and SIM cards is firmly ‚Äúbarricaded‚Äù; </li><li>  a good half of models branded by mobile operators come with a modified Android platform, which significantly affects the overall performance; </li><li>  some users complain about the pixelation of the screen. </li></ul><p>  The estimated cost of the tablet is about 5000 rubles. </p>
