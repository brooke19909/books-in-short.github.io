This is truly a wonderful and charming place that is perfect for family or romantic getaways.  The mountain system is located closer to the west of Ukraine and stretches for 280 km.  Sometimes tourists can meet mountains up to 2000 m high, while Goverla is considered the highest point - 2061 m. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where are the Carpathians" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/401009.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is quite natural that many people wish to visit this ecologically clean area and try to find out in more detail where the Carpathians are.  It is worth noting that the relief is multi-tiered.  So, there are high mountain areas (altitude up to 1500 m), mid-mountain (up to 1300 m), low-mountain (up to 400 m) and foothill. </p><h2>  Location of the Carpathians </h2>

Nevertheless, officially the mountains are located on the territory of Ukraine, namely its four regions: Transcarpathian, Lviv, Chernivtsi and Ivano-Frankivsk.  Thus, from these regions, you can easily and quickly get to recreation centers and take great excursions, as well as enjoy stunning scenery and fresh air.  Quite often, the region under consideration is divided into two parts: Transcarpathia and Carpathian.  In addition to <span>Goverla Mountain,</span> which attracts tourists the most, Pop Ivan, Petros and Hamster are just as steep and beautiful.  Their height exceeds 2000 m, because they are considered no less powerful and interesting.  It is known that people live in the mountains, but civilization does not spoil the overall picture.  At the same time, the atmosphere around is completely different: nature is almost untouched, the air is clean, sometimes heavy, and the tops of the trees touch the human eye.  In the rivers running throughout the Carpathians, there are a variety of fish species, which is why fishing is one of the most beloved activities of both local residents and tourists.

    <h2>  Stunning mountain heritage </h2><p>  Being interested in where <span>the Carpathian Mountains</span> are located <span>,</span> tourists first of all mentally calculate the distance from their hometown to Ukrainian attractions.  But on no map will they ever see those bewitching places.  For example, the Pearl Cave is considered the pride of the Carpathians, on the walls of which calcite balls are formed, somewhat reminiscent of jewelry.  No less interesting will be a trip to the Enchanted Valley - a picturesque gorge with powerful rocks.  It is also recommended to visit the Hanging Swamp, Stone Gate, Synevir Nature Reserve, lovers' rocks and a cave of transparent walls.  In spring, the Valley of Daffodils, which is completely covered with snow-white flowers, the diameter of which can reach 10 cm, will be a great place for a walk. </p>
