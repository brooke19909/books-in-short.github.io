They note the presence of a spacious well-groomed territory, freshly renovated, swimming pools, spaciousness of all rooms.  Tourists like good room decoration, quality service, beach, convenient location of the hotel.  The authors of the reviews consider that in general the hotel corresponds to its category.  Impressions from vacationers about the time spent in the hotel are mostly positive.  The time difference between Moscow and Greece (at 1 hour), according to many tourists, is not felt. </p><p>  As a drawback, guests note the lack of a hairdryer and bathtub in some rooms, security systems (there are no surveillance cameras, each room has a separate entrance from the street), the small size of the bathroom, and poor Internet performance.  Claims of vacationers also relate to the work of some hotel employees accused by guests of impoliteness, insufficient quality of children's animation programs.  However, many tourists consider these shortcomings insignificant and recommend the hotel as a worthy option for living on vacation. </p>
