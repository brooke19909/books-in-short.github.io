  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ottoman Empire</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The Ottoman (Ottoman) empire,</span> whose history began in the <span>14th century</span> (from the time of the decline of Byzantium), was formed in Anatolia by the tribes of T√ºrks.  The state existed until 1922 - the moment of the formation of the Turkish Republic.  The <span>Ottoman Empire</span> is named after the first Sultan - the founder of the <span>Ottoman</span> dynasty. </p><p>  At the beginning of the reign, the sultan expanded his inheritance, adding territories from the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMarmara and the Black Sea, a significant part of the land west of the Sakarya River. </p><p>  After the death of Osman, Orhan ascended the throne.  During his reign, the capital of the state, Bursa (a former Byzantine city), was approved. </p><p>  After Orhan, his eldest son Murad 1 became the ruler. This great statesman managed to strengthen the presence of his state‚Äôs troops in Europe.  Murad 1 in 1389 defeated the Serbian prince on the <span>Kosovo Field.</span>  As a result of this battle, the Ottoman Empire acquired most of the southern territory of the Danube. </p><p>  The system of government in the country was based on a combination of Byzantine, Seljuk and Arab traditions and customs.  On the lands that the Ottomans conquered, they tried to preserve local traditions as much as possible, not to destroy the historical relations. </p><p>  The territory of the Ottoman Empire expanded even more during the reign of the son of Murad 1, Bayazid 1. The most significant victory was the battle of Nikopol in 1396 (on the Danube).  However, despite the external prosperity, the Ottoman Empire experienced quite serious difficulties, both external and internal.  Mostly, the ruler‚Äôs mannered behavior, his huge harem, exquisite ceremonies in the palace caused irritation for many ghazis.  In addition, Bayazid‚Äôs campaigns against Muslims and other ghazis in Asia Minor were also of concern.  As a result, most of the local Beys went over to Tamerlane and were persuaded to start a war against the Ottoman ruler. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a result of the battle in 1402, Bayazid's army was defeated, and the ruler himself was captured.  The Ottoman Empire was fragmented as a result of the subsequent campaigns of Tamerlane.  However, the sultans retained power over some areas of the country. </p><p>  During the 15th century, the Ottoman state pursued a policy of internal reorganization and external expansion and strengthening of borders. </p><p>  The "golden" for the empire was the 16th century.  During this period, Suleiman 1 ruled the country, attaching great importance to strengthening the marine power of the state.  The middle of the 16th century became the heyday of architecture and literature. </p><p>  Feudal relations dominated the Ottoman Empire at that time, and the military organization and administrative system were structured by law. </p><p>  It should be noted that after this time (after the rule of Suleiman 1), most of the sultans turned out to be rather weak rulers.  At the beginning of the 17th century, a reform of the government was carried out in the state.  Earlier in the empire there was a rather cruel tradition - the accession to the throne, the sultan killed all his brothers.  Since 1603, the brothers of the rulers and their relatives were imprisoned in a special, remote part of the palace, where they spent their whole lives until the death of the ruler.  When the sultan was dying, the eldest of the prisoners came in his place.  As a result, almost all the sultans that reigned in the 17-18 centuries were not intellectually developed and, of course, had no political experience.  Due to the fact that there was no worthy ruler, a huge country began to lose its unity, and the government itself began to weaken very quickly. </p><p>  As a result, the Ottoman Empire in the 18th century lost most of its power in the Mediterranean.  The end of the Seven Years' War provoked new attacks on the state.  Thus, the empire acquired, in addition to the old enemy of Austria, a new enemy - Russia. </p>
