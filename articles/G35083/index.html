    <p>  Ever thought about who exactly is the creator of this famous entertainment?  After all, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreation is really unique, and the author can be recognized as almost a genius!  To create the attraction ‚ÄúRoom of Fear‚Äù for the first time occurred to the famous Walt Disney.  Yes, it was he who invented such a terrible entertainment.  Moreover, the creator, for reasons unknown to anyone, probably did not think about children this time (or, on the contrary, thought about it, because the attraction was just for them).  In any case, the room really embodied the most hidden nightmares of the human subconscious.  Only those whose psyche was very stable wanted to come to the ‚ÄúRoom of Fear‚Äù more and more often.  However, on the other hand, it was a good way to get rid of your fears.  That is why the attraction began to quickly gain popularity not only among adults, but also among children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Such rooms began to be built around the world (and I must say, not everywhere equally successfully).  For this, a special room stood out in which there was no electricity, and the only thing that helped to see the monsters was the backlight.  One of the first opened the attraction "Room of Fear" in Moscow.  This was only the beginning of the ‚Äúcareer‚Äù of the famous entertainment place, therefore, it is not worth criticizing it.  It should only be noted that it was not entirely terrible, and only slightly tickled the nerves.  Further, the attraction began to gain momentum and more and more "terrible" rooms began to open in Europe.  In some of them it was really scary, while others were more amused than frightened.  However, the audience fell in love with <span>this entertainment,</span> even if it required minor modifications. </p><p>  Recently opened another attraction "Room of fear" in Israel.  And, I must say, from the very first days he was recognized as one of the worst in the world.  It was this attraction that Walt Disney meant.  He would surely have been proud of the Israelis.  The cunning and smart people did not save and made a truly excellent attraction located on 170 square meters.  This is more of a house than an ordinary room with fears.  For a relatively small amount, anyone can visit there, but before visiting it is important to think about whether it is worth it. </p>

    <p>  What is the difference between the Israeli attraction and many others?  Firstly, this, of course, is the production itself.  The visitor is not in an ordinary room with portraits of zombies and voodoo dolls, he is not sitting in an armchair when voices begin to ring out over him.  In the story, you find yourself in an empty mansion, and the only guide is only the light of the candle, which will lead you through the rooms.  About 15 minutes you will wander through empty rooms with various monsters - this is what the ‚ÄúRoom of fear" is.  The attraction, the photos of which fully convey the sensations, captivates with its atmosphere.  Each visitor receives a picture of himself in an amazing setting at the exit.  This is another difference of the Israeli attraction: <span>infrared cameras are</span> installed in the room <span>,</span> capturing visitors in the most "scary" moments of their lives. </p>
