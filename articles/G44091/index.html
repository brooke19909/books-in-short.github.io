The price of equipment is determined by the number and quality of interactive projectors.  The wider the equipment, the greater the cost.  Important indicators are also the presence of shadow from the participant in the process, the installation time of the system and other factors.  This is an ideal solution for shopping centers, as well as a great idea for organizing playgrounds.  Once in the range of the projector, a person literally converts the picture and becomes a direct participant in the event.  Since the cost of equipment is quite high, today there is the possibility of rental use.  An interactive floor, the average daily rental price of which ranges from $ 75 to $ 300, can diversify the program for opening a new retail outlet, become a bright surprise during an advertising campaign, make an unforgettable fashion show, or attract the attention of museum visitors. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interactive floor" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1210001.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The use of interactive systems </h2><p>  The interactive floor is perfect for kindergarten, school, extracurricular educational institutions due to the many effects that easily attract the attention of children and motivate them to learn through the game.  However, this projection system is not just fun, it is also a powerful tool for promoting new products and services on the market.  The main advantage of the interactive system is that advertising is served unobtrusively, beautifully and interestingly for a potential buyer.  It is not annoying, but rather attracts attention and makes you smile.  Systems are also used in the field of public leisure.  One has only to install the equipment at a night disco, in a restaurant, in the lobby of a movie theater or in an amusement park, and an ordinary party is transformed into a bright and magical event. </p>
