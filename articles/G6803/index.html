    <p>  Nuclear weapons are by far one of the most powerful.  Its development is carried out by many countries.  Five of them can be called <span>nuclear powers.</span>  These are the USA, China, Russia, France and the United Kingdom.  Some other states are engaged in development in this area, but have not yet reached the required level.  The goals they pursue are not always humane.  Therefore, its production should be reduced and kept under special control. </p><p>  The history of creation is quite long.  But the first tests of nuclear weapons took place in 1945, when the United States dropped bombs on the <span>Japanese cities of</span> Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  A terrible catastrophe happened.  The destruction and casualties were numerous.  For many years, the echoes of these explosions made themselves felt. </p><p>  Nuclear weapons operate by fissioning the nuclei of heavy elements (plutonium, uranium, etc.).  Its charge can be of several types. </p><p>  Thermonuclear is one of the varieties.  Its action is the synthesis of light metals.  For this to happen, you need to create a very high temperature, which is achieved through an <span>atomic explosion.</span> </p><p>  The neutron charge differs from the previous one in a large number of neutrons at the output. </p><p>  And finally, a clean charge, which is characterized by a low amount of radioactive isotopes. </p><p>  A nuclear weapon consists of an automation system and a hull.  These are its main elements. </p><p>  The case plays the role of a capacity for a nuclear charge and directly the automation system itself.  It also serves as protection against accidental damage and environmental influences.  The automation system is designed to carry out an explosion only at a specific time.  It also prevents accidental charge explosion.  It consists of several parts: a charge detonation system, a power source, an emergency detonation system, protection, and detonation sensors. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cruise, anti-aircraft and ballistic missiles and aircraft are used to deliver weapons to their destination. </p><p>  The power of nuclear weapons is great.  It is divided into the following calibers: small, extra small, large, medium and extra large. </p><p>  Nuclear weapons can be used in the air, underground or above its surface.  The explosion takes place in midair and can be high and low.  Also distinguish ground or underwater explosions that occur directly above the surface, and underground or underwater. </p><p>  How does nuclear weapons work?  Its explosion is caused by certain factors.  Firstly, it is a mechanical effect.  It is produced by a <span>shock wave,</span> which occurs immediately after the explosion.  Secondly, it is a thermal effect.  This is a significant increase in temperature in <span>the affected area.</span>  After the explosion in Hiroshima, this zone was 4 kilometers.  In this radius, the temperature reached a level at which the human body turned into ashes.  And the last effect resulting from a <span>nuclear explosion</span> is radiation.  It starts from the moment of the explosion and continues for a very long time. </p><p>  The power of each of these steps depends on the type of charge.  The farther away an object or person is from the location of the explosion, the lower the degree of exposure to nuclear weapons. </p><p>  Tactical nuclear weapons are less powerful.  It is intended to destroy individual targets.  These include aerial bombs, torpedoes, depth mines, etc.  Almost all recognized nuclear powers have such weapons.  The total volume of such charges does not exceed several kilotons. </p><p>  The challenge facing humanity is to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to prevent <span>an arms race.</span>  It serves not only to maintain peace, but can also cause the destruction of all mankind. </p>
