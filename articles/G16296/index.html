  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Natural population movement</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Vital population movement is an indicator that determines the change in the number of population as a result of processes such as fertility and mortality.  It differs from mechanical movement (migration) in that it characterizes demographic indicators. </p><p>  With mechanical movement, numbers and structure change under the influence of migratory flows of people who rush from one region to another for economic or social reasons.  Most often, people move from less developed countries to states that are more developed both socially and economically. </p><p>  The term ‚Äúnatural population movement‚Äù first appeared in Germany in the 19th century.  It is measured by the difference between the number of natural growth and population decline.  These data are calculated taking into account age groups.  The following factors affect fertility and mortality: socio-economic conditions;  natural environment;  traditional living conditions. </p><p>  Vital statistics are relative as well as absolute.  Absolute is considered to be: </p><ul><li>  the number of persons born during the time interval; </li><li>  the number of persons who died during the time interval; </li><li>  natural increase (decrease), making up the difference between the first and second. </li></ul><p>  <span>Relative indicators of the</span> natural movement of the population are the mortality, fertility and natural growth rates, which are calculated according to special formulas.  With the right calculation, you can get a clear picture of the state of natural population movement.  These indicators change with the development of society and determine its type. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Scientists distinguish three <span>demographic transitions</span> in the history of mankind.  Under the primitive communal system, the ratio of born and dead people was approximately the same, and population growth was minimal.  This <span>type of population reproduction is</span> called an archetype. </p><p>  The natural population movement in the second (traditional) demographic type increases due to the high birth rate, which is significantly ahead of mortality.  This period extends until the development of capitalist society.  And also captures the period of early capitalism.  And finally, the modern, or rational, third type is the natural movement of the population, characterized by a low birth rate and low mortality.  Longer life of people is associated with the development of health care and improving living standards. </p><p>  It should be noted that changes occur in the developed countries of Europe, where natural growth reaches 0.1-0.7%, which leads to a demographic crisis.  As a result, in some European countries mortality is ahead of the birth rate, and this is expressed in the depopulation of the peoples of these states. </p><p>  The natural population movement in <span>third world countries</span> is still stable.  Fertility is ahead of mortality, despite the more difficult socio-economic situation.  Here the growth is up to 4%, therefore the peoples of Latin America, as well as Africa and Asia occupy the bulk of the world's population.  If Europeans do not seriously engage in raising the demographic level, then after some time they may completely disappear as nations. </p><p>  The natural movement of the population is what will make it possible to reconsider their views on many problems associated with the demographic crisis in Russia, where the population is declining due to reasons that can be dealt with.  This is total drunkenness, drug addiction, a low <span>standard of living,</span> as well as unwillingness to preserve their cultural and national traditions for posterity.  With wise politics, all these issues can be resolved. </p>
