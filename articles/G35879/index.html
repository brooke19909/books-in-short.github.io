  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is communism good?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What is communism?  This is such a system, the main purpose of which is to satisfy all human needs.  Moreover, the need for labor is important, it must also be satisfied, depending on the abilities.  To achieve this state of things, it is necessary to develop science and technology.  Currently, according to the ideology of communism, films, books, music, images, and some programs are distributed on the Internet.  This is an example of how the main myth of the capitalists that it is impossible to give everything to everyone can be dispelled.  It is proved that the resources of the planet, if used rationally, are able to provide everyone, even with a margin. </p><p>  <strong>Communism: Definition</strong> </p><p>  K. Marx and F. Engels defined the concept of "communism".  This is a doctrine, a goal, a principled clear position, active action and action, a revolutionary struggle.  Communism can be seen as a struggle for the liberation of workers, working people, humanity from oppression and exploitation by overthrow, not excluding the violent path, from the rule of all exploiters.  Communist practice has left many examples in the <span>history of mankind of the</span> names of the great communists.  The most famous of them are V.I. Lenin, <span>F. Engels, K. Marx.</span>  These are the greatest practices and theorists of communism.  V.I. Lenin was at the head of the victorious Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia, which turned the whole world upside down. </p><p>  <strong>Principles of communism</strong> </p><p>  1) <span>Private property</span> is subject to restriction: the introduction of progressive taxes, high inheritance taxes, the abolition of inheritance of brothers, nephews and other compulsory loans. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2) Consistent expropriation of land owners, manufacturers, ship and railroad owners, part of the property through competition with state industry, part - directly by the redemption of appropriations. </p><p>  3) The <span>confiscation of property of</span> all rebels and emigrants who rebelled against most people. </p><p>  4) The <span>organization of labor to the</span> proletarians in national factories, estates and workshops, which will eliminate the competition of workers, and manufacturers will have to pay them the same wages as the state. </p><p>  5) The introduction of the same compulsory labor for all, up to the complete elimination of private property. </p><p>  6) Centralized state management of the credit system and money trading through the activities of the National Bank with centralized capital.  Dissolution of all private banks and bankers' offices. </p><p>  7) An increase in the number of national workshops, factories, ships, railways, cultivation of uncultivated land and improved cultivation of cultivated land. </p><p>  8) Raising children in public institutions at the expense of the state. </p><p>  9) The construction of beautiful palaces as a common home for communes, people who will work in industry, agriculture and embody the advantages of rural and urban lifestyles, eliminating their one-sidedness and disadvantages. </p><p>  10) Destruction of dilapidated and poorly built neighborhoods and dwellings in cities. </p><p>  11) Equal <span>inheritance law</span> for children of marriage and extramarital affairs. </p><p>  12) The whole transport business should be concentrated in the hands of the nation. </p><p>  The guarantee of the implementation of these principles is communism.  This does not mean that all of the above activities are implemented instantly.  It is enough to carry out an initial radical attack directed at private property, and the proletariat will be forced to move further and further, all capital will be concentrated more in the hands of the state, the same applies to agriculture, industry, and transport.  This will lead to all these activities.  The organization of society, when capital, production, exchange are concentrated in the hands of the nation, creates communism.  This is a system when private property is eliminated by itself, money exchange becomes redundant, and the growth of production changes people so much that the outdated forms of society‚Äôs relations disappear. </p>
