    <p>  Power is the ability of a group of individuals or one individual to influence the activities of other people.  The essence of power is political domination over a group of people, sometimes even against their will or resistance.  Power is the core around which the life of the state revolves.  It creates forms of functioning, supports the <span>structure, hierarchy of</span> relations in society, serves as a fastening component of any society. </p><p>  Power can be based on fear or coercion, law, remuneration, benchmark, expert opinion. </p><p>  Influence refers to the behavior of a group or one individual, which has a significant impact on the activities, functioning, sensations, behavior of other people. </p><p>  Power and influence are those tools by which a group (or personality) of leaders organizes activities, resolves problems that arise.  Power is a necessary component of any organization. </p><p>  There are various forms of power and influence that have developed in the process of historical development.  Political scientists and sociologists have different approaches to their classification. </p><p>  This, firstly, depends on the definition of the word "power", which is the basis of the typology.  What some researchers consider to be a full-fledged power, others see it as one of its forms.  Thus, researchers who restrict power exclusively to the form of relations do not take into account control over production and objects.  Those who believe that power is influence classify forms according to its types.  From this position, the following forms of power are distinguished: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  coercive, fear-based; </li><li>  incentive or reward based; </li><li>  legal </li><li>  reference; </li><li>  expert. </li></ul><p>  Dispositional conceptualizations often distinguish forms of influence or power based on abilities.  This is especially noticeable in the analysis of P. Morris.  Despite the fact that he uses the term ‚Äúconcept of power‚Äù rather than form, he actually isolates it as a general or specific ability. </p><p>  Secondly, the forms of power are classified in different ways, because they take different criteria as a basis.  The most popular classification is based on the source or motives of submission. </p><p>  Thirdly, forms of power are often divided according to their fields of application.  This position allows you to isolate the power in the family, in production, economic, political, information, etc. </p><p>  From the point of view of statehood, political power is considered especially important because it permeates all institutions, people's activities, and influences <span>social relations.</span>  Political power is an institutionalized, organizational-legal type. </p><p>  All forms of <span>political power,</span> its features, functions are studied by political science or <span>political science.</span> </p><p>  Political power is specific: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ it is created by delegating certain rights and specific powers; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ always encourages, encourages to achieve goals; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ requires the concentration of rights and aspirations of people in the subjects of political power through which it is realized. </p><p>  Not all political scientists adhere to this characteristic.  Some highlight other criteria of political power: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ ability or willingness to express political will; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ the impact of political actors on the formation of the legal field, maintaining the rule of law; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ establishing dominance in society. </p><p>  Despite the fact that different political scientists consider these criteria differently, most of them are unanimous in determining its forms. </p><p>  There are such forms of power (political): </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Dominance or subordination of the majority of society to leading subjects of power. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Management involves the development of programs, goals and objectives for the development of society. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ The organization is manifested in a deliberate and deliberate influence of the authorities on all links of the public state system, objects for the implementation of the given installations. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ The control. </p>
