    <h2>  General concept </h2><p>  Administrative law as a science and academic discipline is a complex system of norms defining them as part of legal science.  First of all, it includes state-administrative public relations, administrative views, ideas, as well as primary ideas about regulatory legal acts that govern relations between individuals, citizens and state executive authorities, as well as between state and local authorities in whole. </p><p>  Administrative law as a science includes in its structure an important component, namely social life: </p><ul><li>  The conditionality and effectiveness of the adopted administrative norms. </li><li>  Patterns of development of society. </li><li>  Reform and development trends of <span>administrative law</span> as a set of managerial and organizational relations regulated by law. </li><li>  The history of the development and formation of this branch of law in the light of other humanitarian and legal sciences. </li><li>  Particular attention is paid to foreign administrative law in order to gain positive experience in the future and implement it in the norms of national legislation. </li></ul>

Like any other science and discipline, administrative law includes 2 parts: general and special. </p><p>  As for science, it duplicates the industry in terms of composition and contains the same elements.  The general part is represented by legal sources.  Here, attention is given to numerous disputes about whether a regulatory act is really a source of law, and not our multinational people, which are closely associated with this industry.  A special position in science is given to the essence of administrative law in its various understandings, to its significance both for society and for state power, as well as its subjects. </p><p>  Administrative law as a science contains a special part.  There are such vibrant sub-sectors and institutions as public services, municipal, construction, and police law.  One of the largest sub-sectors and the most volatile is social law.  There is even school and <span>business law.</span>  Of particular importance for the successful functioning of the state are independent industries, for example, tax or financial standards, which ensure the formation of the budget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="administrative law as a science and academic discipline" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43108/1599222.jpg" width="300"></div>

So, administrative law as a science is aimed at implementing a number of tasks, namely: </p><ol><li>  Identification of problems at the present stage of development of society. </li><li>  Determining the complexity of the implementation of the newly adopted norm. </li><li>  Accurate interpretation of administrative law by official sources. </li><li>  Improving the adoption and implementation of standards, as well as identifying the effectiveness of influence on state power. </li></ol><p>  Any activity, especially public authorities, is not left without attention.  The results of the tasks are as follows.  Scientific research, conclusions, recommendations for improving legislation, as well as various kinds of proposals, are regularly heard.  As a rule, prominent scientists are involved in the development of draft legal acts.  Different opinions of legal scholars allow not only to reach the truth, but also to take measures to improve the managerial mechanism in an extremely short time. </p><h2>  Scientific theoretical basis </h2><p>  Administrative law as a science is based on a certain <span>theoretical basis.</span>  Fundamental and highest priority are philosophy, the science of public administration, the <span>law of social</span> security.  When considering this issue, one cannot do without political science and sociology.  It is difficult to overestimate the contribution of such a science as the <span>theory of state and law.</span> </p><p>  It is impossible to build scientific knowledge solely on the provisions of other legal sectors.  So, the numerous opinions and assumptions of professors, doctors of legal sciences are the basis for this branch of law. </p><p>  Various types of administrative law equally require attention.  That is why in relation to a certain group of norms, it is necessary to conduct a thorough analysis of their action, perception by the subject, as well as the implementation mechanism.  Administrative law is represented as a wide variety as a science, the sources of which can be gleaned from other legal branches, as well as from all kinds of dissertations, abstracts and doctoral works. </p>

    <h2>  It is worth diving into the theory </h2><p>  Administrative law as a discipline is represented by a specially designed training course.  The Ministry of Education has determined that this subject is mandatory for any higher education institution. </p><p>  First of all, it is worth understanding what any academic discipline is - it is the knowledge brought into a single system that is presented to the student by the teaching methodology approved by the Ministry of Education.  As for the administrative branch, here the general theoretical provisions relate exclusively to public administration. </p>

    <h2>  Thematic plan </h2><p>  Administrative law as a discipline takes the basis from the thematic plan, which every teacher has and is officially fixed in the methodological manual. </p><p>  Administrative law as a science and academic discipline includes a huge number of provisions.

This document primarily contains the total number of hours that are divided into lectures, seminars and workshops. </p>

    <h2>  Lack of attention </h2><p>  As practice shows, a specific science that studies public administration and all its aspects does not contain enough hours necessary for complete assimilation of the material.  Such gaps lead to the fact that the teacher does not have time to present fully the most complicated material, and the student only briefly looks through the general provisions in order to ‚Äúat least somehow orient‚Äù.  Such a cursory review of the main provisions overlooks the most important topics related to licensing, customs, appeal to the service.  In addition, in modern society, administrative responsibility plays an important role, with which practically every citizen is familiar in practice.  Unfortunately, insufficient attention is paid to this topic. </p><h2>  Differences of discipline from science </h2><p>  Many students find it difficult to take an exam when answering the question of how administrative law as a science differs from academic discipline.  Similar, it would seem, concepts have significant differences. </p><p>  First of all, science is a complex of qualitatively new knowledge, which until a certain moment was not known to anyone.  In addition, discipline is entirely dependent on a particular science.  In turn, science can exist perfectly without academic discipline, dissolving only in certain legal acts. </p>
