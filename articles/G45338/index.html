Basic theories of human origin</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To date, there are various versions of the origin of man on Earth.  These are scientific theories, and alternative, and apocalyptic.  Many people consider themselves descendants of angels or divine powers, contrary to the convincing evidence of scientists and archaeologists.  Authoritative historians deny this theory as mythology, preferring other versions. </p><h2>  General concepts </h2><p>  Since ancient times, man has been the subject of a study of the sciences of spirit and nature.  Between sociology and science there is still a dialogue on the problem of being and the exchange of information.  At the moment, scientists have given people a specific definition.  This is a biosocial creature that combines intelligence and instincts.  It should be noted that more than one person in the world is such a creature.  A similar definition can be reliably attributed to some representatives of the fauna on Earth.  Modern science clearly separates biology and the <span>essence of man.</span>  Leading research institutes around the world are engaged in the search for the boundary between these components.  This area of ‚Äã‚Äãscience is called sociobiology.  She looks deep into the essence of man, revealing his natural and humanitarian characteristics and preferences. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-628523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/628523.jpg?1576696540"></div><p>  A holistic view of society is impossible without drawing on the data of its social philosophy.  Today, man is a creature that has an interdisciplinary nature.  However, many people around the world are concerned about another issue - its origin.  Scientists and religious scholars of the planet have been trying to give an answer to it for thousands of years. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Human Origin: Introduction </h2><p>  The question of the emergence of intelligent life on Earth attracts the attention of leading scientists of various specialties.  Some people agree that the origin of man and society is not worthy of study.  Basically, this is the opinion of those who sincerely believe in supernatural powers.  Based on this opinion about the origin of man, the individual was created by God.  This version has been denied by scientists for decades in a row.  Despite the category of citizens each person relates to, in any case, this issue will always be exciting and intriguing.  Recently, modern philosophers began to ask themselves and others: ‚ÄúWhy were people created, and what is their purpose of being on Earth?‚Äù  The answer to the second question can never be found.  As for the appearance of intelligent creatures on the planet, it is quite possible to investigate this process.  Today, the basic theories of the origin of man are trying to answer this question, however, none of them can provide a 100 percent guarantee of the correctness of their judgments.  Currently, archaeologists and astrologers around the world are exploring all kinds of sources of the origin of life on the planet, whether they are chemical, biological or morphological.  Unfortunately, at the moment, humanity has not even been able to determine in which century BC the first people appeared. </p><h2>  Darwin Theory </h2><p>  Currently, there are various versions of the origin of man.  However, the theory of a British scientist named Charles Darwin is considered the most probable and close to the truth.  It was he who made an invaluable contribution to <span>biological science.</span>  His theory is based on the definition of natural selection, which plays the role of the driving force of evolution.  This is a natural-scientific version of the origin of man and all life on the planet. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-628524" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/628524.jpg?1576696540"></div><p>  The foundation of Darwin‚Äôs theory was formed by his observations of nature while traveling around the world.  The development of the project was started in 1837, and lasted more than 20 years.  At the end of the 19th century, the Englishman was supported by another natural scientist - Alfred Wallace.  Soon after his report in London, he admitted that it was Charles who was his mastermind.  So a whole direction appeared - Darwinism.  The followers of this movement agree that all types of representatives of the fauna and flora on Earth are variable and come from other, previously existing species.  Thus, the theory is based on the inconstancy of all living things in nature.  The reason for this is natural selection.  Only the strongest forms survive on the planet, which are able to adapt to the current environmental conditions.  Man is just such a creature.  Thanks to evolution and the desire to survive, people began to develop their skills and knowledge. </p><h2>  Intervention theory </h2><p>  The basis of this version of the origin of man is the activity of extraneous civilizations.  It is believed that humans are descendants of alien creatures that landed on Earth millions of years ago.  Such a story of the origin of man has several interchanges at once.  According to some, people appeared as a result of crossing aliens with ancestors.  Others believe that genetic engineering of higher forms of reason, which derived homo sapiens from the flask and their own DNA, is to blame.  Someone is sure that people happened as a result of experiments with animals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-628525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/628525.jpg?1576696540"></div><p>  On the other hand, the version of an alien intervention in the evolutionary development of homo sapiens is very interesting and probable.  It is no secret that archaeologists still find in various parts of the world numerous drawings, records, and other evidence that some supernatural forces helped the ancient people.  This also applies to the Maya Indians, who were allegedly enlightened by extraterrestrial creatures with wings on strange celestial chariots.  There is also a theory that the whole life of mankind from origin to the peak of evolution proceeds according to a long-established program laid down by an alien mind.  There are alternative versions of the resettlement of earthlings from the planets of such systems and constellations as Sirius, Scorpio, Libra, etc. </p><h2>  Evolutionary theory </h2><p>  The followers of this version believe that the appearance of man on Earth is associated with the modification of primates.  This theory is by far the most common and discussed.  Proceeding from it, people evolved from certain species of monkeys.  Evolution began in time immemorial under the influence of natural selection and other external factors.  The theory of evolution really has a number of interesting evidence and evidence, both archaeological, paleontological, genetic, and psychological.  On the other hand, each of these statements can be interpreted differently.  The ambiguity of the facts - this is what does not make this version 100% true. </p><h2>  Theory of Creation </h2><p>  This branch is called "creationism."  His followers deny all the basic theories of human origin.  It is believed that God created people, who is the highest link in the world.  Man was created in his likeness from non-biological material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-628526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/628526.jpg?1576696540"></div><p>  The biblical version of the theory says that the first people were Adam and Eve.  God created them from clay.  In Egypt and many other countries, religion goes far into ancient myths.  The vast majority of skeptics consider this theory impossible, estimating its probability in billions of a percent.  The version of the creation of all living things by God does not require proof, it simply exists and has the right to do so.  In her support, one can cite similar examples from legends and myths of peoples of different corners of the Earth.  These parallels cannot be ignored. </p><h2>  Theory of Space Anomalies </h2><p>  This is one of the most controversial and fantastic versions of anthropogenesis.  Followers of the theory consider the appearance of man on Earth an accident.  According to them, people have become the fruit of the anomaly of parallel spaces.  The forefathers of earthlings were representatives of the humanoid civilization, which are a mixture of Matter, Aura and Energy.  The theory of anomalies suggests that in the Universe there are millions of planets with similar biospheres that were created by a single information substance.  Under favorable conditions, this leads to the emergence of life, that is, a humanoid mind.  Otherwise, this theory is largely similar to evolutionary, with the exception of the statement about a certain program for the development of mankind. </p><h2>  Aquatic theory </h2><p>  This version of the origin of man on Earth is almost 100 years old.  In the 1920s, the aquatic theory was first proposed by a famous marine biologist named Alistair Hardy, who was subsequently supported by another authoritative scientist, German Max Westenhoffer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-628527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/628527.jpg?1576696540"></div><p>  The version is based on the dominant factor that made humanoid primates enter a new stage of development.  This is what forced the monkeys to exchange the aquatic lifestyle for land.  So the hypothesis explains the lack of a thick hairline on the body.  Thus, at the first stage of evolution, man moved from the hydropithecus stage, which appeared more than 12 million years ago, to homo erectus, and then sapiens.  Today this version is practically not considered in science. </p><h2>  Alternative Theories </h2><p>  One of the most fabulous versions of the origin of man on the planet is that the descendants of humans were some bats creatures.  In some religions they are called angels.  It is these creatures from time immemorial that populated the entire Earth.  Their appearance was similar to harpy (a mixture of birds and humans).  The existence of such creatures is supported by numerous cave paintings.  There is another theory according to which people in the early stages of development were real giants.  According to some legends, such a giant was a half-human demigod, since one of their parents was an angel.  Over time, higher powers ceased to descend to Earth, and the giants disappeared. </p><h2>  Ancient myths </h2><p>  A lot of legends and legends exist about the origin of man.  In ancient Greece, it was believed that the ancestors of the people were Deucalion and Pyrrhus, who, by the will of the gods, survived the flood and created a new race of stone statues.  Ancient Chinese believed that the first man was shapeless and came out of a clay coma. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-628528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/628528.jpg?1576696540"></div><p>  The creator of people is the goddess Nuiva.  She was a man and a dragon all rolled into one.  According to Turkish legend, people left Black Mountain.  In her cave there was a pit, which resembled the appearance of the human body.  A stream of rain washed clay into it.  When the form was filled and warmed up by the sun, the first person came out of it.  His name is Ai-Atam.  Myths about the origin of man of the Sioux Indians say that people created the Rabbit universe.  The divine creature found a blood clot and began to play with it.  Soon, he began to roll on the ground and turned into guts.  Then, a heart and other organs appeared on a blood clot.  As a result, the rabbit dashed off a full-fledged boy - the ancestor of the Sioux.  According to ancient Mexicans, God created the appearance of man from pottery clay.  But due to the fact that he overexposed the workpiece in the furnace, the man turned out to be burnt, that is, black.  Subsequent attempts, over and over again, got better, and people came out whiter.  The Mongol tradition is one in one similar to Turkish.  Man emerged from the clay form.  The only difference is that God himself dug a hole. </p><h2>  Evolutionary stages </h2><p>  Despite the versions of the origin of man, all scientists agree that the stages of its development were identical.  The first upright prototypes of people were Australopithecus, which communicated with each other with the help of hands and were no higher than 130 cm. The next stage of evolution produced the Pithecanthropus.  These creatures already knew how to use fire and adjust nature to their own needs (stones, skin, bones).  Further, the evolution of man reached the paleoanthropus.  At this time, the types of people could already communicate with sounds, think collectively.  The last stage of evolution before the advent of <span>Homo sapiens</span> became neoanthropes.  Outwardly, they practically did not differ from modern people.  They made tools, united in tribes, elected leaders, arranged voting, ceremonies. </p><h2>  The ancestral home of humanity </h2><p>  Despite the fact that scientists and historians around the world are still arguing about theories of the origin of people, it was still possible to establish the exact place where the mind was born.  This is the African continent.  Many archaeologists believe that it is possible to narrow the location to the north-eastern part of the mainland, although there is an opinion about the dominance of the southern half in this matter.  On the other hand, there are people who are confident that humanity has appeared in Asia (in India and surrounding countries).  The conclusions that the first people settled in Africa were made after numerous finds as a result of large-scale excavations.  It is noted that at that time there were several types of prototype of a person (race) at once. </p><h2>  The strangest archaeological finds </h2><p>  Among the most interesting artifacts that can affect the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat the origin and development of man really was, were the skulls of ancient people with horns.  Archaeological research was carried out in the Gobi desert by a Belgian expedition in the mid-20th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-628529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/628529.jpg?1576696540"></div><p>  On the territory of the former <span>Sumerian civilization</span> , images of flying people and objects heading for the Earth from outside the solar system were repeatedly found.  Several other ancient tribes have similar drawings.  In 1927, as a result of excavations in the Caribbean, a strange transparent skull, similar to a crystal one, was found.  Numerous studies have not revealed the technology and material of manufacture.  Descendants of <span>the Mayan tribe</span> claim that their ancestors worshiped this skull, like a supreme deity. </p>
