    <p>  Especially tourists revere the <span>forts of Kronstadt:</span> fantastic fortification barriers designed to protect the Russian coast.  You will not see such a heritage anywhere else.  Fort ‚ÄúKonstantin‚Äù is twice unique - it is the largest artillery fortress.  Until recently, penetrating an object was very problematic. </p><p>  Later, the construction passed into the hands of the son of the director of the commercial company Third Park, which is engaged in bus transportation.  Thanks to this, the territory was modernized; a floating hotel-fort ‚ÄúKonstantin‚Äù was built on it.  A <span>helipad was</span> built near the hotel <span>.</span>  Now this is one of the main attractions of the city of Kronstadt.  Everyone can visit the fortress at an additional cost. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General Hotel Information </h2><p>  It began to function for the first time in 2007.

    <p>  Customers who come to rest at Fort Konstantin in Kronstadt will not have to worry about the safety and security of their own car.  For guests provided parking space is absolutely free.  The same applies to water transport.  Wi-Fi is available throughout.  For the smoking audience, special places are allocated. </p><p>  If you have valuable things with you, then it is recommended that you leave them in a safe, which is located in the registration department.  A sports equipment point is also open here.  There are all the necessary fishing equipment.  In summer, a well-kept and clean beach is open - it is not at all necessary to travel to overseas countries to swim and sunbathe. </p><p>  Fort Konstantin pays special attention to corporate leisure.  The hotel specializes in conducting and organizing major celebrations.  Professional staff regularly hold incendiary parties for customers.  You do not need to invent anything yourself, worry about the show program and the dishes served.  It has high-quality equipment and spacious rooms.
