The elevator works without interruptions.  Wi-Fi is free, but not of very good quality.  Although it is quite enough to post a photo on Instagram. </p><p>  Not all vacationers are happy with the location of the hotel.  The authors of the reviews say that it is necessary to go about 1 km to the sea, and the relief is rather uneven: either the descent from the mountain or the rise.  Out of habit, this can be difficult, hotel guests share, legs ache in the morning.  Care must be taken during the descent: on the left at the turn is very slippery - many fall there.  There are either no sidewalks in the city, or there are, but they are very narrow.  You have to get to the beach along a busy road.  This is quite dangerous, tourists are sure, especially if you have to go along this road with children. </p><p>  About the rooms in the hotel "Diana" guests respond as a bit cramped, modest.  Contrary to advertising, not all of them have air conditioning, a hairdryer and a refrigerator.  There is a fan, which vacationers use during the afternoon nap.  And at night it was comfortable to sleep, and so.  The shower in the rooms is not equipped with a bathtub, under it it is supposed to stand directly on the floor.  Room cleaning, according to reviews, is carried out daily, but not very thorough.  Carpeted floors are constantly covered with sand.  Some rooms have laminate flooring. </p><p>  The nutrition of many is quite satisfied.  Sweet is not always, only for dinner.  But fruits are served daily - for lunch and dinner: ripe, tasty watermelons, plums, oranges, peaches. </p>

    <p>  The minus guests consider that the staff does not replenish the coffee machine on time, as well as the devices "Tea" and "Juices".  Of the three juices, usually only one, the rest is water.  Tea is delicious, guests share, not black, but from herbs.  The hotel guests are mostly satisfied with the food: vegetables, meat, feta cheese, noodles, olives, and for breakfast - delicious fresh buns: with poppy seeds, jam (pink), cottage cheese, sausage.  The pool bar serves drinks, which are included in the price.  Some vacationers complain of disrespectful attitude to the guests of the bar workers. </p><p>  At 20.00, tourists say, children's animation begins at the hotel, and children participate in it with pleasure.  From 20.30 to 22.00 animation for teens is held.  If the windows of the room overlook the pool, then the squeal and screams of young people will not let you fall asleep until 22.30.  A closed balcony does not save the situation. </p><p>  The sea, according to reviews, is warm, clean.  On a cozy sandy beach it is usually quite crowded.  Sun loungers, mattresses and umbrellas are available on the beach for a fee.  Some tourists rent them, some buy, while others do without them.  On the beach, tourists say, lifeguards work. </p><p>  The swimming pool at the hotel is divided into 2 parts of different depths: 0.5 m (children's section) and 1.6 m (for adults).  In the children's section, children can swim alone, without adults and life-saving appliances.  They just get their feet to the bottom, parents tell, and can, playing in the water, walk on it. </p>

    <p>  In general, guests are happy with the rest at the Diana Hotel.  The pluses include good food, the presence of a convenient swimming pool, and animation.  The downside is considered poor insulation in the rooms and some crowding.  The guests express their desire to visit Diana once again.  The hotel is highly recommended as a place where you can relax inexpensively and efficiently. </p>
