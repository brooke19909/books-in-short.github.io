    <h2>  Where did they come from </h2><p>  The number of this Native American people was about 1.3 million people.  According to legend, the homeland of the Aztecs was the island of Astlan (translated as ‚Äúheron country‚Äù).  Initially, the members of this tribe were hunters, but then, settling on the ground, they began to engage in agricultural and craft work, although it was a rather warlike tribe.  The Aztecs, in order to begin to lead a <span>sedentary lifestyle,</span> for a rather long time looking for suitable land.  They acted not at random, but in accordance with the direction of their god, Huitzilopochtli.  In his opinion, the Aztecs should have seen an eagle sitting on a cactus and devouring the earth. </p>

    <h2>  This happened </h2><p>  Despite the strangeness of this sign, after 165 years of wandering around the Mexican land, the Aztecs still managed to meet this mysterious bird with unusual behavior.  In the place where this happened, and the tribe began to settle.  The Aztecs called their first settlement Tenochtitlan (translated - "fruit tree growing from stone").  Another name for these lands is Mexico City.  Interestingly, the Aztec civilization was created by several tribes.  Scientists believe that at least seven tribes who spoke related languages ‚Äã‚Äãtook part in this, the most common of which was Nahuatl.  Now more than 1 million people speak it and dialects similar to it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Bottoms and tops </h2><p>  Can the Aztec civilization serve as an example for the modern organization of society?  Fighters for equality probably would not have liked the Aztec division into aristocrats and plebeians.  Moreover, members of high society had all the best.  They lived in magnificent palaces, wore magnificent clothes, ate delicious food, had many privileges, and held high positions.  The plebeians worked on the land, traded, hunted, fished, and did not live well in special neighborhoods.  But after death, everyone received equal chances to get into the underworld, the abode of the death goddess Miktlan, or go to a better world.  Since warriors in the Aztec world enjoyed special respect, those who died on the battlefield could accompany the sun from sunrise to zenith, just like those who were sacrificed.  The honor to accompany the sun from the zenith to sunset was given to women who died in childbirth.  Those who were killed by lightning or drowned can also be considered ‚Äúlucky ones."  They ended up in a heavenly place where <span>the rain god</span> Tlalocan lived. </p>

    <h2>  Fathers and Sons </h2><p>  The tribe referred to in this article paid great attention to the education of children.  Until 1 year old, they were brought up at home, and after that they had to attend special schools.  Moreover, both boys and girls, although the latter, most often, having married, sat at home and watched the household and children.  The common people were trained in craft skills, military affairs.  Aristocrats studied history, astronomy, social studies, ceremonies, management.  The children of high society members were not Belorussians.  They worked on public works, cleaned in temples, participated in rites.  Starikov was waiting for honor, respect and various privileges. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Aztec Culture </h2><p>  No wonder this lost civilization attracts attention today.  The Aztecs were excellent craftsmen, so buildings, sculptures, stone and clay products, fabrics, and jewelry were of high quality.  The Aztecs were especially distinguished by the ability to make a variety of products from the bright feathers of tropical birds.  Aztec mosaics and ornaments are also famous.  Aristocrats were fond of literature.  Many of them could compose a poem or write an oral work.  Legends, legends, poems, descriptions of the rites of this people have survived to this day.  Book paper was made from bark.  The calendars created by this tribe are also interesting.  The Aztecs used the solar and ritual calendar.  In accordance with the solar calendar, agricultural work and religious work were carried out.  It consisted of 365 days.  The second calendar, which includes 260 days, was used for predictions.  The fate of a person was judged by the day he was born.  Until now, many treasure hunters dream of finding Aztec gold.  And they once lived very richly.  This is evidenced by the stories of the Spanish conquerors.  They say that the rich Aztecs, especially in the capital Tenochtitlan, ate and slept in gold.  Gold thrones were installed for their gods, at the foot of which gold bullions also lay. </p>

    <h2>  Aztec Religion </h2><p>  People from this tribe believed that there were several gods who govern the forces of nature and the destinies of people.  They had gods of water, maize, rain, sun, war and many others.  The Aztecs built huge, richly decorated temples.  The largest was dedicated to the main deity Tenochtitlan and was 46 meters high.  Rituals and sacrifices were held in temples.  The Aztecs also had an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe soul.  They believed that her place of residence in man is the heart and blood vessels.  Heartbeat was taken as its manifestation.  According to the Aztecs, the soul was put into the human body by the gods at a time when he was in the womb.  They also believed that the soul possess objects and animals.  The Aztecs imagined that there was a special connection between them that allowed them to interact on an intangible level.  The Aztecs also thought that every person has a magic double.  His death led to the death of man.  As a victim, the Aztecs offered their own blood to their idols.  For this, a bloodletting ceremony was performed.  In general, the Aztecs made human sacrifices in huge quantities.  It is a known fact that 2,000 people were sacrificed during the coverage of the Great Temple.  The Aztecs thought about the end of the world and believed that a large amount of blood could appease the gods and maintain global balance. </p><p>  The Aztec civilization died due to the greed of the Spaniards.  This happened at the beginning of the XVI century, but still the imagination excites the history of the life of the tribe, which disappeared from the face of the earth.  Whether the Aztec gold brings happiness, everyone will decide for himself. </p>
