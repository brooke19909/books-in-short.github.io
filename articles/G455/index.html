  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Professional camera: how much, overview, specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you need to upgrade a professional camera or have a desire to do photography all the time, you need to be well versed in high-end cameras.  The market offers many brands with a wide variety of specifications.  As a rule, professionals need a good SLR or mirrorless camera that will do its job better and longer than the previous one. </p><p>  Find the best option will help comparing the specifications of each brand.  In this case, how much a professional camera costs, its resolution, autofocus quality, shooting speed, type or screen size is crucial.  To achieve the best result, you need to carefully consider what is required from a high-end camera. </p><h2>  How to choose a professional-grade camera? </h2><p>  All photographers want the best camera ever.  And keep up with the latest development trends of DSLR technology and accessories.  Those who purchase a camera have a large selection.  Therefore, both when updating the old model, and when buying a new one, it is necessary to conduct a thorough study.  Below are the main indicators, the assessment of which will make the right choice for a professional camera. </p><h2>  Optics </h2><p>  An important feature of an ideal camera is its compatible lens system.  Optics is the most important tool for assessing image quality and can be a decisive factor in whether an image is ordinary or professional.  It is necessary to take into account the compatibility of the available lens kit with the camera model you are interested in.  Moreover, optics is the most constant part of the investment, because the housing changes more often. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sensor size </h2><p>  Professional cameras have minimal shutter speeds, maximum shooting speeds, high levels of detail and clarity of photos and videos.  It all depends on the image sensor and GPU performance.  The photographer must know which camera he needs, including the required image capture mechanism. </p><p>  Image sensors for professional cameras are available in two sizes - full-frame and APS-C (DX).  The latter is smaller than the first, based on traditional sizes of 35 mm film: 36 x 24 mm.  The dimensions of the APS-C are about 23.5 x 15.6 mm, which corresponds to the crop factor of 1.5x (1.6x for Canon).  Thus, the 50 mm focal length of a full-frame camera is 75 mm, which can be claimed by sports reporters and wildlife photographers.  Full-frame lenses provide higher image quality and more effective shooting in dark conditions.  How much a professional camera costs, as well as its physical dimensions, also depends on the size of the sensor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon EOS 6D" class="if uuid-2372836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2372836.jpg"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Digital cameras should be judged on the basis of the most common and comparable parameters, including resolution, screen size, maximum ISO sensitivity, burst speed and video settings.  Assessing each of these points and creating a hierarchy will help you find a model that will fit the needs of the photographer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Connectivity options </h2><p>  Cameras can have one or more slots for memory cards, several ports and interfaces.  There are models with headphone jacks, an external microphone, and sync flash.  Therefore, before choosing a camera, you need to decide on the necessary set of connectivity options, including wireless ones. </p><h2>  Application area </h2><p>  Some professional cameras are designed for special purposes.  These include models with the ability to shoot at high speed in low light.  They are ideal for journalists, sports reporters and wildlife photographers.  Another category includes cameras with ultra-high resolution.  They are also used by professional photographers involved in the shooting of goods or portraits.  Some models can perform many tasks, including simultaneously capturing photos and videos. </p><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  Professional camera manufacturers compete fiercely for the attention of the target audience.  The more features the camera has, the more attractive it is for customers.  Manual adjustments to exposure compensation, shutter speed, focus points and bracketing enhance the user's creativity.  You need to look for a camera that offers maximum functionality. </p><h2>  Accessories Support </h2><p>  Regardless of how much a professional camera costs, it should use flash units, remote controls or tripods without any problems.  Some models are equipped with a built-in flash, the performance of which can be easily improved with an external flash.  Other cameras are equipped with optional battery holders, which are a great solution for many hours of shooting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The following is a review of professional cameras that are most popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon EOS 5D Mk IV" class="if uuid-2372819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2372819.jpg"></div><h2>  Canon EOS 5D Mark IV </h2><p>  This legendary camera boasts high-end features and is one of the best professional digital SLR cameras.  <span>The Canon 5D</span> features a 30-megapixel full-frame image sensor and the latest 16-point AF system with 41 cross-shaped sensors.
