Many tariff plans, different operators.  Thin cases of ultranovye devices with improved indicators of clarity, brightness, memory and much more.  Comparison of dreams and a satisfied smile - "I have better."  Today, a mobile phone, not a book, is the best gift for many on their birthday, and indeed on any holiday in general. </p><p>  It is difficult, and probably not everyone will be able to remember when they presented their friend, or girlfriend, or relative with a portable radio station.  In the understanding of many, a walkie-talkie is primarily a means of communication between traffic police officers: we all see, passing through their posts, how they talk to each other about it.  The police also have walkie-talkies.  Young people play airsoft, paintball and there they also use walkie-talkies.  Thus, portable radios occupy a strictly defined but small area in our everyday life. </p><p>  If you ask on the street: ‚ÄúWhich is better - a walkie-talkie or a mobile phone?‚Äù, Preference will be unconditionally given to the latter.  But in vain.  The owner of the radio: </p><ul><li>  does not pay operators for hours of negotiations, because the device operates on free radio frequencies, on average up to 10 km between subscribers; </li><li>  does not suffer from the fact that his gadget crashed from falling to the floor, from getting dirt or moisture on it: the walkie-talkie is protected from this; </li><li>  the device keeps charging much longer than the best mobile phone; </li><li>  He‚Äôs not afraid that his child will accidentally go into the wrong application or the wrong site, and will have to spend money on accidentally downloaded paid content; </li><li>  in a camping trip through the woods, at a ski resort, on a trip to the Tien Shan - he can always and everywhere contact the members of the walkie-talkie group; </li><li>  when traveling in several cars, he communicates with all friends traveling with him at least all the way; </li><li>  can talk on the walkie-talkie even while roaming. </li></ul><p>  Some resourceful users of mobile phones such as smartphones can even find the Mobile Walkie Talkie application for them, which allows them to contact about 100 subscribers of their network, you just need to know all the numbers and be able to catch the signal.  True, to communicate with strangers on the radio here will not work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, where the equipment gets stuck in the mud, money for paying for the services of a mobile operator is over or there is simply no signal, the phone is out of order due to banal heat or frost, it fell and crashed, only a walkie-talkie can resist. </p>

    <h2>  The concept of the radio, ranges </h2><p>  A walkie-talkie is a communication device operating on radio frequencies.  Hence one of the possibilities of their classification: according to the frequency used. </p><p>  Those who still have Soviet multifunctional products combining a lamp television, above which there is a record player under the lid, and a radio with keys under the television screen, remember that the latter had the inscriptions - HF (short waves), VHF (ultrashort waves), SW (medium waves), DW (decimeter waves).  They helped the radio amateur find the right radio range and listen to their favorite program or catch unknown signals. </p><p>  By the way, on one of these waves on March 19, 1965, an unknown Soviet radio amateur received a signal from the landing capsule Voskhoda-2 with the astronauts Leonov and Belyaev, which saved their life. </p><p>  So, walkie-talkies can also be distributed on these "keys": </p><ul><li>  <em>Low-frequency, or short-wave (HF).</em> </li></ul><p>  It uses a frequency from 0.1 to 28 MHz.  This is the so-called amateur range.  On it, "sitting" tourists, hams. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  <em>Medium wave (NE).</em> </li></ul><p>  The frequency from 26 to 30 MHz is used here.  This frequency range is usually called ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù because it is intended for mass use by the civilian population both in the city and in the village. </p><ul><li>  <em>The ‚Äúservice‚Äù range (LB) is from 30 to 50 MHz.</em> </li></ul><p>  It has walkie-talkies of military and law enforcement agencies. </p><ul><li>  <em>High Frequency Range (VHF).</em> </li></ul><p>  Works from 136 to 172 MHz.  It is also not for everyone and involves obtaining a license to use. </p><ul><li>  <em>Ultra High Frequency (UHF).</em> </li></ul><p>  It assumes a spread from 420 to 473 MHz. </p><h2>  Classification </h2><p>  As can be seen from this classification, for each wavelength range has formed its own audience.  And this did not happen by chance, but largely due to the nature of the connection itself at each of the indicated frequencies. </p><p>  So, low-frequency (from 0.1 to 28 MHz) radios are more applicable on a flat area away from sources of electromagnetic radiation, in other words - power lines.  The fact is that obstacles such as hilly or mountainous terrain become an insurmountable obstacle for such waves, since they do not have enough length to go around them.  And electromagnetic pulses give a lot of interference in communication. </p><p>  For the urban environment, ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù and ‚Äúservice‚Äù equipment has been developed, adapted to operate at wavelengths, respectively, from 26 to 30 MHz and from 30 to 50 MHz.  But she, of course, suffers from the power lines stretched out in the city, large buildings.  Therefore, manufacturers integrate special noise suppressors into it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Therefore, many users for urban conditions consider optimal high-frequency or ultra-high-frequency radios from 136 to 172 MHz and from 420 to 473 MHz, respectively. </p>

    <p>  This frequency classification defines all further walkie-talkie group distributions. </p><p>  <em>By mobility:</em> </p><ul><li>  Stationary: in a special-purpose vehicle (ambulance, police, etc.), and portable: walkie-talkies that they carry with them in the manner of cell phones. </li></ul><p>  <em>By territoriality:</em> </p><ul><li>  for city and country; </li><li>  for land and water transport; </li></ul><p>  <em>By the nature of use:</em> </p><ul><li>  amateur and professional. </li></ul><p>  You can classify radios further, but frequency gradation is the most defining option when choosing the right device. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The invention of a portable radio station is the work of many.  Each of them, investing their developments, brought the idea closer to the modern embodiment.  In the 19th century, at about the same time, parallel work was going on in different countries around the world, but only Malon Lumis (1872) was the first to patent authorship for wireless communications. </p><p>  Despite this, until the end of the century, many more patents were registered, which belonged to such well-known scientists as G. Herz and N. Tesla.  In Russia, the history of Russian radiotelephony is associated with A. S. Popov. </p><p>  Mass production for the various needs of the common population, and not the country's military system, received radiotelephones after the Second World War.  In the post-war <span>Soviet Union, the</span> emergence of a domestic version of a portable radiotelephone was associated with the name of the inventor Leonid Kupriyanovich and his "cell phone" the size of a palm and a disk dialer (1957).  In addition, from the 60s and almost until recently, in the pilot project mode, the Altai system worked in some regions of the country, sharpened to the 150 band, then 330 MHz.  But, like Kupriyanovich‚Äôs portable radio telephone, Altai began to be used for the needs of the nomenclature and special services and was not widely used throughout the country. </p><p>  Currently, in Russia there are single enterprises producing portable walkie-talkies.  For example, the design office "Berkut" produces a full range of devices for professional and amateur use.  The products of this company find a lot of positive reviews. </p><p>  In the United States, Motorola, which is one of the leaders in their production to this day, was primarily engaged in these devices.  But she now has competitors with equally attractive offers - firms Kenwood, MegaJet, Baofeng and others. </p><h2>  Baofeng or Pofung? </h2><p>  The Chinese company Fujian Nanan Baofeng Electronic Co., Ltd (Baofeng) specializes in developing its own technical solutions in the production of radio stations and accessories for them with various specifications (batteries, programmers, battery compartments, antennas, cases and headsets).  In addition, Baofeng fulfills warranty obligations to buyers of its products. </p>

    <p>  Baofeng was founded in 2001 by Chinese entrepreneur Mr. Wang Jinding.  Today, it is one of the leaders in its own developments in the field of creating portable radio stations of various specifications and sells them worldwide. </p><p>  All these years, the company improved and expanded its production.  Her strategic direction of development is the markets of Europe and the USA, where in recent years she has already received certification for her products, including walkie-talkies of the UV-3R and UV-5R series, and is engaged in their promotion.  Now its relatively cheap, like many Chinese developments, portable radio stations can be purchased in Russia, on the corresponding specialized sales sites of this equipment. </p><p>  Today, Baofeng is a large high-tech enterprise located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã30,000 square meters, which serves about 400 employees.  Here is the center for product development, testing and multi-stage quality control. </p><p>  All production procedures strictly comply with ISO 9001: 2008. </p><p>  But Baofeng's high quality goods may have created problems for her.  Users believe that the decision she has currently announced to begin a smooth rebranding process for the products she launches for international markets is justified by her desire to protect herself from the mass of fakes. </p><p>  The management of the company support a different point of view.  It is indicated that the change of product brand to Pofung is just a marketing move, with the aim of improving the phonetic perception of the brand name overseas.  For China, products will be shipped under the former name of Baofeng.  Changes will also not affect the company‚Äôs web domain.  It is believed that these measures will not only allow finding new markets for their products, but also preserve the history and continuity of traditions within the company. </p><h2>  Factory characteristics of the model </h2><p>  One of the most popular walkie-talkie models today is the Baofeng UV-82.  The best price of a walkie-talkie in online stores is 1390 rubles. </p>

    <p>  It should be borne in mind that the sensitivity of the device decreases sharply when working near power lines, high-rise buildings or natural elevations.  The freer the space, the clearer the communication and its range increases.  Of course, walkie-talkies are equipped with noise suppressors, and the most powerful examples of this communication equipment cope well with these difficulties. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of Baofeng UV-82, as well as by its characteristics, due to the too wide range of reception, exciting and service frequencies, its owners will have to obtain a license (permits) for it through a local radio club or communication inspection. </p><h2>  Features, differences </h2><p>  Many amateurs and professionals have long tested the Baofeng UV-82 radio station.  Reviews of these tests revealed some of its features: </p><ul><li>  when using a walkie-talkie in a car, the body shields the radio waves; </li><li>  approaching the walkie-talkie to metal structures or equipment introduces interference into its operation; </li><li>  range indicators Baofeng UV-82 in the city - up to 7 km, outside the city on an empty highway - up to 10-11 km; </li><li>  the higher the receiving point, the fewer obstacles to signal transmission and the better the quality of communication; </li></ul><p>  "Baofeng UV-82" has an improved version - UV-82 HX.  This is a true dual-band professional radio station, fully keyboard-controlled. </p><p>  From its previous version of UV-82, the UV-82 HX model is essentially distinguished by an output power increased up to 8 W and a more capacious 2800 mAh battery. </p><p>  It is curious that the company still can not decide on the power parameters of the device, because, judging by the reviews of Baofeng UV-82, back in 2013 this series had a power of 8 watts, and since 2014 - only 5 watts.  Most likely, this was a marketing move, because now the claimed power of 8 W has an improved series of this Baofeng UV-82 HX. </p><p>  The exterior design has also been slightly redesigned.  The company took into account consumer complaints and created a dual PTT button, which made switching frequencies more convenient.

    <h2>  Negative reviews about Baofeng UV-82 </h2><p> Probably, in nature there is nothing that could not be evaluated only positively.  In the production of communication equipment, and so oriented on the diverse tastes of consumers, the latter are still waiting for updated models and improvements.  Criticism regarding the particular model under consideration is small, but it is still present: </p><ul><li>  when selling Baofeng UV-82 walkie-talkie in stores, it happens that a headset is removed from the packaging - headphones to sell them separately; </li><li>  the battery capacity in practice is slightly less than declared; </li><li>  Compared to a similar <span>Motorola walkie-talkie, the</span> maximum sound settings are lower; </li><li>  long antenna </li><li>  short range - 10-11 km, which makes it impossible to use it far beyond the city. </li></ul><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  In almost any company of friends there are those who like a more or less extreme vacation.  Someone goes to ski resorts, others travel in hot countries or rafting on Siberian rivers.  There are many people who prefer to go on holiday to their grandmother in a distant Russian village to dig a garden.  What unites all these people?  Probably, special character traits: determination, composure, ability to concentrate, endurance.  In any case, these are extraordinary people, and their reports published on social networks about their outdoor activities gain hundreds of thousands of responses. </p><p>  At home, such friends always have bags and backpacks specially prepared for such travels.  Such people do not need to elaborate and write down a list of necessary things on paper for a long time: it is already ‚Äúrun-in‚Äù and memorized by heart.  To miss something from this list is simply unrealistic, because there are no trifles in it, each thing has practical meaning, the successful outcome of the enterprise directly depends on it. </p><p>  And of course, modern communications are an indispensable attribute of any such trip.  But no matter how good this or that device of cellular communication, sometimes it becomes powerless against the forces of nature.  Differences in the height of the Far Eastern hills, Siberian forests or mountain gorges ringing silence - all this levels almost all the achievements of modern civilization, and a person has to unwittingly return to an almost primitive way of life for the entire period of forced isolation from the world. </p><p>  For such conditions, a communication device was developed - a radio station, abbreviated in everyday life called a walkie-talkie.  It allows you to have both a communication tool and a wide range of radio stations. </p><p>  According to reviews by both amateurs and professionals, the Baofeng UV-82 portable radio station is one of the best deals on the radio equipment market.  Considering criticism, consumers give her a solid 4.8 out of 5 quality points. In the Baofeng UV-82 model, the battery is quite capacious, it does not last about 12 hours, which is its advantage. </p><p>  The goods of this company are traded in various online stores.  Radios "Baofeng" are in great demand due to its quality and low cost. </p>

    <p>  As for the activities of the manufacturer, it shows its interest in the constant introduction of new technologies into production, improving the consumer qualities of its products.  This is a nice example illustrating the oncoming movement of developers and sellers to the consumer. </p>
