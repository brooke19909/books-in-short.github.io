  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why visit China Hotels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Surprisingly, for some reason, our compatriots rarely travel to China for the purpose of relaxation.  This country, at the same time both traditional and modern, seems more attractive from the point of view of business and <span>business negotiations,</span> in not spending holidays.  But China is not only modern technology and the most accurate electronics, but also amazing poetry, science and art, the magnificent beaches of Hainan, the eternal snows on the mountain slopes of Tibet, traditional medicine that does not lose popularity and, of course, hospitable and comfortable hotels in China. </p><p>  This ancient state is able to receive tourists throughout the year.  At any time, you can visit the famous Beijing Opera and the equally famous, legendary Shaolin Monastery, take a walk along the <span>Great Wall of China</span> and the streets of the Forbidden City, or admire the power and grandeur of the <span>terracotta army.</span>  Everyone will be able to learn something new about this extraordinary country. </p><p>  It should be noted that excellent reviews about hotels in China and leisure not in the territory of this state diverge not only within the immediate "neighbors" - Russia and Japan, but also in other countries.  In local hotels, guests will find an excellent level of comfort, the attractiveness of the hotel itself and the design of each room, as well as the convenient location, which distinguishes almost all the hotels in China, and a large list of services they provide.  Due to the fact that the government is allocating more funds from the budget to the development of tourism and hotel infrastructure, many hotels in China not only meet international standards, but also significantly surpass them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An example is the Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing Hotel - luxurious and modern, located a few kilometers from Beijing Airport and East Railway Station.  The Forbidden City Street and Tiananmen Square are nearby.  Everyone will stay in this place - with high-quality rooms and great views, a modern gym and large elite restaurants.  Ladies can indulge in relaxing massages and a visit to the beauty salon, and the whole family will appreciate traditional Chinese dishes and a long tea ceremony.  Of the shortcomings of this hotel, it should be noted only the high cost of living in it, for most tourists with an average income inaccessible.  However, as you know, you have to pay for quality. </p><p>  Shanghai guests will be able to stay at the Oriental Riverside Bund View Hotel, an elite, upscale and modern hotel, equally suitable for family vacations or business meetings in an informal setting.  Like some other hotels in China, this one is located in the city center, not far from People's Square.  Spa centers, beauty and massage rooms, saunas, restaurants and cafes - this is an incomplete list of everything that is available to hotel guests.  They can go in for fitness or active sports on the tennis court and in the pool, or they can go on city tours organized by the hotel‚Äôs tour desk, which is very convenient.  Separately, it must be said that each restaurant located on the territory of the hotel offers guests a wide selection of various dishes not only from traditional Chinese, but also from Asian or European cuisines.  In addition to the high cost, however, this hotel has another major drawback - the lack of the possibility of living with children.  There is little space for games, no playgrounds are provided, and too noisy and ‚Äúadult‚Äù night programs are held. </p><p>  If you want to relax and at the same time improve your health, then hotels in China offer the widest possibilities for this.  For example, the hotel "Pearl River Garden 4 *", in the territory of which is the largest and most popular medical and health center of traditional Chinese medicine.  For our compatriots, this hotel is very convenient, largely because in this place the majority of doctors and staff speak Russian, restaurants have a menu in this language, and many guests from Russia regularly relax.  However, many Russian tourists, on the contrary, would like to relax where there are fewer of their compatriots.  In this regard, the hotel is absolutely not suitable for them. </p>
