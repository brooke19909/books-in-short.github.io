Baking soda: formula, application</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sometimes a completely ordinary and familiar from childhood substance is almost a panacea for many diseases and ailments.  Just not everyone knows that.  One of these compounds is ordinary <span>baking soda,</span> which is stored in each in a cabinet in the kitchen.  It turns out that it serves not only as a means to improve the quality of baking, but also as a medicine, degreaser, bleach and even a disinfectant.  Let's get acquainted with this substance in more detail. </p><h2>  The chemical basis of soda </h2><p>  The correct name of this compound from the point of view of chemistry is sodium bicarbonate.  There are a number of names that are used in everyday life and chemistry to denote this substance: </p><ul><li>  bicarbonate of soda; </li><li>  baking soda; </li><li>  baking soda; </li><li>  sodium bicarbonate; </li><li>  additive E 500. </li></ul><p>  However, any of them reflects the only true essence - this is soda. </p><h2>  Empirical formula </h2><p>  The formula for baking soda is NaHCO <sub>3</sub> .  That is, by its nature, this substance is a <span>salt of carbonic acid,</span> which is classified as acidic.  Since the compound is formed by strong alkali and weak acid, during hydrolysis (in an aqueous solution) there will be an alkaline reaction of the medium.  The solution in baking soda water has a pH of 8.1.  <span>Acid salt is</span> formed easily by the interaction <span>of sodium hydroxide</span> and carbonic acid, the process is expressed by the following reaction equation: </p><p>  NaOH + H <sub>2</sub> CO <sub>3</sub> = NaHCO <sub>3</sub> + H <sub>2</sub> O </p><p>  The empirical formula of baking soda shows the quantitative and qualitative composition of the compound, on the basis of which it can be concluded about the spatial structure of the molecule: a positively charged Na <sup>+</sup> cation in the outer sphere and a negatively charged HCO <sub>3</sub> bicarbonate ion in the inner one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  A carbon atom coordinates three oxygen atoms around itself, with one of which forms a double bond.  Also, one of the oxygen atoms combines with the hydrogen cation, forming a hydroxo group.  The third oxygen atom in the form of an ion is associated near the sodium cation.  Thus, the valencies of each element that is part of this compound are compensated. </p><h2>  Physical properties </h2><p>  Whatever name we give to this substance - baking soda, drinking soda, carbonate, sodium bicarbonate - its formula is still the same and gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <span>physical properties.</span>  So, the appearance of soda is a fine powder.  Its color is white.  It is soluble in water and practically insoluble in organic solvents (alcohol, for example).  It does not decompose outdoors.  It starts to decompose at high humidity.  The products of complete decomposition with increasing temperature are sodium carbonate (middle salt), carbon dioxide and water: </p><p>  NaHCO <sub>3</sub> = Na <sub>2</sub> CO <sub>3</sub> + CO <sub>2</sub> + H <sub>2</sub> O </p>

    <p>  Sodium bicarbonate is odorless, tastes slightly salty, with a touch of alkali.  When dissolved in water gives alkaline solutions of different concentrations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Brief information on the history of the discovery and use of soda </h2><p>  The first information about sodium bicarbonate appeared in the ancient civilization of Egypt.  It was in those lands that several lakes were found containing natural sources of soda.  When dry, these lakes gave soda in the form of white powder, and people collected it.  It was used by the Egyptians as one of the components in the manufacture of mummification products.  The formula of baking soda was not yet known. </p><p>  Specifically, as a chemical compound, a substance was studied much later, approximately in the XVIII century.  It was then that scientists were interested in this powder, formed naturally.  A thorough analysis of the composition made it possible to determine the qualitative and quantitative component of the compound.  So the modern formula of baking soda appeared. </p><p>  A great contribution to the development of ideas about the substance and the properties shown by it was made by the Italian physician Tullio Simonchini.  He owns experiments, according to which soda is a possible treatment option for cancerous tumors.  However, to date, there is no exact data confirming this. </p>

    <h2>  Areas of use </h2><p>  Due to its ability to dissolve well in water, as well as to interact with acids, forming carbon dioxide as a result of the reaction, soda is used in several industries and households.  Namely, such as: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  pharmaceuticals and medicine; </li><li>  chemical industry; </li><li>  light industry; </li><li>  food industry. </li></ul><p>  Let us consider in more detail each of the directions. </p><h2>  Medical use </h2><p>  The main thing that the use of a substance in medicine is based on is its ability to restore the water-alkaline balance in the digestive tract.  The compound NaHCO <sub>3</sub> is an antacid treatment.  The formula of baking soda indicates the presence of hydroxide ions that perform the function of neutralizing high acidity in the body.  Therefore, most often, a solution of sodium bicarbonate in water is used to eliminate the symptoms of heartburn.  However, this is not the only area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe disease where the substance can be used. </p><ol><li>  In the treatment of colds, baking soda relieves cough, as it helps to thin and remove sputum from the lungs and bronchi.  Also, with it you can do inhalation with acute respiratory viral infections. </li><li>  As a bactericidal and anti-inflammatory agent, baking soda is also used.  Its formula reflects the presence of hydrogen cations H <sup>+</sup> , which provide this effect. </li><li>  For the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (arrhythmias and hypertension), a weak solution of sodium bicarbonate is used in water. </li><li>  With diarrhea and vomiting, the use of soda together with salt allows you to replenish the body's water supply and restore the necessary balance. </li><li>  The substance is able to destroy fungal diseases, therefore it is used to eliminate foot fungus, make douching with a solution for thrush, and wash eyes with inflammation of the conjunctiva. </li><li>  Due to the whitening properties, soda is used for brushing teeth. </li><li>  A weak solution allows you to get rid of itching with skin rashes (or insect bites). </li><li>  Treatment of burns of an initial degree. </li><li>  The release of the body from salts of heavy metals. </li><li>  This <span>relieves stress</span> and fatigue, as well as losing weight when using a warm bath with NaHCO <sub>3</sub> and essential oils. </li></ol>

    <p>  A lot can be said about the benefits and harms of baking soda when used for medical purposes, including cosmetology.  The main rule for the use of this drug, like any other medicine, is not to neglect the dosage recommendations.  Improper use can be harmful. </p><h2>  Baking soda: formula and use in the chemical industry </h2><p>  The main area in which sodium bicarbonate is used is household chemicals.  Soda can act as a mild abrasive for cleaning surfaces and degreasing them.  It is also used as a raw material in the manufacture of dyes, foams and fluoride compounds.  In addition, fire extinguishing agents are made on the basis of NaHCO <sub>3</sub> . </p><p>  It is impossible to imagine how household chemistry would develop without sodium bicarbonate.  Baking soda is an important and necessary component for many chemical syntheses. </p><h2>  Light industry </h2><p>  Baking soda is used for surface treatment in the manufacture of rubber, rubber soles and products.  The formula, use, harm and benefits of sodium bicarbonate in light industry is a separate topic for study.  In short, the role of NaHCO <sub>3</sub> is reduced to use in the manufacture of textiles and artificial leather.  In this case, the damage manifests itself in the appearance of burns if contact with the substance took too long and the hands were not protected.  The benefit is that soda is an excellent additive and degreaser for tanning leather and its manufacture, as well as a good fabric bleach in textile business. </p><h2>  Food industry </h2><p>  The formula of baking soda in chemistry reflects the essence of processes in reactions with acids.  For example, with acetic acid, the interaction will be described by the following equation: </p><p>  NaHCO <sub>3</sub> + CH <sub>3</sub> COOH = CH <sub>3</sub> COONa + H <sub>2</sub> CO <sub>3</sub> </p><p>  In this case, the carbonic acid formed, being very unstable, immediately decomposes into CO <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O. The use of sodium bicarbonate in the food industry is based on this particular reaction.  Indeed, for the manufacture of baking, it is necessary to extinguish soda with vinegar, add the mixture to the dough for its porosity and better structure.  The soda quenching reaction is a type <span>of neutralization reaction</span> and is accompanied by the spectacular effect of foaming and hissing. </p>

    <p>  The use of soda makes baking very soft, aromatic and beautiful, so the food industry is one of the main industries where this substance is used in large quantities.  Sodium bicarbonate is also used in baking, in the manufacture of various confectionery products.  In addition, it is also used to form gas bubbles in effervescent drinks (sparkling water, champagne and sparkling wines, mineral water). </p><h2>  Baking soda: properties and treatment.  Harm and contraindications </h2><p>  In fact, the use of soda is quite widespread in a wide variety of industries and households, as we could already see earlier.  Its unusual healing, antibacterial, whitening, soothing and healing properties are used in the treatment of various ailments.  However, like any other medicine, soda also has the opposite side.  It can be harmful and very dangerous to health.  Its indications for use are obvious, but contraindications are also equally important, which we will consider in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Harm and contraindications </h2><p>  There are several main reasons why soda can become an enemy, and not a friend and helper. </p><ol><li>  With prolonged use of the solution inside, an acid rebound effect occurs.  This is a process in which an excess amount of carbon dioxide is released in the body, leading to increased acidity and increased gas removal, bloating. </li><li>  Long contact with the powder can cause irritation and rashes on the skin. </li><li>  Dry powder soda in the eyes, nose, or other mucous membranes of the body causes chemical burns. </li><li>  When using tooth whitening powder, tooth enamel becomes thinner and worse. </li><li>  Frequent ingestion of NaHCO <sub>3</sub> can cause a feeling of persistent nausea. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baking soda formula" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25789/569554.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  Therefore, it is obvious that baking soda plays not only a positive role for humans.  Benefit and harm, treatment are ambiguous aspects.  Before you use sodium bicarbonate everywhere to get rid of various ailments, you should consult your doctor.  If soda is used in everyday life (cleaning surfaces, bleaching fabrics, and so on), then do not neglect the simplest means of protection for the contactless use of the substance. </p>
