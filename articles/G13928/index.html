    <h2>  The special aura of the south </h2><p>  All Russians know Sochi.  This resort town is a symbol of good relaxation.  And not far from it is Lazarevskoye.  Pension "Sea Star" is comfortably located in the very center of the village.  It is this place that attracts curious vacationers.  After all, the Lazarevskoye seaside is rightfully considered one of the ecologically clean regions in the south of Russia.  Agree, this alone makes you want to visit him. </p><h2>  Healing climate </h2><p>  They say that it is here that the subtropics begin.  This is the same climatic zone that attracts northerners and residents of the middle zone.  That is why many of us do not mind visiting Lazarevskoye.  Starfish is an excellent sanatorium where you can spend time not only interestingly, but also with health benefits.  The climate here, like no other, contributes to the healing of ailments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Lazarevskoye: health resort "Starfish" </h2><p>  Those who are not familiar with Sochi's surroundings will not be disappointed when they first see a well-known pension.  The building is surrounded by a chic park.  Its area is 4 hectares.  Exotic plants typical of the subtropics will meet you here in all their splendor.  Tired of the sun, travelers will reliably hide the shadow of trees.  But hardly any of you will want to hide in the park all the time.  After all, there is a beach nearby, which is famous for Lazarevskoye.  "Starfish" is located 200 meters from it.  And this is only 5 minutes walk.  On the beach you can rent a boat or <span>pedalo.</span>  Experience the hitherto unprecedented sensations, feel alone with the sea.  Fans of the underwater world are waiting for a lot of interesting things.  You will have the opportunity to dive and explore the depths of the sea.  The necessary equipment is issued for a fee. </p>

    <p>  The beneficial effects exerted by dolphins on the human body have been noticed long ago.  For 25 years, a method such as dolphin therapy has been used.  These animals have a positive effect on the nervous system, stimulate the body's immune and metabolic processes, and restore hormonal balance.  Even stubborn skeptics after visiting the dolphinarium recognized its healing power. </p><h2>  Lazarevskoye: Starfish Waterpark </h2><p>  Another miracle that a small Sochi village can boast of.  Sometimes it seems that a whole scattering of stars has gathered here.  And each of them is able to captivate and surprise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lazarevskoe starfish photo" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/484019.jpg" width="288"></div>

    <p>  What is attractive water park? </p><ul><li>  Firstly, it is located near the sanatorium of the same name and is a universal institution for lovers of the water element.  Here both adults and children will find classes. </li><li>  Secondly, you can spend all day in the park.  It works until 8 pm. </li><li>  Thirdly, the water oasis provides entertainment for every taste.  Do you like extreme sports and crave unusual sensations?  At your service are attractions "Kamikaze" and "Space Ball".  Fans of a more relaxed holiday can be advised by the Black Pipe. </li><li>  Fourthly, in the water park you will find several pools.  One of them with waterfalls, the other with artificial waves.  So what about the fact that the sea is near?  Splashing around in such a pool is no less fun. </li><li>  Fifthly, on the territory of this kingdom of water there are several catering establishments where you can have a tasty snack. </li></ul><p>  In a word, the Starfish water park has everything in order to feel happy. </p><h2>  The whole range of entertainment in Lazarevsky </h2><p>  But these are far from the only attractions that can be visited in the resort village.  In order not to be bored on vacation, you can explore the village from and to, and at the same time look into very interesting places.  For example, such: </p><ol><li>  Waterpark "Nautilus".  It is far from the sanatorium, but why not take a walk and admire the gorgeous mountain landscape.  The Caucasus froze in its magnificent silence, and how beautiful it is!  ‚ÄúNautilus‚Äù is the largest water complex in the whole Black Sea region, not visiting it is just a crime.  In addition, a huge number of attractions will give you the opportunity to relax in full. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lazarevskiy resort starfish" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/484018.jpg" width="300"></div></li><li>  Oceanarium.  For those who do not risk falling to <span>the seabed</span> with a mask, there is another opportunity to get acquainted with the underwater world.  Go to the Dolphin Entertainment Center and you will be rewarded with the opportunity to see exotic fish, reptiles and mammals.  After all, this is where the oceanarium is located, which met the first visitors not so long ago - in 2008. </li><li>  Zoo.  Young naturalists will love the beast kingdom.  There are not so many of them here, but they are attracted by the opportunity to stroke a thoroughbred rabbit behind the ear or hold a guinea pig in their hands.  Such close contact with nature is hardly possible in a large zoo. </li><li>  Penguinarium.  If we study the fauna, then not by pictures, but with a personal acquaintance.  To this end, visit the <span>Lazarevsky Penguinarium.</span>  He certainly will not disappoint you.  Humboldt penguins, <span>fur seals,</span> African monkeys will look at you with curiosity.  For animals, conditions are created here that are as close as possible to natural ones.  It is interesting to look at exotics! </li></ol><p>  As you can see, a trip to Lazarevskoye promises you many pleasant moments.  Is it time to pack your bags and go on an exciting journey? </p>
