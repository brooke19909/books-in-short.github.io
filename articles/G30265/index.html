It includes a stove, blender, meat grinder, microwave and, of course, a refrigerator.  Without the latter, it is generally hard to imagine life.  Where to store products, if not in equipment specially designed for these purposes?  Currently, the range of such equipment is truly great.  The market presents products of different brands, including LG.  The company has a good reputation and is popular with a domestic buyer.  In the model range of the Korean manufacturer there are both expensive models, and not so.  Units differ in size, design, characteristics, design.  Everyone can purchase a white, silver or beige LG refrigerator.  Thanks to this diversity, creating an organic atmosphere in the kitchen will not be difficult at all.  Speaking about this equipment, one should definitely pay attention to quality.  Korean developers have excelled in this matter.  Their units are equipped with modern technologies, so that the products retain their freshness for a long time.  Although the product range of this manufacturer has many interesting models, however, in this article I would like to dwell on the refrigerator LG GA-E409SMRA.

He founded the company Ku In Hoi in South Korea during the Second World War.  Its activity began with the production of hygienic detergents, or rather, with tooth powder.  By 1947, the company was able to significantly increase turnover. </p><p>  The 60s became the most significant for the company.  It was during this period that the first hair dryers (1963), refrigerators (1965), and televisions (1966) appeared.  Definitely, such a policy was successful.  LG is now introducing its products to the global market.  Her assortment is truly great.  This brand produces monitors, telephones, televisions, vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, as well as many small household appliances.  Note that it is currently sold in most countries, and occupies a leading position. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fridge lg beige" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2201032.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Refrigerator description </h2><p>  Refrigerator LG GA-E409SMRA, unlike the classic white models, comes with a silver casing.  By type of construction, it belongs to freestanding.  Differs in practicality and usability.  Like most modern refrigerators, it has two chambers.  The freezer is at the bottom, and as consumer demand shows, it is this arrangement that is popular with a domestic buyer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The doors of the refrigerator are arched.  This gives the device not only volume, but also presentability.  The developers have provided the opportunity to outweigh the door, making it very easy to find the optimal location for the unit. </p><p>  Describing the appearance, it is necessary to focus on the presence of the display.  It is located at the top of the refrigerator compartment door.  A little higher than it, in the right corner, the manufacturer located the company logo of the company. </p><p>  The developers have thought through the internal content quite carefully.  Glass shelves perfectly complement the stylish design.  The owner may at their discretion change their height.  The freshness area is equipped with a transparent plastic box, which is divided into two compartments.  The refrigerator door is also equipped with shelves.  They are arranged in four rows.  Here you can store bottles, cans, eggs and other products.  The freezer is equipped with three drawers made of transparent plastic.  At the top there is a small shelf in which you can freeze small-sized products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="refrigerators lg prices" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2201033.jpg"></div>
