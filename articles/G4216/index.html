  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electric stoves in which glass ceramics are used as a work surface: pros and cons.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mankind has been familiar with glass ceramics for quite some time.  However, electric stoves, glass ceramics in which began to be used as coatings, appeared in our kitchens relatively recently.  But even for this short period, <span>ceramic plates have</span> won an army of fans.  Let's try to figure out this phenomenal success. </p><p>  So, before us are bright representatives of modern and high-tech kitchen appliances - electric stoves, glass ceramics in which began to be used as the main element.  The main advantage of this material is its high vertical thermal conductivity.  Almost zero horizontal thermal conductivity makes the glass ceramic plate safe.  You can touch its surface just a few centimeters from the working burner, without risking to burn yourself.  How quickly the surface of the stove heats up, so quickly it cools.  It is enough to only reduce the power of the burner to prevent the cooking of the cooked food in the same second.  In addition, glass ceramics is a very durable material that can withstand large static loads.  Although she does not hold point strikes.  Hence the advice to the hostesses - try not to drop electric stoves on the surface, glass-ceramic in which plays the role of a coating, heavy metal objects.  Another important advantage of glass-ceramic plates is the design.  The modern appearance allows such a stove to fit perfectly into the interior of each kitchen.  And thanks to the manufacturing technology, any pattern can be applied to glass ceramics without fear that it will be erased over time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Dependent or independent glass ceramic hob?</strong> </p><p>  Glass-ceramic stoves, in which the hob cannot work separately from the oven, are called dependent.  Gradually, manufacturers abandon such designs in favor of independent ones.  This is pretty easy to explain.  After all, an independent hob can be positioned anywhere, and the oven can be raised from the floor to a convenient height, which will not bend every time you need to check the degree of readiness of the dish.  In addition, their price speaks in favor of independent electric stoves, because when buying such a panel there is no need to overpay for an oven, which some people on the household simply do not need.  As needed, it can be purchased over time. </p><p>  <strong>Electric power and design</strong> </p><p>  Electric stoves in which glass-ceramic serves as a working surface differ from each other by the type of burners.  Burners are rapid, halogen and HighLight.  They differ from each other in heating rate.  The type of burners installed can affect the price of an electric stove.  Be that as it may, electric stoves with cast-iron burners become history and give way to glass-ceramic.  And the gas from modern kitchens is gradually being replaced by electricity.  It is obvious that a modern <span>electric stove is</span> much safer than a gas <span>stove</span> .  The design of modern electric stoves with a glass-ceramic worktop will perfectly complement the interior of any kitchen, and a variety of sizes and shapes will allow you to choose a hob for any size. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <strong>Cons of glass ceramics</strong> </p><p>  Possessing many advantages, glass-ceramic electric stoves have a number of disadvantages.  Despite its strength, glass ceramics does not tolerate point impacts (as mentioned above).  Remember that a cracked glass-ceramic panel cannot be repaired, and its replacement will cost a considerable amount of money.  In addition, you should be careful about sugar products on the surface of the stove.  If this still happened, then you must immediately remove it from the surface.  Glass ceramics are finicky to kitchen utensils.  The bottom of the pan or pan should be perfectly flat and match the diameter of the burner.  To care for a ceramic glass stove, do not use hard wire sponges and tools that include abrasives. </p><p>  So, if after reading this article and weighing all the pros and cons, you decided to purchase an electric stove with a glass ceramic surface, then I will allow myself to give you some advice.  The glass-ceramic coating itself is almost identical for all electric stoves, since only a few companies are engaged in its production.  Therefore, special attention should be paid to the electronic component of the electric stove and the presence of the functions necessary for you.  Ariston products have proved to be quite good.  Glass-ceramic <span>hobs of</span> this company are popular all over the world and fully meet consumer's ideas about reliability and simplicity.  Those who like high-tech products should look at the Bosh glass-ceramic electric cooker models.  The modern market is simply replete with various models of electric stoves with a glass-ceramic hob for every taste and budget.  Therefore, without a purchase you are unlikely to remain. </p>
