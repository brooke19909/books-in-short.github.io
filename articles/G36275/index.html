    <h2>  A bit of ancient history </h2><p>  If you take a brief excursion into the distant past of our country, you can find out that human settlements have already been here since the second millennium BC.  Of course, these were very primitive parking lots, but this all begins.  Active migration processes that were going on at that time made it possible to find and settle in the most convenient places for this, one of them is the East European Plain, in particular the Central Russian Upland.  It was here that the Proto-Slavic tribes rushed, which then separated from the Germanic and Baltic ones into the Slavic proper.  Even later, the Slavic mass was divided into three large groups: western, southern and eastern.  Naturally, the year of the first mention of Moscow was still very far.  However, the Slavs settled on the future territory of Russia, and the vicinity of our capital began to settle in on the most comfortable site for this - <span>Borovitsky hill.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  First mention: annals of Moscow </h2><p>  In historical science there was a version about the appearance of Moscow at the dawn of the formation of the state among the Eastern Slavs.  Indeed, archaeological evidence allowed us to say that there was a settlement in this place, and quite developed.  However, it cannot be argued that it was Moscow.  The fact is that there are no written sources about this, and, accordingly, there is no reason to be sure either.  The main document on the history of ancient Russia is the "Tale of Bygone Years" by the monk Nestor.  If you study it carefully, you can understand that only in the twelfth century does the first mention of Moscow take place.  The date of this event is localized in 1147, when you can find out a new somewhat distorted name "Moscow".  In general, at that time this region, in comparison with other cities in North-Eastern Russia, can be called rather backward, and the city itself was deaf and rural. </p>

    <h2>  Natural advantages and foresight of the prince </h2><p>  However, the area is very conveniently located geographically, so it attracted the eyes of princes of different ranks.  But Moscow will come to the fore very soon.  This district was once chosen by the youngest <span>son of Vladimir Monomakh,</span> Yuri Vladimirovich, nicknamed Dolgoruky.  Being the Prince of Rostov-Suzdal, he also looked closely at Kiev, but understood that civil strife needed to have solid rear areas.  And the old cities had well-organized and strong boyar groups.  In addition, the city was located, figuratively speaking, in the center of Russian possessions, which was very convenient for attacking almost all the major principalities of the North-East.  Therefore, the first mention of Moscow is associated with the name of Grand Duke Yuri Vladimirovich, it was here that he invited his associate in the struggle for primacy in Russia and a relative of Prince Svyatoslav Olegovich. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hypotheses and disputes </h2><p>  However, even despite this, there is no consensus among historians about the year the city was founded.  This is due to the contradictions that are found in the annals, despite the fact that it was in 1147 that the first mention of Moscow was connected.  The date is called into question because another chronicle contains information that in 1156, Prince Yuri Dolgoruky founded the fortress on the site of the future capital.  Although it is known for certain that at that time he ruled in Kiev, and if he had founded Moscow during this period, this event would have been reflected in the annals.  However, on this occasion, the source remains completely silent, which is puzzling.  Despite the mention of Moscow back in 1147, historians suggest that at that time it could not be called a full-fledged settlement.  Most of the scientists still consider the year of the foundation of the fortress and urban settlement 1153. It was then that the Prince of Rostov-Suzdal was in those places, so this version can be assumed. </p>

    <h2>  Kuchkovo - Moscow </h2><p>  Nevertheless, Yuri Vladimirovich not in vain drew attention to the town.  As already mentioned above, the location of Moscow made it a very convenient and advantageous transshipment point, which the ruler is fully aware of.  Even as a Kiev prince, he devotes part of his attention to the Moscow possessions.  This policy was continued by his son Andrei Bogolyubsky, but it is impossible to say that at that time Moscow was of strategic importance.  It was a small border point where the borders of the principalities and trade routes crossed.  The murder of Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky is associated with the convenient location of Moscow possessions.  These lands belonged to the small boyar Stepan Kuchka and were called Kuchkovo.  Wanting to turn the possessions into his own, the prince first tried to persuade Stepan to give up this area, however, the boyar‚Äôs intransigence led to his execution and discontent among the boyar estate, which resulted in the conspiracy and murder of Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky.  However, despite this, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe future capital was assigned to Monomakhovichi. </p>

    <h2>  The role of the heirs of Alexander Nevsky in the formation of Moscow's influence </h2><p>  But the development of the city was very slow.  More than one and a half centuries have passed from the moment when the first annalistic mention of Moscow took place, and until the moment when it gains its own influence.  Only in the thirteenth century did it begin to acquire the features of a large urban settlement and an important strategic point.  The first mention of Moscow in a new quality falls precisely on this period.  This indicates a strengthening of the influence of the city on all-Russian affairs.  The true heyday begins after Alexander Yaroslavovich, who received the nickname Nevsky for his exploits, leaves her a legacy to his youngest son, Daniel.  At first, the young prince was upset that he got such a seedy principality, but as he matured, he began to understand the importance of this region and the influence of the fragmentation period on the entire politics of Russia.  He strengthened it in every way with the help of dynastic marriages, military force.  The prince‚Äôs cunning played an important role.  By the end of his reign, the <span>Principality of Moscow</span> and the city were already quite significant rivals for primacy in the country. </p><h2>  Daniilovichi in the fight for the championship </h2><p>  It is especially worth noting that the rise of Moscow is due to the fact that the former centers (Kiev, and then Vladimir) gradually faded into second roles, and Tver and that same "golden-headed" came to the fore.  It is also worth mentioning the important influence of such a public institution as the Russian Orthodox Church.  At the beginning of the fourteenth century, the residence of the Metropolitan was moved from Vladimir to Moscow.  This, in essence, meant a sharp increase in the status and influence of the latter.  This event happened for a reason, but was a consequence of the visionary policy of the Moscow princes.  The strategic direction set by Daniil Alexandrovich was continued by his heirs: Yuri, who did not have a political outlook, and Ivan, who sat on the throne after the death of his brother.  Nicknamed Kalita, he is a true designer of the growing influence of a young but ambitious city.  It was under him that the Mongol khans paid tribute to the Moscow rulers. </p>

    <h2>  Political Affairs </h2><p>  Under the prince there are chroniclers who attribute the first mention in the annals of Moscow to the ninth, and even to the beginning of the eighth century.  All this was done in order to justify the right of the city and the principality to primacy in all-Russian affairs.  Princes and court boyars strongly supported this version.  The policy of Kalita was continued by his sons <span>Ivan the Red,</span> who received his nickname for his beautiful appearance, and <span>Semyon Proud,</span> distinguished by exorbitant pride.  With them, changes were also made to the annals with the aim of ‚Äúaging‚Äù the future capital a little.  However, it is clear that the first mention in the annals of Moscow, deduced by devoted chroniclers, does not at all correspond to the truth, and this is done purely for political reasons.  Dmitry Ivanovich further strengthened the leading position of the city, having won a decisive victory over the troops of the Mongol-Tatars in the Kulikovo field in 1380.  However, two years later, a new invasion of the conquerors took the city by surprise, and it was taken and burned almost completely. </p><h2>  Family conflicts for the Moscow inheritance </h2><p>  Subsequently, a struggle for power broke out between the heirs, which in historical literature was called the great feudal war.  This page in the history of Russia is full of tragic moments.  The winner was <span>Vasily II the Dark,</span> and already his son, Ivan III, for the first time since the feudal fragmentation received the title of Grand Duke of All Russia, and Moscow became the capital of united Russia.  Subsequently, the city was further strengthened and expanded.  According to the observations of English merchants, he was larger than London.  Moscow retained its capital status until the construction of St. Petersburg and for three hundred years lost the palm to the northern capital.  However, in 1918, through the efforts of the Bolsheviks, it again became the capital, first in the RSFSR and then the USSR. </p><h2>  Moscow: from the capital of the principality to the capital of Russia </h2><p>  So you can quite briefly outline the main points of the foundation and development of the city: from the first mention of the annals of Moscow as a small settlement to the status of the capital of a large and strong state.  On this path, she underwent numerous changes both in her appearance and in the degree of her influence on the general course of events.  In particular, the son of Vasily the Dark built the Kremlin in such a way that we can observe it in our time, of red brick.  The entire historical center of the city was built during the Middle Ages, and then only slightly changed.  And although historians have broken many copies, hypothesizing the period of the settlement, there is a generally accepted point of view that the first mention of Moscow dates back to the twelfth century, and Prince Yuri Dolgoruky is considered the founder.  The year of first mention is 1147. Now the city is one of the largest megacities in the world and the capital of our country. </p>
