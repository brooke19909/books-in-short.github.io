    <h2>  Application </h2><p>  In the old days, craftsmen made special varieties of clay with lids, pots, jugs, and other kitchen utensils.  After firing, such dishes retained their shape, did not let water through, and were quite strong. </p><p>  The most suitable types of clay for modeling are plastic varieties of gray, gray-green and green varieties.  They are used in modeling and creating sculptures.  Masters initially make volume models from this material, followed by casting in plaster or bronze. </p><p>  If the clay sculpture is fired, then this work is called terracotta, and if it is additionally covered with glaze, then it will be majolica. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  Refractory clays withstand firing without softening temperatures above 1500 degrees.  They are used in the manufacture of acid-resistant porcelain and faience products and in the manufacture of molds for metallurgical casting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Fusible grades are used in the manufacture of bricks and in the process of obtaining Portland cement.  Bentonite types of clay for modeling are less suitable.  They are used in the purification of petroleum products, vegetable and lubricating oils, as well as in drilling wells. </p><h2>  Polymer clay </h2><p>  Artificially created material, based on polyvinyl chloride with the addition of plasticizers, pigments and fillers, is called thermoplastics. </p><p>  The material externally and in properties resembles plasticine during sculpting, but it smudges hands less and does not leak from the excess heat of the palms.  Some clay modeling tools of this type are used only in this type of applied art.  For example, for rolling layers and mixing different shades of material, a special paste machine is used. </p><p>  Polymer clay is produced by different manufacturers and is divided into two types according to the method of hardening: </p><ol><li>  Self hardening. </li><li>  Baked (thermoplastics). </li></ol>

Self-hardening polymer clay (plastic) after drying has sufficient strength, holds its shape well, is processed, if necessary, to correct some details.  The surface in this case is soaked with water, after which the necessary adjustments are made. </p><p>  This type of polymer clay is ideal in the process of creating dolls, especially the elements of their clothes and accessories.  Another important area of ‚Äã‚Äãits application is the creation of floral arrangements.  Thin leaves, and especially flower petals with thinned edges, look like they are alive after giving the product a characteristic textural surface. </p><p>  The necessary minimum <span>set of tools</span> for modeling should include a rolling pin so that it is possible to roll out the layers, and a convenient <span>cutting tool</span> for cutting from thin layers of parts of the composition.  Devices for imprinting and extruding texture elements may also be useful.  When working with small parts, it is convenient to use stacks. </p><h2>  Baked polymer clay </h2><p>  Such material, when heated to a temperature of 110‚Äì130 degrees, acquires the properties of plastic.  Finished products are not afraid of moisture, they can be bent without fear of breaking. </p><p>  It is convenient to work with thermoplastics.  It is a soft material, plastic, mixes well.  After heat treatment, the surface takes on a velvety appearance.  The set of tools for molding from thermoplastics is the same as for self-hardening clay.  Used material for the manufacture of dolls, souvenirs, small sculptures, flower arrangements, all kinds of jewelry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Some manufacturers produce two types of thermoplastics: one is soft, which is more suitable for children's creativity;  the other is more rigid material, requiring careful kneading before modeling, but also characterized by increased strength of the finished product. </p><h2>  Polymer clay molding: tools and materials </h2><p>  The working surface is selected from ceramics or glass.  To roll the source material into the layers use a rolling pin, rollers or a special paste machine.  Extruder with interchangeable nozzles squeeze simple or curly "sausages". </p><p>  To give the surface a special look, they use stamps, texture sheets and brushes.  Materials and tools for sculpting are selected individually by each master.  Molds are needed for forming repeating <span>elements of the composition.</span>  For cutting from the reservoir use boats.  Stacks with different profiles are indispensable for sculpting small parts.  For making holes use needles. </p><p>  In some cases, foil can be useful to create a lightweight frame and save material.  Sandpaper can grind finished products after heat treatment.  <span>The food wrap</span> keeps the material well from drying out. </p><p>  We also need auxiliary tools for modeling clay.  Pliers, pliers and wire cutters are indispensable when working with wire to create fittings for future products.  Stationary cutters and sharp scissors are suitable for cutting formed layers. </p>

    <h2>  Homemade appliances and forms </h2><p>  The necessary tools for sculpting with your own hands can be made by anyone.  In some cases, you don‚Äôt even need to do anything, you can simply adapt a suitable object for molding, molding, extrusion or figured processing. </p><p>  So, a kitchen noodle cutter can be used to create even strips from a rolled seam.  <span>A garlic press</span> can squeeze thin threads.  You can create decorative elements on the surface with the heads of screws with grooves for a screwdriver.  A sieve is convenient to make a texture in the form of a lattice.  It can be used to extrude a piece of pumice, the effect of ‚Äúsalt texture‚Äù can be achieved using a hard toothbrush. </p><p>  Suitable clay modeling tools are everywhere, you just need to notice them.  Cookie cutters, bottle caps, curly buttons - everything can be used for molding, extruding or stamping.  A simple glass bottle can be used to roll the material, and instead of a stack for delicate work, you can take a toothpick. </p><h2>  Practical Tips for Beginners </h2><p>  Before starting work, it is worth taking care of protecting the surface of the table on which you plan to do creativity.  Separating a piece of plastic, it should be slightly kneaded in the hands so that it warms up and acquires the necessary softness. </p><p>  To get acquainted with the material, to get the first skills of working with a new type of raw material, as well as to master tools, it is better to choose a simple model for modeling from clay.  Having rolled out a crumpled piece of plastic over the working surface, you can try to cut something out of it, give the workpiece a different texture with the help of molds, stencils or special texture sheets. </p>

    <p>  You can make a small sculpture, try to make a simple composition in the form of a flower or other three-dimensional shape.  The first test lesson is desirable to bring to its logical conclusion.  Self-hardening clay is simply dried, and thermoplastics should be baked. </p><p>  To do this, the product is laid out on foil, parchment, <span>ceramic tile</span> or plate and put in the oven preheated to 110 degrees for the time necessary for baking, indicated in the instructions for clay.  After heat treatment, the model cools in the oven, is removed, painted and varnished. </p><h2>  What is clay modeling called? </h2><p>  Entrepreneurial people with creative potential can easily realize their talent with practical benefits, making and selling original beads, earrings, bracelets, as well as all kinds of souvenirs and a variety of pleasant little things.  The name of this type of creativity is determined by the technique of the finished product. </p><p>  Existing polymer clay modeling techniques are so diverse that they give a beginner the opportunity to choose an activity for any level of difficulty.  The name of a particular type of molding is determined by the techniques and methods used in the manufacture of decorative elements.  For a simple flower or a simple sculpture, one technology is used, multilayer filigree or millifiori in the creation of designer jewelry - a completely different specificity of the work. </p>

    <h2>  Polymer Clay Techniques </h2><p>  How many good craftsmen, how many unique products, so many techniques exist at the moment.  Some are particularly popular and can be taken as a basis by novice modelers. </p><p>  The watercolor technique involves the use of contrasting layers of colored plastic, rolled out in a pasta machine.  In the "color transition" - on the contrary, smooth and blurry borders are used. </p><p>  The ‚Äúbargello‚Äù technique imitates Florentine embroidery; the ‚Äúmica shift‚Äù creates volumetric effects on a flat surface.  The Mokume Gene technique borrowed from Japanese gunsmiths combines the texture of wood and metal, while the imitation creates the likeness of natural minerals, natural and precious stones. </p><p>  ‚ÄúFiligree‚Äù and ‚Äúmillifiori‚Äù are techniques for creating a complex pattern of thin layers, threads or balls.  This occurs in the process of squeezing, drawing and rolling on the surface of a thin section of a complex composition. </p><p>  Amazingly beautiful jewelry is obtained as a result of applying the techniques: ‚Äúkaleidoscope‚Äù, ‚Äúmultilayer‚Äù, ‚Äúthrough‚Äù, ‚Äúsalt‚Äù, ‚Äúsyringe‚Äù, ‚Äúbrain‚Äù, ‚Äúimage translation‚Äù. </p><p>  Besides the listed species?  there is also puppetry, sculpture and flower technology.  They, in turn, have their own characteristics and varieties of molding and molding techniques, the intricacies of the installation of composite elements.  Clay modeling tools for each specific case are selected by the master individually. </p>
