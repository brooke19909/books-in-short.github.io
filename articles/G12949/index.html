  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Youth Tours In Kemer. Night clubs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, tours to Kemer have become very popular among young people and active representatives of adulthood.  And not in vain!  Indeed, on the <span>Antalya coast of</span> Turkey, nightlife is most developed in this place! </p><p>  The central areas of the city of Kemer are simply oversaturated with bars, <span>cafes, restaurants</span> and nightclubs.  Municipal beaches host <span>foam parties</span> and discos.  Kemer is a great place for lovers of sunbathing during the day and dancing at night!  In order to get into this dizzying place, you just need to buy a last-minute tour to Turkey to the Kemer resort.  Given the low cost of such trips, even students can do this! </p><p>  Especially for everyone interested in entertainment, I‚Äôll write a list of the most popular night clubs in Kemer: </p><p>  1) Club "Aura Club".  It is located in the very center of the city under the open sky.  The club has 11 bars, several restaurants of different cuisines.  <span>Themed parties</span> are held every evening, <span>and</span> often popular world singers, artists and DJs come: David Vendetta, Timati, Inna, Roger Sanchez and others. Once a week, the foam falls on the two and a half thousand people who are in the club, creating a special mood.  Entrance to the club costs about $ 20 per person.  In June, the Aura Club hosts the Miss Kemer contest, in which 30 girls from 30 different countries participate.  The competition is held in English, translated into Russian, German and French.  If you want to prove to 30 countries that you are the most beautiful, hurry to find a tour to Turkey to the Kemer resort in June.  I wish you victory! </p><p>  2) Club Charlotte Disco.  This disco is located on the Deniz promenade, from anywhere in the city you can get there by city bus and, of course, by taxi.  This place has an unusual design.  The dance floor is made in the form of a huge <span>chessboard,</span> columns - in the form of Greek statues.  Entrance for tourists will cost $ 7, drinks must be paid separately.  But if you are a big drinker, you can save.  Especially for you, the all-inclusive system is provided: at the entrance, pay $ 22 and take any drinks in any quantity in the bar.  The disco is open from 10 pm to half past four in the morning.  Once a week a special party is held - "Turkish Night".  Here you can see exactly the belly dance that was imagined in your fantasies! <noindex>  <span>Tours in Kemer</span> </noindex>  - A great option for those who are looking for such entertainment! </p><p>  3) "Kristall Club".  This club, built in 2011 by Russian businessmen, has already managed to gain an excellent reputation and is considered an institution of a very high level.  It is more like not a club, but a complex, which includes a disco, restaurants of Russian, Japanese and Italian cuisines and a karaoke bar.  The most important feature is that this complex is located right on the seashore.  You understand what this means, especially for romantics!  The club often performs Russian artists: Esla, Timati, Nyusha, the group "Degrees" and others.  On days when concerts are not held, admission for girls is free.  So if you find a tour to the hotel, which will be nearby, you can completely free to relax here every day! </p><p>  4) Night club "Rai Club Kemer".  It is located in the Moonlight Park, near the center of Kemer.  The club room is large enough, accommodates up to two thousand people in one evening.  This club is distinguished by the fact that it hosts amazing shows: laser shows, dancing with fire, scenes with fascinating performances and go-go dancing. </p><p>  All clubs operate from early May to mid-October, if there are tourists, then longer.  So if <noindex>  <span>buy a hot tour to Turkey</span> </noindex>  , for example, in September (and prices in September are already low), then you will certainly attend all the parties you want. </p><p>  <span>Kemer hotels</span> also host discos.  They, of course, are not of the same level as in the city, but they are free, or rather included in the all-inclusive system.  Decide in advance which places you want to visit: city clubs or a disco in the hotel.  If you are satisfied with the disco at the hotel, you can safely buy a last-minute tour to Turkey and enjoy your vacation.  And if you focus on nightclubs in the city, then not everyone will do.  It is necessary to choose a hotel so that the ride was close and, therefore, inexpensive. </p></div></article>
