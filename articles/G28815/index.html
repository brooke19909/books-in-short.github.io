Karkam M1 is often purchased by motorists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="piterbezugona.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="two-angle recorder" class="if uuid-2289664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2289664.jpg"></div><h2>  Registrar Culture </h2><p>  Megacities are so overloaded with cars that the probability of an accident is very high. </p><p>  It is sometimes difficult for the driver to prove his case, especially when the culprit escaped from the scene.  The presence of a video helps to reproduce the details of an accident. </p><h2>  A little description </h2><p>  The Karkam M1 video recorder has a strict design and functionality, which includes the most popular options for the driver.  The core is the Ambarella A5 processor, which is popular in such devices, allowing you to make high-quality video recordings at any time of the day.  A wide-angle lens facilitates shooting with a viewing angle of 140 degrees.  And thanks to WDR technology, it fixes car numbers without any difficulty at night.  Across the entire width of the video, there is an adjustment by brightening the darkened areas and dimming the brightest.  This method allows you to shoot on video at any time of the day, regardless of the degree of illumination of the site. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Karkam M1 device has a function that warns about the presence of cameras on the road.  It is also possible to fix new sites that were not previously indicated on the gadget's map.  There is also an anti-sleep function used by truckers on long-haul flights. </p><p>  The excellent appearance (thanks to which the Karkam M1 video recorder fits perfectly into the car interior) is far from the only highlight: the 2.7-inch screen allows you to view the captured videos, set the settings in the menu, and thanks to the compact bracket the product can be installed behind the rear mirror view, so as not to interfere with the review. </p><p>  Reviews of the Karkam M1 dashcam indicate that many motorists are attracted by such features as ‚Äúturn to the inspector‚Äù, the stamp ‚Äúdate and time‚Äù, as well as the GLONASS and GPS module, due to which the vehicle‚Äôs location is tracked. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dns-shop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Karkam M1 front view" class="if uuid-2289651" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2289651.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Varies in the range from 8 to 10 thousand rubles.  For example, Yandex. Market puts this model up for sale for 7990 rubles, while the price for Karkam M1 in the TechnoSonic store is 10,190 rubles.  However, according to search engines, the average cost of a product as of January 1, 2018 is 9,999 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features </h2><ul><li>  Shooting in the Wide Dinamic Range mode, which ensures recognition of rooms both in poor street lighting, and in general in the dark. </li><li>  Antiradar - the driver is notified by a signal of approaching the fixation points of the high-speed mode. </li><li>  Motion control - a functional that tracks the distance to the dividing strip both on the right and on the left.  Warns a motorist in case the car is approaching a marking.  A very popular setting among truckers, as it prevents falling asleep while driving.  However, in urban areas it is often disconnected due to the presence of a lot of interference (for example, trees), leading to a false alarm. </li><li>  Compactness is an indisputable advantage of the Karkam M1 video recorder.  Often purchased by car owners.  Those are small in size, because a bulky gadget would obscure the view on the windshield. </li><li>  A convenient bracket allows you to rotate the device 360 ‚Äã‚Äãdegrees to photograph what is happening in the cabin.  For example, communication with a passenger.  Often used by taxi drivers to record a conflict situation. </li><li>  Removable GPS module - allows you to mark the current coordinate and track the route.  It is very useful for identifying the causes of a traffic accident and establishing the degree of guilt of the driver. </li><li>  G-sensor - a module that records the minute of an accident. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="videoregforum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="compact recorder" class="if uuid-2289653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2289653.jpg"></div><h2>  Electronic accelerometer </h2><p>  It is necessary to tell in more detail about how exactly the determination of the moment of time when the traffic accident occurred.  If the machine is in motion, the above-mentioned G-sensor detects the time of a sharp increase in load and an instant decrease in speed.  If the vehicle stood still and the car crashed into it, the accident sensor notes the moment the load and speed increase. </p><p>  In this case, file protection from overwriting or erasing is automatically enabled.  The video itself moves to a specially allocated memory area.  According to reviews of the Karkam M1 dashcam, motorists highly value the presence of an electronic accelerometer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="videoregforum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Karkam M1 with bracket" class="if uuid-2289656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2289656.jpg"></div><h2>  pros </h2><p>  The product is very popular.  According to reviews of Karkam M1, the optimal ratio of price and quality ensures high demand for goods.  The positive aspects include (primarily) the design.  A presentable appearance is the first sign that the gadget will attract the attention of the buyer. </p><p>  Car owners note that the advantage is a user-friendly interface and functionality that includes only important properties.  In third place in popularity is the quality of video recording, which is made without all kinds of freezes and glitches, as well as ease of installation in the cabin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="megaobzor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="on glass" class="if uuid-2289657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2289657.jpg"></div><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Alas, no matter how good the device, there is always a flaw.  Most of the reviews about ‚ÄúKarkam M1‚Äù are exclusively positive, but among the minuses there is a mismatch of video filming with the declared Full HD.  Nevertheless, the quality is kept up to standard. </p><p>  Some owners focus on the rapid overheating of the gadget.  But there are very few such reviews, perhaps an isolated case or operation in high temperature conditions.  In the end, the windshield plays the role of a lens, and the black color quickly heats up in the sun, which is why this behavior of the product. </p><p>  Two or three buyers noted a defocusing of the screen with a sharp difference in lighting from dark to light or vice versa.  The comment is also single, therefore, when choosing this product, it is better to ask the employee to turn it on and check. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  It should be said that DVRs are in great demand among urban residents.  Motorists from rural areas rarely install them because of the low traffic load and, as a consequence, the low probability of an accident. </p><p>  A resident of the city prefers to play it safe.  In the end, the record helps to quickly identify the culprit of the incident, especially if the latter completely denies everything (or even disappeared in an unknown direction). </p><p>  Earlier in the trial of the accident, the video was not evidence and was not considered.  Now (after the amendment of May 7, 2016) the material is attached to the case.  However, this may be rejected if traces of explicit video editing are detected.  Which is also punishable, as it is a fake of evidence. </p><p>  So that the driver is not accused of anything like this, you should remove the flash card and transfer it to the traffic police officer, sealing it before that in an envelope. </p><div class="photo" data-original="megaobzor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="on glass back" class="if uuid-2289665" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2289665.jpg"></div><p>  Recorder materials are also used to unravel complex criminal cases.  For example, a recording from a car parked in a parking lot, which recorded riots in a parking lot, will help restore the details of the incident.  In this matter, Karkam M1 will become an indispensable assistant. </p><p>  Owner reviews, of course, will help restore the picture as a whole, but in any case, you should be careful and careful on the roads, so as not to become a participant in a traffic accident and even more so the victim.  After all, no decision to compensate for the damage from the accident will not be able to return human life. </p>
