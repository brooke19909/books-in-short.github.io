Having no direct access to the sea and deprived of large cities, it is not as famous as Tuscany, Liguria or Sardinia. </p><h2>  Italy's smallest region </h2><p>  Lying in the center of the Apennine Peninsula, the Umbria region is one of the smallest.  The capital of Dividing into two provinces of the region is Perugia - a city captivating with amazing beauty in Italy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãin italy umbria" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1421650.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Umbria is considered an ecologically clean area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe state, and this is due to the fact that there are almost no industrial enterprises and preserved areas of unspoiled nature.  Many picturesque lakes, mountains covered with greenery, dense forests, rounded hills delight travelers who first came to an isolated region. </p><h2>  <strong>Umbria (Italy</strong> ): a small excursion into history </h2><p>  The territory little known to a wide circle of people in the region was inhabited in the Neolithic era.  In the first millennium BC, tribes of Umbra appeared, who gave the name of the area.  The Etruscans, who founded most of the cities in the region, are becoming new inhabitants. </p><p>  A few centuries later, the region was captured by Roman warriors who paved roads through it that previously were not there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1860, Umbria was first annexed to the Sardinian kingdom, and then it became part of Italy. </p><h2>  Part of the gate of Marzia </h2><p>  The centuries-old history has left its mark on architectural monuments, which the ancient region is proud of.  The gate of Marcia appeared in the III century BC, and this is one of the sights preserved from the mysterious predecessors of the Romans - the Etruscans.  Now all guests of Umbria can see part of the building, included in the walls of Perugia as a decorative element. </p><h2>  Well of the Etruscans </h2><p>  Picturesque Umbria (Italy), each centimeter of which is saturated with the spirit of history, is famous for its monuments of ancient architecture.  In the capital of the region is another important attraction left after Etruscan civilization.  Built in the 4th century BC, a powerful structure supplied drinking water to the whole city until an aqueduct appeared. </p><p>  Now it is a working museum, located four meters below the ground.  City visitors willingly visit it, noticing along the way that water is oozing in an interesting but uncomfortable place and smells unpleasantly in the swamp. </p><h2>  Chapel of St. Bernardine </h2><p>  One of the main monuments of the Renaissance is also located in the capital of the region.  The facade of the chapel of St. Bernardine will delight you with the special skill of the sculptor, who created bas-reliefs with scenes from the life of a medieval preacher.  The composition of marble, limestone, clay, surprising with unusual color combinations, is the main feature of the structure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy Lazio Umbria" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1421640.jpg" width="600"></div>

Tourists are also interested in the early Christian sarcophagus, which stores the relics of Blessed Aegidius. </p><h2>  Communal palace </h2><p>  The small region of Umbria (Italy) is also known for the fact that it houses the most striking example of medieval architecture.  The Gothic Palazzo Comunale, built between the 13th and 15th centuries, will appeal to tourists interested in ancient history.  They celebrate the special atmosphere of this place in Perugia, filled with vivid images.  Statues of gods, sculptures of a lion and a griffin at the entrance, colorful stained-glass windows that preserved the ancient decor of the hall, <span>Roman mosaics</span> found at the excavations <span>,</span> fresco paintings affect the imagination of guests of the region, carried over several centuries ago. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="umbria italy" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1421637.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Wine region </h2><p>  Speaking about the sights of the region, one cannot but mention the vineyards, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 16 hectares.  The traditions of making an alcoholic beverage are rooted in antiquity, but only relatively recently, after local craftsmen re-equipped their companies, the products became known far beyond the borders of the country. </p><p>  The wine region of Umbria (Italy) never chased quantity, focusing on quality, for example, Montefalco Sagrantino matures 30 months in an oak barrel.  But the most popular and world-famous wine is Orvieto, the secret of which was discovered by the Etruscans. </p><h2>  Powerful earthquake </h2><p>  Unfortunately, in late August this year, sunny <span>Italy</span> appeared on the front pages of newspapers <span>.</span>  <span>Lazio,</span> Umbria and the Marche region were hit hard by an earthquake that killed some 200 people.  As stated in the Federal Tourism Agency, these regions, lying on the seismic fault line, are not popular among our tourists, so there is not a single dead Russian citizen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Umbria region Italy" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1421641.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Italians themselves say that tremors are commonplace, and such a strong earthquake with a magnitude of 6.2 points is more likely an exception than a rule. </p><p>  Travelers who have visited the region admit that the hospitable Umbria (Italy) is filled with wonderful landscapes and rich in unique architectural monuments, which can not be passed by. </p>
