Age characteristic</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The periodization of Vygotsky, a famous psychologist of the beginning of the 20th century, still does not lose its relevance.  It was the basis of a number of modern studies.  Vygotsky‚Äôs periodization provides a key to understanding how a person‚Äôs personality changes as he passes through various stages of life. </p><p>  The scientist was particularly attracted to childhood.  And this is not accidental, because it was at this time that the foundations of the personality were laid, radical changes were taking place that influenced the rest of life.  Vygotsky‚Äôs periodization allows us to understand what changes should be expected in the personality of a child of one age or another.  Research scientist can greatly help parents who do not understand what is happening with their children. </p><p>  Age psychology, studying the process of development of a child, gives a characteristic of various age periods.  She operates with concepts such as "childhood" and "age."  The age <span>period (age)</span> is a cycle of child development, which has its own dynamics and structure. </p><h2>  Conventionality of age periods </h2><p>  It should be noted that the psychological age of an individual child and the calendar age, recorded first in the birth certificate and then in the passport, do not always coincide.  It must also be said that each period has its own characteristics of the development of the child‚Äôs personality and mental functions, relationships with others.  In addition, he has certain boundaries, which, however, can be shifted.  It turns out that one child enters one age or another earlier, and the other later.  <span>The boundaries of adolescence,</span> which is associated with puberty, "swim" especially strongly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Childhood includes all initial age periods.  This is a whole era, which is essentially the preparation of a child for independent work, for the beginning of adulthood.  The specificity of the age periods included in it is determined by the level of cultural and socio-economic development of the society to which the child belongs, in which he is educated and educated. </p><p>  When does childhood end in our time?  In psychology, traditionally we are talking about the period from the birth of a child until he reaches 7 years of age.  However, modern childhood, of course, continues after the child enters school.  Of course, the younger student is still a child.  Some psychologists, by the way, are considered as a "protracted childhood" and adolescence.  Whatever opinion we share, we must state the fact that true adulthood expects a child only at the age of 15-17. </p><h2>  L. S. Vygotsky on development </h2>

    <p>  Age development of a person is a complex process.  This is especially true for child development.  At each of the age stages, the person‚Äôs personality changes.  Development according to L. S. Vygotsky (his photo is presented above) is, first of all, the emergence of a new one.  Thus, the developmental stages, according to this psychologist, are characterized by certain age-related neoplasms, that is, those properties or qualities that were not previously available in finished form.  However, as Vygotsky wrote, the new "does not fall from heaven."  It arises naturally.  The whole course of the previous development prepares it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The social environment is a source of development.  Each step in childhood development changes how the environment affects the child.  She becomes completely different when she moves from one <span>age group</span> to another.  L. S. Vygotsky spoke of the "social situation of development."  By this concept, the scientist understood the relationship between a person and the social environment specific to a given age.  The child interacts with the social environment, which educates and educates him.  This interaction determines the path of development leading to the appearance of age-related neoplasms. </p><h2>  Experience and activities </h2><p>  How do children interact with the environment?  Experience and activity are two units of analysis of the so-called social situation of development, which were identified by L. S. Vygotsky.  The activity of the child, his external activity is easy to observe.  However, there is a plan of experiences, that is, an internal plan.  Different children experience the same situation in their family in different ways.  This applies even to twins, that is, children of the same age.  As a result of this, for example, a conflict between parents will have a weak effect on the development of one child, while it will cause a neurosis and various deviations in another.  In addition, moving from one age to another, the same child experiences a particular family situation in a new way. </p><h2>  Vygotsky on development paths </h2><p>  Vygotsky identified the following two development paths.  One of them is critical.  It suddenly arises and flows violently.  The second way of development is calm (lytic).  At some ages, indeed, development is characterized by a lytic, that is, a slow course.  Over the long term, usually spanning several years, no sharp, fundamental changes or shifts occur during these periods.  And those that can be observed do not rearrange the whole person‚Äôs personality.  Only as a result of the long-term course of the latent process do noticeable changes occur. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Lytic periods </h2><p>  In relatively stable ages, development occurs mainly due to minor personality changes.  Accumulating up to a certain limit, they are then detected spasmodically in the form of one or another age-related neoplasm.  Most of childhood is occupied with just such periods.  Since the development within them occurs through the underground, so to speak, changes in personality are distinctly manifested when it is compared at the beginning and end of a certain time period.  Scientists have studied stable ages more fully than characterized by crises - another type of development. </p><h2>  Crises </h2><p>  They were discovered empirically and are still not brought into the system.  From the outside, these periods are characterized by the appearance of traits opposite to stable or steady ages.  For a fairly short time in these periods, concentrated and sharp displacements and shifts, fractures and changes in personality.  In a short time, the child changes whole, in his main personality traits.  At this time, development takes on a rapid, stormy character, sometimes catastrophic.  Such an interesting feature is the periodization of human development. </p><p>  Vygotsky also noted the positive changes that the critical period has.  This is a transition to new forms of behavior.  The scientist identified the following critical periods of childhood: the neonatal period, one year, three years, six to seven years, the teenage period. </p><h2>  Age periodization of Vygotsky </h2>

    <p>  First, a newborn crisis is observed, followed by a younger age (from two months to a year).  At this time, there are contradictions between the minimum communication capabilities and the maximum sociality of the child. </p><p>  The age periodization of Vygotsky continues with a crisis of 1 year.  It is followed by early childhood (from one to three years).  At this time, the activity carried out by a little boy or girl is subject-weapon, it is a "serious game."  The child has speech, walking, gestures. </p><p>  This is followed by a <span>crisis of 3 years,</span> after which comes the preschool age (from three to seven years).  During this period, there is a tendency to separate from the adult (emancipation), as well as to a volitional, rather than an affective form of behavior.  "I myself" appears.  The crisis of 3 years has a positive meaning, expressed in the fact that new personality traits appear.  Scientists have found that if, for one reason or another, this crisis is inexpressive, sluggish, at a later age a little boy or girl shows a significant delay in the development of the volitional and affective sides of the personality. </p><p>  This is followed by a <span>crisis of 7 years,</span> after which a new period begins - school age (from 8 to 12 years).  Children's spontaneity is lost at the indicated time.  This occurs as a result of the differentiation of external and internal life.  The logic of feelings, generalizations, experiences of the child becomes meaningful.  In addition, self-esteem arises.  Regarding the crisis of 7 years, the researchers noted that significant achievements were observed in this period: the child‚Äôs attitude towards other children changed, his independence increased. </p><p>  At the age of 13, the next crisis sets in.  It is followed by <span>puberty</span> (from 14 to 18 years).  At this time, a sense of maturity appears.  The child begins to feel his own personality, his self-awareness develops.  The observed decrease in the productivity of mental work is explained by the fact that the attitude changes from visualization to deduction.  A temporary decrease in working capacity is accompanied by a transition to the highest form of human intellectual activity. </p>

    <p>  Vygotsky noted that youth is the age of 18 to 25 years.  By basic laws and general sense, it is the first period among mature ages.  L. S. Vygotsky gave a detailed periodization of childhood only, however, in the future, the personality of a person changes.  Psychologists, continuing research, identified the following periods. </p><h2>  Youth </h2>

    <p>  Scientists usually define youth as age from 19 to 30 years.  However, it should be noted that the boundaries of age are very arbitrary.  The main activity in this period is intimate and personal communication with representatives of the opposite sex.  It should also be noted that youth is a time of optimism.  At this time, a person is full of energy and strength, the desire to achieve goals.  Youth is the best time for self-realization. </p><h2>  <span>The crisis of creative</span> activity </h2><p>  The crisis of creative activity occurs on the border between youth and middle age (average age - from 30 to 45 years).  The reason for this is an increase in skill, which is accompanied by an increase in routine.  Professional and family life are stabilizing.  There is an understanding that a person is capable of more.  It was at this time that often people change their profession, get divorced. </p><h2>  The average age and crisis of this period </h2>

    <p>  Middle age is also a very conditional age.  It is impossible to precisely determine its borders, but usually they are set within the range of 30 to 45 years.  During this period, high efficiency is observed.  Acquiring life experience, a person becomes a good family man and specialist.  He first seriously thinks about what will remain after his death.  By the end of this stage of human life, a <span>midlife crisis</span> sets in <span>.</span>  The reason for it is that it is at the top and understands that it is necessary to look for other strategies to achieve previous goals or to revise old aspirations.  During this crisis, existential problems (isolation, death, loss of meaning) are actualized, specific problems appear (maladaptation, social loneliness, a complete change of values). </p><h2>  Maturity </h2>

    <p>  Old age is an age period of 60 years or more.  The psychological state of a person at this time is characterized by contemplation, peace, vital asthenia, wise enlightenment, a tendency to memories.  An elderly man or woman develops a caring, but detached position in relation to grandchildren and great-grandchildren. </p><p>  Erickson believed that this phase is not characterized by a new crisis, but by integration, summation and evaluation of all previous stages of development.  Peacefulness often comes in old age, which stems from the ability to look at your life and say humbly but firmly: "I am satisfied."  Those who were able to do this are not afraid of the inevitability of death, since they see the continuation of themselves either in their creative achievements or in their descendants.  But some people regard their life as a series of mistakes and unrealized opportunities.
