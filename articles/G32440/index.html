    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The high season at this Turkish resort begins in May and lasts until November.  First of all, those who choose a beach vacation come to Kemer.  Many tourists combine it with a visit to local historical and cultural monuments.  Today, many Russian travel agencies offer tours to this Turkish resort.  In Kemer, there are about one hundred and seventy hotels with different categories of "stars".  Here, any tourist can find for himself an accommodation option for every taste, from budget economy hotels to luxurious expensive apartments.  Hotels in Kemer can be divided into two types: the former are more suitable for outdoor activities, young people travel here more often, and the latter are suitable for regular family vacations with children.  Almost all hotels have their own entertainment program.  One of these hotels is Synosse Hotel (ex. Marinem Diana Hotel 4 *). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description and photo </h2><p>  It was built in 2004 on the first line of the Mediterranean.  The hotel has a rather convenient location: it is located in the center of the resort area, in the village of Beldibi, only two hundred and thirty meters from the coast and a kilometer from the harbor.  Bright flowers, convenient walkways, clean well-groomed territory - all this immediately catches the eye of tourists arriving at the Synosse Hotel 4 *.  Antalya Airport is only thirty-five kilometers away, which is very important for the parents of those children who do not tolerate a long transfer.  There is a bus stop near the entrance to the hotel.  Numerous shops and cafes are located nearby, where you can enjoy delicious Turkish coffee.  The last major renovation in this hotel was carried out in 2014.  It was then that its name changed.  Previously, the hotel was called <span>Marinem Diana Hotel,</span> and today - Synosse Hotel 4 *.  The total area is six and a half thousand square meters, mainly a park area.  By travel agencies, the hotel is positioned as an option for families.  And this is true: it provides all the conditions for young children.  The convenient location of the hotel, in particular in terms of exploring local attractions, is another of its advantages. </p>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Turkey, in particular Kemer, among Russians is primarily associated with holidays on the Mediterranean beach, however, having arrived here, many want to get acquainted with the ancient history of the region, to visit the centuries-old ruins of ancient cities and temples.  Fifteen kilometers from Kemer, you can see the once flourishing ancient Olympos, in which, according to legend, the gods lived.  Here you can see the classical theater and thermal baths, lined with beautiful mosaics.  In the vicinity of Kemer, another no less surprising place is Yanartash, or the "Fire Mountain".  Here you can observe how gas clots that burst from the ground ignite when they come in contact with air.  Judging by the reviews of our tourists, this is an incredibly bewitching sight, especially in the dark.  At the foot of Mount Yanartash is also a dilapidated <span>temple of Hephaestus.</span> </p><p>  To the west of Kemer there is an open-air ethnographic museum.  Having visited it, tourists will be able to learn all about the life of many nomadic peoples, get acquainted with ancient crafts and dishes of different eras. </p><p>  The cost of excursions depends on the pricing policy of the agency in which they are purchased.  For example, a boat trip to Kekova will cost an average of forty-five dollars.  Judging by the reviews, many tourists bought sightseeing tours in the office, which is located on the ground floor of the administrative block. </p>
