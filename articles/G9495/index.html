There are hundreds of bright butterflies on the Internet that have so gently opened their beautiful wings. </p><p>  Beaded butterflies are best woven using wire.  For those familiar with techniques such as beadwork, wire butterflies will immediately seem preferable.  This is due to the fact that the structure of the butterfly will be more rigid, they will take exactly the form that its creator will ask.  If stringing beads on a fishing line, you can create a three-dimensional figure, but from this the <span>wings of the butterfly</span> will become thick, saggy and unpretentious.

Will it fly from the <span>rainforests</span> or will it be a subject of fantasy and imagination?  All these are trifles that you should not pay attention to.  Much more important are those feelings when a person creates the beautiful.  After all, aesthetic education is in the highest place, and weaving from beads is the development of craving for beauty. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to where then the created insect will be used.  There is no need to argue for a long time.  There are many options: </p><p>  1. Create a beautiful brooch that can be pinned to a dress or summer T-shirt.  Butterfly beads that wave their wings reverently on their shoulders or chest on a sunny day will be a wonderful highlight in casual wear. </p><p>  2. Add small beaded butterflies to the hairstyle.
