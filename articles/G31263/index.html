    <h2>  Device positioning </h2><p>  One of the best entry-level smartphones to date can rightfully be considered "Xiaomi Redmi 2".  This device has everything you need for convenient and comfortable work: a small by current standards display diagonal of 4.7 inches, a 4-core productive chip, a sufficient amount of internal and RAM.  It is also worth noting that there is a more advanced version of this gadget - Xiaomi Redmi 2 Pro.  Reviews indicate a higher level of its performance, which is provided by a larger capacity of the built-in drive and a doubled amount of RAM.  The rest are identical devices.  Separately, it is worth noting the various color options for the device.  In addition to typical white and black, there is also pink, green and yellow.  It is this nuance that allows you to accurately determine the potential buyers of this device - young people.  After all, it is she who in this way tries to express her individuality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Gadget kit </h2><p>  Typical, as for most devices of this manufacturer, the configuration in Xiaomi Redmi 2. Reviews indicate this once again.  Its boxed version includes: </p><ul><li>  The smartphone itself. </li><li>  2200 mAh battery. </li><li>  Charger with 1A output current. </li><li>  <span>Warranty card</span> and <span>user</span> manual. </li></ul>

    <p>  In some cases, this device is additionally equipped with an adapter for domestic outlets.  But in the above list, there is clearly not enough cover and protective film for the front panel.  The case, as noted earlier, this smartphone is plastic, you just can not do without these accessories when using it.  Also, an additional memory card, which, like a cover with a film, will have to be bought additionally, will not be out of place.  In addition to this, you will still need to purchase a stereo headset. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Two generations of this smartphone have much in common.  On the front panel is a screen with a diagonal of 4.7 inches.  Above the display are sensors, a speaker and a <span>front camera.</span>  Under the screen is the familiar control panel of three standard touch buttons.  On the bottom side of the device there is a hole in the conversational microphone and a microUSB port.  On the contrary, on its upper edge, a 3.5 mm audio port is output.  On the right side of the device are buttons for adjusting the volume of the gadget and its lock.  But on the left edge there are no communication or control elements.  The front panel of any device in this series is only one color - black.  But the back cover, as noted earlier, can be white, black, green, yellow or pink.  A similar design decision makes this smart phone similar to the iPhone 5c.  So a very practical version of the back cover is the Xiaomi Redmi 2 Black.  Reviews him <strong> </strong>  owners say that dirt, fingerprints and scratches on it are not too noticeable.  But the female half of humanity will prefer Xiaomi Redmi 2 White.  The reviews of the happy owners are another confirmation of this.  The remaining color options (yellow, green and pink) will be the best choice for young people.  On the back of the device, the peephole of the main camera, the LED backlight for it and the main loud speaker are displayed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  As in the Xiaomi Hongmi 2, Redmi 2 smartphone, reviews on this feature of this device quite often indicate that the same chip is installed - Snapdragon 410 from Kualkom.  Its second name is MSM8916.  He has 4 computing modules based on the currently quite progressive Cortex A53 architecture.  At maximum load, they can give out 1.2 GHz each.  Again, this CPU can handle most of the tasks without a problem.  The only thing that he certainly cannot afford is the most demanding toys of the last generation.  But in this case, you need to look towards devices with a cost of 300 dollars or more.  And this is a completely different price category. </p>

    <h2>  Screen and graphics subsystem </h2><p>  The diagonal of the display in this gadget is 4.7 inches.  It is based on the currently most popular matrix manufacturing technology for screens - ‚ÄúIPS‚Äù.  She has excellent color reproduction, and viewing angles are close to 180 degrees.  The resolution of the display is 1280x720.  That is, the image on it is displayed in ‚ÄúHR‚Äù - quality.  The basis of the graphics subsystem of this device is the Adreno 306 video accelerator.  It cannot boast of an impressive level of performance, but it is perfect for solving most everyday tasks.  Also, entry-level and intermediate-level toys in this graphic solution will work without problems.  But the most demanding games of the latest generation should not be run on this gadget: performance is definitely not enough. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cameras, photo shooting and video recording </h2><p>  The main camera in this device is based on an 8MP sensor.  It also implements important technologies such as autofocus, digital zoom and face recognition.  The developers did not forget about the LED backlight.  The quality of the photos obtained with its help is just excellent, as for such a device.  This camera can shoot video in 1080 p.  In this case, the image refresh rate will be 30 frames per second.  The front camera sensor is more modest - 2 megapixels.  But this is quite enough for a "selfie" and making video calls.  It should also be noted that the front camera can record video in 720 p. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  In the basic configuration, this phone is equipped with only 1 GB of RAM.  At the same time, only 300MB is allocated for the user's needs.  The capacity of the built-in drive is 8 GB.  It is divided as follows: 3 GB - system software, 2 GB - internal memory for installing application software, 3 GB reserved for personal user data.  This is clearly not enough for comfortable work.  Therefore, the potential owner of such a device will also have to purchase an external flash card for an additional fee.  Its maximum capacity in this case can be 32 GB.  But there is a more advanced modification of this smartphone - Xiaomi Redmi 2 Enhanced Edition.  Reviews highlight its memory subsystem.  The RAM capacity of the gadget is increased by 2 times and is already 2 GB.  That is, not 300 MB, but 1300 MB is allocated for the user's needs.  Accordingly, more applications can be simultaneously launched on such a phone.  The capacity of the built-in drive is increased to 16 GB, and the user in this situation can count on 11 GB for personal data.  To top it all off, this device has exactly the same expansion slot as the ‚Äúyounger‚Äù model, and a 32 GB memory card can be installed in it. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The Xiaomi Redmi 2 phone boasts good autonomy. Reviews speak of confident 2-3 days of work from one battery charge at an average load level.  If you run the most demanding applications on this device, you can count on 1 day of battery life.  Well, in the case of maximum battery power, you can stretch for 5 days.  The battery in this device is removable, its capacity is 2200 mAh (200 mAh more than the previous generation model).  It charges from the complete charger in just over 2 hours. </p>

    <h2>  Information exchange </h2><p>  This device supports all major data exchange interfaces.  Among the wireless methods for transmitting information, we can distinguish the following from them: </p><ul><li>  Support for all existing mobile networks: GSM, 3G and LTE.  In the first case, the data transfer rate can reach 500 kb / s - this is only enough to download small sites and communicate on social networks.  But in the case of 3G or LTE files of any size or demanding Internet portals will be loaded quite quickly. </li><li>  It‚Äôs best to use a GPS system to navigate using this phone.  There is a corresponding transmitter in it.  Also at the program level, support for the domestic GLONASS system has been implemented.  There is also the A-GPS system, which uses mobile towers to determine the location of the smartphone. </li><li>  The device is equipped with a Wi-Fi transmitter, which allows you to download files of any size in a matter of minutes. </li><li>  There is also a ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù, which allows you to connect wireless headphones to the gadget or share small files with similar devices. </li><li>  To carry out battery charging and to connect to a computer, the standard microUSB port is used. </li><li>  A 3.5 mm audio port is provided for connecting wired headphones. </li></ul><h2>  Software </h2><p>  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù with serial number 4.4 is a system software, on the basis of which the Xiaomi Redmi 2 smartphone functions. Reviews highlight its stable and reliable operation.  On top of the operating system, the proprietary shell of this manufacturer, MIUI version 6, was installed. The interface of this software system is simple and intuitive.  Therefore, to deal with it is not difficult.  The rest of the software is standard: social mini-programs (Facebook, Twitter, and, of course, Google +), add-ons for the operating system (calculator, organizer, calendar, etc.) and a set of utilities from Google (browser, Google News, etc.).  The rest of the application software will have to be additionally installed by the new owner of this device from the Play Store application store. </p>

    <h2>  Current device cost </h2><p>  It is an excellent ratio of low cost and excellent technical characteristics that is the strength of this manufacturer.  This model of smartphone was no exception in this regard.  At $ 130, the most affordable version of this gadget is currently valued - Xiaomi Redmi 2 8Gb.  The reviews highlight a more advanced modification of the device with the prefix "Pro".  It is priced at 195 dollars.  But at the same time, she has doubled the capacity of the built-in drive and RAM. </p><h2>  Gadget Reviews </h2><p>  Xiaomi Redmi 2 has almost no shortcomings. User reviews often point to small backlash backlashes.  This minus is not so common in devices of this model.  The rest is a great entry-level smartphone, which has everything you need to work.  On the other hand, its technical specifications and the price of 130 dollars correspond to each other.
