An almost four-kilometer straight thread of the underground highway connects North and South Ossetia. </p><h2>  History.  Mountain road </h2><p>  The first mention of the need for a transit road through the Main <span>Caucasian Range</span> appeared in the middle of the XIX century.  The Highlanders demanded that the governor of the Caucasus begin the construction of the ‚Äúarbny‚Äù road.  Already then there was an urgent need for a transport connection between the two parts of Ossetia.  And even then, the bureaucratic machine rejected the project for various reasons. </p>

Georgia took an active position in the discussion, which categorically did not want to lay the path because of the fear of losing Tskhinval (the road would go straight to the city), and with it the natural defense in the form of a pass.

    <p>  In 1930, the question arose of uniting both parts of Ossetia and joining them to socialist Georgia.  Stalin‚Äôs question: ‚ÄúHow do you want to unite them if there is no way between them?‚Äù, - it seemed to move things off the ground. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ruten Gagloev, starting construction, makes the first explosion.  This solemn moment meant that the dream of the inhabitants of Ossetia would finally come true.  Simultaneously with the work begun, design documentation was developed.  The cost of the road was incredibly high.  There was a proposal to stop unprofitable construction and invest in the construction of the railway from Alagir to Gori, that is, to Georgia.  This decision ‚Äúfroze‚Äù work on the pass for 40 years. </p><h2>  Roksky tunnel.  Opening after construction </h2><p>  In the early 70s, L. I. Brezhnev heeded the beliefs of the authorities of North Ossetia in the need for a road through the pass "for the rapid movement of military units."  And, despite the protests of the Georgian side: ‚ÄúWhy another road, if there is a Georgian Military?‚Äù, The project was developed.  N.V. Nagaevsky, taking the initial documentation of R. Gagloev as a basis, was forced to reduce the cost to the detriment of quality and safety, that is, to go through an avalanche-hazardous area. </p><p>  To accept the long-suffering project, we even went for a little trick.  With the cost of the object more than 100 million rubles (and the estimated cost was 120), the project was approved at a meeting of the Politburo.  Given that there are active opponents of the road, the construction was divided into two parts: the first is the road and the tunnel, the second is the avalanche protection facilities.  In this form, the project was approved by the Chairman of the Government A.N. Kosygin.  In 1975, finally, they began laying a tunnel, which was being built simultaneously with the entire Trans-Caucasian highway. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tunneling was carried out using blasting.  The passage began on both sides towards each other.  Ahead of the schedule, the builders completed the passage through the rock and connected on November 4, 1981, so the Roki tunnel was formed.  The opening of a temporary working path for construction equipment took place the next day.  Three years later, the tunnel began to let in a stream of cars.  And the elimination of deficiencies have been doing for a long time. </p><h2>  Tunnel operation </h2><p>  Roksky Pass was considered one of the most disadvantaged sections of Transkam.  It was constantly blocked due to the descent of snow avalanches and rockfalls.  The money allocated for repairs went only to replace the asphalt surface and eliminate leaks.  The work was carried out by specialists of the Vladikavkaz road organization.  Overhaul was never. </p>

For some time the Roki Tunnel was an orphan building.  In 1999, he was taken to the balance of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation and immediately began to examine the condition.  After the complication of international relations with Georgia, the pass became part of the <span>border crossing.</span>

    <p>  In 2007, it became clear that a major overhaul of the structure was necessary, for 25 years of operation it was completely worn out.  The metal was corroded, the waterproofing was broken, the ventilation did not work at all.  Close the movement through the pass for several years was not possible.  Therefore, it was decided that reverse tunnel traffic was introduced in the tunnel.  Car drivers were sympathetic, as driving on the old road became very dangerous. </p><p>  Perhaps the decision on the reconstruction was accelerated by the events of August 2008.  Through this tunnel, the Russian army quickly entered Ossetia to prevent large-scale military operations from Georgia. </p><h2>  Tunnel Reconstruction </h2><p>  Work began at the end of 2010, their completion was expected in 5 years.  In fact, with great efforts, the builders finished working a year earlier.  On November 5, 2014, vehicles under the new tunnel were solemnly launched under the Sokhs mountain. </p>

There were mounted modern engineering communications.

    <p>  The second stage was the repair of the tunnel itself.  Its cross section was also increased, the route was straightened.  At the same time did waterproofing and decoration.  In the construction involved modern powerful equipment. </p><h2>  After reconstruction </h2><p>  Today it is the most modern and safest section of Transkam.  Builders also provided emergency exits in the Roki tunnel.  Opening after reconstruction made it possible to increase the flow of transport in this section.  Concrete coating, as at an airfield, high-quality drainage and waterproofing systems, excellent ventilation and lighting.  Now even heavy trucks can freely part in the tunnel. </p>
