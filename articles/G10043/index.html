Different techniques use different materials and elements. </p><p>  For embroidery Richelieu, the main thing is to create a delicate, almost weightless lace pattern.  Achieving this effect is possible only with the help of high-quality thin threads and a light translucent base. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lace elements" class="if uuid-2675563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2675563.jpg"></div><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  Only the use of quality materials can provide a beautiful result.  On materials for embroidery, Richelieu needlewomen are advised not to save, because it depends on them how the final work will look. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fulfillment of motive" class="if uuid-2675567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2675567.jpg"></div><p>  The fabric is not only decorated with different stitches and types of seams to create lace, but also cut out small elements with scissors to give the finished sample weightlessness.  For the process you will need: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The cloth.  It should be moderately dense and light, but not stretched so that the created pattern does not deform in the future.  An ideal option for work would be a <span>homespun cloth.</span>  For beginners, embroidery Richelieu on the canvas will be easier than using embroidery fabric or solid canvas. </li><li>  Threads.  If the base is natural, then it is advisable to pick up a mouline thread from silk or cotton.  But often synthetic threads are used in the work, which significantly reduces the cost of the process. </li><li>  Needles and scissors are used for sheathing elements and cutting out excess parts. </li></ul><p>  Most embroiderers create embroidery on a sewing machine.  This allows you to make interesting bizarre forms and experiment with fabrics and options for the application of the finished work.  As already noted above, embroidery Richelieu differs from other techniques in ease and delicacy.  Do-it-yourself lace will look very impressive and interesting. </p><h2>  Step by step execution </h2><p>  Before starting work, it is necessary to carry out the procedure of tissue decanting.  This protects the base from rolling after washing.  Richelieu embroidery material is dipped for some time in warm water, squeezed out by hand and dried.  After this, the fabric needs to be ironed carefully. </p><p>  After that, with the help of a water-soluble marker, the pattern begins to be transferred to the base.  To ensure that all elements are well drawn, you need to use a hoop or an embroidery machine.  They will create a good strong stretch. </p><p>  Beginning needlewomen craftswomen are advised to use simple motives, and only after practice to switch to multi-stage plots.  Ready contours should be stitched with ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù stitches so that it is clear which parts need to be sewn. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bordal.pt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork motifs" class="if uuid-2675564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2675564.jpg"></div><p>  The middle of the element is sewn up with satin, the remaining parts are carefully cut out.  If the work consists of many small details, then in step-by-step embroidery, Richelieu for beginners is advised to use a small clerical knife to speed up and simplify the cutting process. </p><h2>  Craftswoman Tips </h2><p>  To prevent the fabric from sagging in the process, you can slightly starch the material, but not much, because during the cutting process this will create additional difficulties.  Before starting work, it is recommended to look at ready-made photos of Richelieu embroidery. </p><p>  This will help to avoid errors in the process of doing the work.  Although the drawing will be translated into material, you can additionally make yourself a diagram and be guided by it in the process of cutting out unnecessary parts. </p><p>  In the work, symmetry is important, this applies to any type of motive.  You cannot create the same elements of different sizes; from this, the finished result will look sloppy. </p><p>  To create classic patterns, it is advised to use white threads, since contrasting colors or shades of the same gamut can affect the volume of work, reducing it.  For lace, white is considered optimal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="combination of shades" class="if uuid-2675565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2675565.jpg"></div><h2>  Application options </h2><p>  The technique relates to applied embroidery, allows you to create beautiful tablecloths, pillows, napkins.  Recently, richelieu elements on clothing and accessories have become popular. </p><p>  This is a universal type of embroidery, since its elements can be combined with other needlework techniques, and a variety of stitches can be used to create complex patterns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lagarterana.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lace tablecloth" class="if uuid-2675568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2675568.jpg"></div><p>  In the artistic version, embroidery should be done with a lot of lace elements, here the role of stitches fades into the background.  The technique goes well with standard cross-stitch, if the second conveys the clarity of the picture and is used to display the plot, then the cutwork has a purely decorative character and only complements the chosen theme. </p><h2>  Combination with beads </h2><p>  Sew on details can be used to create bulk or highlight individual elements.  Depending on the <span>size of the beads,</span> you can create more voluminous work, as well as small motifs. </p><p>  The smaller the amount of work, the more accurate and smaller the beads should be.  Also, to create the desired density, needlewomen advise novice craftswomen to use small beads. </p><p>  Beads can easily fill the contours of the pattern, sewing one element to the canvas.  For greater reliability, you need to use a special thread for beads, it is strong and does not fray during use. </p><p>  You can sew beads already strung on a thread with another thread, clasping the necessary elements.  But this should be done carefully and not use this option to create clothes, because if the thread breaks from the fabric, then all work will be spoiled.  It is also advisable to use white beads for the process. </p><h2>  Secrets </h2><p>  In a step-by-step embroidery, Richelieu does not describe tricks that help to complete the work faster and better.  Putting them into practice will help to significantly save time and allow you to create a quality product. </p><ul><li>  Cut unwanted items better at the end of the work.  Sometimes craftswomen make mistakes in the process of sewing on elements or creating seams.  To hide this, lace motifs with carving are used. </li><li>  If you need to create additional volume and add elegance to the work, it is better to perform the motif with threads of different shades of the same tone, this will add depth to the work. </li><li>  To strengthen the contours, it is better to use a loop seam. </li></ul><p>  Even a beginner needlewoman can cope with the creation of a drawing on a canvas with delicate motifs.  There is nothing complicated here. </p><h2>  Floral motif </h2><p>  Floral motif is simple, but requires perseverance and accuracy.  Ideal for those who have already mastered the stitch embroidery technique and want to practice other techniques. </p><p>  After transferring the pattern to the fabric, it is necessary to sheathe the contours, and then perform the breezes.  These are special jumpers made of threads that prevent the embroidery elements from spreading and help to keep in shape. </p><p>  A thread is placed over the fabric, part of which will be cut, and additionally sheathed with dense, uniformly sized seams.  Ideal here is the use of a loop seam. </p><p>  Next, with scissors, you need to cut out the excess elements, but this should be done carefully so as not to damage the fabric.  The scheme is suitable for decorating a handbag, scarf or napkin on a table. </p><h2>  Napkin motives </h2><p>  Floral motifs and ornaments from geometric shapes can be used to create a festive tablecloth.  The abstraction highlighted in contrasting colors or shades of one gamma will look beautiful.  Embroidery of a Richelieu on a typewriter for beginners will be simple, but this will require certain skills to recreate the selected pattern on the canvas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.folk-art-hungary.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="multi-colored napkin" class="if uuid-2675569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2675569.jpg"></div><p>  In most cases, motifs serve as a frame for napkins and are created along the edges of the product.  But neatly and evenly executed, they can become a real masterpiece and turn even an ordinary piece of fabric into a work of art. </p>
