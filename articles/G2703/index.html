  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choosing a mobile phone for a child: basic criteria and popular models</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Does a <span>child</span> need a mobile <span>phone at</span> all?  For most parents, this question is rhetorical, because this device allows you to find out at any time where the child is left unattended, and what he does.  In fact, this is the main purpose of a cell phone.  That is, before entering the school, the baby is unlikely to need his mobile.  But the more independent the child becomes, the more new people and events appear in his life, the more dangers await him.  You will be worried anyway.  And therefore, from the moment of entering school, a mobile <span>phone for a child</span> is not just a luxury item, but a real necessity.  But how to choose it? </p><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone for baby" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10783/107177.jpg" width="600"></div>  Say no to expensive models </h3><p>  Too expensive a phone with a huge amount of "bells and whistles" for a child, in fact, is useless.  Having bought such a model, you will expose it to a serious risk of being robbed or get into a fight.  In addition, children themselves are rarely accurate with respect to technology.  Therefore, even throwing out a "tidy" amount for the gadget, you run the risk of seeing a lot of cracks and scratches on it after a month or two.  And the more expensive the selected phone model, the more expensive it will cost you to repair it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h3>  Convenience and lightness </h3><p>  What do you personally prefer: a bulky device that barely fits in your hand, or a compact and lightweight phone?  98% of people will opt for the second option.  So for your child the phone should be convenient: not too big and not heavy.  A cell phone that is ideal in size should fit in the pockets of your child (moreover, do not look out and fall out of them). </p><p>  It is important to immediately adjust the appropriate ringer volume.  If he is too quiet, there is a great risk that the child simply will not hear him (especially during a noisy break).  At the same time, too loud a signal will annoy others and may serve as a reason for comments from teachers. </p><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kids mobile phone" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10783/107180.jpg" width="350"></div>  Quality </h3><p>  Everything is simple here: you should not save when buying a mobile phone for a child.  Most likely, there will come a time when it will have to be repaired.  Therefore, it is best to immediately buy a reliable and trusted manufacturer's cell phone.  Moreover, it should be purchased at specialized points of sale or equipment supermarkets, where, among other things, they will provide you with a guarantee and other documentation.  If you buy a used phone, it is better to immediately check all its functions and replace the ‚Äúworn-out‚Äù battery. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h3>  Choose what your child likes! </h3><p>  When you choose a mobile phone for a child, be sure to consult with him.  Outline a few models that satisfy you according to all the above criteria, but the final choice should remain with your child.  To put it simply, you need to find a ‚Äúmiddle ground‚Äù between your abilities and the needs and desires of the child himself. </p><h3>  Popular models </h3><p>  How to choose a mobile phone, we already know.  But which of the hundreds of models worth paying attention to? </p><h4>  Samsung C3011 </h4><p>  This is a great <span>kids mobile phone.</span>  It will cost you approximately 55-65 cu  Samsung C3011 - lightweight, supporting camera functions (0.3 megapixels), FM receiver, Bluetooth.  There is a slot for a flash memory card.  We can safely say that the Samsung C3011 is ideal for children of any age. </p><h4><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose a mobile phone" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10783/107182.jpg" width="476"></div>  Nokia Asha 200 </h4><p>  A fairly modern model, released at the end of 2011 and has found many fans among people of all ages.  Its highlight is a full QWERTY keyboard, with which it is much more convenient to type messages and use the Internet.  The cost of the device on average is $ 100, but for the money you get a ‚Äúcomplete set of chips" - from Bluetooth and a 2 megapixel camera to a huge selection of colors.  In addition, Nokia Asha 200 supports the ability to use SD-cards and is equipped with an incredibly capacious Li-on battery for as much as 1430 mAh! </p><h4>  Samsung Star 3 </h4><p>  Convenient <span>touch candy bar</span> with a thickness of only 11.5 mm.  It costs a little more than previous models - about $ 140.  But any child from Samsung Star 3 will be delighted!  After all, it is not only beautiful and convenient, but also very functional (support for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 3.0, games, FM radio, organizer capabilities, etc.).  The three-inch QVGA display shows very bright and colorful images.  Among other things, Samsung Star 3 is equipped with a good camera for as much as 3.2 megapixels.  If your child is in high school, this is the best option for him. </p>
