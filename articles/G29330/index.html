Named icons are the <span>faces of saints,</span> they are also called guardian angels, whose names were given to a person at baptism.  If you order a set as a gift, then note that there can be several saints with the same name.  It is better for the person to ask the name given at baptism, or consult with the priest about choosing an icon as a gift. </p><h2>  How to <span>embroider icons with beads?</span> </h2><p>  It is better to work with a ready-made kit, where instructions, beads, needles, and a canvas with a pattern have already been given.  Embroider the icon on the frame (knock four bars under the size of the embroidery), joke the ends of the fabric to it.  If you do not tighten the canvas during the work, then you can work without auxiliary materials. </p><p>  Now proceed to embroider the name icon: </p><ul><li>  insert the two ends of the thread into the needle, forming a loop; </li><li>  bring it in the lower left corner to the front of the canvas; </li><li>  string the bead; </li><li>  insert the needle into the opposite corner; </li><li>  then withdraw the needle in the next cell in the same lower left corner and repeat again; </li><li>  as soon as the thread is finished, stretch the needle on the wrong side through a few stitches. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery of personalized icons with beads" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/349573.jpg" width="235"></div></li></ul><p>  As with any needlework, the embroidery of nominal icons with beads should be without knots and broaches.  Therefore, we embroider in two additions to form a loop, and at the end of the thread we sew the bead twice and hide it under 8-10 stitches on the wrong side.  If the set contains beads of different textures and sizes, then embroider small ones first.  Since large beads can take up more space than is shown in the figure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bead embroidery of personalized icons: general tips </h2><p>  For durability of embroidery, beads are sewn twice, if the work is under glass, then you can attach the thread once.  The main criterion for the quality of the icons is the evenness of the product.  Therefore, experts advise to sew either vertical, or horizontal, or diagonal rows, introducing and removing the needle in the same place. </p><p>  This is necessary so that the embroidery of nominal icons with beads is even.  Having reached the face, hands or inscription, start the next row as if the previous one was finished.  In the best option, work in such places with several needles so that the painted areas are without assemblies and constrictions. </p><p>  Choose a thread of white or the color of the fabric.  Under the dark beads, the shades of the thread are not visible, but it is better to embroider transparent beads with monofilament.  The technique in a circular motion requires professional skills, as the bugles of different sizes and different direction of the rows are used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beadwork icons registered schemes" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/349099.jpg?1394372747938" width="276"></div>

    <p>  Pay attention to the quality of the canvas: it is difficult to embroider on linen, but the beads do not slip, and the material does not come off.  Needles are easily pierced through silk, the entry / exit points for the needle are clearly visible in the figure, but the fabric is twisted with a slight pull of the thread. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to choose bead sets </h2><p>  When buying a set of icons, you need to pay attention to quality.  Unlike floss beads, it is difficult to convey the entire palette of colors.  Where backstitch can emphasize the sharpness and elegance of lines, bead embroidery uses either a different color or a drawn pattern.  That is why some schemes are fuzzy, and the plots of the paintings can only be seen from afar (near everything merges into a spot). </p><p>  Therefore, you need to carefully approach the sets and patterns (monochrome and for the cross do not fit, only beadwork).  Icons registered ‚ÄúCrochet‚Äù are more expensive in comparison with the manufacturer ‚ÄúAbris Art‚Äù, but their quality is better.  The faces of the saints are clearly drawn, the maximum number of colors is used in the work, the background is drawn with an abstract pattern or landscape.  When choosing a kit, look at the size of the finished embroidery.  Icons of small size (about 10 cm) can be carried with you as a talisman, and large sizes (up to 30 cm) should be hung at home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery with beads" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/349086.jpg?1394372789346" width="430"></div>

    <p>  Of all types of needlework, beadwork is considered the most beautiful.  Named icons (schemes refer to production ones) look like real ones.  Many pros combine embroidery with beads of different sizes, beads and stones with the faces of saints from religious calendars.  This technique requires great professionalism and patience. </p>
