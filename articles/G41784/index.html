Golubitskaya is waiting for you!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is no secret that vacation on the Black Sea rises in price every year, and service, especially in small towns, still remains at the level of Soviet times.  Nevertheless, the Black Sea is very fond of, and in summer there are so many vacationers that the air seems to be thick, saturated with vapors of alcohol, sweat and reckless walks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park golubitskaya" class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/271288.jpg" width="395"></div>  There is nothing wrong with that, unless we are talking about children's vacations.  Kids still need a quieter place.  Thus, the village of Golubitskaya is an almost ideal place for children's recreation.  On the one hand, it has everything that children and their parents need: a crocodile farm, a butterfly park, an aqua park (Golubitskaya is the only Azov resort with such a park).  On the other hand, this place seems very quiet compared to any Black Sea village.  <span>What is the village of</span> Golubitskaya?  A water park and a crocodile farm, a butterfly park and a mud volcano, a warm shallow Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov and a pleasant breeze even in the most severe heat.  The local water park is the second largest on the coast.  Unlike Gelendzhiksky, it occupies a smaller territory, but there are no queues here.  There are many entertainments in the village <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stanitsa golubitskaya water park" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/271285.jpg" width="431"></div>  but the main thing, of course, is still the water park.  Golubitskaya is located between two seas: Black and Azov.  Perhaps that is why the level of the slides is very close to the Black Sea, and the prices are close to the Azov ones.  This season, a ticket for everyone above 120 cm cost 700 rubles, and for those below this mark - only 450.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Amazon Waterpark </p><p>  Golubitskaya, whose prices have not been rising for several years, is very affordable for an economical vacation.  Here you can not only relax well, but also not spend a lot of money.  A ticket to the water park is also available (Golubitskaya has not raised prices for several years), especially when you consider that it operates from 9.00 to 21.00.  On two hectares there are five dizzying slides (one of them is 25 m in height), two swimming pools, a variety platform, cafes and cafes, a tasting room.  There is a pond for fishing.  Guests of the water park note the magnificence of the pools, always clean snow-white sun loungers.  The most ‚Äúcalm‚Äù hill, green, is intended for those who like to go down on a rubber circle.  But sometimes there‚Äôs no queue for the ‚ÄúPigtail‚Äù: it‚Äôs so breathtaking during the descent that even young people don‚Äôt immediately recover from the amount of adrenaline thrown into the blood.  The girls swear never to come down again from the ‚ÄúPigtail‚Äù, but after half an hour they again, screaming with delight, go upstairs.  By the way, it‚Äôs better to ride in a <span>closed swimsuit,</span> as there is a risk of losing clothes at too high a speed.  The water park has its own hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park amazon golubitskaya prices" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/271278.jpg" width="502"></div>  Those who live in it use the rides for free.  Every evening, something interesting takes place on the territory of the water park: famous artists perform here, <span>foam parties</span> and discos are organized.  Naturally, the locker rooms, places for storing things and all the other auxiliary rooms are also there and are in perfect order.  And what to do in the village in the evening or when you are bored with crocodiles, dolphins, and a water park?  Golubitskaya is located nearby (only 30 km) with Temryuk.  There is a large market, good shops, the Military Hill memorial.  From the village, excursions are organized to the ethnic village of Ataman (during the day), the African village (at night).  In addition, you can go to the Tuzlov spit, which practically connects the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov and the Black Sea, and splash around all day in the waves of two seas.  There are also mud volcanoes, horseback riding, excavations and excursions to various picturesque corners.  And all this at prices completely incomparable with the Black Sea.
