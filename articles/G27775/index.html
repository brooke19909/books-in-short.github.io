  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forms of ownership and their classification</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many authors studying <span>forms of ownership</span> (including land ownership) are faced with the fact that there is no single classification system for this term.  Each author offers his own classification, which seems to him the most correct.  To begin with, we will consider forms of ownership depending on the subject of ownership, i.e.  depending on the ownership of the property to a specific entity. </p><p>  Individual property implies the individual‚Äôs full right to dispose of his property.  The owner clearly knows and understands what belongs specifically to him.  This form of ownership, in turn, is divided into personal and private.  Personal property, as a rule, assumes that the owner uses and consumes the property himself or allows others to use it completely free of charge.  It follows that private property is those objects of property that are provided for use by other persons for a fee.  The category of private property is the economic one, since it is it that has an effective influence on the efficiency of the economy. </p><p>  Collective property does not belong to a specific individual, but to a group, community or collective.  Most often, such a team is a legal entity (company, enterprise), public organization, or government agency. </p><p>  Public property - this property, which belongs to everyone and everyone on an equal footing.  With regard to this form of ownership, it is practically impossible, and not necessary, to specify the owner.  Public property is natural wealth that is not involved in social production: water, air, flora, fauna, etc. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But that property, which is involved in social production, belongs to the state.  This may be information, working capital, etc., this is property that, by the will of the people, under certain conditions, has been placed at the disposal of state bodies.  Regional state ownership is what belongs to the <span>subjects of the federation.</span>  Communal and <span>municipal property is</span> transferred to the disposal of local governments.  General forms of ownership involve the use of certain property, values, etc.  a group of people in compliance with the general rules established by law. </p><p>  This classification is different from that which is widely known and spelled out in Russian law.  According to the latter, the forms of ownership in Russia are as follows: private, municipal, state and other forms. </p><p>  Private property is interpreted as any property that citizens and legal entities freely dispose of and use for any activity they need.  Free disposal is limited, in addition to the interests of the owner, only by the general framework of laws and market conditions.  State ownership includes the country's resources and various objects that are of state or defense significance.  In municipal ownership are all urban and rural settlements, counties and areas.  Other forms of ownership: property of <span>religious organizations,</span> property of foreign states on Russian territory, etc. </p><p>  Forms of property on land are identical to general forms of ownership.  Allocate state, municipal and private property.  State ownership of land, in turn, is divided into property of the Russian Federation (federal property) and property of <span>constituent entities of the Russian Federation.</span> </p>
