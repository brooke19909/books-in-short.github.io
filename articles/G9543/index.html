The international airport is about 5 km away.  The organizers of the institution managed to successfully combine the national flavor with the highest standards of service, a welcoming atmosphere - with comfort and coziness.  It is these sides that are mentioned in the reviews left by former hotel guests.  In addition, the reviews mention that I liked the quick check-in and the same quick paperwork.  But the most important thing is that there is no checkout time, so you can call in and check out at any time.  Payment is made for every 24 hours of stay at the time of departure.  The price includes: transfer, internet, breakfast.  Of the minuses - a small number of outlets in the rooms and the lack of hangers - there are only 2 of them, and robes are hung on them.

One of the restaurants is located on the top floor, from where you can admire the beauty of the city.  There is a gym, sauna and a place to play billiards.  You can also order breakfast in your room, as well as drinks and food at any other time.  Upon request, cooks can specially prepare any diet dish - all this is stated in the reviews of former hotel guests.  Many recommend it as an excellent institution, where there is everything for a quality stay.  And this is not surprising: in the rating of hotels in the city "Megapolis" is one of the highest places. </p><p>  Check-out (before 12:00) and check-in (from 14:00) is expedited.  Private parking is available where a hotel employee can drive away. </p><h2>  Room reservation </h2><p>  Today, thanks to the World Wide Web, Shymkent hotels offer to book a room online.  It is convenient, saves time and takes only a few minutes.  Of course, each consumer is primarily interested in how safe it is to transfer their personal data via the Internet. </p><p>  Each hotel establishment takes this issue very seriously, and in order to ensure the safety of each client's information, it is transmitted in a secure mode and in encrypted form.  In addition, no funds from customers' credit cards, other than reservation fees, are withdrawn.  Payment for accommodation is made by the client only at the hotel. </p><h2>  Cancellation </h2><p>  There are frequent cases when a person is forced to cancel a trip for various reasons.  Can he return his money by canceling the reservation?  There are several rules common to most hotel establishments: </p><ol><li>  If the cancellation occurred two (or more) days before the day when the person was supposed to check into the hotel, fines will not be charged. </li><li>  If the reservation is canceled later or on the day of arrival, a penalty will be charged.  It is equal to the total cost of the reservation. </li></ol><p>  Since Shymkent hotels are quite diverse and each has its own rules, you must pay attention to this item when booking a room, having read the cancellation policy. </p><h2>  Financial questions </h2><p>  Shymkent hotels offer several payment options so that each guest of the city can take advantage of the most suitable offer for him.  You can pay for accommodation: </p><ol><li>  In cash. </li><li>  Transfer of funds. </li><li>  Card.  Accepted credit cards Master card, Visa Electron, Visa. </li></ol><p>  There is a single estimated time for payment - 24 hours.  The reference is the time of arrival.  But in some institutions, the estimated time may be different - 12 hours, so this must be clarified even when booking a room. </p>
