  <section class="page js-page"><h1>USSR formation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the USSR is a very important period in the history of one sixth of our planet.  In addition, this is also an important period in the history of our Motherland.  Like any story of great powers, this is a story of great victories and great defeats, this is a story of the happiness and hopes of millions of people and a history of tragedies for many.  The ideas with which the USSR was created still delight a huge number of people of different nationalities.  There are those for whom the USSR is associated with the "Empire of Evil."  In any case, a person who is proud of the victory in the war, which we call the Great Patriotic War, the first manned flight into space, one of the best <span>education systems,</span> is proud of the successes of the USSR.  Thus, the history of the USSR is dear to everyone who cherishes the history of Russia. </p><p>  <strong>USSR formation</strong> </p><p>  It is impossible to understand the history of a state without studying the history of the formation of that state.  Therefore, it is important to know the history of the formation of the USSR.  History takes us back to 1922, when representatives of the four Soviet republics signed a document on the formation of a union state.  On December 29, this agreement was signed, and the next day the agreement was approved at the All-Union Congress of Soviets.  This day, December 30 is the day from which the history of the USSR begins, the formation of which we are considering.  The following republics took part in the signing of the treaty in those days: Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Federative Republic, Socialist Soviet Republic of Belarus, Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.  The Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic is a state composed of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia.  The formation of the USSR is associated with the signing of the treaty by precisely the four republics.  And it was destroyed in December 1991 by representatives of only three republics, which is one of the reasons for the absolute illegality of the destruction of a single state. <br>  <span>The creation of the USSR was</span> preceded by the February Revolution, the fall of the monarchy, the collapse of the Russian Empire, the <span>October Revolution, a</span> bloody civil war.  Under these conditions, the Bolsheviks were able to recreate a single state.  What are the reasons that a large and strong state was re-formed on the territory of the collapsed empire? </p><p>  <strong>The formation of the USSR: reasons</strong> </p><p>  Long-standing historical ties of the territories that became part of the state.  The formation of the USSR did not take place from scratch ‚Äî these territories had long-standing economic, social, and cultural ties, which necessitated the creation of a single state. <br>  The ideological closeness of the political regimes prevailing in the republics.  The main ideas that guided the governments of the republics were socialism, internationalism, universal equality, an early world revolution.  This pushed for the formation of the USSR. <br>  Hostility of the surrounding states in relation to the <span>Soviet republics.</span>  <span>External</span> danger united the republics among themselves. <br>  Cooperation between the republics has been going since the establishment of <span>Soviet power</span> in the republics <span>.</span>  During 1920‚Äì22, various <span>cooperation agreements</span> were signed between the republics <span>.</span>  The need to create a single state became increasingly apparent.  Among the leadership of the RSFSR, there were disputes about how to build a single state.  Autonomists led by Stalin assumed that the republics would become part of the RSFSR, while gaining autonomy.  Opponents of this path led by Lenin proposed the unification of equal republics into a federation.  As a result, the Leninist version won, and a federal state of the USSR was created. </p>
