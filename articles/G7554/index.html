    <h2>  Main advantages </h2><p>  Since a number of apartments are already sold out today, people are starting to look closely at their housing.  And therefore, reviews of residents begin to appear.  “House on Profsoyuznaya 69” is located in a very attractive area, and many want to live here.  The low cost of housing is the main advantage, which for most is decisive.  What else can be noted: </p><ul><li>  The proximity of the subway.  In walking distance at once two branches. </li><li>  The house is located in an area with existing infrastructure.  Lack of such is the main minus of all new residential complexes. </li><li>  Quick commissioning.  The frame of the building was initially ready, so only redevelopment and major repairs are underway.  The object will be surrendered by the end of 2017. </li></ul><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Reviews about LCD "House on Profsoyuznaya 69" are not limited to pluses.  There are moments that customers are not too happy with, and they openly write about it on the official website: </p><ul><li>  In the arsenal are only small-sized apartments.  It is precisely because of this that prices are low for this area of ​​Moscow. </li><li>  The developer is inexperienced.  This is the first project in the company's portfolio.  On the other hand, this is not the most difficult project, because the frame of the building already exists. </li><li>  A big minus is the lack of own parking.  That is, residents are invited to leave cars right next to the house, which is not too convenient. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd house on union 69 customer reviews prices" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2181055.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Now let's look at the prices.  LCD "House on Profsoyuznaya 69" is aimed at young couples, as well as single people.  The standard studio has a total area of ​​17 m2.  Its cost is 3 million rubles.  Today on the fifth floor a cozy studio is for sale.  The living area is 8 m <sup>2</sup> .  The commissioning deadline is December 2017.  One-room apartments have a larger area.  On average, it is 37 or 38 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><h2>  Customer opinion </h2><p>  Reviews about LCD about “House on Profsoyuznaya 69” are affordable housing in the center of the capital.  There are finished apartments with finishes upon request.  It is proposed to buy apartments of a small area.  At the same time, here you can find an option for any family, since having bought two apartments, it is possible to combine them.  Due to this, create different layout options.  If your family grows, it will be possible to increase living space. </p><p>  Those who have already made a purchase emphasize that a considerable part of the work is yet to come.  Yes, people already live somewhere.  However, most apartments are still without decoration.  All this is carried out under the contract, after the purchase.  Immediately pay attention to the thickness of the walls and the quality of decoration, so as not to overhear the conversations of neighbors.  It is very difficult to verify this today, because you are shown not the apartment selected on the plan, but the standard one, which is prepared for this.  If the sound insulation is bad, then you have to do it yourself, and this is an additional cost. </p><p>  On the floor, the developer places the laminate.  It is difficult to judge whether there is a substrate, whether the laying technology was followed.  Therefore, here, too, after checking in, one may encounter surprises.  Another point that buyers note is heating.  In the office room on the second floor, a battery is the width of the window.  And in the rooms for sale, it barely makes 1/3 of its width.  It turns out that after acquiring an apartment it will most likely have to be changed, otherwise it will be cold in winter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews of residents of the house at union 69" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2181056.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Office service </h2><p>  In fact, the reviews are not unambiguous.  Some note the warm welcome and polite attitude of managers, others note some inconsistencies.  The site does not have open data on which apartments have already been sold and which are free and ready for sale.  In this case, the cost is indicated only minimal.  That is, you come to the office at the facility and find out all the necessary information on the spot.  What awaits you here: </p><ul><li>  There is no finished price.  It is calculated each time with the client.  This creates certain difficulties in comparing prices among themselves. </li><li>  Managers here do not show a complete list of available apartments.  To the request to show all available options in printed form, they answer that the information is closed. </li><li>  Documents that will have to be signed are not given into the hands.  They can be read only at the time of signing. </li><li>  If possible, come to the office with a competent lawyer. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, when choosing an apartment in this complex you can encounter certain difficulties and pitfalls.  Therefore, you need to be extremely careful.  Your future life and calm depend on the choice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="builder reviews lcd house on union 69" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2181070.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Making your own choice </h2><p>  The official website of the project is full of bright slogans on the topic of affordable own housing.  It would seem nothing special.  But when you read about the essence of the project, it sounds very convincing.  This is a home for those who want to get their first home or a Moscow residence permit.  Fulcrum for future, new life.  It's no secret that many have to buy housing in old houses in order to get their start in life.  This project is something similar, but on a different scale. </p><p>  A huge fifteen-story house has been converted into a residential complex.  After major repairs, more than 200 apartments will be provided to buyers here.  As practice shows, such housing is very popular in the market.  This project is not a champion in terms of dimensions, such have already happened and have repeatedly confirmed their relevance, receiving good customer reviews. </p><p>  Prices for residential complex “House on Profsoyuznaya 69” start at 3 million. Such amounts can slightly scare an unprepared person.  But to find primary housing for the money in the "old" Moscow, next to the metro is simply unrealistic.  Everyone knows that new buildings are mostly located on the periphery, opening up new areas, where often there are no schools, shops, or public transport stops.  Therefore, customers are constantly on the official website, waiting for news about the sale of housing. </p>
