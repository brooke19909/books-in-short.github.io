    <p>  Working process: </p><ol><li>  A sheet of colorful color cardboard should be folded in half and form the desired size of the future postcard.  If necessary, cut off the edges on it, making them slightly rounded. </li><li>  Draw an oval with openwork edges on a sheet of pink paper and cut out all the necessary details with a special knife.  The result should be a figure with a solid middle and lace edges.  The oval should be glued in the center of the postcard in a horizontal position. </li><li>  From white and pink paper, it is necessary to cut seven <span>small flowers</span> with carved edges (preferably of different shapes).  In order for all the flowers to be beautiful, they must first be drawn and then cut. </li><li>  From green and light green colored paper you need to cut a lot of leaves of different shapes and sizes.  The lighter the edges of the finished leaves will be, the more beautiful the postcard will look. </li><li>  Next, proceed to the manufacture of parts for a large flower.  It will consist of several parts.  To do this, draw 15 petals of elongated shape on a sheet of white paper and cut them out.  Then you need to bend each petal in half (vertically) and press the edges with your fingers.  After that, it is necessary to cut 10 petals from pink paper, but of a different shape (as indicated in the photo).  It is not necessary to bend the pink details. </li><li>  When all the details for decorating the postcard are ready, you need to glue them.  In the lower right corner of the card, you need to glue the white petals in the shape of a flower.  Details should be placed close to each other, with sharp folds down.  Next, you need to start forming the middle of the flower by gluing pink petals so that they have a cup shape.  In the center of the resulting flower you need with glue to attach a lot of small white beads. </li><li>  To the left and right of the large flower, it is necessary to glue pink flowers with the middle of pearl beads. </li><li>  In the upper left corner, you need to fix 3 white flowers with pearl centers. </li><li>  Now it remains to decorate the craft with carved leaves, and it is almost ready for use. </li></ol><p>  Similar cards "From March 8!"  can be made in absolutely any color and have other shapes of flower petals.  And in the center of the lace oval you can write a beautiful wish. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Friendly greetings </h2><p>  Original greeting cards for friends and girlfriends are especially popular.

The brighter and more colorful the buttons and pencils will be used to decorate the card, the more original it will look.  Do not dwell on this type of product, because stalks and leaves can be added to buttons.  And also depict the sun and blue clouds in the sky. </p><h2>  For grandparents </h2><p>  Some people have a question how to decorate a postcard for people of advanced age so that they like it.  Indeed, many modern ideas are not to their liking.  But in this case, you can come up with an interesting solution, using application for decorating the product. </p><p>  Such an application can be made of paper, as in quilling, or from clippings from magazines.  If all these elements were skillfully placed on a folded cardboard, then we get pretty interesting models of greeting cards.  Do not forget that in such a craft not only flat objects, but also having three-dimensional shapes will look great.  For example, a house with open shutters and a flower bed.  Surely this will please the elderly. </p>
