  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Colognes of the USSR: description, features and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the Union, there was no such thing as a men's perfume.  For the stronger sex, practical colognes were produced.  They were created to perform hygiene procedures.  Colognes in the USSR were very cheap, and used them everywhere.  And not only men, and not only after shaving.  After reading this article, those born in the USSR will feel nostalgia, while younger readers will learn something new from the history of the Soviet Union. </p><h2>  Triple cologne from the USSR </h2><p>  It cost a mere penny.  The cheapest cologne was smeared on the face after shaving, it was used to disinfect hands, and compresses were made.  Some motorists wiped them the details of the car when fixing it.  Well, and the fact remains, colognes in the USSR were made from natural alcohol, so often they were simply drunk.  One bottle of such a “drink” was equal in strength to a bottle of vodka. </p><p>  How did men get the idea that cologne can be drunk?  The fact is that everyone knew about the manual for the means of this type, which was written back in the 18th century.  The instructions suggested for heart palpitations or headaches to drip 30-40 drops in a glass of water and drink in one gulp. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Triple Cologne" class="if uuid-2597610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2597610.jpg"></div><p>  Do you know where the name “Triple” came from?  Producers associated the history of its creation with Napoleon.  It was he who gave the task to his perfumers to create a tool with a triple effect.  The emperor, who spent most of his life on campaigns, wanted the liquid to have three qualities: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  freshened up; </li><li>  disinfected </li><li>  possessed healing properties. </li></ul><p>  Reviews of the Triple Cologne are generally quite good.  The smell was harsh, but everyone got used to it, and it quickly disappeared.  Given its multitasking and very low cost, few used it as a perfume.  It was perfect for hygiene procedures and was used by the whole family.  Grandmothers smeared their knees and wrapped them in scarves.  Means warmed pleasantly.  Moms rubbed their chest and back with a cold for children. </p><h2>  Cologne "Shipr" </h2><p>  A more expensive analogue of the Triple Cologne is a remedy called Chypre.  The history of its creation was allegedly connected with the island of Cyprus.  When creating a brand, the name was defeated, and the result was “Shipr.” </p><p>  The aroma of this tool felt notes of exotic plants and sandalwood.  Men's perfume contained a slaughter percentage of alcohol - 70%.  Despite this fact, he was rarely taken inside.  Apparently, the perfumery composition more inclined the male gender to choke on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newauction.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cologne &quot;Shipr&quot;" class="if uuid-2597652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2597652.jpg"></div><h2>  Colognes from France to the USSR </h2><p>  Finding a good imported fragrance for men in the Union was very difficult.  Mods who did not have connections used the means of joint production of the USSR and France. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  They were produced by the Novaya Zorya factory.  Cologne "Commander" in the USSR enjoyed wildly popular.  There was also the “Consul”, which had a wonderful fresh aroma. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Cologne &quot;Commander&quot;" class="if uuid-2597680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2597680.jpg"></div><h2>  Cologne "Myth" in the USSR </h2><p>  The manufacturer of this product was the Latvian perfumery and cosmetic factory Dzintars.  It was created in 1980 and belonged to the Extra group.  The packaging had an aesthetic appearance.  The bottle was rectangular in shape.  The round cap twisted.  The cologne was packed in a cardboard box in red and black. </p><p>  The perfumery composition of the cologne from the USSR consisted of invigorating citrus and cool green notes.  They were complemented by the scent of oak moss and musk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dess0us.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cologne &quot;Myth&quot; in the USSR" class="if uuid-2597712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2597712.jpg"></div><p>  Top notes were: </p><ul><li>  lemon; </li><li>  bergamot; </li><li>  orange. </li></ul><p>  Middle notes: </p><ul><li>  patchouli; </li><li>  neroli; </li><li>  sandalwood; </li><li>  vetiver. </li></ul><p>  Base notes: </p><ul><li>  musk; </li><li>  galbanum; </li><li>  oak moss. </li></ul><p>  This perfume is on sale today.  The factory produces a line of colognes "Myth" under the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. The aroma of each instance has a difference.  Those who remember colognes from the USSR say that the modern Myth is nothing like the Soviet. </p><p>  Reviews about this tool are wonderful.  Of all that could be obtained in the era of scarcity, it was the best option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cologne &quot;Myth&quot;" class="if uuid-2597702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2597702.jpg"></div><h2>  "Riga" factory "Dzintars" - Brezhnev's favorite tool </h2><p>  Rumor has it that Leonid Ilyich was still that dandy and versed in fashion.  All the years that Brezhnev led the USSR, his favorite cologne was Riga.  And in the Kremlin this fragrance was floating.  Information was provided by the head of the Dzintars factory and other people close to Brezhnev. </p><p>  Perfume was launched in 1960.  The legendary cologne was given to Brezhnev by the daughter Galina, who was a fan of Dzintars products.  The girl was friends with perfumers who worked there, and often went to production.  The specialist who created the “Riga” perfume was called Bronislava Abramovna Shvartsman. </p><p>  Colognes “Dzintars” in the USSR were definitely the best, and “Riga” was also a terribly scarce commodity.  Perfumery was a regular participant in foreign exhibitions.  "Riga" had a lot of awards.  The men who used it were delighted.  About "Riga" said that he had a signature foreign flavor. </p><h2>  Perfume composition "Riga" </h2><p>  The perfume felt a velvet beginning.  It was a little sweet.  It smells good cognac and dried fruit.  Middle notes: aroma of skin, cigars, musk.  Base notes reminiscent of the modern Mitsouko fragrance.  They are mossy and soft.  By concentration, “Riga” belonged to the colognes of the “Extra” group.  The product was available in 148 ml vials. </p><p>  This is a fragrance for men who have this type of temperament as an optimistic sanguine person.  With him, life in the Soviet Union seemed brighter to a man.  The strong floor, smothered by "Riga" felt more confident. </p><p>  The perfume for men had only one type of bottle - in the form of a cylinder with grooves.  The cover was in the form of a transparent washer.  Its diameter was equal to the diameter of the bottle. </p><p>  “Riga” is a high-quality perfume that is loved all over the world.  He has been on the wave of popularity for several decades.  Reviews about him are wonderful.  Many adult men are nostalgic for it.  Look for a vintage original on the Internet at special auctions.  Now finding “Riga” in the CIS countries is not easy, because even then it was in short supply.  Those who are not looking for easy ways order cologne from the Baltic states. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.laparfumerie.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cologne &quot;Riga&quot;" class="if uuid-2597642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2597642.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Today, you can become the owner of a vintage cologne from the USSR, if you use online auctions, contact collectors or shops that specialize in products from the Union. </p><p>  It is amazing that perfumes, which were released 40 years ago, still fully retain their aroma and properties.  The thing, most likely, is that the components from which the colognes of the USSR were made were completely natural and very high quality.  Production was strictly controlled.  Non-compliance with GOST requirements was unacceptable. </p><p>  We have long been accustomed to the fact that a well-groomed man should smell like good cognac, high-quality Cuban cigar and exquisite eau de toilette made in France.  In the USSR, each representative of the stronger sex smelled of cologne.  We have long forgotten what a deficit is.  Now the store shelves are full of perfumes for every taste and budget.  It is not difficult for us to purchase good toilet water for ourselves or as a present.  The era has long passed when a real hunt was organized for quality goods, but many can not forget colognes of the times of the USSR and touchingly store vials in lockers. </p>
