    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of the Paradnaya Hotel (Yaroslavl) contain the following negative comments: </p><ul><li>  the rooms have poor sound insulation, and therefore, if your windows overlook the roadway, then you will not be able to sleep; </li><li>  maids do not always report hygiene items when cleaning; </li><li>  the carpet in the rooms is a bit shabby; </li><li>  the rooms have a fairly fresh repair, after which there is still a strong smell of paint and other materials; </li><li>  despite the impressive area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rooms, they do not provide wardrobes (there are only hangers); </li><li>  if your room is located above the cafe, then it will constantly have the smell of food that goes through the hood; </li><li>  the bathroom does not have hooks for towels, as well as shelves for cosmetics; </li><li>  a huge drawback is the lack of its own parking zone; </li><li>  unstable supply of hot water; </li><li>  a very bad wireless internet signal (this is not enough to work). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The Paradnaya Hotel (Yaroslavl, Russia) is quite popular among visitors.  Reviews of tourists indicate the extremely favorable location of this institution.  This is the central part of the city, from where you can easily reach all major cultural attractions.  Also in the immediate vicinity is the train station. </p><p>  The hotel pays special attention to the design and functionality of the rooms.  The interior is made in bright colors, due to which the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room seems visually larger.  It is also worth noting the rather high ceilings (with the exception of attic rooms).  Windows let in a lot of sunlight.  Pleased with the tea set, but refrigerators could be less noisy. </p><p>  Special attention should be paid to the restaurant that operates in this hotel.  Of course, the breakfast included in the room price is unlikely to impress anyone.  But if you make an order on the menu, you can enjoy unique gourmet dishes from a professional chef.  This place is loved not only by tourists, but also by citizens.  Nevertheless, try to avoid checking into the rooms located above the restaurant, otherwise the smell of food will be constantly present in your room. </p><p>  If we talk about the shortcomings, it is worth noting the lack of their own car parking.  In addition, all possible parking spaces are always occupied by cars of visitors to the restaurant, and hotel guests have nowhere to put their transport.  That is why, choosing this hotel, take care of placing your cars in advance. </p>
