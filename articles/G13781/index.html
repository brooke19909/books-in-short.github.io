After all, kids in knitted clothes look very interesting, fashionable and stylish.  Therefore, in the current article we will talk about how to make various products for your beloved child yourself. </p><h2>  Where to begin </h2><p>  Most beginners first buy yarn, and then think about what they still want to knit.  However, experienced needlewomen say that the first thing to consider is your product.  First, decide what item of clothing the baby needs.  After you think over the style and choose a pattern.  It is also worth noting that the masters do not recommend to beginners who want to knit for a newborn to do too busy a thing.  Children's things are best diversified with the help of color or various decorative elements.  For example, ears on a hat, tails on pants, and so on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hat with ears for a newborn" class="if uuid-2968232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2968232.jpg"></div><h2>  Buying yarn </h2><p>  Having carefully thought over the model of the conceived product, you can go to the store for knitting threads.  However, this process also has a lot of nuances, which experienced needlewomen are happy to talk about.  In their opinion, the most important criterion when choosing a yarn is its quality.  Indeed, coarse woolen or synthetic thread is not suitable for children's things.  It is much more reasonable to use special children's yarn.  It meets all standards and does not exactly provoke the development of allergies.  There are no strict recommendations regarding the color.  But for patterned products, pastel or plain yarn is more suitable.  For beginners who are just learning the basics of knitting for a newborn, you should buy any unusual yarn.  For example, gradient.  And then you can fulfill the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa facial or garter stitch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tool selection </h2><p>  Due attention must be paid to the choice of knitting needles.  In most cases, experienced needlewomen, having stuffed a hand, can knit various products with the most inconvenient tools.  However, even they are very careful about those that have already settled in the box for needlework, and are serious about choosing new ones.  And all because good knitting needles provide speed, quality and beauty of work.  This is especially important when knitting for a newborn.  Therefore, professional masters about the perfect instrument can talk endlessly.  The main criteria that determine the purchase are the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  material - metal; </li><li>  appearance - the absence of defects (chips, roughness, etc.); </li><li>  diameter - equal to the thickness of the thread. </li></ul><h2>  Taking measurements from the baby </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="panties for the newborn" class="if uuid-2968230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2968230.jpg"></div><p>  It is not difficult to understand knitting technology for newborns with knitting needles.  A description of the necessary manipulations we will study in the presented material.  But first, you need to determine the parameters of a particular child.  And for this, decide which product you want to knit.  After all, different things need their own measurements.  For: </p><ol><li>  Sweatshirts - product length, armhole level, sleeve length, chest circumference. </li><li>  Panties - the length of the product, the circumference of the hips, the height of the fit, the distance between the legs. </li><li>  Hats - head circumference, product height (1/2 distance from ear to ear through the crown). </li><li>  Socks, booties - length and width of the foot, lifting height, girth of the base of the lower leg. </li></ol><h2>  Sample preparation </h2><p>  Many novice masters skip this point.  However, experienced knitters are convinced that only he can qualitatively carry out knitting with needles for newborn girls and boys.  Therefore, we recommend that readers also follow the steps in this paragraph.  You won‚Äôt have to do anything complicated.  You just need to take the prepared knitting needles and yarn, and then, relying on the pattern of the pattern, knit a sample - a square of 10x10 cm. Count how many loops and rows it turned out.  And divide both parameters by 10, if necessary, round to the nearest whole.  Thus we find out how many loops and rows fits in one centimeter.  Now you need to pin the sticker to the sample and indicate both parameters on it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting clothes for babies" class="if uuid-2968214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2968214.jpg"></div><h2>  Technology for calculating the parameters necessary for knitting </h2><p>  To make knitting on a newborn jumpsuit or other interesting thing bring pleasure, it is important to carefully prepare.  For this, we turn to mathematics.  We work with the values ‚Äã‚Äãobtained in the previous paragraph.  We choose which product we want to knit.  Then we take the specified measurements from the baby.  And we divide all the horizontal parameters by the number of loops in one centimeter, and the vertical ones by the number of rows.  We draw a schematic image of our ideas.  And indicate all the new values. </p><h2>  Knit a blouse </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.postila.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blouse for the newborn" class="if uuid-2968207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2968207.jpg"></div><p>  To tie this product, you need to dial on the knitting needles the number of loops equal to the circumference of the chest.  Then distribute to hosiery knitting needles and knit, moving in a circle.  And it‚Äôs better to start with a simple single or double gum.  Then go to the main pattern and rise to the level of the armhole.  Separate half of the loops and continue knitting the back and front separately.  Then select on both parts exactly in the middle half of the neck girth - loops designed for the gate.  Sew the product at the shoulder seams.  Using a hook along the armhole line, dial new loops and knit the sleeves of the desired length using knitting needles.  By analogy, you can make a jacket.  In this case, it is required to divide the front part into two shelves and knit, moving back and forth. </p><h2>  Knit panties </h2><p>  The following description will help to implement another version of knitting for a newborn with knitting needles.  Combining this master class and the previous one, you will be able to make an excellent jumpsuit for the baby.  But the top of the product is recommended to be supplemented with buttons or zippers to make it easier to put on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="startknitting.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="we knit jumpsuit for a newborn" class="if uuid-2968223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2968223.jpg"></div><p>  So, knitting pants is simple.  We draw on the needles the number of loops equal to the circumference of the hips.  We distribute to hosiery knitting needles and rise to the height of landing.  Then in the middle we select the number of loops equal to the distance between the legs.  And we knit a strip - 3-5 cm. Using a hook we connect to the opposite side.  Then we knit new loops on it.  And we carry out each leg separately. </p><p>  If you want to make a jumpsuit, we knit pants.  We collect new loops along the upper edge and knit a blouse.  It is possible without a sleeve. </p><h2>  Knit booties </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting booties" class="if uuid-2968224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2968224.jpg"></div><p>  A huge number of mothers are interested in how to knit booties for newborns with knitting needles.  After all, the description for working with a hook is more common on the Internet.  Therefore, we further offer a master class.  It starts with knitting insoles.  We collect on the needles the number of loops equal to 2/3 of the width of the foot.  We add in the following rows at the beginning and end one loop, gradually leaving the desired width of the insole.  Then we knit the product in length.  In the end, by analogy, we reduce the loops.  And take the hook.  With it, we collect new loops around the edge of the insole.  We transfer to hosiery knitting needles.  We rise to 1/3 of the lifting height.  Then we begin to gradually reduce the number of loops, trying to come to those that are necessary to grasp the lower leg base.  It is better to fix each step on paper.  After all, then you need to tie the second product.  Having successfully completed the task, we raise the upper part of the product to the desired height.  That's the whole description of knitting booties for newborns with knitting needles. </p><h2>  We knit a hat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="hat for newborn" class="if uuid-2968205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2968205.jpg"></div><p>  Another important thing, which should also settle in the wardrobe of the baby, has hundreds or even thousands of variations.  Especially popular are hats with ears and faces of various animals.  Most often, mothers turn newborns into bears and kitties.  But on the eve of the New Year, some needlewomen also propose to make a hat with a pig.  To make the model shown in the photo, we collect the number of loops equal to the circumference of the head.  We knit the front surface for the entire length.  Below the canvas itself will be wrapped, as in the photo.  For 10 rows to the end, we begin to reduce the loops.  Divide their total number by 10, finding out how many loops should be reduced in each row.  But we distribute them evenly.  We sew ears and a patch to the finished product.  On this description of knitting hats for a newborn ends.  Now it remains only to complete the eyes and nose. </p><p>  As you can see, even beginners can cope with the task.  The main desire! </p>
