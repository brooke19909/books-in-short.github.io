Smartphones come out in batches every year.  Series after series occupy a niche in a certain segment, where everyone can choose the most suitable option for themselves.  Among the models of this year, the Meizu M5 32Gb looks good.  He collected different reviews.  Let‚Äôs try to figure out what is good in it, and let‚Äôs not forget to mention the bad. </p><h2>  Company </h2><p>  More and more, the domestic buyer began to trust Chinese devices.  If before they were skeptical, now you often see a passerby who is holding a device from Meizu in his hands. </p><p>  This company has especially taken root and is loved by many people.  She is only 14 years old, during which time she was able to become a leading manufacturer of electronics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone meizu m5 note 32gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2014121.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The most popular are smartphones such as Meizu M5 32Gb.  Reviews about them are mostly positive.  Customers praise both the quality of the materials and the technical component.  Many people like the strategy of the company itself. </p><p>  In addition to smartphones, the manufacturer offers players for sale.  During its existence, a huge number of models came out.  Not so long ago, other gadgets began to gain popularity.  These include portable chargers, smart watches, fitness trackers and music equipment.  They also have a good headset. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, in such a short time, Meizu has made a huge leap in development, has interested many buyers and gained fans. </p><h2>  About smartphone </h2><p>  Before us is a cell phone Meizu M5 32Gb.  Reviews about him are good, as, indeed, about his "brothers", released earlier. </p><p>  All because he became the most affordable in the "M" line.  According to the manufacturer, the novelty became the heir to the previously known model M3.  We have heard of few people about her, since she has not gone beyond China. </p><p>  At the same time, the Meizu M5 Note model with improved characteristics and an increased price tag is becoming popular, which replaced the most popular smartphone of the last year Meizu M3 Note. </p>

    <p>  In general, as we see, the family with the ‚ÄúM‚Äù index has indeed become popular and significant. </p><p>  As you already noticed, there was no model with the number ‚Äú4‚Äù.  This is due to the fact that the Chinese are wary of her.  But despite superstition, the MX4 and MX4 Pro smartphones were still presented to the audience. </p><p>  The surprise in the new items was caused by the fact that, despite the latest trend of metal cases for the budget segment, the new item ‚Äúchanged its shoes‚Äù into plastic.  For better or worse, it is up to the users to decide, and we move on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Packaging </h2><p>  Regarding the packaging of the <span>Meizu</span> M5 32Gb mobile <span>phone</span> , reviews about it leave good ones.  The company continues to delight fans with its minimalism.  The box is not loaded with unnecessary information. </p><p>  The smartphone was placed in a compact white package.  It is made of thick textured cardboard.  Everything looks expensive and high quality.  Everything is packed tightly inside, which ensures safe transportation. </p><p>  Opening the cover, you can see the phone on top.  Underneath is a tray with everything you need.  The Chinese are not particularly generous.  The documentation was placed in a special envelope.  There is also a paper clip for removing the tray with SIM cards.  It reminds us that the system works with a proprietary Flyme shell. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the box included a 2 amp network adapter and a cable with a USB connector.  Despite the fact that there is no quick charge function, and they have not added a universal Type-C connector, the device still charges quickly. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  To find out what exactly in the passer's hand is Meizu is no longer difficult.  The familiar rounded shape of the case, 2.5D glass, on the back there is a large ‚Äúeye‚Äù of the lens, on the front there is a borrowed mechanical oval fingerprint scanner button. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As already mentioned, a plastic case has become a feature of this model.  On the one hand, it is not the first time it has been used in the devices of this company, on the other hand, the latest released models have been clad in metal. </p><p>  But to say that plastic is a drawback is impossible.  To each his own.  In addition, in order to appease the buyer, several cool color solutions for the Meizu M5 32Gb were released.  There are many reviews on this subject.  Buyers liked matte black and blue.  Glossy white and turquoise were not left without attention.  But gold turned out to be less popular than other options. </p><p>  The phone‚Äôs dimensions are standard for similar models.  In height, it reaches 14 cm, in width - 7 cm, and its thickness - 8 mm.  Due to the fact that the case is plastic, it turned out to be lighter than its predecessors - only 138 grams. </p><h2>  Detailed description </h2><p>  The main area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe front panel is the screen.  Around it there is a rather noticeable framework, which for some aesthetes can become a negative feature.  Above the display is a speaker.  On the left side of it is the front camera.  Do not forget about the notification indicator and sensors. </p><p>  According to most device owners, the earpiece turned out to be very good.  It makes a clear sound, there is a volume margin.  You can even hear low and high notes.  It seems that he got here from an expensive device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m5 32gb white reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2014108.jpg" width="422"></div>

    <p>  Under the screen is a regular mechanical button.  She remained the same oval shape.  In this model, it can act as a fingerprint scanner.  There is even a heart rate sensor. </p><p>  The reverse side is concise.  In the middle above, as usual, there is a large ‚Äúeye‚Äù of the camera.  Under it is a two-color flash.  The manufacturer did not forget to leave his logo. </p><h2>  Items </h2><p>  The elemental base is well placed and for former owners remains familiar.  Apparently, that's why there are so many good reviews.  Meizu M5 32Gb White has stayed true to the details.  Therefore, on the lower edge there is still room for connecting a headset, microphone, USB port for a charger.  From the very edge there is a grill with speakers. </p><p>  The upper end is free.  Although in older models on it you can find an additional noise reduction microphone. </p><p>  The combination tray is barely visible on the left side.  Traditionally, it can work with two nano-SIMs, or you can replace a SIM card with a memory card.  In general, initially this design of the tray caused smartphone owners dissatisfaction.  Now they got used to it, even managed to push everything there at once. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cell phone meizu m5 32gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2014109.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The right end is occupied by the volume and power buttons.  Both are made of plastic.  They have a mild course.  Using them is inconvenient, well, or only if you use a cover without slots. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The new model comes with a diagonal of 5.2 ". The Meizu M5 32 GB smartphone (blue) has become universal due to its size. Previous models were offered with a diagonal of 5.5 inches. It is already considered borderline. Someone will find this display large. Version Pro 5 generally appeared with a screen of 5.7 inches. </p><p>  But the five-inch M3S mini, on the contrary, seems uncomfortable to some because of the small screen.  In general, the size of the display is always a debate between adherents of compact models and "shovels." </p><p>  The resolution of this model is 720x1280 pixels.  This is a budget choice that could be increased by Full HD, but then its price tag would have to be increased.  Therefore, such a resolution is understandable.  An IPS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãinstalled inside. </p><p>  In general, the screen is not the best.  It does not have a very high brightness indicator, the viewing angles are disgusting.  The screen produces normal colors only in the normal position.  If you tilt it forward or backward, it noticeably loses its brightness and distorts shades. </p><h2>  Photo / Video </h2><p>  With the camera, the Meizu M5 is simple.  The main module works with a resolution of 13 megapixels.  It has phase focus and aperture at f2.2.  The front camera produces 5 megapixels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="5 2 meizu m5 32gb smartphone blue" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2014105.jpg"></div>

    <p>  This is a budget version of the camera.  You should not expect anything special from her.  Happy good bright shots.  Photos are rich, clear.  But at dusk the image is not happy.  Noises appear, because there is not enough lighting, the image becomes dull and ‚Äúsoapy‚Äù. </p><p>  Video is shot in FullHD resolution.  During the day, the results are 30 frames per second, at night the processing speed drops to 20 frames per second.  Focus slows down a bit.  But the sound is recorded good: without creaks and noises. </p><p>  The front camera can also record video in FullHD.  Better not to experiment at night.  But in the afternoon, good videos are obtained.  You can use it as a webcam. </p><h2>  "Filling" </h2><p>  The reviews on the Meizu M5 32Gb mobile phone are mostly positive.  This is due to the fact that despite its budget, the manufacturer decided to equip the model with good hardware.  Inside, the <span>MediaTek MT6750</span> processor <span>runs</span> on eight cores.  It contains two clusters of four "crystals".  The first half operates at a speed of 1 GHz, the second - 1.5 GHz. </p><p>  According to tradition, the Mali-T860 works for graphics.  It supports all modern features.  It‚Äôs impossible to talk about what will pull the latest mobile news on the ‚ÄúUltras‚Äù.  But all the same, it will give you the opportunity to enjoy everything that you find on the Play Market. </p><p>  Iron calmly copes with everyday tasks.  The case is not heated very much.  Overheating during charging is possible, but they are not critical. </p><p>  Models come in several modifications.  A version with 2 or 3 GB of RAM is available.  Internal can be a choice: 16 or 32 GB. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="advantages and disadvantages of the meizu m5 model" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2014110.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The battery received a volume of 3070 mAh.  For a smartphone, such a diagonal will be enough.  Moderate use will extend the operation of the device for 14 hours.  If you play continuously, then without recharging he will live about 4 hours.  Watching videos will drag on for 7 hours, and listening to music can last up to 50 hours. </p><h2>  Software component </h2><p>  This model was released on the basis of Android 6.0, covered by the proprietary "shell" Flyme 5.2.  By the fall of 2017, many models have already been updated to the sixth version of the software. </p><p>  Users liked the fact that the manufacturer took care of the system ‚Äúcleanliness‚Äù of the device.  It does not have a huge number of pre-installed programs that no one will ever use.  There is everything you need for everyday use. </p><p>  Of the brand it is worth noting a music player with a sleek design and a simple equalizer.  There is a set of tools like: calculator, magnifying glass, mirror, compass, etc. </p><h2>  "Neighbors" </h2><p>  Together with this model, a couple more interesting options from the manufacturer entered the market.  One of them was the <span>Meizu M5 Note</span> 32Gb mobile <span>phone</span> .  He received good reviews.  It turned out to be a logical continuation of the Meizu M3 Note. </p><p>  Of course, it is impossible to say that the owners of the latter rushed to buy a novelty.  Nevertheless, it became good for those who just decided to buy a Chinese smartphone. </p><p>  Nevertheless, he got an improved design, got more metal elements.  More precisely, lost almost all plastic parts.  Improved camera, screen, battery capacity.  All these minor changes have affected the cost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews of meizu m5 note 32gb gray" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2014111.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As a result, reviews about the Meizu M5 Note 32Gb Gray were only positive.  This is a universal option for everyday use.  It works with absolutely all applications, perfectly pulls games and shows good performance.  Its cost, depending on the modification, is quite acceptable: from 10 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Meizu MX5 also found its buyer.  It turned out to be a couple of thousand rubles more expensive than the previous model.  But the cost was increased for a reason.  Firstly, the front panel was covered with a protective glass <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3. Secondly, the screen from Samsung Super AMOLED gives an extraordinarily rich and bright picture. </p><p>  The 20.7 megapixel improved camera with a huge amount of "buns" <span>influenced the</span> prices of the <span>Meizu MX5 32 GB</span> .  We can say that the manufacturer tried to make a ‚Äúcamera phone‚Äù out of this model.  Otherwise, how to explain the presence of a sensor from Sony, accurate auto focus and video recording in 4 K. </p><p>  And finally, the Meizu MX5 ‚Äúfilling‚Äù turned out to be a good one.  The Helio X10 Turbo processor emits a frequency of 2.2 GHz.  Graphics involved PowerVR G6200.  The version comes with 3 GB of RAM. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Here are such bright and different models from Meizu.  Of course, not all models were clear to fans.  The output of some raised many questions.  But in general, the company is trying to produce serial smartphones, with small but important changes. </p><p>  To understand what advantages and disadvantages of the Meizu M5 model is possible only by reviews.  But the overall impression is good.  The owners noted the main advantage: value for money.  I liked a lot and design. </p><p>  Some appreciated the quality of the camera, the autonomy of the device, the size of the display.  Particularly pleased with the "clean" Android. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu mx5 32gb prices" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2014122.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Among the shortcomings, the same autonomy was singled out.  What is connected with the fact that some assemblies can work all day in normal mode without recharging, while others are discharged halfway to work, it is unclear.  There may be a problem calibrating the battery.  Many users forget that the first few charges must be carried out according to the instructions. </p><p>  Another of the main problems was the Internet connection - after turning off Wi-Fi, it was necessary to turn on the mobile Internet several times.  Although such a drawback is observed in many devices. </p><p>  Otherwise, this is a great option for those who are looking for a compact device with a "stuffing" for everyday use with breaks on games. </p>
