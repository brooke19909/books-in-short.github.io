  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ioannina, Greece: attractions with photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This distinctive town owes its name to the holy martyr John.  The capital of the historical region of Epirus, unfortunately, is not spoiled by tourists, and after all, it deserves that travelers come to look for a completely different Greece. </p><p>  The cultural center, where the Christian and Islamic religions harmoniously coexist, makes an indelible impression, since Turkish motifs are seen more clearly here than Greek ones. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The colorful Ioannina in Greece is located in the north-west of the country, far from the sea, on the shores of the picturesque lake of the same name.  The city, whose area is only 46 square kilometers, was founded in the VI century by Justinian I - the emperor of Byzantium.  The economic heyday of a small town began at the beginning of the 13th century, when, after the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, the Epirus State was created in the Balkans. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="39.66502880000001" data-lng="20.853746600000022" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/5/9/7/17597.png"></div><p>  In the 30s of the 15th century, the troops of the Turkish Sultan conquered the intellectual center of Epirus, which turns into the residence of the ruler of Ali Pasha.  Residents who refused to accept Islam are expelled from the city.  Murders and executions are becoming commonplace here.  A tyrant who did not stand on ceremony with the local population did a lot for the development of the city.  The main historical monuments, which Ioannina (Ioannina) is proud of, belong to the period of the reign of the Turkish despot.  Despite everything, the ruler left a noticeable mark in history, and his memory lives on to this day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The vassal of the Ottoman Empire, which pursued its own policy, secretly corresponded with Napoleon and Potemkin and paid with his head.  On the orders of Sultan Mahmud II, he was killed, and with him the death of a martyr, the children of Ali Pasha and his grandson.  Five hundred years of Turkish rule left a significant mark: old houses, minarets of mosques and fragments of fortifications remind of the era of Ottoman rule. </p><p>  Only in 1913 the city became part of the country. </p><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  Ioannina in Greece has a warm climate, but it is worth considering that in this area Epirus is a little cooler than in the south of the country.  Winters are mild with moderate rainfall, and summers are wet and hot.  The average air temperature in July is +27 <sup></sup> , and in December -8 <sup></sup> . </p><p>  The most favorable period for rest is from May to October. </p><div class="photo" data-original="doublediamondpaintball.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amazing natural landscapes" class="if uuid-3223201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3223201.jpg"></div><h2>  A tourist spot </h2><p>  Epirus pearl, located far from the most famous sights of the country, is rarely visited by tourists.  However, travelers who meet this amazing place say that it is worthy of attention: it is best to stay here for a couple of days, since it is simply impossible to explore everything in a few hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The main historical monuments </h2><p>  Acquaintance with Ioannina in Greece, which has preserved the architectural appearance of the past, begins with the fortress walls built in the X century.  Now, overgrown with grass, they do not look like a fortification, but an unusual fence, behind which people live.  Inside the walls are the acropolis, which appeared much later. </p><p>  Castro Fortress, which holds tragic memories of the rule of Ali Pasha, is the hallmark of the glorious city.  The oldest Byzantine castle in the country is an unusual place where history comes to life.  As city dwellers say, all roads lead to this citadel, where once the beautiful palace of the ruler was located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The fortress-palace of Ali Pasha" class="if uuid-3223199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3223199.jpg"></div><p>  The inner territory of the fortress occupied 200 hectares, and the width of the powerful walls was about 10 meters.  On the one hand, the citadel was surrounded by a moat with water, and on the other, a fresh lake.  And only a bridge that could quickly lower and rise connected the bastion with the outside world. </p><p>  Inside the historic site of Ioannina, Greece has a special atmosphere.  Here peace and silence, and it seems to visitors that they are in a completely different world.  Inside you can see the tomb of Ali Pasha, admire the Fethiye Mosque, visit the Byzantine Museum and the Museum of Silver. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Old city </h2><p>  The present guide from the past is the historical center of Ioannina, which is located around the old bazaar, not far from the citadel.  A colorful corner with a labyrinth of narrow streets, numerous workshops of tinkers and silver craftsmen, absorbed various cultures, and its architecture silently narrates about each of them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.citiestips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City where cultures mixed" class="if uuid-3223200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3223200.jpg"></div><h2>  Student paradise </h2><p>  Ioannina (Greece), whose population is more than 100 thousand people, is a busy village, and this is the merit of the largest university of the state.  Seventeen faculties of the educational institution attract applicants from all over the country to study. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ioannina University - the oldest in the country" class="if uuid-3223202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3223202.jpg"></div><p>  Now more than 25 thousand students study at the university and set the lively tone for the provincial town.  There is always a cheerful atmosphere, and even after dark, life does not stop, and young people have fun in the night cafe-bars. </p><h2>  Natural wonder </h2><p>  The main natural masterpiece of the town is the picturesque reservoir of Pamvotida (Ioannina).  The lake in Greece, which is forbidden to swim, is considered one of the oldest in Europe.  It is no coincidence that the locals are so proud of him.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe miraculous miracle is 32 square kilometers, and the depth is 5 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.discovergreece.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Ioannina (Pamvotida)" class="if uuid-3223198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3223198.jpg"></div><p>  The calm waters of the fresh lake fascinate at first sight.  They reflect on the surface amazing landscapes, as if descended from postcards. </p><h2>  Idyllic place </h2><p>  Inside the reservoir, a tiny islet of Nissi was sheltered, on which only three hundred people live.  From the coast of Ioannina in Greece to the original village can be reached in 15 minutes by boat. </p><p>  It was here that in 1822 the tyrant Ali Pasha was killed.  Tourists can visit the museum, all of whose collections are dedicated to the cruel ruler.  You can even see his personal items.  In addition, the monastery of the Prophet Elijah and the monastery of St. Nicholas the Ugodnik are located on the islet.  In the latter, during the time of the Ottoman yoke, Orthodox priests secretly trained. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ttnotes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nissi Island" class="if uuid-3223203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3223203.jpg"></div><p>  Nissi is an idyllic corner where there is no place for the hectic modern world. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  For tourists who are going on vacation, Greece is associated with the bright sun, warm sea, ancient ruins and blue domes of churches.  And those who visited Ioannina have the impression that they were not in the Greek, but in the Middle East town.  Vacationers discover a completely different Greece, in which there is no sea and ancient ruins, and instead of Christian churches - mosques. </p><p>  Since Ioannina in Greece (photos of the city are presented in the article) is not spoiled by tourists, the more interesting are the souvenirs that they bring.  The production of silver jewelry here dates back to Byzantine times, and therefore no guest leaves without products recognized as the most beautiful in the country.  In addition to earrings and rings made in the antique style, you can buy a small bag entirely made of silver, a carved vessel, a cast lamp or a salary for the icon.  In addition, vacationers enthusiastically respond to household copper utensils. </p><h2>  Amazing place without crowds of tourists </h2><p>  Ioannina is a city in Greece, which is not a popular tourist center, because it is located away from the favorite routes of vacationers, but this is considered to be its main advantage. </p><p>  There are no crowds of foreigners with cameras, all history buffs will be able to leisurely get acquainted with city sights and observe the life of the local population.  The unique symbiosis of Greek and Turkish cultures, geographical location, numerous natural and man-made monuments - all indicate a special history of the wondrous corner. </p>
