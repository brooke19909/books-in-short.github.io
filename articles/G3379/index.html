Fatty tissue is a soft and motionless tumor consisting of fat mass.  In Greek, lipos is fat, oma is a tumor.  Therefore, doctors call this lipoma formation.  As a rule, it does not hurt, and does not bring any unpleasant sensations if it does not suddenly begin to grow.  Increasing to a certain size, it can begin to put pressure on the nerve endings.  Then pain is inevitable. </p><p>  The fatty tumor is most troublesome if it appears in open places, representing a cosmetic defect.  Lipoma can form on any part of the body: on the legs, arms, back.  Very often it appears on the head, especially on the forehead. </p><p>  Having found out, in general, what a wen is, it should be noted that there are several varieties of them.  Usually, they differ slightly in structure, depending on where they are located. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ A ring-shaped wen is located on the neck. <br>  ‚Ä¢ A capsule may grow inside an organ. <br>  ‚Ä¢ There is a tree wen, what is it?  It is formed inside the joints and has processes that resemble a tree structure. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Diffuse has no connective tissue. <br>  ‚Ä¢ If there is a lot of such tissue - this is a fibrous adipose. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Cavernous - contains many vessels inside. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Petrified - in addition to fat there are calcium deposits in it. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Bone tissue may develop in the ossified. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the fatty tumor does not grow much, then it does not pose a danger, being benign.  Such a tumor usually does not hurt.  To more accurately determine the nature of the wen, an ultrasound scan is performed, according to the results of which treatment is prescribed. </p><p>  We gave a general concept of what a wen is, but there are several types of them, and the reasons for their appearance are also different. </p><p><br>  ‚Ä¢ Deposition of cholesterol under the skin - such wen can be removed in cosmetic clinics by laser resurfacing of the skin. <br>  ‚Ä¢ A hereditary predisposition to this disease is possible. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Such formations may occur at the site of injury. <br>  ‚Ä¢ It may appear on a part of the body that is subject to constant friction or prolonged pressure. </p><p>  Traditional treatment </p><p>  Zhirovik usually grows very slowly, without causing any inconvenience, so people can not go to doctors for years.  But the probability of its rapid growth for no apparent reason is quite high.  Therefore, doctors recommend in most cases to remove the tumor surgically.  Moreover, one cannot exclude the possibility of its degeneration into a malignant one. </p><p>  Removing such a tumor is a process that usually takes several minutes and is performed under local anesthesia.  Healing occurs within a few days.  Methods of removal depend on the size of the tumor and on the place where it is located.  This may be liquid nitrogen, a laser, electrocoagulation, or conventional surgery. </p><p>  Alternative treatment </p><p>  Knowing what a wen is, and that it actually does not pose a health hazard, many try to get rid of this trouble with folk remedies.  There are many such methods.  Presumably, depending on the type of tumor, different remedies help in different ways.  Most often, these are compresses that are applied either at night or worn constantly for some time, refreshing the bandage every day. </p><p>  Here are some of the simplest and most common tips: </p><p>  1. Put a mixture of honey and salt in a ratio of 2: 1.  Wear 5-6 days.  Suitable for wen on any part of the body. <br>  2. It is recommended to stick the chicken egg film on the wet side and hold until it falls off. <br>  3. Ordinary beets in the form of a compress (grated) helps in three days.  You need to change it daily. <br>  4. Every 12 hours you should change the compress of the golden mustache. <br>  5. In some cases, lubrication with an asterisk helps. <br>  6. A small wen can pass if you take the ground thistle three times a day for a teaspoon.  Eating cinnamon is welcome. </p><p>  Each recipe may be suitable, but the advice of doctors should not be neglected. </p>
