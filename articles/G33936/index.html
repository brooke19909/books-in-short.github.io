To make it or not, it is, of course, up to the parents to decide.  But still, everyone is advised to have such a book, thanks to which you can follow the development of your child. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  What is a portfolio for a child for? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="max.kg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is a baby portfolio for?" class="if uuid-2481102" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2481102.jpg"></div><p>  Due to the fact that the portfolio will be carefully maintained and regularly replenished, it will be able to bring parents closer to the child, as they will constantly maintain interest in terms of the development of their baby. </p><p>  Portfolio is able to show how much the child has developed in: </p><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Times New Roman" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  Socio-personal relationships. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Times New Roman" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1">  Cognitive-speech plan. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Times New Roman" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1">  Physical development. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Times New Roman" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="1">  Artistic and aesthetic plan. </li></ul><p>  Thanks to the portfolio, you can remember over time how the baby was, what first drawing he depicted on the album sheet, his first crafts, words and much more. </p><h2>  Portfolio Features </h2><p>  But still, many parents are wondering what a portfolio is for.  The answer is simple, it has a function: </p><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Times New Roman" data-listid="4" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  Purposeful.  It supports the goals of learning something new. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Times New Roman" data-listid="4" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1">  Diagnostic  Fixes all changes in external factors. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Times New Roman" data-listid="4" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1">  Motivational.  Pushes the child to move on to his goal. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Times New Roman" data-listid="4" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="1">  Meaningful.  Shows and saves all the work and efforts of the child. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Times New Roman" data-listid="4" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="5" data-aria-level="1">  Developing. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Times New Roman" data-listid="4" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="6" data-aria-level="1">  Rating.  Helps to see the number of skills, abilities and progress. </li></ul><h2 aria-level="2">  How to draw up a portfolio? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="paidagogos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make out" class="if uuid-2481106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2481106.jpg"></div><p>  Since the portfolio is intended for the child, it must necessarily be bright and unusual.  If properly designed, it can become the pride and the most beloved book of the child. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before creating a portfolio, it is necessary to explain to the child what it is made for.  After that, you can begin to design together. </p><p>  It must be remembered that the brighter the ‚Äúbook‚Äù, the more interesting the baby will be to approach its replenishment. </p><p>  You also don‚Äôt need to be afraid that the child will paint or try to decorate the portfolio with something of his own.  On the contrary, you need to ask the baby to help, since absolutely all the details, all the awkward drawings of the child with a pencil, all this is a memory.  How pleasant it will be in a few years to look at and remember how he sat and tried to decorate a small piece of his life. </p><p>  It is strongly not recommended to restrict the child from creating his own portfolio, since his help will not only remain a memory, but also give the baby the opportunity to express himself and feel that he is actually trusted. </p><h2>  Proper title page design </h2><p>  The front page for a portfolio is the "clothing" of all the contents inside.  He can also be called the ‚Äúface‚Äù of all subsequent work.  Also, the first impression of all content will depend on the title page, because for all people the first impression is the foundation of a common, concluding opinion. </p><p>  The main rule of the title page for children's portfolios is a minimum of information.  There is no need to overload the cover with a huge amount of incomprehensible information, as it would seem that we are now facing a reference book or book.  Instead of excessive informativeness, it would be better to do the design more carefully, since the children's portfolio should look appropriate to its small owner. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Yes, absolutely nothing should be written on the title page, but this does not mean that the portfolio should be ‚Äúnameless‚Äù.  You can post all information about the owner inside.  After all, it is much more interesting to read the details on bright, colorful pages decorated with photographs than on the title page, which is completely filled with letters. </p><p>  Now the title page is drawn up mainly thanks to the computer, as new technologies can provide a huge number and variety of designs.  You can choose ready-made children's portfolios or choose the font, drawings, and many other additions yourself.  If the child wants to contribute a piece of his work to the design, then he should not forbid it.  The kid will be pleased that he participated in creating the portfolio. </p><h2>  What sections do you need to add? </h2><p>  The portfolio must be carefully divided, since it must contain absolutely all information about the child.  It is necessary to rationally distribute all sections so that it is more convenient to perceive the content. </p><h2>  The first section.  "My life" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="praktika.nnov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="first section" class="if uuid-2481108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2481108.jpg"></div><p>  In this section you can enter any information that is important for the child. </p><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Times New Roman" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  Name (you can write the meaning of the name, why parents chose this name, and so on). </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Times New Roman" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1">  My family.  It is necessary to enter all family members, tell them what their name is.  Alternatively, you can attach a generic tree to the page.  Thus, everything will look much more aesthetically pleasing. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Times New Roman" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1">  My friends.  It is compiled similarly to the previous one, but in addition it is necessary to write a brief information about friends, their hobbies and so on. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Times New Roman" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="1">  Where I live.  It is necessary to write concise information about the hometown, its attractions.  You can also attach photos. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Times New Roman" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="5" data-aria-level="1">  My kindergarten.  Tell about your kindergarten, add information about the group. </li></ul><h2 aria-level="2">  The second section.  "My hobbies" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ck-magazine.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="my hobbies" class="if uuid-2481119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2481119.jpg"></div><p>  In this section you can write about the hobbies and hobbies of the child.  For example, if a kid is fond of drawing, you can write that most of all he likes to draw and attach a couple of his works.  You can also talk about what he does in the kindergarten, mug.  If a child often spends time with his grandmother, you can talk about what, for example, crafts they most often do.  Toy preferences also need to be entered. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If the baby likes to read, or listen to stories, you can write about his favorite book. </p><p>  In general, this section should be fully devoted to the child‚Äôs favorite activities and hobbies. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  The third section.  "Holidays" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="my holidays" class="if uuid-2481137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2481137.jpg"></div><p>  This section can be replenished with photos from various holidays.  Be it birthdays, New Year, March 8th. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  The fourth section.  "I am growing up" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="zoj.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="my growing up" class="if uuid-2481205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2481205.jpg"></div><p>  This section can include absolutely all indicators of child development.  For example: annually add the outline of the palm, legs.  You can add a table in which there will be all the indicators of the physical development of the baby, thanks to which you can observe changes in growth, weight. </p><p>  Also an interesting ‚Äúheading‚Äù in the portfolio will be a list of the first phrases that the kid said. </p><p>  Creative development is also included in this section.  You can add various applications, papier-m√¢ch√©, drawings, modeling and absolutely all other creative results. </p><p>  If the child has any serious hobby, participates in competitions, contests, and the like, you can post various letters, diplomas and other evidence of his work on the page "My records". </p><h2 aria-level="2">  The fifth section.  "My impressions" </h2><p>  In this section, you can add many different photos from theaters, travels, any discoveries.  Even photos from ordinary parks will be appropriate in this section, since for all children going to the park is an unforgettable storm of emotions, because there you can run, jump, ride on the carousels and really have fun. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  The sixth section.  "Reviews and suggestions" </h2><p>  This section can be done as desired.  If you want to add it to the portfolio, then you can distribute reviews into the categories of "Educators" (if the portfolio is for kindergarten), "Parents" and "Teachers". </p><p>  Thanks to the positive reviews, comments, and various wishes, the child will develop self-confidence, determination.  He will see that all his efforts are not in vain and will continue to succeed in the same spirit. </p><p>  Also, this list is an example of designing a portfolio of kindergarten according to GEF. </p><h2>  Portfolio Creation </h2><p>  At first glance, it may seem that the steps to complete the children's portfolio are very difficult, confused.  But this is not so. </p><p>  To collect the entire portfolio, you need a folder, best of all - an archive, because thanks to the hard cover it will not shake much during use.  In order to save time on design, you can buy a folder with a ready-made colorful look.  But if in stores it‚Äôs hard to find, then you can buy the usual one by pasting it with gift wrapping paper.  Thus, you can not only save time, but also arrange everything as you want. </p><p>  In terms of forming sheets in a children's portfolio, everything is just as simple.  It is necessary to choose a suitable design, arrange everything on a computer and print it on photo paper. </p><p>  After that, you need to attach the sheets to the files, and carefully arrange everything in the folder. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  Children's portfolio for a boy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="luxfon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="for boy" class="if uuid-2481141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2481141.jpg"></div><p>  All parents want to capture the most important moments of their child‚Äôs development.  If you need to make a portfolio for a boy for kindergarten or just have a desire to start fixing everything that is connected with the life of the baby, then it will not be difficult to complete it.  You can do manufacturing with a child, this will greatly facilitate the process, since you can immediately find out what design the kid wants. </p><p>  If there aren‚Äôt any specific unusual ideas for design, then you can use any cartoon characters as a decoration that the child is crazy about.  Thanks to the Internet, you can find any portfolio with various external designs. </p><p>  You can also download a ready-made portfolio for the boy for kindergarten, which already has a huge number of pages to fill with a bright and colorful design. </p><p>  As for the rules for filling out the portfolio, you can not worry, turn on your imagination or listen to our tips on how to arrange it correctly. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  Children's portfolio for the girl </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.1zoom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="for girls" class="if uuid-2481144" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2481144.jpg"></div><p>  Girls, as you know, love everything bright, brilliant and sweet.  From childhood, it is necessary to teach the little princess to keep everything clean, everything should be ‚Äúlaid out on the shelves‚Äù correctly.  Children's portfolio will ideally help to cope with this task, you can entrust it to the baby. </p><p>  But in order for her to be pleased to possess the "treasured folder" and want to replenish it, it is necessary to properly design the design.  If it is very difficult to think of it, you can find samples of children's portfolios for girls. </p><p>  For many years, Disney has been delighting all children with new cartoons.  Particularly fans of fairy tales are girls.  All the most famous and beloved princesses became popular thanks to Disney.  It is quite possible to arrange the title page and all other sheets in the form of a small fairy tale, which will help the baby feel like a real princess. </p><h2>  Caretaker Portfolio </h2><p>  No matter how strange it may sound, a portfolio is also made for educators.  Thanks to him, you can easily find out the level of professionalism, work experience and all the necessary information that will help parents choose the right teacher for their child, and the teacher, in turn, will be very easy to introduce themselves and state all the details about themselves and their work.  More details about the details of its creation can be found thanks to the sample portfolio of the kindergarten teacher. </p><p>  The content of the teacher‚Äôs portfolio must include: Name, date of birth, place of work, position and education.  It is necessary to add additional information, such as: work experience, additional education (music, art school and so on), achievements in work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eduportal44.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="portfolio conclusion" class="if uuid-2481197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2481197.jpg"></div><p>  In conclusion, we can say that a portfolio is an archive of development, achievements of a child.  This is a kind of mini-presentation, a story about the baby‚Äôs life, which everyone needs so that, over the years, they can see the album‚Äôs pages, their successes, and parents can remember how small their favorite child was. </p>
