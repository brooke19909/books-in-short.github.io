"What area is this?"  they ask, usually a little surprised.  We answer: this rather modest-sized settlement is located in the Republic of Bashkortostan (Russia). </p><p>  What is this place famous for?  What is so amazing about him?  And why should everyone visit it as soon as possible?  This article is ready to answer all these and many other questions from those that are most often asked about the city of Sterlitamak.  What area?  What time is it?  Is the climate different?  What does the local population do and what are the features of the local nature?  All of this will be discussed below. </p><p>  In general, I would immediately like to note that when discussing the city of Sterlitamak what region or <span>region it is</span> , asking is not entirely correct.  Why?  The thing is that this locality belongs to another territorial unit called the republic. </p><h2>  Section 1. General information about the city </h2>

    <p>  So, Sterlitamak (which region of Russia and whether it is permissible to ask such questions in principle, was mentioned above) is considered the second most populated administrative center of the Republic of Bashkortostan in the Russian Federation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that this is a rather large machine-building center by modern standards, as well as one of the most important centers of polycentric agglomeration.  Sterlitamak is also known to many for its developed chemical industry. </p><p>  Geographically, the city of Sterlitamak, whose area of ​​influence on the economy of our country is actually difficult to underestimate, is located on the left bank of the river.  Belaya, 121 km south of Ufa. </p><p>  This settlement was founded a long time ago, back in 1766. The area of ​​the city of Sterlitamak had the same name, but subsequently, in 1953, it was abolished. </p><p>  Having gone deep into history, you can find out that initially this settlement arose around the so-called Sterlitamak salt-water pier, but the official status of the city was assigned to it in 1781. </p><p>  In the not so distant past, the city of Sterlitamak (which <span>region it</span> was until 1953, indicated above) was the capital of the autonomous Bashkir Republic.  A little later, the role of the most important city of the region was transferred to Ufa, as a result of which the number of people in the city decreased significantly.  Today, more than 278 thousand people permanently live here. </p><p>  <span>The time difference with Moscow</span> is 2 hours. </p><h2>  Section 2. Where did this name come from? </h2>

Quite a harmonious and very logical name. </p><h2>  Section 3. Features of the physical and geographical location </h2>

    <p>  The city of Sterlitamak, what region it is and whether it exists at all, was indicated above, is located in the <span>European part of the Russian Federation.</span>  To the east of it lie the Ural Mountains, and in the west there is a vast and very picturesque East European Plain. </p><p>  It should be noted that in the vicinity of the city are the so-called shihan, which are unique geological natural monuments.  Near the Kushtau mountain there are numerous children's health camps, holiday homes, ski resorts with pistes and ski lifts.  And this automatically means that there is almost never a shortage of tourists here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Initially, the city of Sterlitamak was created in the interfluve of Ashkadar and Sterli.  Exactly there now is the Old City - the historical center of Sterlitamak.  Subsequently, he, of course, like many other cities in the world, was built up.  The most actively populated locality grew in the northern and western directions.  To date, 5 roads and 1 railway bridge have already been built across the city through the Sterlu River. </p><p>  People who are interested in our country often ask why this settlement did not begin to develop in a seemingly more logical direction.  The thing is that there its growth is limited by the Olkhovka River, which is the left tributary of Ashkadar. </p><h2>  Section 4. The current image of the city </h2>

    <p>  The city of Sterlitamak at the moment is a large center of republican subordination.  Previously, it was the capital of the Bashkir Autonomous Republic, which was then transferred to Ufa, located 120 km from the aforementioned city. </p><p>  Today's settlement is famous for mechanical engineering, chemical industry, large federal highways pass near it. </p><p>  Despite its modest size, the city has interesting places to visit.  For example, amazingly beautiful mosques in the old part of the city have been preserved. </p><p>  It should be noted that, starting from the seventies of the last century, a special scheme was put into effect in Sterlitamak: all residents intensively green their city.  As a result of such painstaking work, the current settlement exceeds even the million-plus city of Samara in the number of birches. </p><p>  The infrastructure is very developed here.  Everywhere visitors to the city expect a variety of shops, boutiques, cafes, pubs, restaurants.  By the way, not everyone knows that in 2007 Sterlitamak was recognized as the most comfortable city in the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Section 5.

    <p>  Sterlitamak owes its origin to a certain merchant Savva Tetyushev, who proposed a project for the construction of the marina in order to take in large quantities the salt brought here.  The total mass of the seasoning supplied, according to the plans of the businessman of that time, could well reach a million pounds, problems with loading and unloading would still not arise.  For those who are curious when exactly the events listed above took place, let’s say that the Tetyushev project with the attached notes of the Orenburg governor was approved by decree of 01/19/1766. A fairly solid period, isn't it? </p><p>  The first caravan with Iletsk salt, which left the marina in the spring of 1767, amounted to the completely not promised million pounds, but three times less.  With the advent of the marina, local salt cart drivers called it Ashkadar, and not at all Sterlitamak, as Tetyushev wanted it to. </p><p>  Soon, multiple shortcomings of the chosen place were discovered.  As a result of the checks, at the suggestion of the chairman of the Salt Commission of the Russian Federation P. D. Eropkin, in 1769 a salt pier with a shallow river.  Ashkadar was moved to its original place. </p><p>  She began to be again near the tract Bugulchan on the river.  White.  Although they still continued to send barges with other cargoes from the previous pier, the mass of which, by the way, significantly exceeded the amount of salt previously exported. </p><p>  It turns out that the city of Sterlitamak was very important in the life of the region. </p><h2>  Section 6.

It is currently closed and is not used for its intended purpose.  But even being almost abandoned, it enjoys steady popularity among environmental tourists.  Extreme fans who skate on skateboards, roller skates and special bicycles love it too. </p><p>  However, one must be careful here, since the territory is guarded and penetration there is not a very legal thing. </p><h2>  Section 9.

    <p>  The reservoir is located at the very foot of the Shihan Tratau.  There is an island on Tugarsalgan, although it used to be a peninsula.  Here once upon a time valuable valuable endemic plants grew, which at the moment, unfortunately, are almost completely destroyed due to thoughtless human activity. </p><p>  It is pleasant to note that at least something is being done to preserve the nature of this region.  So, since 1965, Lake Tugarsalgan and its environs (only about 100 hectares) are officially considered a natural monument. </p><p>  From a geological point of view, Tugarsalgan is one of the <span>deepest lakes of</span> karst origin in Bashkortostan; its greatest depth in some places is <span>27 m. The</span> lake is fed by spring waters.  Its length is 395 m and its width is 260 m. </p><p>  So, this article answered all the questions posed in the city of Sterlitamak: what area, where geographically located, a little history of occurrence, a list of features and a list of the most interesting places to visit.  The point is small - try to feel its atmosphere. </p>
