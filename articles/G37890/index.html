Despite this, there are many definitions of this term.  But it is better to consider it from the angle of different sciences. </p><h2>  Literature </h2><p>  “He who does not know his past is deprived of the future” - this phrase can be heard more than once in various interpretations at lectures on literature or philosophy.  We have been taught from childhood how important it is to know your family tree.  The life story of one’s own ancestors, one’s roots and one’s native land is what a conscious person should know.  That is why already in the first grades, children at school are given various tasks on this topic.  For example, draw your own family tree.  The child gets acquainted with the past, studying his family and thereby realizing the infinity of the countdown. </p>

    <h2>  Definition </h2><p>  The past are certain events of the temporary space that have already occurred.  It is almost impossible to consider this concept without defining the present and future. </p><p>  The past may include events or times, people or objects characteristic of a particular period.  This concept is often used in colloquial speech to determine what will never return and will not happen again.  And there is the phrase "last century."  Using it, a person indicates the untimelyness of objects or events. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The past is something that can be associated with pleasant memories or, conversely, cause negative emotions. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Most of all, history is directed to the study of the past.  This aspect is very important - because it provides a concept and a basis for all processes and events through which human civilization and the world in general have passed. </p><p>  Without studying this science, it is impossible to imagine a single general educational course.  Without knowing the secrets of the past, a person is not able to learn lessons and use the accumulated experience. </p><p>  The historical experience of various peoples makes it possible to learn about world culture as a whole and the generally accepted laws of human development.  Each stage of history, in one way or another, is connected with the present, and the restoration of the chain of logical events helps each person to correctly identify themselves in the modern world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Physics </h2><p>  Classical physics applies the concept of the past and explains it as half the time axis.  This concept is widely used in the theory of relativity, but with some correction.  According to the conclusions of scientists, the past is a certain number of events that allow you to reach the present.  Physics considers the concept of the “cone of the past,” where certain events affect the present.  Thus, this is a whole chain, a causal relationship. </p>

    <p>  But now physics has revised its views on the past and does not consider it to be a constant value.  Albert Einstein's theory, together with practical experiments, prove the possibility of moving in temporary space and even the possibility of influencing it. </p><h2>  The properties </h2><p>  Most sciences and philosophical systems attribute to the past certain properties: </p><p>  1. Invariability - the past will always be the past. </p><p>  2. Uniqueness - each event from the past is concrete and cannot be replaced by another past. </p>

    <h2>  The present </h2><p>  How is the past and present connected?  Even in childhood we were taught to connect it with the present, and the present with the future.  But the future will not be complete without what is happening now.  After all, the future is the result of not only the present, but also the past. </p><p>  For many centuries, people have noticed that the experience of the past cannot be ignored, because the events that have happened can remind themselves at the most inopportune moment.  And what this reminder will be is unknown. </p><p>  Therefore, it is better to remember the past.  After all, it can save you from mistakes in the future, not only of a specific person, but of humanity as a whole.  After all, what is happening in the future and the present is quite natural and inseparable from the past. </p><p>  People are not used to analyzing past events and do not know how to weigh their decisions, linking them with previous experience.  This sometimes leads to an "attack on the same rake." </p><p>  The past and the future are inextricably linked, and between them is the present, which in a couple of moments becomes the past. </p><h2>  Future </h2><p>  The experience of the past sometimes interferes in the future, and sometimes it is simply irreplaceable.  We learn from our mistakes, and what lesson we learn depends on our perception. </p><p>  Is it right to live in the past?  It is impossible to unequivocally answer the question.  But the past often interferes with the future.  It has passed, and we are no longer there.  And it is simply impossible to live or linger in it. </p><p>  Living with the future is also not entirely true.  After all, twisted constantly in dreams, it is impossible to notice the present.  Although everything is very relative.  We can analyze the past and the present, but we cannot see the future, especially the distant one. </p><p>  Living a real life, we have every right to make plans and at the same time draw lessons from the past.  Therefore, it is important to appreciate the moments that are happening here and now. </p><p>  From the point of view of human perception, the past is always the result of some changes or actions.  For each person, this is a certain life experience.  There is also a historical past - this is also an experience that a person uses.  It cannot be changed, but perception is changeable.  It depends more on the present. </p><h2>  Is it possible to change the past? </h2><p>  Practical esotericism and psychology claim that through exercise you can change some points.  They argue that the past and the future do not exist.  These, in their opinion, are simply subjective categories that people perceive differently.  But in fact there is just an instant in which a person is. </p><p>  Understanding this simple fact makes it possible to reconstruct the past.  Nothing can be done in it.  When working with the past to change events and emotional reactions, you need to turn to the imagination.  A person creates his past and future, can do anything with him and bring to his present that desired quality of emotional experiences. </p><p>  Having learned the secrets of the past, a person helps himself and learns to live in the present and look with faith in the future. </p><h2>  Forget the past </h2><p>  Sometimes the past interferes with our present.  In the life of any person there are events that he wants to forget, only memory does not allow this.  After all, psychologists argue that focusing on the past and the future does not allow you to fully live in the present. </p><p>  Man is an emotional being.  The more vivid emotions an event triggers, the more difficult it is to forget it.  For the most part, a person remembers a negative. </p><p>  There are many ways to forget, but this is intentionally impossible to do.  The more we try to forget something, the more we remember it. </p><p>  The most powerful way to forget the past is through memories.  Dianetics allows you to do this.  You just need to live again the event associated with the negative, until then, until it ceases to cause any emotions at all. </p><p>  Psychologists use this practice to help people get rid of the fears of the past and start living in the present. </p><p>  One way or another, despite the definition of a concept, man himself is the creator of his past. </p>
