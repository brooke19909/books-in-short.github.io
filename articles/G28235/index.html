    <p>  These conditions are met by the <span>Black Sea coast of</span> Bulgaria, for example, the resort of Albena, which is great for a quiet family vacation.  Bulgaria, as you know, is famous for its excellent ecology: there is no industry on the coast, but a lot of greenery.  The sandy beaches here are the widest and some of the cleanest in the country.  Off the coast of Albena, the sea is shallow, the entrance is gentle, which is very convenient and safe for bathing young children.  The temperature in summer is comfortable, there is no sweltering heat, as in Turkey or Egypt, which is also good for families with children.  And, finally, the entertainment infrastructure is well developed, amusement parks work, there are many playgrounds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where it is better to relax with a child at sea" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10761/154360.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And besides Bulgaria, <span>where is it better to relax</span> at sea with children?  Many parents choose Mediterranean resorts.  The best time to relax in this region is June, end of August, beginning of September.  At this time, the sea has time to warm up, but there is no sweltering heat.  The beaches of Turkey, Tunisia, Spain, Egypt will provide excellent options for where to relax with your child at sea.  Everything here has to rest: sandy or small-pebble beaches, warm gentle sea, and, of course, well-developed infrastructure.  Many hotels have their own playgrounds, water parks, children's clubs and even small zoos, which are very popular among children. </p><p>  Choosing where it is better to relax at sea with children in Egypt, you need to be very careful in choosing a hotel.  The fact is that in the Red Sea there are many <span>coral reefs</span> that can be dangerous for children.  In addition, it is not allowed to go directly to the corals, therefore, vacationers dive from the pontoon where the reef ends, which means immediately great depth, which, of course, is quite inconvenient for the child.  However, on the Red Sea there are hotels that have both sandy beaches with a shallow and comfortable for children bottom, and coral, where you can admire flocks of colorful fish. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ‚Äã‚Äãholidays with children in Russia" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10761/154362.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <p>  <span>Holidays at sea</span> with children in Russia is also possible, it even has many advantages.  You do not need to travel abroad, which means that there is no need to apply for visas and all kinds of permits for the export of a child.  In addition, you relax in your native country, where everything is familiar to the child - language, customs, people.  And this is very important, since foreigners and their incomprehensible language are stress for the baby.  And finally, importantly, financially, you are likely to win too. </p><p>  Where is it better to relax at sea with children in Russia?  You can choose the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  These resorts are traditionally chosen for family vacations.  Off the coast, the sea is shallow, the bottom of the shallow water warms up pretty quickly.  In recent years, the infrastructure of children's recreation has been intensively developing here.  Thus, a <span>vacation with children on the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov</span> will be comfortable and inexpensive. </p><p>  And finally, with the kids you can perfectly relax on the Black Sea.  Back in Soviet times, the resort of Anapa was considered a children's health resort, and today the buildings of new modern hotels have grown and settled here, the old motels and boarding houses have been completely reconstructed, and a modern entertainment infrastructure has been created. </p>
