  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Popular knitting patterns for booties</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Young mothers know that the legs of the newborn in the winter and in the summer should be warm.  For this, in addition to ordinary socks, you can use booties, which are easy to make on your own, using knitting needles or a hook.  The product will turn out to be original and will suit exactly your baby.  Knitting patterns for booties can differ in level of complexity, the principle of implementation and variable finishing methods. </p><h2>  Selection of tools and materials </h2><p>  To make the product suitable for the child to wear, it is worth choosing the appropriate materials.  Booties for very young children are usually knitted from acrylic.  If we talk about the summer version of booties, then cotton is usually used here.  Decorative types of yarn are used only to decorate the product. </p><p>  Necessarily need a suitable pattern for knitting booties, in which all additions, decreases, the knitting method of each row and the main pattern will be precisely registered.  If the manual is clear, then the speed and quality of execution will be optimal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nieuwsblad.be" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="yarn for knitting booties" class="if uuid-2936157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2936157.jpg"></div><p>  You need to decide on the choice of additional materials for decorating the selected model.  Sometimes booties can have a rough sole made of fur, cloth or felted cloth.  Depending on the choice of the scheme and the model itself, the choice of tools with which the product will be created.  There are only 2 types of tools - knitting needles or hook. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The simplest booties on 2 needles </h2><p>  The simplest and most convenient option for shoes for newborns is booties.  But for some needlewomen, the creation of even such a simple shoe can cause difficulties, so you should pay attention to the simplest schemes. </p><p>  For beginners, the option is suitable where the booties fit with just 2 knitting needles.  Such a knitting pattern with knitting needles is easy to read, you can easily change the size using the description of the product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting booties with two knitting needles" class="if uuid-2941003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2941003.jpg"></div><p>  Description of work: </p><ol><li>  You need to dial 38 loops and knit 7 rows with front stitch.  At the beginning of each row, 1 loop is added.  As a result, through 7 rows, 45 loops are already obtained. </li><li>  The next 6 rows are knitted with an elastic band, which consists of back and front loops alternating between each other through one. </li><li>  Knit 33 loops face, then expand the work and count the middle loops in the amount of 21 pieces. </li><li>  It is necessary to knit 6 loops with the wrong ones, and the next 9 with elastic. </li><li>  Turn the work and knit the last ninth loop from one of the side 6 loops. </li><li>  Next, only 9 middle loops will be knitted, and at the end of each row, the last 1 will be knitted.  An elastic band of 9 middle loops will be performed until all 6 loops on each side of the elastic band contract. </li><li>  We knit all the loops of the cloth with a garter stitch.  It should get 14 rows.  You can knit an additional few rows using yarn of a different color. </li><li>  Sew booties around the edge. </li></ol><p>  This version of the product is suitable for any age. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Booties - "watermelon": fast and original </h2><p>  To knit booties, "watermelon", you should first choose the right color of yarn.  In accordance with the color of the berries, it is necessary to take a salad and dark green colors.  For knitting, you need to take 2 knitting needles with number 2.5. </p><p>  Knitting booties according to the scheme with the description consists of only several steps, each of which is simple: </p><ol><li>  You need to dial 50 loops and knit 90 rows of facial stitch.  It is worth using a thread of dark green color. </li><li>  Next, a sock will be formed.  You need to close 28-30 loops. </li><li>  A salad-colored thread is introduced, and 6 rows of stocking knit are knitted (the front rows are knitted with the front ones, and the wrong ones with the wrong ones).  Next, knit 6 rows again with the front stitch, using again a dark green thread. </li><li>  This alternation suggests at the end the presence of 8-10 strips of facial smoothness. </li><li>  After forming the sock, all the loops are closed. </li></ol><h2>  Assembling booties - "watermelon" </h2><p>  After knitting, you need to proceed to assembly and decoration.  If the knitting pattern of watermelon booties was correctly recreated in the work, then problems with assembly should not arise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.syl.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern of watermelon booties" class="if uuid-2940791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2940791.jpg"></div><ol><li>  You need to sew a sock to the canvas, which is connected by the front surface.  That is, you need to sew the end of the work with the beginning. </li><li>  You need to sew the upper part of the sock with ordinary stitches and pull the thread together.  Lock the thread. </li><li>  Sew the lower part together with stitches along the entire work.  So the foot is formed. </li><li>  The part of the fabric that will clasp the leg, as a result of socks, can be tucked in or remain in the rack position. </li></ol><p>  You can use other color combinations.  The finished product can be decorated in accordance with the chosen design. </p><h2>  Crocheted booties for newborns </h2><p>  The crochet pattern of booties with crochets is a simple version of a product that a needlewoman can make without experience.  You need to prepare 50 grams of the main color yarn and 10-15 grams of auxiliary thread for decorative finishes. </p><p>  Work algorithm: </p><ol><li>  Tie a chain of air loops.  For a 2-month-old baby, you need to dial 18-19 loops.  The blank is tied on both sides with double crochets.  The number of rows depends on the size of the legs. </li><li>  The second stage of work is the binding of the sole.  The principle of forming the walls of the product is quite simple, since only double-crocheted columns are used for knitting. </li><li>  The third step will be the assembly and decoration.  At the stage of wall formation, an additional element, namely ruffles, can be connected.  Beads or satin ribbons can act as decorations. </li></ol><p>  To understand the principle of the work, it is worth using a knitting booties scheme for newborns with a detailed description. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ball.ucoz.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet booties pattern" class="if uuid-2940970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2940970.jpg"></div><h2>  Booties finish </h2><p>  Even if the <span>knitting</span> pattern of <span>booties is</span> too primitive, this does not mean that the product will result in inconspicuous.  Anything can be made original and aesthetically pleasing with the help of decoration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gotobuy.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="option for finishing booties" class="if uuid-2936064" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2936064.jpg"></div><p>  Booties can be decorated with satin ribbons, which can also serve as ties.  Ribbons can be used for embroidery.  Beads, beads, sequins can serve as decoration.  From yarn you can make pompons or strapping along the edge of the product.  From the thread you can tie flowers, leaves, butterflies and other decorative elements. </p><p>  The simplest decoration option will be stickers for textiles, ready-made embroideries made of threads, sequins or beads.  You can buy other ready-made items: flowers, cars, decorative buttons. </p>
