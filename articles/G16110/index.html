Firstly, it is interesting to know that its depth is 8 meters.  It is a shallow station.  There are only three flights here.  Secondly, a huge number of columns supporting the ceiling, standing in two rows, attracts attention.  There are more than fifty of them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro Yasenevo" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/403982.jpg" width="300"></div>  The distance between the columns is approximately 7 meters.  They are noteworthy for their cylindrical shape, the marble of <span>green color,</span> which they are lined with, also looks beautiful.  In addition, you should pay attention to the walls of the station.  They consist of lime green metal tiles.  It has the shape of cells.  The design of the station was developed by N.V. Shurygin and N.I. Shumakov.

Those who like sports can go to the complex called the Commonwealth.  If you just want to take a walk, the Yasenevo district is great for this.  There are several large parks of the capital.  The most popular of them is Bitsevsky.  It is huge, perhaps only Elk Island is bigger than it.  It is worth getting to the metro station "Yasenevo" to take a walk here.  People come here even from afar.  Inside the park there is a manor, which was built in the XIII century.  Rich and famous people lived in it.  If you want to know more about this, you can use the services of a guide.  In addition, the Znamenskoye-Sadki estate, as well as Uzkaya, are located on the territory of the park.  Here is a very interesting place "Bald Mountain", where you can see unusual plants and several sources. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro station Yasenevo" class="if" height="213" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/403986.jpg" width="320"></div>  There are always a lot of people in <span>Bitsa Park</span> - both Muscovites and tourists come here.  By the way, the latter want to know what time the Yasenevo metro opens.  On even numbers, this happens at 5:40.  Isn't it pretty early?  And on the odd, it opens at 5:45.  This is very convenient, because if you need to urgently leave somewhere, you do not have to call a taxi and spend a lot of money on it.  Of course, every sane person will go on the subway.  It allows you to get to the right place quickly enough and at the same time save.

Also, the advantages of the district include the fact that there are no plants.  Therefore, it is easy to breathe in Yasenevo.  The air here is just wonderful.  Near the metro station "Yasenevo" live happy and contented people.  And this is not at all surprising. </p><h2>  Purposeful and courageous inhabitants of the area </h2><p>  Yasenevo is located in the south-west of the capital, it is located quite far from the center.  In this rather large area very purposeful and active people live.  At the end of the 80s, it was decided to create a zoo and make a trip to the Moscow Ring Road.  However, residents have ensured that these plans have been canceled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro Yasenevo Butovo" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/403988.jpg" width="550"></div>  And at the end of the 2000s, a garbage burning enterprise should have appeared here, but people also did not allow this.  So living near the Yasenevo metro is safe for health.  It is noteworthy that an apartment in this area can be bought at an average cost.  Of course, housing prices here are simply astronomical, as in the whole of Moscow.  But if you compare Yasenevo with other areas of the city, then buying a property here is profitable.

    <h2>  Advantages of the Yasenevo area </h2><p>  - There are a lot of trees, this is rarely seen in the capital.  In the area there are forest parks Golubinsky, Uzkoye, Yasenevsky.  There is also a nature reserve called ‚ÄúBitsevsky Forest‚Äù.  The area is simply surrounded by forest parks.  Although the Moscow Ring Road runs along the southern border of Yasenevo, this is not at all felt, no discomfort is felt.  Some green spaces located directly in the blocks received their names.  For example, the Nightingale Park, as well as the Park of the 30th anniversary of Yasenevo.  There are also squares and groves without names.  However, they are much prettier and nicer than many parks located near new buildings, created in haste. </p>

There are two <span>stations: Novoyasenevskaya</span> and Yasenevo.  They are located at the end of a rather convenient Kaluga-Riga branch.  Of course, the center is far enough from here, but the trip will turn out to be comfortable.  In February, a new metro line appeared: Yasenevo-Butovo.  This was awaited by many residents.

    <p>  - Since the air here is clean, various diseases are less common.  Is it really bad to live in an area where there are no factories at all?  The residents of the area have reason to be proud.  On Novoyasenevsky Prospekt there is a large stone marking the highest section of the capital. </p><p>  - Although the district is located on the edge of the city, the infrastructure here is at a fairly high level.  On the Kaluga highway, for example, Mega is located, and near the Yasenevo and Teply Stan stations there are several shopping and entertainment complexes. </p><h2>  Buses from the metro station "Yasenevo" </h2><p>  Many are interested in which buses run here.  There are a lot of them: 781, 639, 202, 101, 642k, 642, 264, 710. In general, there is no shortage of transport, and this is another advantage of this region. </p>
