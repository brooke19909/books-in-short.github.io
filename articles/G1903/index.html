If you liked this phone model, you just need to choose the size that is more suitable without any compromises or additional considerations. </p><p>  This is a very rare occurrence in the industry.  Apple's iPhone has different resolutions and cameras; Huawei's P10 models vary in a wide range of specifications.  Google‚Äôs Pixel, the most modern of Android phones, offers a different display resolution for a larger device.  Even with the 2018 update, the Galaxy S9 Samsung has placed different cameras in the model. </p><h2>  Infinity Technology Development </h2><p>  While the Galaxy S6 + and Galaxy S7 rounded screen models had some changes, the innovations in the Galaxy S8 matrix shapes made the model the phone of the future.  There are a lot of changes in this smartphone.  Double curved edges, sculpted sides and a glass back cover have additionally increased water resistance modes. </p><p>  Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus often gets reviews because of its design.  This is the first model in the smartphone market that has similar shapes.  On the front panel, a big change is a decrease in the upper and lower sides of the front panels, a change in aspect ratio - 18.5: 9.  The company's goal was to increase the screen-to-body ratio and give more display, without leading to a significant increase in the size of the case.  The Samsung Galaxy S8 + has a 6.2-inch display, but its width is only 73.4 mm.  This is already larger than the iPhone 8 Plus, but the new technology increases the screen matrix itself by half an inch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="bgr.com" data-author=": Zach Epstein, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rounded edges" class="if uuid-3023313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3023313.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, changing the diagonal leads to an increase in the screen, but it is more elongated and not wider, therefore, although the diagonal becomes larger, the client receives the same display area as with a 6.2-inch 16: 9 phone. </p><h2>  Use difficulties </h2><p>  Reviews on the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus can be found on major domestic and international gadget review portals.  Buyers often share different emotions about the non-standard screen of the model.  In fact, Samsung stretched the display to sections of the phone that used to be the upper and lower frames, shifting the screen controls and completely removing the logo at the top.  Moving the controls to the display is something that the company has avoided for many years, but now it requires moving the fingerprint scanner to the back of the device and the mechanical button under the screen matrix, replacing it with a touch screen. </p><p>  In addition, users leave positive feedback about the "Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus" about the screen.  Surprisingly, although the S8 + has a huge display, it is not too bulky.  Saving the screen width during verification makes it easy to place the device in one hand, although it cannot be avoided that it is almost impossible to reach the top of the matrix with one hand without using the other. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Reviews about the "Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus" are mixed about the usability of such a screen.  Whether the S8 is too large and bulky is a moot point.  For some, perhaps yes, but there is the same Galaxy S8 specification that offers identical technology, but in a smaller 5.8-inch package. </p><p>  The only flaw in the design of the S8 + is the speaker.  There is one speaker at the bottom of the frame, and its performance is rather weak.  However, this is what Samsung fixed in the new Samsung Galaxy S9 +, although it is worth considering whether the speaker volume is important if there are high-quality branded headsets.  The original cover on the ‚ÄúSamsung Galaxy S8 Plus‚Äù is not difficult to find.  A large selection of products is presented on the official website of the company. </p><h2>  Gadget Features </h2><p>  Reviews on the "Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus" are positive and in terms of its performance.  Turning to the characteristics of the device, it is also worth noting that at the time of the release of the smartphone, he held repeatedly leading positions in performance tests. </p><p>  Key technical indicators: </p><ol><li>  The processor type is Exynos 8895. </li><li>  RAM - 4 GB. </li><li>  64 GB of internal memory and resolution for microSD cards. </li><li>  Built-in 3500mAh rechargeable battery. </li><li>  USB Type-C connector and support for wireless charging function. </li><li>  Gigabit LTE connection speed. </li><li>  3.5mm jack for wired headphones. </li></ol><p>  The performance of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus was pretty high for 2017.  Except for the design itself, the Samsung Galaxy S8 + comes with completely updated accessories.  The smartphone was the first to install a 10-nm chipset, although until 2017, most other manufacturers refused to use this technology. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Galaxy S8 + has no competitors.  It performs daily tasks without difficulty and is able to simultaneously run multiple applications at once.  The multitasking mode is possible thanks to the new processor core technology.  Switching to 10nm architecture brings new benefits, and the next-generation GPU offers more options for playing games and watching movies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.bestbuy.ca" data-author=": Ted Kritsonis, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Location of widgets on the screen" class="if uuid-3023319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3023319.jpg"></div><p>  The high performance of Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus allows you to process tasks and incoming information to the device in seconds.  A wide range of multitasking options uses not only power, but also the unusual aspect ratio of the display.  Multitasking is not new for Samsung, as the company initially built its policy on high performance when releasing S-series devices. The result is experience gained through many years of work by specialists.  And now in the new model, even after several months of active use of the gadget, all its actions in the work are carried out smoothly and without slowdowns. </p><p>  This is not a phone that starts to heat up during long work.  The success largely testifies to the manufacturer‚Äôs experience, as well as the provided proprietary software and hardware modules that are integrated into the smartphone.  Naturally, the Galaxy S9 + is faster, but even a year later the S8 + is not inferior to it in performance. </p><h2>  Integrated technology </h2><p>  The review of Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is also worth mentioning modern technology for the latest generation of gadgets.  The USB Type-C connection at the bottom charges the 3,500 mAh battery.  This is a rather large volume, but it becomes nominal for such a size device.  The gadget without recharging works fine during the day, often the charge is enough the next day without any problems.  Nevertheless, the constant discharge of the smartphone to the maximum will eventually lead to the fact that the battery will cease to hold the charge normally. </p><p>  The charging of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus has also undergone a change.  The developers introduced radio modules into it and changed the connection bus.  There is support for wireless charging through a special unit, as well as quick recharging by cable for 30 minutes to return to work as soon as possible.  Gadget technology is also focused on optimizing battery performance.  Not only does it take advantage of Nougat's advanced energy-saving features, such as Doze, there are additional energy-saving features through manual switching, with many settings, so that the buyer can get the desired result. </p><p>  A review of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus also showed the device‚Äôs technology from the past.  The Samsung Galaxy S8 + also has a headphone jack.  It may seem strange, but in 2017, many smartphones abandoned this heritage. </p><h2>  Screen overview </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus screen gets a lot of positive feedback from customers.  In addition to the technology of placing the display itself, the phone is notable for the fact that it has a new matrix. </p><p>  Screen Specifications: </p><ol><li>  The screen size is 6.2 inches. </li><li>  The maximum resolution is 2960 x 1440 pixels. </li><li>  Matrix with AMOLED Infinity Display technology with double edges. </li><li>  The aspect ratio on the device is 18.5: 9. </li><li>  Screen Quality Certification - Mobile HDR Premium. </li></ol><p>  The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus screen has been developed for a long time and gradually introduced technology for a frameless format.  According to many users, this is the most beautiful display that can only be found on mobile gadgets.  Even with the updates introduced in the Galaxy S9 +, the S8 + still attracts attention. </p><p>  The performance of this display is impressive to many.  The smartphone uses the AMOLED panel.  This proprietary technology has an excellent reputation for use on generations of Galaxy S devices. The AMOLED in the S8 + delivers depth and richness, making competitor screens a bit dated and dull. </p><p>  The new type of resolution 18.5: 9, which absorbs most of the space, is very attractive to many users.  Equally integrated into the phone, Infinity Display technology really looks fantastic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.smartprix.com" data-author=": Deepak Singh, "><img itemprop="image" alt="High resolution matrix" class="if uuid-3023324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3023324.jpg"></div><p>  This display offers stunning visual effects.  Buyers say that after they started using S8, any idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa marketing ploy disappeared, especially when the screen began to perform everyday tasks, broadcast movies and launch games.  It is also a display with support for HDR (High Dynamic Range). </p><p>  It is able to display content more dynamically than other devices, in terms of maximum brightness and color gamut (representing more colors for a more saturated appearance).  The various portals that broadcast movies and clips have a separate HDR label.  The mark indicates that the played videos will be in this format of high definition and contrast.  Owners' reviews of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus note that the video on the screen looks quite realistic. </p><p>  There is a change in resolution up to 2960 x 1440 pixels.  This makes it possible to change display formats, although the default mode is 1080 p to save battery power.  But changing the screen resolution will not make much difference for things like email and social networks. </p><p>  Another distinguishing feature is brightness.  Under direct sunlight, the S8 + reacts stably to all actions, transmitting content and information without losing brightness.  The changed screen shape, brightness, deep black tones of the matrix, saturated colors, certification of Mobile HDR Premium - this is just a small list of advantages in the Galaxy S8 +. </p><h2>  Fingerprint scanner and face recognition </h2><p>  The scanner in the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus smartphone has the following characteristics: </p><ol><li>  Iris touch processing technology. </li><li>  Face recognition processor. </li><li>  Fingerprint scanner on the back. </li><li>  Pressure sensitive button below the screen. </li></ol><p>  It is worth examining the <span>fingerprint scanner</span> and the Home button in detail.  The reader is now located at the back, but it is not executed, as, for example, in the Google Pixel 2 XL.  This is, according to users, the most successful solution in the location of the sensor on the back side, and the Galaxy S8 +, unfortunately, is not. </p><p>  It is worth turning to the history of the development of the model.  Back in 2010, the original version of the Samsung Galaxy S had a mechanical button.  Each new S-Series model followed suit as Samsung avoided the temptation to go on-screen controls.  This physical button has recently contained a fingerprint scanner, the result is a result quite similar to the iPhone, but more efficient and convenient to use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.researchsnipers.com" data-author=": Aiman Bilal, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wireless charger" class="if uuid-3023325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3023325.jpg"></div><p>  Moving the display into a space without mechanical control means no space for this button and no space for the fingerprint located on the front of the scanner.  Its rear position can push the camera away from the point of view of a simple user - this is simply inconvenient.  Devices like the Google Pixel avoid this because it is only a fingerprint scanner in the center and the camera is in the corner.  With Samsung, the buyer needs to touch the scanner with his finger and not touch the nearby camera lenses. </p><p>  However, after a week of active use, unlocking becomes more convenient.  However, as noted by buyers, problems still remain, since everyone‚Äôs palm sizes are different, and unlocking using a fingerprint scanner will be inconvenient for children or teenagers.  Therefore, fortunately, Samsung offers a number of biometric unlock options.  There is an ordinary password and a pattern key, but an iris scanner is more suitable. </p><p>  To do this, you need to scan your eyes by looking at your phone, and it will then automatically give access to work.  Of course, for this you will need to activate the scanning mode by long pressing the virtual Home button.  In fact, using the new virtual home button and eye scanner is as simple as the old fingerprint scanning system. </p><p>  For those who do not want to look at the red lights that are used in the front camera for scanning, it is possible to use face recognition technology.  This lock system has been under closer scrutiny because people could unlock your phone from a photograph.  This is evidenced by tests conducted by users of smartphones with this technology. </p><p>  Samsung smartphone buyers can now be satisfied with the on-screen buttons.  The company has long adhered to this technology off-screen, while most of the Android gadgets have already tried to completely get rid of the mechanical parts on the front panel. </p><p>  Now you can simply tap the bottom of the screen to go to the main screen.  When performing this action, pressure sensitivity and tactile feedback will give the feeling that the user has pressed a mechanical button, although it is completely virtual.  This change is quite significant for smartphone owners.  Samsung took a step forward, discarding one of the remnants of the old that held the flagship. </p><p>  It also means that the navigation bar can be dynamic.  If users of the Samsung smartphone said that the buttons were located on the panel in the reverse order compared to any other Android device, now all the virtual controls are fully editable.  Clients say that, if necessary, you can configure special game modes by adding additional elements to the navigation menu if necessary. </p><h2>  Camera overview </h2><p>  The company did not place much emphasis on cameras and lenses. </p><p>  Description of features: </p><ol><li>  The rear camera is 12 megapixels. </li><li>  Front camera - 8 megapixels. </li><li>  Multi-frame image processing. </li><li>  Bixby Integration. </li></ol><p>  <span>Samsung Galaxy S7</span> was one of the best gadgets, according to users of 2016, so it is probably not surprising that in 2017 nothing changed in terms of cameras on the S8 +.  Much has remained unchanged, both in terms of hardware and the camera, from fast shooting to HDR capture and good all-round performance.  Thanks to this photo in the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus, we get high quality. </p><p>  Each of the models 7 and 8 of the version has virtual buttons and controls for shooting, but in general, the technology is convenient to use.  Since S8 + is the 2017 model, there is the addition of some AI elements, such as Snapchat masks, that you can wear to yourself or other people.  Since the gadget is positioned for the younger generation, namely adolescents and students, not all buyers will use similar technologies. </p><p>  To quickly launch the camera in the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus, now double-clicking the standby button is used, the shooting time is adjusted by a swipe to the right or left.  The camera focuses quickly, offers a full range of manual controls, including night shooting and excellent performance in all conditions.  One of the obvious improvements is that now stabilization of video at higher resolutions is possible due to the greater processing power of the smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="workreveal.biz" data-author=": workreveal, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How lies in the hand" class="if uuid-3023330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3023330.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, a camera with an 8-megapixel lens with a higher resolution appeared in the front of the case.  Looking at the angle capture, the front camera now also uses autofocus.  This means that the front silhouettes are now sharper and the background is more blurry.  As a result of this photo in the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus come out more expressive. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the performance is good in all areas, in low light you can notice errors in the pictures, because the camera processes the image noise and can not do the correct focus.           -    ,    f / 1.7     ,    . </p><p> Many 64GB Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus customers also praise the on-screen exposure compensation switch located in the camera‚Äôs settings.  If the low-light angle is too bright (such as sunset), you can easily slide the brightness down to get the colors you want.  The technology is applicable in many directions. </p><p>  The only thing users really complain about is the addition of AI and Bixby Vision stickers.  This creates unnecessary clutter in the applications, and there is no way to remove them.  How can all this be compared with the Samsung Galaxy S9 +, the question is interesting.  Samsung's latest phone has a camera with much more power.  Additionally, a super-powerful deceleration of 960 frames per second is offered, but the real difference is the dual-aperture camera.  This gives the S9 + better imaging skills even in low light.  Then there is an additional 2-optical modulation.  It enables faster image processing even at high magnification.  General reviews about the characteristics of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus from customers are positive, although there are flaws in the device. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The flagship device is also distinguished by the presence of modern software, which also includes artificial intelligence technologies.  The Bixby system has been integrated into the Galaxy S8.  This is the name of Samsung's AI service, which includes many features and is also activated through a physical button on the left side of the phone.  Bixby aims to cover the series of all devices, but began its promotion on this model.  As a result, the memory on the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus began to be additionally loaded from running processes. </p><p>  After a rather slow start, Bixby managed to expand its appeal by bringing the voice of the software bot to a wider circle of users.  You can ask questions, but the most useful part is the ability to change device settings using Bixby voice control.  It cannot be ruled out that the Galaxy S8 + is a complex device, and Bixby can help a novice user quickly master the gadget.  Additionally, the software is convenient when using the player in the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus.  With voice technology, you can quickly manage your playlist. </p><p>  But does the program justify the button highlighted specifically on the phone panel, a question that does not have a clear answer.  Over the last year of using a device equipped with Bixby, smartphone buyers almost never used the services of Samsung.  Especially when the Google Assistant included in this device provides much greater integration with Google services, hardware elements such as Google Home and extensive smart home control. </p><p>  Experience with the software of many users suggests that the technologies used in the gadget are not always doomed.  A few years ago there was a time when users left comments that the Samsung TouchWiz (or Samsung Experience UX, as it is now called) was very overloaded, and the process of updating and editing software was very slow. </p><p>  Now the technology is integrated into HTC Sense, partially involved in Huawei's EMUI, and surpasses LG UX UX.  Samsung also has the option to not install proprietary applications when the phone starts.  The company allowed the owners of their smartphones to decide which applications to choose, as well as to configure them on their own.  In the instructions for the "Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus" you can find a detailed description of each technology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thetechy.com" data-author=": ByKonark Tyagi, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Back view" class="if uuid-3023338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3023338.jpg"></div><p>  To list all the subtleties and settings of the system in S8 +, it will take a lot of time.  There are basic personalization solutions that are used everywhere.  You can use the navigation bar settings, you can disable the download of Samsung applications.  The user chooses whether he will have branded programs or not. </p><p>  Thanks to the settings of the headphones, screen, sidebar with widgets and the ability to launch applications in full screen mode, the Galaxy S8 + has greatly simplified management for beginners and advanced users.  The operating system, along with the software shell, always searches through autoruns to connect the buyer to a TV, speakers or Chromecast, or without having to open something like Bluetooth settings. </p><p>  Bixby, users claim, will someday have a place in all of this, but there is Samsung Connect (now called SmartThings, as the company is trying to remove all its brands), which seems to optimize these connections and simplify them. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  Owner reviews of the Samsung Galaxy S8 are more positive.  All comments evaluate the appearance, camera quality and system performance.  However, there are also negative reviews.  Most of these comments relate to the elongated shape of the gadget and the proximity of the fingerprint sensor with the camera. </p><p>  The pros and cons of the Samsung Galaxy S8 mainly relate to the individual assessment of each device owner. </p><p>  Of the main advantages most often distinguish: </p><ol><li>  Curved screen. </li><li>  High degree of protection against moisture. </li><li>  Powerful processor and large amount of RAM. </li><li>  Stylish design. </li><li>  Wireless charger. </li></ol><p>  Of the shortcomings, buyers distinguish: </p><ol><li>  Fingerprint sensor. </li><li>  Face recognition system. </li><li>  Marked screen. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, the cons though not significant, but still there.  Therefore, before purchasing this model, you should familiarize yourself with it and at least hold it in your hands. </p><h2>  Final decision </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus phone has received many international awards and prizes.  He was surveyed by millions of publishers.  The company was waiting for 2017 to release its flagship phone, and it was worth it.  A year later, with the fall in prices, the Galaxy S8 + is still opposed to the new version of the Galaxy S9 +. </p><p>  Refined design, high-quality waterproof assembly, an excellent camera and a 3.5-mm headphone jack - these are the parameters included in the list of positive results.  In addition, this is an improved software experience that offers the buyer a choice of options and functions, as well as the highest performance, in which the S8 + is superior to other flagships. </p><p>  Users praise the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus and the display.  At first glance, it looks great, but in the hand it feels great.  Some might think that the aspect ratio of about 2: 1 will be stretched, but after it was decided to use this format in the video, customers fell in love with the quality and brightness that the matrix offers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techwelike.com" data-author=": Analie Cruz, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Comparison of older and younger models" class="if uuid-3023322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3023322.jpg"></div><p>  To choose between Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus or iPhone 8 you need for personal reasons.  Both smartphones radically differ not only in form, but also in integrated technologies.  Of course, the Galaxy S8 + will just be too big for some.  You can‚Äôt easily get your finger to the top of the screen without using your second hand.  In addition, there is a poorly installed fingerprint scanner, which is located close to the rear camera. </p><p>  But when there is Stranger Things, a magnificent widescreen mode, increased battery life, allowing you to actively use your smartphone all day, and the experience of the company that distinguishes the device from others, S8 + is unparalleled.  As a result, buyers for a considerable price get an excellent phone capable of performing any, even complex tasks. </p>
