The ancient city of Cardiff was once one of the main industrial centers of England, and now it is a luxurious resort with many attractions for tourists. </p><p>  It was not for nothing that they called him the capital of castles and the city of passages.  Walking along the old streets of vibrant Cardiff, you can get acquainted with the mysterious Bopre mansion castle, visit the tower of the Umfravilles family estate, and see with your own eyes the legendary Red Castle.  Morgan in Wales, Cardiff - these are the most famous and popular shopping galleries that are loved by all shopping enthusiasts.  In Victorian arcade shopping malls, time runs unnoticed. </p><p>  But the main attraction of the city is closely connected with its history, and not a single tourist leaves without visiting a neo-Gothic building located in the very center of the capital. </p><h2>  The history of the construction of the castle </h2><p>  Cardiff Castle is the oldest building in <span>South Wales,</span> open to tourists.  Cardiff Castle was built on the site of a Roman fort that controlled access to the sea. </p><p>  According to archaeologists, at the beginning of our era, Celtic tribes settled here.  Later, the territory was captured by Roman legionaries, who built the first fortification in the middle of the III century.  For two hundred years, a powerful structure protected the Roman borders from the constant raids of barbarians from the sea. </p><p>  After the Norman invasion, the erected defensive fort was destroyed, and its ruins can now be seen during an exciting excursion. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The new stone fortress built on the hill in 1091 became the progenitor of the famous castle, the owners of which were the English aristocrats, including the royal Tudor dynasty.  Around the fortress there are settlements that have turned into the city of Cardiff. </p><h2>  Restored mansion </h2><p>  Surrounded by a moat, the residence of noble English clans undergoes the first changes in the 12th century.  Its owner erects a huge stone wall with loopholes and a barracks for soldiers.  Each owner makes his own changes in the appearance of the structure, and Cardiff Castle is repeatedly rebuilt to please the new owners. </p><p>  Surviving decay and rebirth, a beautiful mansion, each room of which tells about different historical eras, passes into the possession of the famous dynasty of coal magnates.  Rich Buttes make Cardiff Castle the most famous city landmark. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cardiff castle interiors" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1326025.jpg" width="600"></div>
