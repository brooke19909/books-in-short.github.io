    <h2>  In Sochi!  In February? </h2><p>  For the first acquaintance with the <span>capital of the Olympic Games in</span> 2014, an unhurried walk through the historic quarter is the best choice.  February Sochi impresses with the brightness of the flowers of the lush greenery of tropical vegetation. </p><p>  Trees and palms that had withered in August prettified themselves and greet travelers with a dark gloss of fleshy leaves.  Here and there, couples of lovers, languidly holding hands, stroll leisurely.  Parents with children impressively walk. </p><p>  Do not believe?  Take a look at the photo! </p>

    <h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  The weather in Sochi in February is characterized by an abundance of sunny days.  The average air temperature fluctuates around +8 ° C.  Often the air warms up to +15 ° C.  It gets cooler at night, but the thermometer only occasionally drops below 0 ° C. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the mountains, it’s traditionally frosty.  The warmest in the settlements: Adler, Sochi, Matsesta, Hosta.  Snow in the middle of winter is an exceptional phenomenon, it rains more often.  There are no more than ten cloudy days this month. </p>

    <h2>  Beach life </h2><p>  In Sochi, in February, beaches are as crowded and fun as in June.  True, the colorful tents selling slates, towels and panamas replace the counters, clogged to the top with warm hats, gloves and scarves with a sports theme. </p><p>  Cats scrawled from the southern sun scurry around, and seagulls dive into the sea somewhere nearby.  Photos of tourists are the best proof of this. </p><p>  No less noisy in seaside restaurants.  They lure idle passersby with the spicy aroma of barbecue.  Street verandas and terraces are still open. </p><p>  Bicycle and scooter rentals are available.  Barkers are inviting for boat trips, children's carousels are spinning and spinning. </p><h2>  For entertainment at the Riviera </h2><p>  If the rides on the embankment suddenly seem a little to you, feel free to go to the "Riviera".  This is the central park of the city, which operates year-round.  In Sochi, only water slides were closed in February. </p><p>  The Ferris wheel, like in the summer, tirelessly uplifts vacationers into the blue abyss of the Caucasian sky.  "Pirate ship" takes the children into the world of exciting and dizzying adventures. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A chain carousel dizzy with colorful ponies, donkeys and elephants harnessed to smart carts.  Kids frolic on inflatable trampolines, ride in the colorful cars of the "Merry Train", screaming and laughing, riding horses. </p><h2>  Shopping at the Mall MoreMall </h2><p>  Shopping and entertainment center “MoreMall” is the largest shopping center in the city.  In Sochi in February it is quiet and not crowded.  The shopping center is located on the banks of the rivulet, called Sochinka, at the intersection of two transport arteries, Tchaikovsky and Donskaya Streets. </p><p>  Dozens of boutiques and shops, cafes and eateries are located on several floors of the shopping complex.  MoreMall is an excellent option to pass the hours of bad weather, which is no-no and even comes to these parts.  On weekends, it becomes a place of pilgrimage not only for the ubiquitous tourists, but also for the townspeople. </p><h2>  Sochi National Park </h2><p>  <span>Sochi National Park,</span> according to the numerous reviews of travelers, is another point that must be included in the route when planning a tour to Sochi in February. </p><p>  On its territory, the famous Vorontsov Mountains rise, in the depths of which mysterious caves are hidden from prying eyes.  Here even in winter you can meet wild leopards, enjoy the contemplation of kites soaring in the sky, and see with your own eyes the bison. </p><p>  The park is home to hundreds of birds, including graceful storks.  Excursions are conducted by experienced guides. </p><h2>  Arboretum </h2><p>  The arboretum is part of the structural unit of the Sochi National Park.  Residents of the city claim that winter in Sochi is by no means a reason to refuse to walk around the local reserves. </p><p>  The heart of the arboretum is a swan lake.  Graceful birds never leave their homes, admiring the audience with their snow-white plumage. </p><p>  Even in February, you can wander along the arboretum's paths all day long.  Oaks, palm trees, cypresses, pines and cacti grow in the reserve.  Not far from the pond stands the villa of Sergei Nikolaevich Khudekov, the founding father of the park. </p><h2>  SkyPark AJ Hackett </h2><p>  SkyPark rises above <span>the Mzymta River.</span>  If you are planning a vacation in Sochi in February, do not deny yourself the pleasure of looking at the spurs of the Caucasus Mountains from a bird's eye view. </p><p>  At the guests' disposal are four attractions at once, from which, without exaggeration, the heart beats.  We are talking about the very "bungees" that are known to everyone.  But here they hang right in the gorge, in the depths of which fog swirls. </p><h2>  Olympic Park </h2><p>  The Olympic Park, or Imereti Resort, is the last station of the Swallows, coming from Tuapse and Sochi.  Regardless of the weather, the Olympic Park hosts competitions, concerts and even performances. </p><p>  Within a short drive from sports facilities, the borders of the Southern Cultures Park, another unit of the Sochi National Reserve, stretch. </p><p>  Guided tours that remain after the 2014 Winter Games are held both on foot and on electric vehicles.  Experienced travelers recommend using the latter option or renting bicycles. </p>

    <h2>  Sochi Park </h2><p>  Sochi Park is considered one of the largest entertainment complexes in Europe.  It is located next to the Olympic stadiums, and its attractions are visible from the Black Sea coast. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the “Quantum Leap”, “Serpent Gorynych”, “Firebird”, “Charolet”, “Drifter” and the Ferris wheel that opened last year enjoy the greatest demand among visitors. </p><p>  By the way, visiting Sochi in the winter, you can also save.  Tickets to Sochi Park will cost an order of magnitude cheaper!  Want to get an extra discount?  Make a ticket on the official website. </p>

    <h2>  "Rosa Khutor" </h2><p>  All the most interesting and memorable <span>events in Sochi</span> in February are focused on the Rosa Khutor ski resort.  It is located high in the mountains.  It’s better to get here by the "Swallow" electric train. </p><p>  Snowy peaks, which are always in perfect condition during the high season, are served by modern funiculars and lifts. </p>
