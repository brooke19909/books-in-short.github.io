Even in the photo, the architecture of Dubai is a delight.  Among the hot sands, a city has grown, which in its architectural grace and unique infrastructure is not inferior to any city in the world. </p><h2>  Burj Khalifa Tower </h2><p>  When it comes to the modern architecture of Dubai, first of all we recall this highest tower in the world, whose height reaches 828 meters.  This is one and a half times larger than the second tower in height, located in Shanghai, and three times higher than the famous Eiffel Tower.  This architectural object is certainly striking in its appearance.  A multilevel structure in the form of a three-beam star, crowned with a thin arrow.  However, the internal structure of the tower is much more interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tiqets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Burj Khalifa Tower" class="if uuid-3074865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3074865.jpg"></div><p>  One of the unique structures is high-speed elevators that lift people and goods to the highest floor in seconds.  The elevator speed is about 10 meters per second, which is the best indicator in the world.  On the territory of the Burj Khalifa there are observation platforms, restaurants, business centers, residential apartments and fitness centers. </p><p>  The tower is made of durable materials, designed for elevated temperature and direct sunlight, which sometimes heats the surface to 50 degrees above zero.  The architectural idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe tower is such that on its territory there is everything necessary for independent provision: hydraulic installations, electrical substations, air conditioners of the highest class. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bridge "Three Graces" </h2><p>  Its special place in the architecture of Dubai is occupied by a truly amazing structure - the Three Graces bridge.  It is not known for certain which Graces inspired designers to implement this idea, but the fact that the bridge will never have competitors is clear at first sight.  The project was created by an architectural agency in Rotterdam, and its designers wanted to combine symbols of unity and beauty in one building. </p><p>  A tiny marine creature called radiolaria pushed the architects into a form of construction.  Before starting the construction of the elements of the bridge, work was done to create bulk platforms on the ocean floor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Three Graces Bridge" class="if uuid-3076492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71085/3076492.jpg"></div><p>  The three main elements are created in almost the same form and create a single architectural picture.  All towers are interconnected by special jumpers.  This is a kind of bridges, inside which are located various residential and commercial premises, entertainment venues and pedestrian zones.  The complex is equipped with an independent indoor climate control system. </p><p>  During the construction of the bridge, the place was not chosen by chance.  Three connected Graces symbolize a certain sea gate for travelers arriving in the Persian Gulf. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel "Sail" </h2><p>  A miracle of architecture is the Parus Hotel in Dubai.  His other name is ‚ÄúBurj al Arab‚Äù, which translates as ‚ÄúArab tower‚Äù.  The uniqueness of the structure is that it was built on an artificial island and is located at a fairly large distance from the coast.  To get to it, you need to overcome almost 300 meters.  The construction of the hotel took about five years.  The construction was considered the highest in the world.  But a few years later the championship passed to another building in Dubai - the Rose Tower.  The Burj Al Arab is built in the form of a dhow sail.  It must be admitted that this is a unique architectural structure. </p><p>  The height of the hotel is 321 meters.  Its unique sail detail is made of a special material that reflects the sun's rays and therefore appears dazzling white.  At night, this canvas is used as a screen on which magnificent light shows are shown.  The roof is equipped with a special platform for landing helicopters and light motor aircraft. </p><p>  Internationally, the hotel has five stars.  However, guests claim that the hotel needs to be assigned seven stars in terms of service and overall room design.  Information about how much investors have invested in this project is hidden, but judging by the fact that the construction used the most expensive grades of marble, rare wood, high-quality gold foil, you can calculate the approximate cost of the project. </p><div class="photo" data-original="me.popsugar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Sail" class="if uuid-3074973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3074973.jpg"></div><h2>  Palm islands </h2><p>  In 2001, the United Arab Emirates shocked the world with a palm tree archipelago project. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For several years, builders who lived right there on a moored ship poured tons of stones and sand into the ocean water, gradually raising the bottom and giving the bulk islands the shape of a palm tree.  As a result, the Persian Gulf coastline increased by almost 570 kilometers, and the islands turned into three date palms with individual names: Jebel Ali, Deira and Jumeirah. </p><p>  The islands are surrounded by a crescent-shaped belt, which is a symbol of Islam, and in this case also serves as a breakwater, protecting structures from strong waves.  These islands are connected to the mainland by a bridge, so that they can be reached at any time of the day or night.  On the palm trees 16 leaves.  On each of them, architects placed hotels, shops, parking lots and restaurants. </p><p>  Palm trees - this is the second building on the planet after the Great Wall of China, created by man, which is visible from space. </p><div class="photo" data-original="erasmusu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palm island" class="if uuid-3076297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3076297.jpg"></div><h2>  Sheikh Zayed Mosque </h2><p>  The wonders of architecture are located not only in Dubai.  The capital of the Arab Emirates Abu Dhabi is famous for its amazing beauty by <span>Sheikh Zayed Mosque.</span> </p><p>  The construction of the mosque was completed in the 21st century.  She became one of the largest in the world.  She takes the sixth line in the ranking, but this does not become less attractive.  The snow-white mosque is named after the first sheikh of the United Arab Emirates - Zayed. </p><p>  The architectural design and construction of a mosque in Abu Dhabi took an average of twenty years.  It was decided to design the building in the classic Moroccan style, but some changes were made during the construction process.  Subtle borrowings from the Persian and Arabian directions appeared.  The external walls of the temple are made in the Turkish style.  This mix made the building unique.  In the mosque, you can count about a thousand columns, eighty domes covered with high quality gold leaf.  The main square is made of white Moroccan marble. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.radissonblu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="White mosque" class="if uuid-3076301" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3076301.jpg"></div><h2>  Jumeirah Mosque </h2><p>  It was erected in 1979 in the very center of Dubai.  A feature of the construction was a mixture of medieval style with modern building materials.  The building can accommodate more than a thousand believers.  A drawing of a mosque in Dubai was placed on a local banknote. </p><h2>  David Fisher Tower </h2><p>  The architecture of Dubai is impossible to imagine without the design <span>of the</span> Fisher‚Äôs <span>rotating tower</span> .  There are enough projects like this tower in the world, but only she was ahead of her brothers in self-sufficiency. </p><p>  This unique building is under construction and will be built in Dubai, despite the fact that the city is already famous for its architectural wonders.  The David Fisher Tower is a synthesis of conventional housing and equipment that converts wind energy into electrical energy.  Seventy wind turbines that are built into the building will provide energy not only for themselves, but also for several objects located in the neighborhood. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.middleeastarchitect.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fisher Tower" class="if uuid-3076314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3076314.jpg"></div><h2>  Opera and cultural center </h2><p>  The most unusual building in the architecture of Dubai will be the famous opera.  The project was created under the direction of Zaha Hadid, a British architect with Arabic roots.  It was she who brought to life the unusual, conquering with her softness forms in the building of a cultural center of world scale. </p><p>  The view of the building is very fantastic.  It resembles sand dunes, which are common in the Arabian desert.  The opera will be located on the artificial island "Seven Pearls".  But this does not hinder getting to the cultural center by car, as the island will be connected to the mainland by a bridge.  As planned by the architect, up to three thousand guests will be able to attend opera events, and the theater itself is designed for 800 people.  The hotel will be located nearby.  The building is under construction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldofarchi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="opera and cultural center" class="if uuid-3076305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3076305.jpg"></div><h2>  Leaky Tower </h2><p>  Views of Dubai can please even a sophisticated esthete.  With each new project that the Government of the United Arab Emirates brings to life, there is one more architectural miracle in the world.  This also applies to the amazing "holey" tower, which you can admire in Dubai.  "O-14" is the name of an administrative building that looks like a piece of cheese, which houses business centers and office buildings.  The construction is unique in that, thanks to the many holes, each square meter is perfectly lit.  And if natural sunlight is not enough, then architects know how to solve this problem with the help of modern equipment. </p><h2>  Michael Schumacher Skyscraper </h2><p>  In 2008, the German architectural company LAVA created a high-rise building project, named after the famous Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher.  The skyscraper is under construction and will comprise 29 floors, on which not only residential premises will be located, but also retail outlets, offices, restaurants and bars.  According to this project, the creators plan to build seven skyscrapers around the world - in terms of the number of rider wins in various competitions.  And the first will be in the United Arab Emirates. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vezess.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Skyscraper Michael Schumacher" class="if uuid-3076310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3076310.jpg"></div><p>  All attention is focused on aerodynamics, and from the side it seems as if the tower rushes out of the water up at great speed.  The base of the building looks like a marina, and the apartments on the lower floors are the most expensive, because each has its own exit to its own marina. </p><p>  The tower has an impressive number of balconies.  Due to their vertical arrangement, the structure has such a dynamic look. </p>
