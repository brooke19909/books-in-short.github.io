There are several such layers.  In our article, we will try to briefly describe what the main geospheres are, how they differ and what their function is.  Such general information will be interesting not only to people who are professionally studying the structure of the Earth's layers, but also to the simple reader for general development. </p><h2>  General concept and types </h2>

As already mentioned, the geosphere is just such a layer.  It is interesting to consider the planet in the context.  If we begin to disassemble the shells of the Earth's geosphere from the inside, then we can see the following picture:

    <ol><li>  The innermost layer of the planet is the core. </li><li>  Around the core is a mantle. </li><li>  The next layer is directly the earth's crust. </li><li>  In addition, in the process of formation, water and air shells arose.  In addition, the planet has its own magnetic and <span>gravitational field.</span> </li></ol><p>  Each layer differs from the other mainly in the density of the elements that make up its composition.  In the center of the earth is the densest layer, and as you move away from the middle, the density decreases.  All layers exist in a clear relationship with each other.  One layer penetrates another, and we can observe the presence of one layer in another, etc.  We cannot talk about the isolation of the geospheres, because they are all closely interconnected.  And we will understand this connection when we consider each layer separately.  Many will be surprised to understand that the geosphere is what is around us. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Core </h2>

This, so to speak, is the inner geosphere of the planet, and it is located in its very center.  If we evaluate the appearance of the core, then it is a ball that has a thickness of more than two thousand kilometers.  The composition of the core has a liquid formation, which contains molten iron, nickel and sulfur.  The radius of this layer is about three and a half thousand kilometers.  Moreover, the core has two parts: internal and external.  Their temperature is so high that it is difficult to reproduce such in reality - more than 4 thousand degrees.

      <p></p>
    <p>  Experts explain that the core plays the role of a dynamo for the planet.  How does this happen?  The liquid formation <span>inside the Earth is</span> constantly moving due to its rotation around the axis.  This movement of the nucleus causes the presence of a magnetic field on the planet.  Geologists still continue to study all the features of this hot heart of the Earth. </p><h2>  Mantle </h2><p>  When discussing the geosphere of the earth, the next one is to mention the mantle.  This layer occupies the largest part of the planet - almost two-thirds of its entire mass.  She also has upper and lower parts.  If translated into kilometers, then the lower part takes up to two thousand kilometers, and the upper - a little less than a thousand kilometers.  Geologists have long collected information about what these two mantles consist of.  They took samples from the bowels of the Earth and from the bottom of the ocean, and came to the following conclusions: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  the mantle contains silicates and iron; </li><li>  the structure of the mantle is in the form of crystals, which are in this state only due to the large pressure;  in the opposite case, high temperature (more than 2500 degrees) would lead to melting; </li><li>  the upper mantle is in a liquid state, or rather its lower part;  this layer is a kind of litter for the lithosphere, which seems to float on the surface of the mantle. </li></ul><p>  In general, all these layers are quite mobile relative to each other and can change state from hard to plastic depending on the loads. </p><h2>  Lithosphere </h2>

This layer lies on the mantle and has a thickness of about one hundred kilometers.  We know this part of the planet as the <span>earth's crust.</span>  It is characterized by great rigidity along with excessive fragility.  Granites and basalts make it from top to bottom.  The relief of the bark is divided into two parts:

      <p></p>
    <ul><li>  oceanic </li><li>  continental. </li></ul><p>  These two species differ from each other in composition and structure.  If we consider the continental type of the lithosphere, then its upper layer consists mainly of elements such as oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium.  It can be said that granite rocks enter this part, but basaltic magmas are located deeper.  The oceanic part was always below sea level, which means that it was not affected by the changes that the land part underwent in the process of evolution.  The closer the oceanic plate to the continent, the greater its thickness.  Soil is what lies on the surface of the lithosphere.  It appears after the influence of a number of factors.  It is this layer that strives for the correct interaction with the environment. </p><h2>  Hydrosphere </h2>

This includes all the water on Earth, no matter in what condition it is: liquid, solid, gaseous.  This is a continuous layer, since water forms a cycle.  This layer is represented on the planet by seas, oceans, lakes and rivers, groundwater and glaciers.  Water has a unique climate-forming property on the planet.

    <h2>  Atmosphere </h2><p>  And, of course, when describing the geospheres of the Earth, one cannot ignore the atmosphere.  This is the very layer of air that we need so much for life.  It is about this layer that scientists and ecologists have so often been talking recently.  The composition of this sphere is approximately as follows: </p><ul><li>  78% nitrogen; </li><li>  21% - oxygen; </li><li>  1% - <span>inert gases,</span> hydrogen, carbon dioxide. </li></ul><p>  As these numbers change, climate change and problems for the inhabitants of the planet begin.  For proper life on the planet, such a balance of numbers is needed. </p>

The main defining characteristics are indicators of temperature and pressure in each layer.  So, there are such layers in the composition of the atmosphere:
