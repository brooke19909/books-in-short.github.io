Income tax (that was the name it used to be, and now its name is often heard) is paid to the budget from the incomes of both Russian citizens and temporary workers in the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to calculate personal income tax" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/210422.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <p>  In accordance with the requirements of the tax code of the Russian Federation, personal income tax can be paid both independently, by submitting a <span>declaration of income</span> based on the results of the tax period, and using the services of a tax agent, i.e.  employer paying income.  The latter is more common.  This is convenient: a taxpayer does not need to know how to calculate personal income tax; an experienced accountant or an employer will do it for him by paying a tax and providing the necessary information to the tax service.  The amount of tax is deducted from the salary, and the employee receives his income minus personal income tax. </p><p>  Despite this, in order to control the correctness of accrual and payment of salaries, nevertheless knowledge on how to calculate personal income tax will be useful.  This is completely uncomplicated.  First you need to understand some concepts. </p><p>  <span>The tax base</span> for personal income tax is the income from which it is necessary to pay the specified tax.  In accordance with the law, these include all income received both in cash and in kind, both in rubles and in foreign currency.  The exception is various benefits, except <span>for sick leave:</span> pensions, alimony, student scholarships, payment for donation, inexpensive (costing up to 4000 rubles) gifts from the employer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal income tax base" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/210424.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tax period - the period for which income should be paid tax.  Regarding personal income tax, this is a calendar year.  Although it is deducted from the monthly salary, the correctness of its calculation and payment is monitored based on the results of a particular year.  But it is necessary to pay personal income tax right after the income has been received. </p><p>  Tax deductions - fixed, statutory amounts by which the tax base is reduced when calculating tax.  That is, before calculating personal income tax, it is necessary to take into account all the parameters by which the deductions are made, then subtract their total amount from the amount of income, and only then calculate the tax.  There are several types of deductions. </p><p>  Most often used: personal income tax deductions for children, the so-called standard deductions.  They apply to the income of all taxpayers who have children under 18 years old or 24 years old - provided that they study in some educational institution in a hospital.  Such deductions are provided subject to the taxpayer writing the corresponding application and submitting supporting documents (copies of birth certificates, certificates from educational institutions).  The amount of the <span>standard tax deduction</span> is 1400 rubles per month for the first and second children, 3000 for the third and subsequent, as well as for children with disabilities.  This deduction is granted until the amount of income during the year exceeds 280,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal income tax deductions for children" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/210419.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Other deductions, social and property, most often the taxpayer receives independently from the tax inspectorate, providing documents confirming the right to receive the results of the calendar year. </p><p>  <strong>How to calculate personal income tax?</strong> </p><p>  The tax itself is calculated at a rate approved by the tax code of the Russian Federation: 9, 13, 15, 30, or 35 percent of the amount of the tax base minus tax deductions.  The most common rate is 13%, others relate to the receipt of income in the form of dividends or income of non-residents of the Russian Federation, as well as from wins, prizes and other income that are not salaries and payment for services. </p>
