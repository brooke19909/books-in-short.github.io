  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mixed economic system</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is believed that the oldest economic system is the traditional one.  It is such a way of forming an economic life in which capital and land are in common ownership, and production issues are resolved on the basis of traditions that pass from generation to generation. </p><p>  A centrally regulated system is based on state monopoly.  With such an economic <span>structure, the state</span> organizes production and manages economic resources in accordance with the plan adopted in advance.  Economic management is carried out using command-administrative <span>methods (control,</span> orders, rewards, punishments, etc.). </p><p>  <span>A market economy</span> is a structure in which decisions of consumers and producers are able to determine the distribution pattern of labor, financial and <span>material resources.</span>  Thus, a self-regulating and rapidly developing structure is formed. </p><p>  Countries with mixed <span>economies (Japan,</span> USA, Italy, Sweden, Great Britain and others) are distinguished by the presence of highly efficient production in combination with a high degree of satisfaction of the needs of the population.  These states combine the benefits of a market, command, and traditional economy.  For example, in Japan, national customs and traditions are of great importance. </p><p>  Thus, a mixed economy system is a system based on different forms of ownership.  Its development is governed by civilized decisions, traditions and the market. </p><p>  A mixed economic system is distinguished by the fact that most of the economic goods and resources are held by private owners, and a smaller part is held by the state.  In various countries, the percentage of intervention in the state economy is from 10 to 50%.  In other words, the state controls a certain percentage of services and goods or has a certain share of economic benefits, which it distributes at its discretion. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The mixed economic system assigns a significant role to consumers, producers and the state in solving production problems.  With such an interconnected structure, conditions are created for achieving high efficiency in production.  The abundance of economic benefits, freedom in production and consumption, a high level of income and people's lives in a state with a mixed economy clearly demonstrate the advantages of the system. </p><p>  Within the framework of this structure, participants in economic activity listen to the conclusions of economists, and it implements economic principles and laws.  Thus, the success of the structure is formed. </p><p>  A mixed economic system includes national models of economic formation.  These, in particular, include the Japanese, Swedish, American, German model.  Their implementation in practice led to the formation of an ‚Äúeconomic miracle‚Äù, manifested in the rapid development of the economy in the respective states. </p><p>  Specialists consider the ‚Äúsocial market economy‚Äù according to the model of <span>Ludwig Erhard</span> to be quite promising forms for the formation of an economy <span>.</span>  Such an economy is free competition in conjunction with ensuring the protection of society from the negative effects of a market economy.  Thanks to the responsibility and activity of all participants in the model, consent and the social world are ensured with the existing order. </p><p>  The mixed economic system is developing by the definition of the state, which directs and regulates the processes taking place in it.  This is done through laws, taxes and other methods of indirect, direct and legal management. </p><p>  Along with this, the state contributes to the creation of conditions for the functioning of the entire mixed system as a whole. </p>
