The key organ that carried out the coup in the country was the Military Revolutionary Committee (VRK).  This political unit played a key role in the establishment of <span>Soviet power</span> in the fall of 1917.  VRK was the main body of the Petrograd Soviet of Soldiers and Workers Deputies.  However, the quick liquidation of the Revolutionary Committee reduced the degree of historiographic coverage of the moving units of the revolution.  Subsequently, the functions of the All-Russian Revolutionary Committee were largely transferred to the Cheka, but their continuity was not covered by the Soviet authorities. </p>

    <h2>  Creation of the Military Revolutionary Committee </h2><p>  The formation of the WRC took place in October (from 16 to 21) 1917.  It consisted not only of the Bolsheviks, as it might seem at first glance, but also of the Socialist Revolutionaries and Anarchists.  Lazimir was appointed the head of the Military Revolutionary Committee, who, according to ideological affiliation, was a Left Socialist Revolutionary.  The Bolsheviks committed all these actions with the aim of disguise.  However, Leonid Trotsky became the real leader of the All-Russian Revolutionary Committee.  The activity of this historical character, as well as the activity of the revolutionary committee itself, was deleted from history during the years of the Stalinist regime.  This is due to the confrontation between Stalin and Trotsky after Lenin's death.  After the leader of the revolution passed away, there was a fierce party struggle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The purpose of the committee was articulated as a confrontation of the advancing German army.  However, in reality, a huge coordinated headquarters was set up to prepare for revolutionary events. </p>

    <h2>  VRK activity during the October Revolution </h2><p>  The Military Revolutionary Committee of 1917 was the main legal point for the preparation of an <span>armed uprising.</span>  On October 25, the committee issues Lenin's appeal for the overthrow of the Provisional Government.  At that time in the country there was a situation of dual power.  During the overthrow of power, the Military Revolutionary Committee relied on the Council of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies, the ranks of the guards, sailors, and also on local revolutionary committees.  The Red Guard was quite numerous at the time of the revolutionary uprising and totaled about 200 thousand people in more than 100 cities. </p><p>  October 25, almost all of Petrograd was in the power of the All-Russian Revolutionary Committee.  On the same day, the revolutionary committee announced that the Provisional Government had resigned and that all power had been transferred to the Soviets.  The next day, the military-industrial complex organized an armed seizure of the Winter Palace and arrested almost all members of the Government except A. Kerensky, who managed to escape. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  These events were the peak of the activities of the Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee.  In the future, its functions gradually transferred to other authorities. </p>

    <h2>  WRC branches in Russian regions </h2><p>  On the basis of the Military Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, a headquarters was created in Moscow, and then in the remaining regions of the country.  At the time of the armed uprising, about 40 regional committees functioned in the territory of the former empire, which also prepared the revolution and established Soviet power.  VRKs existed in various administrative units of the country: provincial, district, volost, district and city committees met. </p><h2>  Special departments of VRK </h2><p>  Before the October Revolution, a special body for expropriation was created in the structure of the Military Revolutionary Committee, which means ‚Äúorganized robbery‚Äù.  Forcibly seized premises, cars, money, documents - everything that could serve the needs of workers and peasants. </p><p>  Also, before the revolution, a commission was established within the framework of the military committee, which carried out investigative, judicial and administrative functions.  During the period of revolution and the formation of Soviet power, this department carried out many arrests and executions.  The concept of "counter-revolutionary" was not legally enshrined, and any objectionable resident of the country could fall into this category. </p><p>  Another special subdivision of VRK is the press department.  This body distributed the newspaper and print media of the Bolsheviks.  Also, the print department censored and closed publications that contradicted the views of the Soviet government.  Active foreign propaganda on the radio was carried out.  This is due to the desire to foment a world revolution.  The Soviet government later abandoned this idea. </p>

    <h2>  Features of the revolutionary committee </h2><p>  The main feature of the 1917 Military Revolutionary Committee was the lack of accountability.  The VRK was disobedient to other authorities, and depended only on the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party. </p><p>  The second feature is the lack of a legislative framework that could outline the terms of reference of the All-Russian Military Revolutionary Committee.  The Bolshevik Party endowed the Revolutionary Committee with special functions, but these decisions did not have legal force. </p><p>  The armed forces owned by the revolutionary committee gave him the right to carry out any legal and unlawful actions.  Thus, this body had access to all economic facilities of the country and could acquire all the necessary benefits and means by military means. </p><h2>  WRC Results </h2><p>  In just a month of its actual functioning, the Military Revolutionary Committee achieved significant success.  Thanks to him, the very October Revolution took place, which marked the beginning of a new era in the history of Russia.  184 commissioners were appointed by the committee to various civilian institutions.  They were vested with the functions of reorganizing the state apparatus, and also had the right to carry out the arrests of counter-revolutionaries.  After November 10, 1917, part of the functions of the revolutionary committee was transferred to the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission, which fought against counter-revolution and sabotage during the establishment of Soviet power throughout the country.  On December 5, 1917, the military-industrial complex was liquidated by self-dissolution.  On this day, the era of the organ that organized the change of historical paradigms in Russia officially ended. </p>

    <h2>  Military Revolutionary Center </h2><p>  In mid-October, the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party adopted a decision on the formation of the Military Revolutionary Center as a special body within the Revolutionary Committee.  Historians of the Stalin period noted that the ARC was the main driving force behind the activities of the Military Revolutionary Committee.  However, it is worth paying attention to the peculiarity that the actual head of the World Trade Center Trotsky was not included in the activities of this center.  The main head of the unit was I. Stalin, who, after the death of Lenin, was Trotsky's main rival. </p><h2>  Naval Revolutionary Committee </h2><p>  At the same time as the military council, the naval committee launched its activities.  Its functioning is not particularly covered in historical references, but it had a significant impact on naval command during the October Revolution. </p><p>  The decision to create a VMRK was made at the II All-Russian Congress of Soviets.  The representative of the Baltic Fleet Vakhrameev was elected the head of the committee.  Lenin and Stalin, as the main party leaders, transferred to the naval committee the authority to rally the sailor masses, as well as protect the sea borders from external intervention and internal enemies. </p>
