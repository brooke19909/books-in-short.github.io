That is why the royal flush in poker and means a clear victory.  The thing is <span>that such a</span> combination of cards is very, very rare.  Diamonds are also expensive, due to the fact that you can get them relatively little.  The probability of collecting a royal flush in poker is extremely small, which is why it is valuable to the player. </p>

But losing a lot of money is easy!  Flash piano - this is one of the combinations.  The goal of poker is to collect a stronger combination of cards than your opponents.  Most people know that a flash piano is a very, very powerful combination, because it is often depicted in all kinds of pictures.  But many did not even hear about other combinations.  If you decide to seriously approach the game of poker and achieve success in it, that is, make money from it, you must first thoroughly study it.

Most likely, you also know how to arrange cards by seniority.  Just in case, we recall: a deuce is the weakest card, and an ace is the strongest.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Ten, jack, queen, king and ace of one of four suits.  The probability of collecting a royal flush leaves 0.0002%, that is, it is very small.  It is interesting that the situation when two players sitting at the same table have collected such combinations, but of different suit, is impossible in principle. </li><li>  Straight flash (five cards that belong to the same suit) is drawn much more often.  Its probability is 0.0015%.  If such a combination was collected by two players, then the winner is the one with a stronger card.  Therefore, it is sometimes said that a royal flush is one of the varieties of street flash. </li><li>  Four of a kind (four cards of the same suit) is dropped with a probability of 0.024%.  The highest square is considered a combination of four aces, and the youngest - four deuces.  It is clear that if players have two squares of different ranks, the one with the stronger cards will win.  If the square is on the table, then the winner is determined by the kicker. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="build a royal flush" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11627/219180.jpg" width="400"></div></li><li>  Full house (three plus two identical cards) the player will collect with a probability of 0.14%.  When two such combinations occur, the win is determined first by three cards, and then by the dignity of the remaining two. </li><li>  Flash (five cards of the same suit) can be collected by several players at the same time.  The winner is determined by the value of the flash card.  If they are of the same rank, then the cash prize is divided between the players. </li><li>  Straight (five consecutive cards of various suits) is dropped in 39 cases out of 10,000, that is, much more often than the aforementioned card combinations.  As in the previous case, the winner is determined by the seniority of the straight.  If they have one rank, then the money is divided between the players.  It should be noted that the ace can be both the youngest card and the oldest. </li><li>  The player will collect thrips (three identical cards) in 2 cases out of 100; </li><li>  Doper (two pairs of identical cards) is quite common; </li><li>  A pair (two identical); </li><li>  High card or kicker (unpaired card). </li></ol>
