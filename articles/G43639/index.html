The device, compared with previous models, has been significantly upgraded.  In addition to the design, the filling has also changed.  But, as Nikon representatives themselves stated, the main feature of the new model is the incredible optical zoom.  After the announcement on the Internet, a real war began.  Some claimed that zoom was an important and almost vital thing, while others believed that all this was nothing more than a <span>marketing ploy</span> in order to sell as many devices as possible.  So who is right?  You can find out the answer to this question by reading this review on the Nikon Coolpix P600. </p><h2>  Nikon </h2><p>  The first thing that comes to mind when the word "camera" is Nikon.  Over the past few years, the company has virtually monopolized the professional camera market.  Although similar products are produced by such giants as Sony, Canon, etc., but Nikon is simply out of competition.  At one time, the guys from "Nikon" tried hard and made a real revolution in the world of camera equipment.  They made huge profits and millions of loyal customers.  As a result, Nikon has gone far ahead of its competitors.  However, now everything is different.  Due to the lack of worthy opponents, the company is developing rather slowly.  Modern Nikon focuses on making money and regularly releasing new cameras that are minimally different from previous models. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  But not so long ago, the company realized that it was on a false path, that something needed to be changed, and they announced a new camera that looked pretty promising.  The company presented the <span>Nikon Coolpix P600</span> as another revolution in the world of photographic equipment.  But is this really so?  Has Nikon made another breakthrough?  Or is it all just another marketing ploy, thanks to which the company is going to fill up its wallet with money?  You will find out by reading this article. </p><h2>  <span>Nikon Coolpix P600:</span> review </h2><p>  The first thing that catches your eye is the design.  A bright, glossy cherry-colored camera rivets all the attention.  For adherents of conservatism there is a more classic black version of the apparatus.  The plastic of which the camera is made is quite durable and does not bend.  The only thing that disappoints is the build quality.  There are small backlashes, and the buttons creak a little when pressed. </p><p>  As for ergonomics, then everything is done at the highest level.  Surprisingly, a convenient handle with a rubberized overlay allows you to easily hold the camera, despite the impressive dimensions.  Also, "Nikon" is one of the few companies in which they guessed to make an eye on the lens cap and put a small nylon cable into the kit.  It seems to be a trifle, but nice. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  On the side of the lens you can see a duplicate zoom lever.  It allows you to change the distance with your left hand.  It can also be customized specifically for manual focus.  Nearby is a button, when pressed, the built-in flash rises.  Shooting modes (of which there are quite a lot) are switched by means of a mechanical drum, just like on SLR cameras.  Next to the drum is a shutter release with a zoom lever, a programmable Fn button, and power on. </p><p>  The display of the camera, which is made using special technology, is 3 inches, resolution - 921 thousand pixels.  The picture is quite bright and, most importantly, has a very clear detail.  When you change the viewing angle, the image practically does not fade.  The Nikon Coolpix P600 also has a swivel mechanism.  It allows you to choose almost any angle for a photoset, and sometimes with it you can even stabilize the camera. </p><p>  All pictures are recorded to the SD card.  A lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 1850 mAh is used as power.  This means that on a single charge, you can shoot about 400 frames.  For a compact camera, this is a very worthy result. </p><h2>  Zoom </h2>

    <p>  Well, and, perhaps, we consider the most important advantage of the Nikon Coolpix P600 - zoom.  The guys from "Nikon" really tried their best.  The range of equivalent distances can vary from 24 to 1440 millimeters.  The zoom ratio is 60x.  Thanks to this, the camera extends very far and even sees what a person with eagle eyes will not notice.  The intelligent guidance system, which focuses on the right objects, is encouraging.  Optical stabilization is also on top.  Even in very sunny weather, all frames are clear.  But at the same time it‚Äôs almost impossible to use the camera without a tripod at night.  After all, the aperture ratio of the device is relatively low. </p><h2>  Nikon Coolpix P600: professional reviews </h2>
