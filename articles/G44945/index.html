To begin with, all Armenian soldiers were disarmed, after which selective deportation of some citizens to conditions unsuitable for living began.  This was followed by mass deportation, accompanied by violence and killings. </p><p>  <strong>Genocide of the Armenian people: historical background</strong> </p><p>  Armenian settlements arose in the second century BC.  In those days, this people inhabited part of the territories of modern eastern Turkey, as well as the area near <span>Lake Van</span> and <span>Mount Ararat.</span>  It is interesting that in 301, <span>Great Armenia</span> became the first country where Christianity was recognized as the only state religion.  Faith was the impetus for the mass eviction and destruction.  But the Armenian genocide began much later. </p><p>  The country was repeatedly subjected to raids by the Ottoman troops.  And in the late 19th century, most of the Armenian people were under the rule of the Ottoman Empire.  And since the citizens of Armenia were not Muslims, they were considered second-rate members of society.  For example, soldiers were forbidden to carry weapons and testify in court, and taxes were several times higher. </p><p>  The first massacres of Armenians occurred in 1894-1986.  In the future, several more clashes of Armenian soldiers and Ottoman troops occurred, during which several thousand Armenian citizens died. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Armenian Genocide during the First World War</strong> </p><p>  In 1914, a secret agreement was signed between Turkey and Germany on changing the eastern borders of the Turkish state.  This would make it possible to lay a corridor to the Muslim population of Russia.  The creation of such a free region meant the expulsion of Armenians from the mentioned territories. </p><p>  However, in 1915, when the Ottoman Empire was drawn into World War II, Armenian citizens were called up to the front.  In the same year, after the British troops attacked the Dardanelles, it was decided to relocate the capital of the Ottoman Empire.  On the other hand, the authorities were afraid of the possible assistance of Armenians to the enemy forces.  Thus, it was decided to quickly deport all representatives of the Armenian people. </p><p>  And to this day, April 24, 1915 is considered a mourning day for the whole people.  It was on this day that the Armenian Genocide began.  In his organization, <span>Enver Pasha, Talaat Pasha</span> and Jemal Pasha are found guilty. </p><p>  Turkish rulers issued an order to collect all the Armenian intelligentsia and urgently deport.  For several months, mass arrests continued.  During this period, famous artists, writers, lawyers, entrepreneurs, musicians, doctors and other talented citizens fell victim to repression.  Those who survived were deported to the desert, where they died of hunger, heat, or by the hands of robber gangs. </p><p>  But such extermination of the Armenian people took place not only in Constantinople - soon repressions began to be actively carried out throughout the country.  Official sources report that evictions and killings continued until 1918.  On the other hand, there is evidence of cruelty towards the Armenian people in the future. </p><p>  The same groups of refugees who managed to avoid a tragic fate united in their desire for retribution.  Thus, a list of eighty people who were involved in one way or another in organizing and conducting the genocide was created.  Within three years, almost all of this list was killed by Armenian soldiers, including Enver Pasha, Shekir Bey, Dzhemal Pasha and other rulers. </p>
