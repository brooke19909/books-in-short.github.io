    <h2>  What else is worth knowing? </h2><p>  So, both hotel complexes are distinguished by a decent level of service and comfort.  Because the attention of tourists deserves both the first and second option.  And both are really popular.  Therefore, if you want to relax here in the summer, in the midst of the season, it is better to use early booking.  Firstly, there is an option to get a discount.  Secondly, it will turn out to choose the number you like, and not the remaining one. </p><p>  In the Dominican Republic, summer reigns year-round.  But only in every month is it special.  It is better not to go here in June, since it rains here often at this time.  And in July, real hell reigns here.  It is rare when the thermometer readings are pleasing with a temperature of less than 30 ¬∞ C.  And in August there is increased humidity.  Here is the best option - a trip to the Dominican Republic in the winter.  This time is the most comfortable here, as the air temperature ranges from 23 to 27 degrees. </p>
