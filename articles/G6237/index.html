    <h2>  The faster the better </h2><p>  This opinion is shared by most travelers.  As a matter of fact, Anapa - Krasnodar is not such a long route.  Between the cities there are only 160 kilometers, and this is really a trifle, given that they are in the same region.  At an <span>average speed</span> of 80 km / h, you can cover the distance in just two hours. </p><p>  This is not to say that this is a particularly beneficial way to travel.  But it all depends on how much gas a car needs per hundred and what kind of fuel the owner of his iron friend is fueling.  Suppose if a car takes 8 liters of gasoline per 100 kilometers, it will take about 13 all the way. If the fuel is cheap (30 rubles each), then the trip will take 390 rubles.  In the event that the car spends 11 liters per hundred, it will be necessary to refuel at 18. At a price of 35 rubles per liter, 630 rubles will go all the way.  So it all depends on the car and gas prices.  Although some, in order to save money, they take fellow travelers who fill the car with a chipper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Along the way </h2>

    <p>  It‚Äôs convenient to travel along the Anapa ‚Äì Krasnodar highway ‚Äî there are signs everywhere.  However, there are a lot of them, as a matter of fact, of the settlements that will need to be driven along the road.  Among them: the Tarusin farm, the village of Natukhaevskaya, the village of Verkhnebakansky, Zhemchuzhny and many other points.  It is advisable to get acquainted with the map before setting off on a journey - this will be useful.  Firstly, the driver will feel more confident while driving, and secondly, being informed once again about the details regarding the upcoming route will never hurt. </p><h2>  Map Location </h2><p>  If you decide to overcome the Anapa - Krasnodar route with your car, then you should prepare for this short trip.  Many decide to download a map for this.  This is really convenient - by the way, there are even special applications with which the system itself automatically routes the route.  It is most convenient for the driver, since the program selects the paths that require minimal time costs.  It is very comfortable to navigate on such a map, since the route in the direction of Anapa - Krasnodar is highlighted by a separate line.  The system also offers information about traffic police posts and gas stations located along the way.  <span>This information</span> will also not be superfluous. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is worth remembering that the movement along the route that was laid and thought out in advance is a guaranteed way to save yourself from possible problems that so often arise in an unfamiliar place.  Do not overlook the details. </p>

    <h2>  Shuttle Buses </h2><p>  Well, there is another way to overcome the route Krasnodar - Anapa.  Bus - it is the most popular and least expensive.  A ticket for it costs about 270 rubles.  Flights run regularly - the very first leaves from Anapa at five in the morning, and the latest at 19:00.  Buses depart every hour. </p><p>  In this way, most people overcome the route Krasnodar - Anapa.  The distance between these cities by bus can be reached in 3.5 hours.  This is slower than using your own car, but you need to remember that the minibus driver also stops in some localities where he is waiting for other passengers.  In addition, the bus has another advantage that many people care about is its price. </p><h2>  Railway transport </h2><p>  And finally, a few words about another method of overcoming the Anapa-Krasnodar route.  The train does not follow him, but still the railway message also exists.  Few get on trains.  The problem is that they do not go as regularly as regular buses.  And they go much longer.  By train, you can get from Krasnodar to the resort city in 4.5 hours.  This is an order of magnitude longer than a car or even a bus.  In addition, this is a very disadvantageous option.  If a bus ticket costs less than 300 rubles, then the minimum price for a train ride is approximately 540 rubles.  And this is a reserved seat!  Everyone knows that these tickets are sold out instantly, only coupes remain.  Moreover, there are no direct trains; by the time of arrival in Anapa, it‚Äôs impossible to sit on the parade ground exactly.  A coupe ticket costs about 1,400 rubles.  So there are very few advantages here - unless you can lie on the couch. </p>

    <p>  In general, there are several ways to overcome a given distance.  The most convenient and profitable is, of course, a trip by regular bus.  Needless to say, even some car owners (that is, those who can drive on their own), decide to buy a ticket.  This option really seems more beneficial to many.  You also don‚Äôt have to worry about getting directions. </p>
