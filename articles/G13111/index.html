Breakfast includes a standard set of products (feta, ham, tea, coffee, cucumbers, tomatoes, yogurt, olives, bread, honey, juice and cheese), while for lunch and dinner there is a greater variety on the tables (several varieties of salads, snacks and hot dishes).  In addition, guests are always offered ice cream or fruit.  Dishes are cooked daily and very tasty, so the food just does not have time to get bored. </p><p>  For those who prefer to eat outside the hotel, there are cafes nearby where you can always eat deliciously. </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  On the territory of Castro Beach Hotel 3 * (Crete) there is a bar in which guests cater.  There is a pool with a relaxation area, sun loungers and umbrellas.  The reception is open around the clock.  The keys to the safe are provided for a fee.

The complex welcomes guests from different countries.  It is located in the center of Amudara village, where within walking distance there is everything that spa people need. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Castro Hotel 3 * (Greece, Crete), like any other European hotel, does not have its own beach.  However, this is not a problem.  The coast is very close.  It has a beautiful sand cover with a gentle entry into the sea.  Sun beds and umbrellas on the beach are paid, but no one will force you to use them if you yourself do not want to.  On the beach, a red flag is often raised because the sea is not calm. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  As we have already mentioned, the hotel is located in the center of the resort village of Amoudara, not far from Heraklion.  The popularity of this place is ensured by beautiful sandy beaches, the proximity of the island's capital, good infrastructure and a wide range of hotels.  Our compatriots make up a significant portion of holidaymakers in the village. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castro beach hotel 3" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1564326.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the main street of the resort there are many small shops with souvenirs and supermarkets.  In addition, the village has taverns, cafes, restaurants, eateries and bars.  There is even a Thai restaurant.  But most of the establishments offer traditional national dishes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are no special entertainments in Amoudar.  In its central part you can only visit the cinema, playgrounds.  But on the beaches you can do almost any water sport.  Active tourists who want to see historical sites and attractions should definitely visit Heraklion and other nearby resorts. </p><h2>  Castro Beach Hotel 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to discuss the reviews about it of tourists who have already rested here.  Should I recommend vacationers Castro Hotel 3 *?  Guest reviews characterize the hotel from the best side.  It will be a great budget place to spend a vacation by the sea.  Hotels in Amoudar are not as expensive as in the capital of the island, but are located almost nearby.  In addition, the village is a quiet and fairly calm place to relax.  And you can always go have fun in more rave places.  If you are planning a family vacation with children, then as an economy option you can consider Castro Hotel 3 * (Crete).  Reviews of tourists confirm the presence of beautiful, spacious rooms with good furniture and normal repair.  All apartments are clean with no signs of shabby.  Each room has a balcony or terrace (on the ground floor). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castro beach hotel 3 o crete" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1564329.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Air conditioning is included.  Maids clean the rooms daily and very high quality.  Towels are changed almost every day, if left on the floor.  But bedding can be changed no more than once every three days.  In general, the apartments are all very clean, the atmosphere is pleasant and comfortable.  All equipment is working properly.  If breakdowns occur, then it is worth telling the receptionist on duty, and everything will be quickly repaired.  Wonderful rooms will certainly please all guests of the complex.  The apartments even have a capsule coffee machine and tea sets. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  When planning your vacation, you think through all the nuances in advance in order to take into account all the little things and not get into trouble.  The main question that always interests all tourists is food.  Of course, everyone independently chooses the most suitable option.  Active travelers are unlikely to pay full board, as they simply will not be in time for lunch.  According to hotel guests, the food in it is quite acceptable.  Some people think that morning food is scarce, but it fully fits into the concept of a European continental breakfast.  As for lunch and dinner, they are tasty and satisfying, despite the not so rich assortment as with All Inclusive, but do not forget that the hotel has only a three-star category. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castro beach hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1564338.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For those tourists who do not plan to eat in the complex, there are cafes and restaurants nearby, where you can taste delicious local dishes and fresh seafood. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel ... </h2><p>  The complex has a beautiful pool with a good seating area, however, guests still prefer the sea coast.  The nearest beach is very nice, has a fine tin sand cover.  However, the sea itself in this region, according to tourists, is very restless.  Quite rarely observed calm.  As a rule, excitement prevails at sea.  Perhaps this nuance depends on the season.  The municipal coast is very clean and well equipped, there are cafes and taverns along the coast where you can dine and take your time at the hotel.  There are not many people on the beach, there is always a free place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castro hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1564332.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The complex has a swimming pool, which is open until 22.00.  It is cleaned every night, so it can be safely used during the day. </p><p>  Not far from the village is Heraklion, which is worth a visit and admire its beauties.  This can be done by public transport.  The bus stop is located right next to the complex, and you can rent a car.  Of course, the car will allow you to quickly and comfortably explore the whole island and see its most beautiful places. </p><p>  You can rent a car even with Russian rights.  But it is better to choose full insurance, since local roads are incredibly dangerous (mountain serpentines), not every driver has sufficient experience.  The nearest rental office is right next to the hotel. </p><p>  The hotel staff deserves special attention; it is very attentive and courteous with absolutely all guests.  Here you can feel the real Cretan hospitality.  The settlement takes no more than five minutes.  If something does not suit you in the room, then you will be calmly replaced with no surcharges.  The hotel administration always makes concessions to guests.  The complex generally enjoys an atmosphere of goodwill, it is very pleasant to relax here, you really relax away from domestic problems and city bustle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castro hotel 3 greece about crete" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1564333.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel as a whole is comfortable and interesting in every way.  It has a favorable location in a quiet corner of the resort, and at the same time it is very easy to get to all key places of the island from it even without a car.  The complex is suitable not only for active travelers, but also for couples who come to improve their kids.  Beautiful warm Aegean Sea just can not help but like. </p><p>  On the roof of the hotel there is a beautiful terrace, accessible to absolutely all vacationers.  It offers beautiful views of the sea and the coast.  Tourists love to be here and take wonderful photos of a wonderful time as a keepsake. </p><p>  Good apartments, convenient location, sensitive, well-trained staff and acceptable food are not the only advantages of the hotel.  Many tourists prefer it for reasonable prices with such a good level of service.  It is far from often that you can find a decent vacation spot for little money.  That is why many vacationers again and again return to the Castro Hotel 3 * <span>(Crete).</span>  <span>Reviews</span> about him are proof of this. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Crete is a great place to relax.  It has long been popular among tourists from many countries.  The island has a sufficient number of resorts.  Here you can find quiet and cozy corners, and fun party places.
