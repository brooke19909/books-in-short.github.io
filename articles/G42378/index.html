Tourists note that it takes about five minutes to check in due to the speed of staff.  While things are included in the room, you can walk around the cozy territory. </li><li>  Blue Lagoon Resort - 5 stars.  Small, very comfortable hotel on the outskirts of the city.  The staff are polite and very executive.  The food of tourists is excellently set, and for the animation you can put a solid five.  But the approach to the sea is not the best, you have to walk on the rocks. </li><li>  Atlantis - 4 stars.  Very comfortable hotel in the resort of Lampi.  Nearby is a long and beautiful beach.  True, next to the hotel it is pebble, and the entrance to the sea is not the smallest.  Umbrellas and sunbeds are paid.

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Upon arrival, you will find out that it was here that the father of medicine Hippocrates was born.  Every year, the best doctors from around the world gather at the center named after him.  Here, on the island, an ancient plane tree grows.  Some experts claim that he is already 2,000 years old, and under him an ancient doctor taught followers.  What other attractions has Kos prepared for you: </p><ul><li>  <em>Asklepion</em> - this is the first attraction that is found by tourists on the island.  These are the ruins of a former temple and hospital.  They still look very magnificent.  It is located in a beautiful place of the island, from where a wonderful view of the sea opens. </li><li>  The castle of the Knights of St. John is a real fortress, which was built to protect against the Turks.  The island has many ancient buildings, and the castle is no exception.  Here are the tombs and altars, columns and a stone bridge.  The interior of the castle suffered, but you can still understand how the knights lived in those days. </li><li>  <em>Altar of Dionysus</em> .  It is located near the Agora.  It was not preserved in the best way.  To be more precise, it was the temple of the god of winemaking.  It was built in the form of the letter "P".  It was destroyed by an earthquake, and since no one was restoring it, it gradually became desolate.  There are few surviving fragments of walls and other structures, but they convey the beauty of the temple and the altar. </li><li>  <em>The fortress of Antimachia</em> is one of the best examples of medieval architecture.  It is located in the center of the island.  It was laid in the early Middle Ages. </li><li>  <em>Colorful mosques</em> . </li><li>  <em>Peacock forest</em> .  This is one of the most colorful attractions on the island.  In a stunning coniferous grove inhabited by hundreds of peacocks.  They live here without any restrictions and fences.  Birds walk along the fringes, spreading their luxurious tails.  They are used to the constant influx of tourists, so they calmly take food from their hands. </li></ul><p>  Experienced tourists recommend not taking excursions from the hotel.  It comes out pretty expensive.  Moreover, Kos is a very small island.  Take a bike and calmly go round beautiful places almost for free.  In addition, breathe in fresh air and recharge your batteries for the whole year ahead. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see on kos island greece reviews" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2012221.jpg" width="600"></div>
