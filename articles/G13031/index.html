  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best headphones up to 1000 rubles: review, rating and selection tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Music includes a huge number of meanings, concepts and has been with us since time immemorial.  The 20th century brought its own, and considerable adjustments to this area.  Not only a host of new musical directions saw the light, but also equipment for their reproduction. </p><p>  Along with players, smartphones, radio players and computers, headphones occupy a special place.  The latter helps to completely immerse yourself in what is happening on the screen or surrender to the music without looking back at the people rustling nearby and the noise of the city. </p><p>  On the shelves you can see a lot of such devices.  But not everyone is willing to pay for models from the premium segment.  Of course, they offer exceptional sound quality and extensive functionality.  But many consumers are looking for something simpler and cheaper.  As a price threshold for such requests, you can take a sum of 1000 rubles that is quite acceptable for most users. </p><p>  Our article will help you choose the right headphone option and not miscalculate your purchase.  In addition, to facilitate the flour of choice, we will provide a list of the most interesting models that can be found on sale. </p><h2>  Selection tips </h2><p>  If you are thinking about buying headphones worth up to 1000 rubles, you should know that any of your choice, whatever it may be, will be a compromise.  You can find a more or less optimal device only by properly prioritizing.  First of all, we will talk about portability and sound quality. </p><p>  That is, if one decreases, then the other increases.  A small speaker will never give out the volume and amazing sound experience, but the modest dimensions of such devices allow you to carry them with you anywhere and anytime. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, large headphones have a better sound and offer a more complete immersion in a song or game.  But at the same time they have a decent mass and an impressive size design.  So you will need to decide which is more important - portability or sound quality. </p><h2>  Application area </h2><p>  Just like any other device, headphones are selected to solve specific tasks and fulfill specific goals.  Here you need to clarify for yourself how and when you will use them.  The selected scenario largely determines the future form factor of the model. </p><h2>  Home and office </h2><p>  For a home or office, as a rule, they buy full-size <span>closed-</span> type <span>headphones</span> with the most comfortable fit on their heads.  This type is great for long work or listening to songs.  In addition, good soundproofing qualities will not distract you from classes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zeel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="headphone for office" class="if uuid-2914718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2914718.jpg"></div><p>  You can also try and overhead type devices, which are noticeably more compact than full-size models.  Ears do not sweat from them and they are practically not felt on the head, but noise isolation leaves much to be desired.  So they are suitable only for office workers and those who got a quiet room. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When choosing a <span>full-size headphone,</span> be sure to pay attention to the quality of the material from which the ear pads are made.  Synthetics or velor will not make your ears sweat so much, unlike natural or artificial leather. </p><h2>  Town </h2><p>  Vacuum earplugs are perfect for city walks and trips in public transport.  They are located inside the ear canal and deliver sound immediately to the destination.  In addition, such models weigh a little and are compact, which creates a minimum of problems when moving in a crowd of people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.retire.ly" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="outdoor headphones" class="if uuid-2914713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2914713.jpg"></div><p>  The ear pads of such headphones are made mainly of silicone.  The latter allows manufacturers to not limit themselves in colors and sizes.  The ear pads made of porous foam are quite popular.  They are also called anatomical.  When heated by body temperature, they take the form of an ear canal.  Products made of porous foam are less durable than their silicone counterparts, but they transmit sound with almost no distortion. </p><p>  Be sure to pay attention to the braid.  Ordinary budget wires very poorly tolerate low temperatures and break.  But a rubberized or fabric-protected cord will feel much better in extreme cold. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Games </h2><p>  The choice of headphones for gamers is striking in variety, but in most cases there is only one form factor - full-sized closed models.  A mandatory attribute of such devices is a chat microphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.themasterswitch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gaming headphones" class="if uuid-2914716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2914716.jpg"></div><p>  Another important criterion is surround sound.  Imitation of solid systems of 5.1 or even 7.1 format will be an excellent advantage in 3D battles, where you will not only hear every rustle, but also feel its direction. </p><p>  Also, you must pay attention to the length of the wire and its braid.  If an ordinary music lover can sit comfortably in an armchair, having adopted a favorite pose, and enjoy the composition, then the gamer actively works with the keyboard and moves his head.  The cord of the gaming headphones should be at least two meters long and with a reliable braid made of fabric or supple rubber. </p><p>  It will also be useful to clarify the presence of special thickenings at the plugs.  They not only eliminate kinks and kinks, but also help prevent accidental breakdown of the connector when in a rush a player jumps up and forgets that he has headphones on his head. </p><p>  Noise reduction is also an important criterion.  And this applies not only to the headphones themselves, but also to the microphone.  You cannot fully immerse yourself in the world of competitive games if you are distracted by someone or something from the outside.  The same goes for the microphone.  During communication with friends, extra sounds only interfere and do not allow you to concentrate on what was said. </p><h2>  Plug </h2><p>  A lot of consumers forget about it and with annoyance take the purchase back to the store just because the wrong plug was selected.  Well, if you bought the device somewhere around the corner, and if in an online store, then the return turns into a real headache. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digishop.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="headphone plug" class="if uuid-2914717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2914717.jpg"></div><p>  Almost all models of headphones, which are presented in computer stores and mobile phone stores, come with a standard mini-jack plug - 3.5 mm (photo above).  The usual ‚Äújack‚Äù (6.3 mm) can be seen on professional-grade equipment designed for studios and other record companies.  Micro-jack (2.5 mm) is much less common and is used for specific acoustics.  So be sure to check with the seller for the plug format. </p><p>  Next, we will consider specific models of headphones that can be safely recommended for purchase.  But, again, taking into account the above characteristics.  The main criteria for evaluating the models in our ranking were sound quality, usability, reliability of devices and consumer reviews. </p><p>  <span>Rating of the best headphones</span> worth up to 1000 rubles: </p><ol><li>  Sony MDR-EX15AP. </li><li>  Panasonic RP-HJE125. </li><li>  JBL C100SI. </li><li>  Sennheiser CX 180 Street II. </li><li>  Panasonic RP-HT161. </li><li>  Defender HN-750. </li><li>  Panasonic RP-HT010GU-H. </li></ol><p>  Consider the rating participants in more detail. </p><h2>  Sony MDR-EX15AP </h2><p>  Sony has always delighted its fans with high-quality equipment and has especially succeeded in the segment of musical devices.  Many people know the brand as a manufacturer of gadgets for the premium sector, but there are more affordable devices in the assortment, which just fall under our case. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.johnlewis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony MDR-EX15AP" class="if uuid-2914715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2914715.jpg"></div><p>  Models of the MDR-EX15AP series are the <span>best earplugs with a microphone</span> up to 1000 rubles.  Despite such an affordable price, the gadget attracts not only with high-quality performance and pleasant appearance, but also with technical characteristics along with functionality. </p><p>  The presence of a remote control and a microphone greatly expands the capabilities of the device.  With their help, you can answer incoming calls and switch tracks in the player.  So, among other things, the model can be safely called the best headphones up to 1000 rubles for a phone. </p><p>  Moreover, the device has excellent ergonomics.  It weighs quite a bit (only 3 grams) and fits perfectly into the auricles.  There is no discomfort even after prolonged use. </p><p>  But <span>the best headphones</span> for 1000 rubles have their drawbacks.  Some owners, despite a decent frequency range (from 10 to 25,000 Hz), complain about not deep enough and not fully revealed bass in some especially ‚Äúheavy‚Äù compositions. </p><p>  Also, users note that the cable instantly dubs at minus temperatures (less than -10 degrees), so in winter they have to be wrapped or hidden under warm covers.  There are no complaints about the rest of the operating characteristics, and here we have really the best earphones-earplugs up to 1000 rubles from a well-known brand. </p><h2>  Panasonic RP-HJE125 </h2><p>  Another representative of the Land of the Rising Sun.  Unlike Sony, Panasonic brand devices are more widely represented in the budget segment.  The RP-HJE125 model can easily be called the best vacuum headphones up to 1000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.7dayshop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic RP-HJE125" class="if uuid-2914714" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2914714.jpg"></div><p>  Maybe they do not look as attractive in visual terms as the leader of our rating, but the technical characteristics of the device are impressive, even despite the low cost.  The model copes with bass very well and perfectly reproduces the mid frequencies, without overwhelming the upper ones.  The sensitivity range of the model is impressive - from 10 to 24 000 Hz. </p><p>  The owners also have no complaints about the build quality.  No gaps on the case or backlash were noticed.  All parts of the structure are well fitted to each other and do not go.  Moreover, the model received good sound insulation and an L-shaped plug.  So many users believe that these are the best headphones up to 1000 rubles for games and the street. </p><p>  True, there may be some problems with the latter if the temperature outside is below -10 degrees.  As in the case of the device from Sony, the cable dubs in the cold and is prone to breakage.  Headphones need to be wrapped up and somehow protected from low temperatures.  In all other respects, these are really the best vacuum headphones up to 1000 rubles from the Japanese brand. </p><h2>  JBL C100SI </h2><p>  A model from a well-known manufacturer immediately catches the eye and attracts with its aggressive and at the same time attractive appearance.  The device rightfully takes the third place in our rating of the best headphones up to 1000 rubles and offers the owner not only the original exterior, but also a very good technical part. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dealclear.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="JBL C100SI" class="if uuid-2914723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2914723.jpg"></div><p>  Reproduce the model quite acceptable for vacuum devices frequencies - from 20 to 20 000 Hz with an impedance of 16 ohms.  Due to such decent resistance, the best in-ear headphones up to 1000 rubles are great for both mobile gadgets and a computer. </p><p>  The weak point of any liners and plugs has always been low frequencies.  Here, designers increased the diameter of the membrane to 9 mm, as a result of which, the model produces very good bass.  The best headphones up to 1000 rubles are pleasing with a clean, detailed and beautiful sound.  Of course, there is no ‚Äúvelvetiness‚Äù inherent in expensive models, but this effect can also be achieved if the tracks are passed through the equalizer filters.  With the help of the latter, the model is able to organize such a sound supply, but it will be necessary to make a lot of effort. </p><p>  But the best headphones up to 1000 rubles have their drawbacks.  Some owners complain about ear pads.  They become unusable too quickly.  They are easy to change and they are inexpensive, but the two previous participants are doing much better with this.  Well, the notorious cable, again, does not tolerate low sub-zero temperatures.  Owners have no complaints about the assembly: all elements are tightly planted and do not go. </p><h2>  Sennheiser CX 180 Street II </h2><p>  This brand can safely be called a legend when it comes to music devices.  Premium equipment from this manufacturer is respected throughout the world and is in demand by professionals.  Devices for the budget segment are a rarity for the company, but we have just such a pleasant exception - the best earbuds in-ear up to 1000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flipkart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sennheiser CX 180 Street II" class="if uuid-2914719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2914719.jpg"></div><p>  Separately, it is worth noting the ergonomic part of the model.  Both earbuds are compact, conveniently located in the auricles, weigh very little and are not felt.  A well-thought-out V-shaped insert divides the cable into two parts.  This protects the wire under loads and prevents gusts.  The cable length is enough for working with smartphones and tablets, and for laptops with personal computers. </p><p>  The frequency spread of the model is from 20 to 20,000 Hz with a resistance of 16 ohms.  The best in-ear headphones up to 1000 rubles give an excellent sound.  Especially pleased bass parts.  Some owners were not very happy with the quality of the high-frequency reproduction, but this applies for the most part to classical works, where the violin or clarinet is pronounced, and jazz, where the saxophone solo. </p><p>  The assembly of the model is at the proper level for the brand, that is, very high quality.  In addition, unlike other participants in our review of the best headphones up to 1000 rubles, the Sennheiser CX 180 Street II wire is rubberized and can tolerate excesses, as well as low temperatures.  The manufacturer provides a two-year warranty on his device, which is also good news. </p><p>  The gadget turned out to be qualitative in many respects, but it did not get into the top three leaders in the best headphone models up to 1000 rubles just because it has problems with high frequencies.  But those who listen to pop music, rock, techno and other similar directions can turn a blind eye to this shortcoming. </p><h2>  Panasonic RP-HT161 </h2><p>  Another representative of the Japanese brand, but with a full-sized device of a closed type.  The model can be safely called the best gaming headphones up to 1000 rubles.  Thanks to its form factor, it reliably isolates the user from extraneous noise, helping to completely immerse themselves in the world of music or games. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic RP-HT161" class="if uuid-2914722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2914722.jpg"></div><p>  The model pleases with its ergonomics.  The wide frame is divided into a couple of bands, which contributes to the reliable holding of the device on the head and prevents its creep, even during the active actions that fill the gamer's everyday life.  They are very convenient not only to play and listen to music, but also to watch movies without disturbing others, while also completely immersing themselves in the atmosphere of what is happening on the screen. </p><p>  The best <span>gaming headphones</span> up to 1000 rubles have a very good frequency range - from 10 to 27,000 Hz with a resistance of 32 ohms.  The latter indicator allows you to connect them to powerful audio systems.  Headphones sound very good, well withstanding both low and high midrange frequencies.  A two-meter wire involves working with both mobile devices and a personal computer. </p><p>  Build quality at a decent level.  Details do not go and sit tight in their places.  True, some owners complain about dermatin, which over time clings to the lining.  In this case, high-quality velor, synthetics or even leather saves, but you already need to apply for it in the mid-price or premium segment, but they will not fit the category of ‚Äúbest headphones up to 1000 rubles‚Äù. </p><h2>  Defender HN-750 </h2><p>  This is a universal option that allows you to play games, work, and listen to high-quality music.  The best headphones up to 1000 rubles (photo below) have a very worthy technical part and please with a very good sound. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alzashop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Defender HN-750" class="if uuid-2914721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2914721.jpg"></div><p>  The microphone is placed behind the structure on a metal rod and does not hang like on the liners under the chin.  This solution allows you to place it almost anything to achieve good user audibility. </p><p>  The ear pads are oval in shape and completely cover the auricles, which allows you to completely isolate yourself from the outside world and immerse yourself in the world of music, films and games.  There is a volume control on the wire, so you can adjust voice chat without involving programs and the operating system. </p><p>  The model received a good range of frequencies - from 18 to 20,000 Hz, where the bass is felt in full.  Upper case is a bit overwhelming, but this is only in some classic compositions.  Other tracks best headphones up to 1000 rubles reproduce, as it should. </p><p> A plus and at the same time a minus is the complete isolation of the auricles.  Sitting in them for more than one and a half to two hours is very difficult.  Ears sweat and numb.  The feeling of discomfort makes you periodically throw off your headphones around your neck and give your head a rest.  Moreover, rarely, but still there is a marriage in stores where only one speaker works.  So before buying, you must necessarily check the model. </p><h2>  Panasonic RP-HT010GU-H </h2><p>  And again, a well-known regular in the budget segment with an invoice model.  The device received a direct ‚Äúnickel‚Äù with a large speaker.  A gray and also pretty edging is crowned with a silver inscription indicating the brand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flipkart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic RP-HT010GU-H" class="if uuid-2914724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2914724.jpg"></div><p>  Foam pads fit over pads made of high-quality and pleasant to the touch material.  Adjusting the position of the headphones is done using walking on several teeth of the staff. </p><p>  The frequency range should be enough to play any music - from 16 to 22 000 Hz with a resistance of 24 ohms.  The impedance index allows you to connect the model not only to mobile devices, but also to medium-power music centers. </p><p>  The sound is quality.  Low frequencies do not hum and have sufficient depth.  Upper case with lower case did not disappoint either.  Headphones do not overwhelm bowed instruments and adequately show themselves while listening to classical compositions. </p><p>  Despite the high-quality sound, the model has a number of disadvantages that not everyone can put up with.  The owners have many questions about the mount, which often goes astray and does not hold the selected level, as well as sound insulation.  If you use the model in a quiet room, then there should not be any problems.  But the headphones are not suitable for the street or noisy rooms, because because of the lack of sensible soundproofing, there will be no complete immersion in your favorite pastime. </p>
