The opinions of Russians regarding their stay at this five-star hotel are mostly unanimous.  This hotel meets all expectations, and especially if we consider living in it in terms of cost per tour and the quality of the service offered.  The declared category "Holiday Park Resort" for most points is fully consistent. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the food in it is offered high-quality and always fresh.  According to the majority of Russians vacationing here, there is practically nothing to complain about in the matter of food at the hotel. </p><p>  Customers leave a lot of positive words after arriving home and about the staff, which, according to them, always looks neat and tidy.  The friendliness and friendliness of young people working at the registration desk, the agility of the waiters, the honesty of the maids - all these qualities are captivating.  And the amazing ability of the staff to quickly solve any, even the most unexpected problems, is sometimes amazing. </p><p>  Settlement takes place quite quickly, without unnecessary delays.  If there is a free number in fifteen minutes, all documents are filled out and an electronic key to the number is issued. </p><p>  A lot of enthusiastic reviews about the cleanliness of the sea.  Even at a depth of four meters, the water in the Mediterranean is so clear that shells and starfish are visible from the side of a boat or yacht at the bottom. </p><p>  The only minus of this five-star hotel, most Russians resting here calls the beach, or rather, the entrance to the sea, which without the presence of rubber special shoes is inconvenient.  But many solve this problem with the help of a wooden pier located on the coastal zone of a neighboring hotel, from which you can go down the stairs relatively calmly to the sea, but this option is dangerous for young children.  Many vacationers prefer to lie on sun loungers and swim in the pool instead of going to the beach. </p><p>  Tourists also leave many positive reviews about the rooms.  Comfortable furniture, everything you need for a comfortable stay, fast Internet, high-quality cleaning, funny figures of towels that make maids even without any tips - all this completely suits travelers. </p><p>  The location of the hotel is convenient: in a few minutes you can walk slowly to the beach, and get to Alanya from the stop located at the gate, where comfortable shuttles leave every half hour.  The price of a one-way trip is about one dollar.  Our compatriots are satisfied with the contingent of residents.  Many of them want to spend more than one vacation at this hotel. </p>
