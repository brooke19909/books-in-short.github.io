How does it affect world civilization?  What is the role of science in modern society?  What do new scientific discoveries give <span>modern man</span> ?  The search for answers to these questions all the time accompanied the formation and development of modern science and became urgent for understanding both its very essence and civilization, within the framework of which a scientific approach to the world became a real opportunity.  At the present stage of life, these issues have acquired a new urgency and relevance.  First of all, they relate to the situation in which the current society is. </p><p>  Today in the world the informational stage of development has begun.  Universal computerization has made it possible to use digital technology in many areas of life.  Their application requires new knowledge, skills and abilities, the acquisition of which should be provided by modern science. </p>

    <p>  The impact of science on social life </p><p>  It is impossible to overestimate the role of science in modern society, because today it has a huge impact on many areas of human life and activity.  There is no doubt that all the indicators of the development of society ‚Äî economic, cultural, and educational ‚Äî depend on the degree of development of science. </p><p>  The past century has brought technological, economic and social changes to people's lives.  And today, evaluating the role of science in the modern world, we can conclude that at the following stages of human development the following main directions will form its life: computer science, genetics, ecology, energy, studying the <span>capabilities of the human brain,</span> materials science. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The development of science and the solution of environmental problems </p><p>  Particularly important is the role of science in the modern world as a social force that helps to solve urgent important problems of our time.  These, in particular, include the ecological state of the planet.  Rapid scientific and technological progress, introducing qualitatively new changes into human life, leads to a significant reduction in the planet‚Äôs resources and environmental pollution.  Therefore, science is becoming one of the causes of irreparable loss and irreversible changes in the environment in which humanity lives.  Scientific evidence plays a major role in assessing the extent of environmental threats. </p>

    <p>  The influence of science on modern culture </p><p>  The increasing role of science in modern society every year has led to the emergence of its special status in culture and new types of interaction with many layers of social consciousness.  Therefore, the problem arose of the correlation of the features of scientific knowledge with other types of activity leading to knowledge - ordinary consciousness, art. </p><p>  This philosophical problem has great practical significance.  Awareness of the <span>features of science</span> is an important prerequisite for the use of scientific methods in the management of cultural processes.  This comprehension is also necessary for the development of laws that help manage science itself in the conditions of rapid technological progress, because to study the features of scientific knowledge it is necessary to analyze its social conditioning, as well as its interaction with different spheres of culture, both material and spiritual.  In this regard, the role of science in society will constantly increase. </p>

    <p>  What role does science play in modern education </p><p>  With the help of scientific knowledge, man comprehends the world.  The big role of science in modern society also lies in the fact that it is impossible to manage it without certain knowledge.  Scientific knowledge has led to changes in the social structure of society: a greater number of people engaged in mental work have appeared, and the number of those engaged in unskilled labor has decreased.  Science affects a person directly through education. </p><p>  When determining the role of science in society, attention should be paid to the relationship between the scientist and his research with humanity, the level of social responsibility of scientists.  The problem is that new inventions are not turned against man.  It is necessary to abandon the principles of freedom of scientific research, which are not limited by anything.  Scientific research should be for the benefit of man, and not to the detriment of him.  Modern science must feel its ethical responsibility for the future of the entire planet. </p>
