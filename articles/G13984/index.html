This place has various "star" hotels, where you can stay for a while.  A good option would be the Caribbean World Resort Borj Cedria.  In some descriptions, it is declared as a 3-star hotel.  In others, it is assigned 4 *.  This is not so important, since there is only one hotel complex with the same name, and it cannot be confused with anything else.  Well, it‚Äôs worth talking about the features and advantages of this hotel and paying attention to reviews that will help to understand why it is popular among tourists. </p>

    <h2>  restaurants and bars </h2><p>  At the Caribbean World Resort Borj Cedria, pictured above, there are several places where you can satisfy your hunger.  The first restaurant is called L'HACIENDA.  It serves a variety of dishes - both cold and hot.  The cuisine is international and Tunisian.  There is a terrace.  A wide selection of drinks is provided - from soda to local beer, wines and liquors.  But they are paid separately. </p><p>  The schedule is as follows - European breakfasts begin at 7:00, and end at 10:00.  Continental runs from 10:00 to 11:00.  Lunch starts at 12:30, and ends at 14:30, and dinner lasts from 19:00 to 21:30. </p><p>  There is also a restaurant LES ALIZEES.  But it works only in the summer period - from June 1 to September 15.  In this establishment, drinks are included in the price of the paid type of food.  The work schedule is the same.  But here they serve not according to the menu, but according to the "buffet" system. </p><p>  Also on the territory of the Caribbean World Resort Borj Cedria 3 * (Tunisia) there are four themed restaurants, in each of which you need to reserve a table if you want to have dinner there.  At one, Indian dishes are served.  The other serves Chinese delights.  The third restaurant specializes in Mexican cuisine.  And the fourth offers visitors Italian dishes. </p><p>  In addition to the above, Caribbean World Resort Borj Cedria (Tunisia) has several bars.

    <h2>  Guests on Nutrition </h2><p>  Separate attention I would like to note the reviews left about the restaurants of the Caribbean World Resort Borj Cedria hotel.  People say that food is tasty and varied, but to some it seems specific.  In Tunisia they like to cook fatty, fried, with all kinds of spices.  But you can find diet food - fresh and stewed vegetables, fruits, side dishes.  It also serves sweets and pastries in a variety.  Pizza, hamburgers, omelettes and many other dishes are prepared at guests, so you can verify the freshness of food yourself. </p><p>  Out of the unusual, curd cheese, cold cuts, magnificent omelettes, delicious halva and soft croissants (a large choice - filling for every taste and color), mussels, oysters and even camel grilled on a fire are noted for their attention.  Alcohol is also high-quality, undiluted.  You won‚Äôt be able to stay hungry - the guests assure us that you can take whatever is pleasing to your soul in any quantities.  By the way, in the evening they make a good hookah. </p><p>  By the way, there is a market and a supermarket nearby, with quite reasonable prices and a wide range of products. </p><h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  Hotel Caribbean World Resort Borj Cedria reviews are getting pretty good.  In many of them, guests talk in detail about the rooms.  Well, it‚Äôs worth touching them too. </p><p>  The hotel has a total of 270 rooms.  All of them have the same living area (26 sq. M.) And design.  The amenities are identical too.  The apartments are furnished with everything you need - comfortable beds, TVs, telephones, air conditioning.  Each room also has a spacious furnished balcony and a bathroom with a toilet. </p><p>  The apartments are designed for two, three and four guests.  Those rooms that accommodate two guests have a large king-size bed.  Although, if this option does not suit them, they may be offered a room with two separate beds. </p><p>  The apartment, designed for three people, has a large bed for 2 guests, and one standard for the third guest.  Approximately the same situation prevails in those rooms where usually four tourists occupy.  There is one king-size bed and two standard beds. </p><p>  By the way, many apartments are made in the style of maisonettes, which pleases people who came to rest with the company.  These are rooms, the "upper" space of which has been successfully implemented, the construction of a second level, to which a staircase leads from the first.  There is a second bedroom.  That is, the area, in fact, is 26 square meters.  m, but much more useful space is obtained.  And for each guest there is a secluded corner. </p><p>  By the way, apartment prices are very low in the Caribbean World Resort Borj Cedria.  Reviews confirm this.  On average, 1,500 rubles per person per day.  And then, this is not even a fixed cost - it can vary, depending on the season. </p>

    <h2>  Impressions of tourists about the rest </h2><p>  People staying at the Caribbean World Resort Borj Cedria 3 * have different reviews.  Many of them are positive. </p><p>  Attention is noted by the polite and helpful staff.  If the guest does not like the room, they will change it right away, and for free.  They can even optionally set up a Russian-language channel on the TV.  They clean well and thoroughly, changing linen with a towel and replenishing supplies of bath accessories.  Tip, by the way, no one requires.  As in bars with restaurants.  The staff there is also excellent - the waiters serve quickly, without forcing customers to wait a long time for their order.  And the buffet dishes are replenished until the end of the meal. </p><p>  Many more talk about the hotel.  She is beautiful and big.  And also well-groomed.  The order here is carefully monitored. </p><p>  The beach near the hotel is good, clean, there are plenty of sun loungers even in high season.  Experienced tourists are advised to take their towels with them, since here they are issued only on bail. </p><p>  The entertainment program is also noted for attention.  As the reviews of 2016 of the Caribbean World Resort Borj Cedria assure, the animators try from morning to evening.  Everything is interesting, but unobtrusive.  If someone is worried about silence, then in vain - the sound insulation in the apartments is good, so the noise of fun will not interfere with a relaxing holiday. </p>

    <h2>  What else is worth knowing </h2><p>  Many people who have already rested here often compare the level of the hotel, and Tunisia itself with Egypt.  One of the fundamental differences is that here you can swim in the sea at night.  And the beaches, like the whole surrounding area, are under the supervision of a guard, which is very pleasant to realize. </p><p>  Some complain in reviews that the restaurant serving the buffet system at the height of the season is not enough plates and cups.  So that this problem does not cause inconvenience, you can just come closer to the end of the meal.  Then there are fewer queues, and there are dishes.  Many still do not like the lack of refrigerators in the apartments.  But the hotel has 3 meals a day and a bar, so that, in fact, it is not needed. </p><p>  On the territory, most of which is blooming greens and ponds, frogs appear at night.  However, they are not visible - only heard. </p><p>  The most important thing that most people go to Tunisia for is the sea.  It is clean and transparent, with comfortable approaches.  But not very deep.  About 160 centimeters is up to buoys.  If you swim for them, then the depth begins. </p><p>  In their comments, tourists often give advice to those who are just going to go here.  So, you need to think in advance where to hide the room key, since it is very weighty.  You also need to take with you funds from mosquitoes and cream from / after tanning.  The ointment from burns will also not be superfluous, since real hell reigns in Tunisia.  And sneakers will not hurt - especially for lovers of morning runs on the coastal strip. </p><p>  It is still not worth changing too much money, since currency cannot be taken out of the country (with the exception of coins).  And it‚Äôs better to spend everything to the airport, as there are extremely poor choices and high prices in stores.  Excluding souvenirs.  They are in sufficient quantities at the airport, and even cheaper than in the city. </p><p>  In general, to summarize, we can confidently say that the Caribbean World Resort will be an excellent hotel complex for people who dream of a budget, but full of impressions holiday in Tunisia. </p>
