    <p>  In summer, there are many tents in the vicinity of the lake.  They are installed in various corners, especially occupied areas near places for swimming.  It can be noted that there are practically no convenient sandy free beaches. </p><h2>  Rest on the lake </h2><p>  As already mentioned, many people prefer camping.  But at the same time, numerous holiday homes are also not empty.  Among these places there are affordable, comfortable and at the same time inexpensive bases. </p><p>  Lake Akakul is also rich in children's camps that have access to the lake and the forest.  The territory is equipped for a fun and active holiday, so children love to come here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="base of lake Akakul" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1070372.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are parking for cars.  If a person lives in his tent, you can go to the equipped beach for an additional fee.  In addition, in some places it is possible to rent a boat or catamaran. </p><p>  Holidays on Lake Akakul will not seem dull, because there are restaurants, cafes and bars.  Delicious dinners are served here, which allows you to completely escape from all household chores and not fuss over the stove.  If it is necessary to mark an important event, cafes and restaurants offer their services.  When visiting Akakul, you don‚Äôt have to worry about your safety, since each boarding house has its own rescue service, which carefully watches what is happening on the water. </p><p>  Any base on Lake Akakul offers decent comfortable rooms that can be rented for several days or even for a day. </p><p>  Fishing enthusiasts will not be bored either, as pike, bream, perch, tench, mackerel, whitefish, roach and other fish are found in the lake.  But still it is believed that Akakul is more suitable for swimming and relaxing than for fishing.  To catch a fish, many go to neighboring lakes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="base on lake Akakul" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1070375.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The delights of winter relaxation on the lake </h2><p>  Akakul Lake welcomes guests both in summer and winter.  At this time, mini-hotels and pensions are no less happy with visitors and assure them that they will not be bored.  Here you can rent snowmobiles, sleds or skis and ride plenty.  After such an active holiday, you should definitely visit a Russian bath with birch brooms. </p><p>  Many, arriving in the winter, combine rest with fishing.  Even at this time of the year, no one is left without a catch. </p><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  Many families come to the lake with children.  Almost every recreation center has places for children on its territory.  It can be sports and entertainment towns or game rooms with many toys.  Some motels regularly organize events for children with contests and prizes. </p><h2>  Akakul Lake: vacationers reviews </h2><p>  Given the favorable features of the lake, many more than once came here to rest and managed to make their impression.  Almost everyone admires the lake.  It is unusual because it is decorated with islets with trees.  There are also picturesque beaches that can abruptly break off.  But still there are a lot of bases, camps, boarding houses and sanatoriums with their gently sloping beaches cleared of algae. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akakul lake reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1070371.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In summer, you can find blueberries and lingonberries in the forest, and there are also mushrooms.  But the reviews of many show that in recent years, due to the influx of uncultured campers living in tents, the free coastal zone is full of garbage.  Therefore, those who have fallen in love with Akakul try to settle in a recreation center where the owners make sure that their territory remains well-groomed and clean. </p><p>  In addition, many fishermen say that the catch is not rich, therefore, when coming here with the aim of catching fish, you must definitely choose the right time so as not to be wasted for several hours. </p>
