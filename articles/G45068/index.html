Its main advantage is a long time without charging.  It can function even under the lowest temperatures.  Due to its ability to save energy, a lithium battery is superior to other types.  That is why their production is increasing every year.  They can be of two forms: cylindrical and prismatic. </p><h2>  Application </h2><p>  They are widely used in computer technology, mobile phones and other equipment.  Lithium battery chargers have an operating voltage of 4 V. The most important advantage is operation at a wide temperature range, which are in the range from -20 °  to +60 ° .  Today, there are batteries that can operate at temperatures below -30 ° C.  Every year, developers are trying to increase both the positive and negative temperature range. </p><p>  At first, the lithium battery loses about 5% of its capacity, and this figure increases with each passing month.  This indicator is better than that of other representatives of the batteries.  Depending on the charging voltage, they can last from 500 to 1000 cycles. </p><h2>  Types of Lithium Batteries </h2><p>  There are such types of lithium batteries that are found in various areas of household and industrial economy: </p><ul><li>  lithium-ion - for the main or backup power supply, transport, power tools; </li><li>  nickel-salt - road and rail; </li><li>  nickel-cadmium - shipbuilding and aircraft manufacturing; </li><li>  iron-nickel - power supply; </li><li>  nickel-hydrogen - space; </li><li>  nickel-zinc - cameras; </li><li>  silver-zinc - the military industry, etc. </li></ul><p>  The main type are lithium-ion batteries.  They are used in the areas of power supply, production of power tools, telephones, etc. Batteries can operate at temperatures from -20 º to +40 º, but developments are underway to increase these ranges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lithium battery" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1163127.jpg" width="600"></div>  With a voltage of only 4 V, a sufficient amount of specific heat is released.

It is changed by replacing graphite or by adding special substances to it. </p><h2>  Lithium batteries: device </h2><p>  As a rule, such devices are produced in a prismatic shape, but there are also models in a cylindrical case.  The inside consists of electrodes or separators.  For the manufacture of the body using steel or aluminum.  The contacts are displayed on the battery cover, and they must be insulated.  <span>Batteries,</span> prismatic <span>lithium</span> batteries contain a certain number of plates.  They are stacked on top of each other.  To provide additional security, the lithium battery has a special device.  It is located inside and serves to control the work process. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lithium battery chargers" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1163128.jpg" width="465"></div>  In case of dangerous situations, the device turns off the battery.  In addition, the equipment is provided with external protection.  The case is absolutely tight, so there is no leakage of electrolyte, as well as water ingress.  The electric charge appears due to lithium ions, which interact with the crystal lattice of other elements.

    <h2>  Lithium battery screwdriver </h2><p>  Three types of batteries can be installed in it, which differ in their cathode composition: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  cobalt lithium; </li><li>  lithium ferrophosphate; </li><li>  lithium manganese. </li></ul><p>  A screwdriver with a lithium battery differs from other <span>types of batteries with a</span> low level of self-discharge.  Another major benefit is maintenance-free.  If the lithium battery breaks down, it can be thrown away, as it does not harm humans and the environment.  The only negative is the low charge of lithium batteries, as well as high safety requirements.  It is difficult to charge it at low temperatures. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  It depends on the technical characteristics of the work of the screwdriver, the state of its power, the time of possible functioning.  Among the remaining technical indicators, there are: </p><ul><li>  the voltage of one battery in the device can be in the range from 3 to 5 V; </li><li>  the indicator of maximum energy consumption reaches 400 Wh-l / l; </li><li>  loss of own charge by 5%, and over time by 20%; </li><li>  integrated charging mode; </li><li>  a full battery charge takes 2 hours; </li><li>  resistance from 5 to 15 mOhm / Ah; </li><li>  the number of cycles - 1000 times; </li><li>  service life - from 3 to 5 years; </li><li>  use of different types of current at certain capacities of the battery, for example, a capacity of 65 º - direct current is used. </li></ul><h2>  Production </h2><p>  Most manufacturers strive to make electric tools more sophisticated and up-to-date. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lithium battery charging" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1163129.jpg" width="450"></div>  To do this, it is necessary to provide good batteries in the design.  The most popular manufacturing companies are:

    <ol><li>  Firm Bosh.  The lithium battery is manufactured using the new ECP technology.  It is she who controls the discharge of the device.  Another useful property is protection against overheating.  At high power, a special device lowers the temperature.  The battery design has openings that serve as ventilation and cool the battery.  Another technology is Charge, thanks to which charging is much faster.  Bosh also produces batteries for a variety of electric tools.  Many users leave good reviews about this company. </li><li>  Makita company.  It produces its own microcircuits that control all the operating indicators and processes in the battery, for example, temperature, charge content.  Thanks to this, you can choose the charging mode and the time of its holding.  Such microcircuits increase the operating life.  Batteries are manufactured with a sufficiently powerful case, so they are not subjected to mechanical stress. </li><li>  Hitachi company.  Thanks to its latest technology, the weight and dimensions of the battery are reduced.  That is why an electric tool becomes light and mobile. </li></ol><h2>  Operational Features </h2><p>  When using a battery, you must adhere to the following rules: </p><ol><li>  No need to use a lithium battery for individual unprotected items, and buy cheap Chinese parts.  Such a device will not be safe, since there will be no system that protects against short circuits and elevated temperatures.  That is, with significant overheating, the battery may explode, and its service life will be much shorter. </li><li>  Do not heat the battery.  As the temperature inside the device rises, the pressure rises.  These actions will lead to an explosion.  Therefore, you do not need to open the top cover of the battery and place it in places exposed to sunlight.  Such actions will shorten the useful life. </li><li>  Do not bring to the contacts located at the top of the cover, additional sources of electricity, as a short circuit may occur.  Built-in protection systems will not always help in this matter. </li><li>  It is necessary to charge the battery in compliance with all the rules.  When charging, use <span>chargers</span> that evenly distribute current. </li><li>  The battery charging procedure is carried out at a positive temperature. </li><li>  If there is a need to connect several lithium batteries, then you need to use models of the same manufacturer, and similar in technical characteristics. </li><li>  Store lithium batteries in a dry place that is not exposed to sunlight with a temperature of more than 5 º.  When the equipment is exposed to high temperatures, the charge will decrease.  Before storage in the winter season, the battery is charged at 50% of its capacity.  Make sure that the battery is not completely discharged.  If this happens, urgently charge it.  If mechanical damage occurs on the case, as well as signs of rust, the device must not be used. </li><li>  If during operation there is a significant overheating of the battery, the appearance of smoke, then you should immediately stop using it.  After that, move the damaged device to a safe place.  If a substance is released from the body, then it must be prevented from getting on the skin or other organs. </li><li>  It is forbidden to throw out and burn lithium batteries.  Their disposal occurs during mechanical damage to the case, explosions or ingress of water or steam. </li></ol><h2>  About a fire </h2><p>  If a lithium battery ignites, then it must not be extinguished with water and a fire extinguisher - carbon dioxide and water can react with lithium.  To extinguish it, <span>powder fire extinguishers,</span> sand, salt, and a thick cloth should be used. </p><h2>  Charging process </h2><p>  The lithium battery, the charger from which is connected to direct current, is charged at a voltage of 5 V or more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lithium battery device" class="if" height="251" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1163133.jpg" width="368"></div>  Moreover, there is a minus - they are unstable to overcharge.  An increase in temperature inside the case leads to damage. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lithium battery charger" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1163130.jpg" width="485"></div>  The instruction manual indicates a special level.  When it is reached, it should be charged.  If you increase the voltage during charging, the properties of the lithium battery will decrease significantly.

    <p>  As mentioned earlier, <span>the</span> battery life is 3 years.  To maintain this period, it is necessary to adhere to the operating conditions, charging and storage.  In addition, they must be constantly functioning, not stored. </p><h2>  Overcharge </h2><p>  The design of the battery provides a recharge system, so the charger can not be turned off and not be afraid that the composition inside will boil, as happens with car batteries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rechargeable batteries lithium batteries" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1163131.jpg" width="500"></div>  If the equipment will be stored for more than one month, it must be completely discharged.  This will significantly extend the service life.

    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The price of a lithium-ion battery depends on capacity and specifications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lithium battery screwdriver" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1163132.jpg" width="600"></div>  On average, it ranges from 100 to 500 rubles.  Despite this cost, many users leave positive feedback.  Among the positive aspects, there is a wide range of operating temperatures, high power and the ability to work for more than 1000 cycles (about 3 years of intensive use).  Devices are widely used in various fields, so everyone can appreciate their benefit.
