    <p>  For the first time the title ‚ÄúCity of Military Glory‚Äù was awarded to Kursk, Oryol, Belgorod.  The certificates were handed directly to the heads of administrations.  It happened in 2007, namely on May 7. </p><p>  After some time, namely on November 7, the president read out a new order, which said about the assignment of the title "City of Military Glory" to several more places.  In the Catherine‚Äôs Hall, the necessary letters were presented to the mayors.  We are talking about cities such as Vladikavkaz, Yelnya, Yelets, Malgobek and Rzhev. </p><p>  Two years later, at the beginning of September, the first commemorative stele was opened.  It received the corresponding name - "City of Military Glory."  The opening took place in the city of Dmitrov in the Moscow region. </p><p>  In March 25, 2010, decrees were signed on conferring the honorary title on such cities as Volokolamsk, Nalchik, Bryansk, Rostov-on-Don, Vyborg.  After some time, namely on November 4, this title was received by Vladivostok, Tikhvin, Tver. </p>
