    <h2>  Watch devices </h2><p>  The GSM tracker watch is not a novelty and has long been in great demand.  If you believe the experts, then the accuracy of determining their coordinates is low.  Also, the problem of devices lies in small batteries.  When discharged, the chipsets are not able to continue to work offline.  Transmitters for models of this type are used at different frequencies.  Many models are capable of working on the PP20 and PP30 channels. </p><p>  Moisture protection systems are used in different classes.  Modern modifications are made with the "Vector" system.  First of all, it will allow you to update maps.  At the same time, communication with the module is continuously checked.  It is also worth noting that the "Vector" system greatly helps when using weak batteries.  There is a high-quality model in our time about 10 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Options for children </h2><p>  GSM-tracker for children is very popular.  The transmitters of the modifications are mainly designed for 20 Hz.  They are able to work in manual and autonomous mode.  Many modifications are made with contact chipsets.  They have little memory.  Batteries are mainly used for low power.  The newsletter feature is very useful.  Also on the market are models with channel antennas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  They work from a linear type adapter.  The signal conductivity from the tower is quite high.  The operating humidity of this type of tracker does not exceed 40%.  Route detection is rare.  There is a good tracker for a child in the region of 8 thousand rubles. </p>
