Whereas previously bank accounts were opened for the purpose of accumulating and making profit in the form of accrued interest, now the services of banks are mainly servicing plastic cards, which are a convenient means of payment. </p><h2>  How to put money on someone else's Sberbank card: instructions </h2><p>  The largest bank in Russia - Sberbank - offers a large number of cards used by the population for settlements, as well as receiving social payments or wages.  Sberbank credit cards and debit cards with various bonus programs are very popular.  Therefore, the services of this particular bank are especially popular.  And to have a card issued by him, if not mandatory, then a very desirable condition. </p><p>  From all this it follows that it is extremely necessary to know how to put money on someone else's Sberbank card.  After all, it is not known what can happen: you need financial assistance to a friend or you want to send a cash gift to a relative, decide to lend a friend or pay someone‚Äôs services - for any of these actions you will need to deposit money to someone else‚Äôs Sberbank card.  Find out her number, full name  payee and choose a convenient method. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tech2.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to put money on someone else's sberbank card" class="if uuid-3078223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/3078223.jpg"></div><h2>  From card to card through the Sberbank application </h2><p>  Let's start with a method convenient for customers of Sberbank.  After all, the simplest means for any payments is through a special application that can be downloaded to your phone through the AppStore or Google Play.  If you are a client of Sberbank, then be sure to do it.  The application is useful not only for such an action as transferring money from a card to a Sberbank card, but also for other, no less necessary actions, such as: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  money transfers to cards of other banks; </li><li>  transfers to bank accounts; </li><li>  payment of various services, utility bills, telephone, Internet, fines, taxes, goods in online stores and others; </li><li>  barcode payment on receipt; </li><li>  convenient recharge cards. </li></ul><p>  And all this and much more is always at hand, right in your pocket.  Just do not forget to pre-activate the mobile banking service at the bank‚Äôs branch and get a login and password at Sberbank‚Äôs ATM. </p><p>  In order to put money on a Sberbank card to another person through the application, you need to log in and go to the interface of your card with which you are going to make a transfer, or by clicking on ‚ÄúPayments‚Äù in the bottom menu of the application, select ‚ÄúPayment or transfer‚Äù, and then to the ‚ÄúClient of Sberbank‚Äù.  At the next step, everything is still clear - enter the recipient's data.  Then indicate the amount you want to transfer and, if necessary, a comment on the payment that your opponent will see when receiving the money.  As you can see, everything is simple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="time.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to put money on someone else's sberbank card ways" class="if uuid-3078196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/3078196.jpg"></div><h2>  "Sberbank Online" </h2><p>  A similar way, how to put money on someone else‚Äôs Sberbank card using your card, is to use the version of your personal account through the computer on the site.  To get access to it, you will need the same as in the previous method: a connected service and a password to enter.  And then everything follows the same pattern: ‚ÄúPayments‚Äù, ‚ÄúTo Sberbank Client‚Äù, data of the payee.  After you enter all the data and the amount of payment, you will be prompted to enter a code that will be sent via SMS to your phone number.  Enter the correct code and the payment is completed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Via SMS service "Mobile Bank" </h2><p>  This method of <span>transferring money from a card to a Sberbank card is</span> not very convenient, but it is still popular due to the fact that it takes just any phone to complete it.  No preliminary preparations are required in the form of installed applications and received passwords.  Just a phone or smartphone with the function of sending SMS to short numbers, the activated Mobile Bank service and the recipient's data.  Please note that he must also have a mobile bank connected. </p><p>  "TRANSFER 1234567890 100" - the text of the SMS message to be sent to the Sberbank number "900".  In the message after the word "TRANSFER", after a space, dial the Sberbank client card number, consisting of 16 or 18 digits, or its phone number, consisting of 10 digits - without the "eight", and after, after the space, the amount. </p><p>  If you have several bank cards registered, then in this SMS you need to enter the data of the one with which you want to make this transfer.  All numbers are not needed, only the last four.  They must be inserted after the word "TRANSFER". </p><div class="photo" data-original="bintroo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Put money on someone else's card through an ATM" class="if uuid-3078190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/3078190.jpg"></div><h2>  Using an ATM of Sberbank </h2><p>  Sberbank terminals with the function of receiving cash allow not only to replenish your card, but also to transfer to another client of the bank.  If your card already has the required amount, then a terminal that only dispenses cash is suitable, without acceptance.  Its menu does not differ from the first, only a bill acceptor is missing. </p><p>  The process of transferring funds is very similar to the first two.  Having logged in using your card at an ATM, you also find yourself in your personal account, where any actions with your finances will become available. </p><ol><li>  Select "Payments and Transfers" from the menu. </li><li>  The next item is ‚ÄúFunds Transfer‚Äù. </li><li>  Enter the card number of the recipient. </li><li>  Indicate the amount. </li><li>  Carefully check the entered data before confirming them in the last step. </li><li>  Do not forget to take a check or make sure that the money has been delivered. </li></ol><p>  The main convenience of this method is that for the transfer you do not need to connect any services, you just need to be a client of Sberbank.  ATMs operate around the clock and are installed near each branch of Sberbank, as well as in large shopping centers and other crowded places. </p><p>  It is worth noting that all the previous methods are completely free, as they are performed within the same bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abcnews.go.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank terminals with the function of receiving money" class="if uuid-3078202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/3078202.jpg"></div><h2>  Through an ATM of another bank </h2><p>  No difficulties should arise when using other ATMs.  The menus are similar and very simple.  Everything has been done so that any person can make the payment, even an inexperienced client of the bank.  The inscriptions in the menu may slightly differ from those described above, but the meaning is the same: we look for the item "Transfer of funds" and enter the card number and amount.  Do not forget that when transferring from one bank to another, a fee will be charged from you, the amount of which depends on the particular bank and its policy.  The amount of the commission should be indicated on the screen of the ATM and on the check, which is better to keep until the transfer is received. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.presstv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank card" class="if uuid-3078259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/3078259.jpg"></div><h2>  Through any payment terminal </h2><p>  In addition to ATMs, you can use payment terminals.  For example, you can often find QIWI ("Qiwi").  It‚Äôs difficult to tell you step by step how to deposit money on someone else‚Äôs Sberbank card using the terminal.  After all, the same QIWI, which can be found in many stores and even on the street, has several types of on-screen menus.  The general principle is still as clear as in the case of ATMs.  Find in the menu "Bank services" or "Transfer to a bank card" and specify the details of the recipient.  Methods of transferring to a bank account or card are available.  In the first case, you will have to indicate the BIC, correspondent account, bank name and account number.  In the second case, only a card number. </p><p>  The main inconvenience when paying through a payment terminal is often a rather large amount of commission. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.azcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Put money on someone else's sberbank card" class="if uuid-3078266" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/3078266.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion to a card from an electronic wallet </h2><p>  If you use payment systems such as Qiwi Wallet, Yandex.Wallet, WebMoney or others, you can put money on someone else's card using this method.  Find the "Withdraw funds" menu in the wallet menu and select - transfer to a bank card or account.  Thus, you can either put money on someone else's card of Sberbank, or on the card of any other bank someone else's or your own. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankrate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="put money on a card at the bank cash desk" class="if uuid-3078212" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/3078212.jpg"></div><h2>  Through the bank cash desk </h2><p>  The simplest and most familiar to every client of Sberbank since the time of Sberkassy was replenishing an account or transferring money to an account through a bank cash desk, that is, contacting an operator.  The simplest one, because you only need the card number of the recipient and the details of the bank that issued it, all the rest will be done by the employees of the financial institution.  When contacting the Sberbank cashier, do not forget to present your passport.  You can transfer both cash and money from your card.  The service may be paid even if you transfer within one bank.  It is better to familiarize yourself with the tariffs in advance, since the amount may turn out to be more than you expected. </p><p>  Now you know how to put money on someone else's Sberbank card.  The methods we examined seem to be all.  And if not, then enough so that it does not cause you any difficulties. </p>
