The trip computer of this model is best suited for off-road vehicles of the Lada family, which is highly appreciated by car owners.  Additional benefits include universal mount and affordable price. </p><p>  The versatility of the trip computer Multitronics TC 740 lies in the compatibility with most cars and the possibility of mounting in a non-standard place - for example, on the dashboard of a car. </p><h2>  Computer overview </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mcgrp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="multitronics tc 740" class="if uuid-3202655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3202655.jpg"></div><p>  The design and materials of TC 740 are made to the highest standards and meet the latest requirements of both Russian and foreign car concerns.  Car owners also appreciate the Multitronics TC 740 trip computer in reviews. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The on-board computer is equipped with a 2.4-inch TFT graphic screen and a resolution of 320x240 pixels.  The temperature range of the display is increased and varies from +50 to -30 degrees, which almost completely corresponds to the temperature range at which cars are operated. </p><p>  An additional advantage of the Multitronics 740 display is the ability to display information in various ways, including animation.  Such properties increase the attractiveness of the model for car owners, demanding on the appearance of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Connecting a computer to a car </h2><div class="photo" data-original="avto-spros.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="board computer multitronics tc 740" class="if uuid-3202656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3202656.jpg"></div><p>  <span>The on-board computer "Multitronics</span> TS 740" is connected to the car in several ways: </p><ol><li>  Connecting to the OBD-II diagnostic box is the easiest option.  It takes 30 minutes, and most of the time is spent laying inside the dashboard of the cable.  After that, the car owner needs to configure the computer according to the algorithm specified in the operating instructions included in the delivery. </li><li>  Connection in universal mode.  The Multitronics TC 740 trip computer is connected directly to the vehicle nozzle, speed and fuel level sensors.  This method is resorted to when the technique does not determine the type of controller and the protocol of its operation.  Thanks to this, you can use all the functions of the computer with the exception of the diagnostic scanner.  In other words, in universal mode, the Multitronics TC 740 is not able to read and clear ECU errors. </li><li>  Combined connection method.  The technique is connected to the car in the first way, but information about some data is not transmitted to the ECM, so you have to resort to the second method. </li></ol><h2>  Advantages of the computer </h2><p>  The on-board computer Multitronics TC 740 stands out among its analogues by the presence of a mini-USB connector, quality control functions and an "econometric", with which it is possible to plan and control trips for fuel consumption. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An additional advantage is the connection of parking sensors: two parking sensors can be synchronized simultaneously with the on-board computer using the optional -8 cable. </p><h2>  Functional and diagnostic options </h2><div class="photo" data-original="topsto-crimea.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="trip computer multitronics tc 740" class="if uuid-3202657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3202657.jpg"></div><p>  The wide functionality of the computer includes the following features: </p><ul><li>  Multitronics TC 740 is equipped with a TFT display with a diagonal of 2.4 inches and a resolution of 320x240 pixels.  The operating temperature range of the computer varies from -20 to +45 degrees.  The color scheme of the screen is adjusted via RGB channels.  The user can choose from four color schemes with quick switching. </li><li>  A high degree of speed and on-board computer performance is achieved through a 32-bit processor.  The updated software interface in combination with a powerful processor provides wide functionality. </li><li>  Availability of informative multi-displays - arrow, custom and graphic.  The manufacturer offers up to 35 displays per parameter, three displays with 9 parameters, 4 displays with 7 parameters and 6 displays with 4 parameters.  Arrow and graphic displays are offered in two parameters maximum.  For parking sensors connected to the on-board computer, displays are also provided. </li><li>  The Multitronics TC 740 supports both universal and original diagnostic protocols for most modern vehicles.  The computer can also connect to a speed sensor and car nozzles. </li><li>  Extensive diagnostic capabilities allow the on-board computer to monitor the operation of more than 30 additional parameters and read information from still images on 40 different parameters. </li><li>  Simultaneously with the trip computer, two parking radars located on the front and rear bumpers of the car can work at once.  Manufacturers recommend installing parking sensors of the same brand. </li></ul><h2>  Software Interface Features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="compavto.tkat.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="multitronics tc 740 reviews" class="if uuid-3202658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3202658.jpg"></div><p>  The upgraded software interface of the on-board computer Multitronics TC 740 offers the car owner a wide range of options and instant access to most of the model's features: </p><ul><li>  Hot menus provide quick access to the most requested parameters.  Each menu holds up to 10 different functions at the discretion of the user.  All four independent ‚Äúhot‚Äù menus are called by pressing a single key. </li><li>  The function "Journey and gas station log" allows you to collect statistics on the operation of the vehicle.  The virtual document is stored in the memory of the on-board computer and contains information on the latest routes and gas stations of the car.  It is possible to configure the trip computer to fix automatically the last 20 trips and gas stations. </li><li>  The device monitors the quality of fuel poured into the tank using the option "Fuel quality control".  The reference indicators of the duration of injection and the operation of the power unit, on which the system relies for subsequent comparisons, are stored in memory.  The on-board computer when the data is rejected to a greater or lesser extent informs the user about this. </li><li>  The "Countdown" function displays several graphs of instantaneous parameters simultaneously on the on-board computer display, comparing them with each other. </li><li>  The on-board computer Multitronics also notifies the driver of the need to turn on or off the side lights and dipped / main beam. </li></ul><h2>  PC synchronization </h2><p>  Connecting to a personal computer allows you to not only configure the on-board computer of the car, but also to edit and save files and configurations.  A miniUSB cable is supplied with the device, allowing you to connect it to a computer.  The generated settings file can then be used to calibrate similar computers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="max.kg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="on-board computer" class="if uuid-3202662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3202662.jpg"></div><p>  The software is updated via the Internet.  Due to the synchronization of the on-board computer with a personal computer, it is possible to conduct a detailed analysis of the collected static and operational data for a specific time period. </p><h2>  Additional devices </h2><div class="photo" data-original="avtozvuk.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="multitronics tc 740" class="if uuid-3202661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3202661.jpg"></div><p>  The on-board computer Multitronics can synchronize simultaneously with two parking sensors of the same brand installed on the front and rear bumpers.  The front bumper is triggered when the object approaches the car at a distance less than the allowed distance, which the on-board computer will notify.  The indication of operation can be audible and visual with the display of the distance to the object. </p><p>  The rear parking sensors are activated after the reverse gear is engaged, which is accompanied by an audible indication and information output to the on-board computer display.  The data allows you to determine at what distance from the vehicle the object is located. </p>
