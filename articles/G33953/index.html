  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scientific methods of cognition of the world</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If we consider the ways and methods of understanding the world, then they can be divided into three main ways: <span>science, art and</span> religion.  These are the three most common of all methods of cognition.  The object of knowledge is the same for them - the world around them, but among themselves they differ in the methods and tools of knowledge. </p><p>  It is clear that science uses scientific methods of cognition of the world.  These methods are based on logic and <span>objectivity (</span> sometimes <span>objectivity is</span> also called the ‚Äúmethod of scientific verification‚Äù).  The main tool of science is the mind - consciousness, which is based on human feelings.  A person has six of these feelings: sight, touch, smell, hearing, taste and memory. </p><p>  Scientific methods of knowing the world around us are always objective, rational and concrete, this follows from the definition of science itself, only various hypotheses and assumptions can be subjective in it.  Usually knowledge is called only the process of searching for truth, and the result of this process is called knowledge.  Knowledge is the result of knowledge of reality, tested by practice, it is reflected in the thinking of a person. </p><p>  The essence of scientific knowledge is to determine the exact quantitative measure that characterizes a particular process.  Scientific methods of cognition of the surrounding world are a sphere of human activity in which he develops and systematizes the acquired objective knowledge.  This knowledge reveals the internal essence of the studied objects, processes and phenomena of reality. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A complete system of scientific knowledge is obtained in the form of an accumulation of revealed facts, their quantitative, qualitative and conceptual descriptions, as well as empirical laws found with their help.  The most important hallmark <span>of science</span> is that it has <span>research methods.</span>  <span>The scientific method of research</span> is a set of techniques and operations, as well as methods of justifying a knowledge system and ways to control the results obtained in terms of objectivity.  This method also includes building models that adequately reflect reality. </p><p>  Among scientific methods, general and special methods can be distinguished.  General methods are general scientific, general philosophical, mathematical, which make it possible to describe heterogeneous objects, processes and phenomena from a single point of view.  Special methods are mainly used in narrow specific areas of cognition, for example, methods of psychological pedagogical research, since for the natural sciences and the humanities the methods of cognition differ significantly.  Their objects of research differ in nature, therefore it is impossible to approach their study with the same standards. </p><p>  Scientific methods of cognition of the world can be divided into several successive stages: </p><p>  - Observation of in vivo objects, processes and phenomena, obtaining primary information about them using sensory organs and devices. </p><p>  - A qualitative and quantitative description that captures the results in one form or another using science-accepted concepts, graphs, and charts.  Then the studied qualities are indicated by numerical representations, systematized and classified. </p><p>  - The facts established as a result of observation are not only recorded, but also comprehended with the help of existing concepts and concepts.  In scientific analysis, a comparison and generalization of facts takes place, they are separated from particulars and general properties are distinguished.  At this stage, general assumptions appear - hypotheses. </p><p>  - The search for the necessary evidence that can confirm or refute the hypothesis put forward. </p><p>  - As a result of the accumulation of confirmed hypotheses, a theory arises, which is an integral system of images, schemes and models, which reflects the totality of the properties and relationships of phenomena and objects that exist in a natural relationship. </p>
