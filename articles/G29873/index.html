The same gray color, orange tail.  But the size of an individual is more like a sparrow than a jay.  This is kuksha or in other words a ronja.  The bird, in addition to external beauty, has an amazing voice, which is heard by the inhabitants of the northern regions of Russia, since the bird lives there.  Moreover, the singing of young individuals resembles a mumble, and only in adulthood do sounds equalize into a beautiful melody. </p><p>  The ronja bird sings very quietly, so it is impossible to hear it from afar.  But witnesses say that singing is somewhat reminiscent of the sounds of bullfinches, the same clicks, clicks and lingering trills.  Even captive kukshi are able to independently master the natural melody, which gives untold joy to the owners of the bird. </p><p>  In the article, we will introduce the reader to the Ronja bird closer, find out her habits, what she likes to do, except singing, how she builds nests and starts a family where you can meet her in nature.  It will also be useful to find out to the owners of this bird, containing it in the cage at home, that the kuksha loves to eat. </p><h2>  Where dwells </h2><p>  The kuksha lives in the forest zone, loves spruce, fir, cedar or larch thickets of the taiga.  It can be found not far from Moscow, Kazan or in the latitude of the Southern Urals; it also lives in the regions of Altai and Transbaikalia adjacent to Mongolia.  The habitat covers the territory up to the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãOkhotsk, Sakhalin and the Scandinavian countries.  The most common bird is the rongee bird in the north of European Russia, with the approach to the south the number of individuals is significantly reduced. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In total, there are 11 species of this bird.  Two of them can be found even in the forests of China and in North America. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.birdid.no" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bird appearance" class="if uuid-2560770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2560770.jpg"></div><p>  This bird is characterized by a <span>sedentary lifestyle,</span> the cuckoo begins to travel only in the winter, and even then at close distances, united in small flocks.  Birds travel on the same route every day in search of food, however, it has been noticed that for some reason in February they fly this distance twice. </p><p>  At this time, it can be seen even in birch groves.  But most of all, she likes to settle in the most dense thickets of cedar, fir, spruce or larch forests.  During the winter season, kuksh can be seen in Denmark, Hungary and the Slovak Tatras.  It is possible to meet her in the north-eastern part of Kazakhstan. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The ronja bird (kuksha) feather color is light gray, turning on the head in black.  From afar, it seems that a black cap is put on his head.  Thanks to this color, it easily hides among the trees of the forest, it gives out only a red tail and small spots on the wings.  The feathers themselves are brown.  Beak and legs are black. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bbc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what makes a kuksha in winter" class="if uuid-2560766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2560766.jpg"></div><p>  In size, the bird is larger than the sparrow, but smaller than the jay, about 26-30 cm with the tail in males.  Females are slightly smaller, from 24 to 28 cm. The weight of the bird is on average from 81 grams in females to 87 grams in males.  The beak is rather short, slightly bent at the end of the beak.  The tail is long and rounded at the end, consists of 10 tail feathers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What eats </h2><p>  The food goes to the ronja bird (photo below) quite easily, as this bird is omnivorous.  She perfectly eats the seeds of conifers, different berries that grow in the forests.  Also does not disdain the ronja and food of animal origin.  These are insects, they especially like to catch bugs, small birds or mice, shrews or voles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pernatidruzi.org.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bird food" class="if uuid-2560762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2560762.jpg"></div><p>  Cases of ruin by nests of other species of birds by the cuckoo are known, while chicks go for food.  In winter, when there is a shortage of food, they can attack white partridges caught in the net by bird-catchers, or eat animals that were killed by other predators, do not shun carrion.  For the winter in the hollows, the kuksha harvests stocks of lingonberries and other berries. </p><h2>  Where settles </h2><p>  Kuksha nests (another name for the bird - ronja) makes nests at an altitude of 2 to 6 meters, hiding nests in dense thickets of taiga.  It is located most often between the trunk and the branch extending to the side, but it also occurs on the branches themselves. </p><p>  The shape of the nests is bowl-shaped, they are built neatly, from thin branches and stems of grass.  Dense construction is insulated with feathers, lichens, dry grass.  The socket size is as follows: </p><ul><li>  diameter - 23 cm; </li><li>  wall thickness - from 5 to 7 cm; </li><li>  the diameter of the inner tray is 9 cm. </li></ul><h2>  Breeding </h2><p>  The kuksha family has been formed for a long time.  The male and female live together for a whole year, and according to the observations of ornithologists, most likely, even in a short period of formation, the schools do not lose one another from sight.  This occurs in winter, when it is easier to survive in a flock.  Sometimes kukushi are found in the amount of 6-8 birds along with titmouse.  Before the breeding season begins, the flocks disintegrate.  Courts of the male begin from March to April. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pernatidruzi.org.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hatching chicks" class="if uuid-2560763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2560763.jpg"></div><p>  Ronji begin to nest early and only once a year.  There is a nesting period, sometimes in March, sometimes in April.  There are usually 3-4 eggs, very rarely - 5. Their size varies from 23 to 28 mm.  The color of the eggs varies, from greenish gray to off-white, sometimes there are mottled spots with a purple hue, thickening on the dull end of the egg. </p><p>  Hatching begins from the very first egg and lasts 16-17 days.  Both parents sit on the masonry together, clinging tightly to each other, do not leave the nest, even if the person is bothering them. </p><p>  After hatching, both parents take care of the offspring.  Chicks are born completely helpless, covered with dense brown down. </p><p>  The grown-up Ronji learn to fly already on the 21st day, but even having left the nest, they are nearby for a long time. </p><h2>  Molting </h2><p>  The change of feathers in kuksha begins in mid-June.  At first, the small feather changes, at the end of June there is a change of feathers in the stumps.  In mid-September, the molting process is almost over, it remains only for the small feathers on the head and neck.  Such information was obtained as a result of catching birds in different periods. </p><h2>  Interesting information </h2><p>  The name kuksha, according to one version, the bird received from the sound ‚Äúkuuk‚Äù made by it.  Other ornithologists believe that the name of the species came from the Finnish word kuukkeli. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rantalat.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flight of ronji" class="if uuid-2560761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2560761.jpg"></div><p>  Ronja is called only by Russians, since in some dialects of the Baltic peoples they call it a nut.  But since such birds do not live in the Baltic, the name of the ronja is not used among scientists and ornithologists. </p><p>  Ronja is often referred to as other birds, for example, cedar, bluecake, waxwing, and jay. </p><p>  The article gives a photo and description of the Ronja bird (scientifically kuksha).  The Latin correct name for the individual is Perisoreus infaustus.  Now you can easily recognize such a bird in the forest, because it is impossible to confuse it with anyone. </p>
