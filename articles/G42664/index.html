At the same time, I really want every coat and jacket to have its own new thing, suitable in color and model.  To be able to change a hat as often as a down jacket, you will need to learn how to sew a hat with your own hands.  Having sewing skills and various rags of fur or other suitable material, you can create a real exclusive thing.  But let's look in order the options for manufacturing various models. </p><p>  How to <span>sew a hat</span> from a knitted fabric for a child. </p><p>  This option is perfect for a mischievous baby in the offseason or winter.  Our hat will be rectangular with two ears decorated with fur and a small lapel.  To make it, you will need dense knitwear for the lining, a knitted fabric and small pieces of fur for bombing. </p><p>  First, measure the baby‚Äôs head.  This measure will be the width of the knitted fabric.  The length of the cap can be chosen at your discretion.  If you want the ends of the headgear to hang down and form a headscarf, then make it longer.  We take for example the following measurements: girth of the head 30 centimeters, lapel 5 centimeters and the height of the cap - 15 centimeters.  With such dimensions, it will sit tightly on the baby‚Äôs head for 1.5-2 years. </p><p>  Given our standards, we prepare a knitted fabric 30x27 centimeters and lining knitwear 30x15 centimeters.  If you have bright old <span>knitwear,</span> then you can use them to make such a headgear. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We cut out two rectangles according to the given sizes.  Before stitching the cap, prepare the details of the top and pad.  Fold the knitted fabric in half, upside down.  Grind the side and top cut with an overlock.  We make sure that the knitted columns do not blossom.  In the same way, we sew the lining, leaving a small segment open.  Through it we will turn the product on the front side. </p><p>  Fold the prepared parts of the cap with the sides facing inward, equalize the slices and pin them with needles to prevent displacement.  Having retreated one centimeter from the cut, we draw a straight line along the entire circumference of the cap.  We get a pipe from two parts with wired ends.  Through the hole left, we turn the cap on the front side.  Sew the slot manually.  We fill the lining inside the cap and bend the lapel out. </p><p>  Now we make fluffy bombs from fur flaps.  Sew them to the corners of the finished hat.  To fix the headgear, you can supplement it with ties from threads or ribbons.  This will allow the baby to feel comfortable and not to lose his hat while playing on the street. </p><p>  If you are considering how to <span>sew a hat of fur of the</span> same model for yourself and your daughter, then consider the following option.  It will suit you perfectly.  Having rags of an old or <span>artificial sheepskin coat</span> and a beautiful fur collar available, you can sew a beautiful Mongolka fur hat.  The headgear itself is made of several wedges and sits tightly on the head.  As a decorative trim, any strip of fur that runs around the circumference of the lower edge of the cap is used. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Before you sew a fur hat, you need to make an exact pattern of a suitable size.  We will show you the easiest method.  Take an ordinary bag and put it on your head.  Wrap tape over it, starting the first turn along the supposed bottom of the cap, gradually rising up.  Adhesive tape will make an exact impression of your head.  Now remove the bag from the head and cut off all the excess.  The resulting mock-up of the cap is carefully cut into several wedges or, having made one side cut, slightly cut it several times from the crown.  The pattern made in this way is similar to the teeth of the crown.  Which option you choose will depend on the amount of available pieces of fur for the base. </p><p>  We lay out the details of the pattern on the sheepskin coat and circle, adding one centimeter on each side.  The thicker the fur, the more it will be necessary to add to the seams so that the hat does not press on the head.  Using manicure scissors or a scalpel, we cut out the details, being careful not to damage the fur.  A very thick undercoat needs to be cut, retreating 0.7-1 centimeter from the slices. </p><p>  Fold the wedges with their faces inward and sew them on an overlock or <span>furrier machine,</span> connecting them into a hat.  Now you should prepare a fur strip for decoration.  If you use an unnecessary arctic fox or fox collar for this purpose, then unlock the lining from it.  Measure the required length and cut off the excess fur.  Fill the fur strip with the front side on the inside of the cap, equalize the sections and grind round.  Join the side seam on the decorative trim.  After that, turn the strip outward, slightly bend the raw edge and hem it by hand.  You can process it on an overlock.  If the fur is very fluffy, then the section will not be visible.  From the remnants, make bombs by sewing them on shoelaces or strips of leather, and sew them to a hat. </p><p>  Now you know how to sew a hat, and you can please yourself and children with fashionable new things. </p>
