  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best books of Alexander Elder</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Alexander Elder is a well-known professional trader, consultant and expert in exchange trading.  The author of many articles and books on this topic.  Elder's 1993 work, entitled "How to Play and Win on the Exchange," became an international bestseller (translated into 12 languages) and has survived several editions.  In a professional environment, the book has received great recognition.  But this is not the only work of the trader that is worthy of attention.  The article will feature the <span>best books by</span> Alexander Elder.  So let's get started. </p><h2>  "How to play and win on the stock exchange" </h2><p>  This most popular work of a trader has already been mentioned.  According to Elder, success in the stock market game depends on three factors: methods, psychology and risk control.  At the beginning of the book, Alexander shows that the keys to success lie in psychology.  A trader teaches how to develop discipline and avoid emotional traps.  Then he talks about the search algorithm for profitable deals using charts, computer indicators and other analysis tools.  Based on this information, readers will be able to develop their own system by combining different methods.  And in the end, Elder will teach you how to properly manage funds in a brokerage account. </p><p>  Being a successful trader, Alexander not only reveals the secrets of skill, but also offers 200 exchange tasks with solutions.  Trading methods in the futures, stock, foreign exchange and other markets are presented in a very accessible form.  Readers will learn how to achieve success in the stock market game, save money during failures and significantly increase capital in profitable trading sessions.  Few trading books can teach such things.  We go further. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Trading with Dr. Elder" </h2><p>  In this work, Alexander interprets three success factors (methods, psychology, risk control) much broader than in the best-seller described above.  Elder reveals the secrets of managing time, money, teaches trading strategies and helps traders get out of profit transactions. </p><p>  The process of reading a book can be compared to visiting a doctor‚Äôs personal account.  It‚Äôs as if you are sitting in a chair, and Alexander gives instructions that will be equally useful for both beginners and professionals.  The author tells traders how to analyze all stages of the transaction based on the key concepts presented in the publication. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ozon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trading with Dr. Elder" class="if uuid-2536170" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14097/2536170.jpg"></div><p>  The book by Alexander Elder will help you master everything you need to make a profit in the financial markets: placing stop-loss orders, trading systems, risk management, technical indicators, psychology of the crowd and the stock marketer.
