If something goes wrong with you, let the reception know about it and the hotel staff will quickly fix all the problems.  In general, according to tourists, the rooms have everything you need.  People who have come to rest with their children and settled in family rooms also note the presence of kitchenettes in their apartments.  This made it possible, if necessary, to prepare food for the kids.  Also, some tourists used the kitchenette, preparing their own lunches or dinners in order to save.  Moreover, there is a supermarket nearby where you can buy any products.  Room cleaning, according to the guests, was done every day.  Bed sheets and towels were changed three times a week or as needed.  Please note that towels cannot be taken out of the room.  If you need a <span>beach towel,</span> you can either rent it at the reception of the hotel, or buy it in one of the nearest shops. </p><p>  As for the territory of the hotel, it is small but very well maintained.  True, according to travelers, you will not find much vegetation here, as, indeed, in Cyprus as a whole.  In addition to the pool for children and adults, on the territory of Mimosa Beach Hotel 3 * there is a tennis court and a volleyball court. </p><p>  I liked the tourist and the location of this hotel.

The distance to it from the hotel is about three kilometers.  They can be overcome both by bus or taxi, and on foot.  Alternatively, head to Ayia Napa, just 10 kilometers away. </p>

    <h2>  Comments of Mimosa Beach guests about beach vacations and entertainment </h2><p>  Like the vast majority of <span>hotels in Cyprus,</span> Mimosa Beach 3 * (Protaras) does not have its own beach.  The nearest municipal beach is located literally ten meters from the border of the hotel‚Äôs own territory.  In addition, for hotel guests there is no particular need to pay for the use of sun loungers and umbrellas on the municipal beach, as they can comfortably accommodate on hotel loungers.  At the same time, they will be trimmed from the sea with only an additional couple of tens of meters, which, according to tourists, is completely uncritical.  As for the local beach, many travelers liked it very much.  So, it is sandy, with a gentle entry into the water.  In addition, there is a small bay, so the sea in this place is very warm.  Family tourists claim that it is a pleasure to relax here with children. </p><p>  The hotel also has a small outdoor pool with a sun terrace, where you can have fun.  Outdoor enthusiasts can also play volleyball or tennis.  Experienced travelers are also advised to rent a car and take excursions around the island at least for a couple of days. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, we can say that Mimosa Beach Hotel 3 * (Protaras) is, according to our compatriots, a very pleasant place to stay in Cyprus for those tourists who want to find comfortable, but economical accommodation.  Travelers are sure that this hotel is perfect for families with children and the elderly, but young people who are used to a noisy vacation can be bored here. </p>
