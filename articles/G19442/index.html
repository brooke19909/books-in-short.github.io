This mobile gadget brightens up the time on the way to work, while traveling, and before going to bed sometimes you want to watch your favorite series in silence without involving a massive TV. </p><p>  Video content on the Web is simply in bulk, but many do not know how to upload movies to a tablet.  As a rule, there are no problems with desktop devices, but with mobile gadgets, and in particular with the Android and iOS platforms, some have difficulties. </p><p>  So, let's try to figure out how to upload movies to the tablet, and to do this as painlessly as possible for the device itself and for its owner.  Consider the main ways of downloading content with some distinctive features of each method. </p><h2>  Browser </h2><p>  This is one of the most common ways to upload movies to your tablet.  For this we need any browser.  Even a regular version of Google will do.  On the Internet there are so many sites that allow you to download content directly from your interface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to download movies to your tablet for free" class="if uuid-3175636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3175636.jpg"></div><p>  To download the movie to your tablet, just click on the appropriate button.  The latter is usually located somewhere under the player.  To download content, it is best to use specialized resources specifically designed for mobile gadgets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, you can upload movies to both the Apple tablet and the device running the Android platform.  The only thing is to clarify that you will need to take into account the maximum resolution of your screen.  This will significantly save both space on the internal drive and the time spent downloading. </p><h2>  Features download via browser </h2><p>  If, for example, your gadget can play videos with a maximum resolution of 720 r, then it is not necessary to download capacious files designed for 4K resolution.  From this they will not become more beautiful.  All this information must be specified in the player, and you can find it out by clicking on the "gear": 360 r, 480 r, 720 r, 1080 r, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to upload movies to apple tablet" class="if uuid-3175644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3175644.jpg"></div><p>  It will also be useful to find out what formats a regular player can play.  It will be a shame if you upload a movie to your tablet in MP4 format, and the player only works with AVI.  Although rare, it still happens. </p><h2>  Torrent </h2><p>  This method of downloading content is extremely popular not only on personal computers, but also on mobile devices.  Using the torrent client, you can also download movies to your tablet absolutely free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.utorrent.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to download a movie on a tablet" class="if uuid-3175639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3175639.jpg"></div><p>  To download video content, you need special software.  On the same "Play Market" you can find several varieties of torrent clients.  The utility is downloaded and installed as a normal application.  No problems should arise here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next, you need to find a torrent link on the Web.  There are plenty of resources on the Internet where you can do this: ‚ÄúRutor‚Äù, ‚ÄúRutraker‚Äù, etc. After you download a torrent link, there are two ways to start downloading movies.  The first is through the file manager.  Just find the downloaded torrent and click on it.  The client should start automatically and start the download.  You just have to indicate the place on the internal drive where the file will be downloaded. </p><h2>  Customer Features </h2><p>  You can download the video through the torrent client itself.  The menu should have a ‚ÄúFile‚Äù branch, where you need to click on the ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù sub-item.  By selecting the torrent link you downloaded earlier, you will start the video upload process. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that torrent resources, which host video and other content, are for the most part prohibited for use on the territory of the Russian Federation.  Therefore, you may need a virtual VPN to access such sites.  Similar software in a large assortment lives on the same "Google Play" and is installed as a regular application. </p><h2>  A computer </h2><p>  You can upload a movie to your tablet from a computer.  In some cases, the Internet may not work, and specific applications refuse to start.  This situation is very often observed on older devices: on platforms of past generations and with a modest set of chipsets in terms of power. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to upload a movie to a tablet from a computer" class="if uuid-3175638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3175638.jpg"></div><p>  Then one of the most proven methods is suitable - using a computer and a USB cable.  To do this, you need to connect the cable to the interfaces on both sides and enable USB debugging mode on the tablet.  The latter option is suitable for those whose device cannot be read on the computer as an external drive. </p><p>  You may also need to install branded drivers or a client.  For example, gadgets from Samsung are very picky about direct connection and work correctly only in tandem with the original application for synchronization. </p><p>  To download video content to a tablet, you must open Explorer on your computer.  The tablet should be defined as an external drive.  If a memory card is installed on the mobile gadget, then there must be two disks. </p><p>  Decide which drive you will upload movies to, and open the explorer window by clicking on the disk icon.  Then open the second window, where the previously prepared content is located.  Use the mouse to drag the desired file into the drive window. </p><p>  Some clients have built-in functionality for copying different types of files to a mobile gadget.  The program scans the device and finds a predefined format for media content.  After which it offers to determine the specific files and copies them to the tablet. </p><h2>  Memory card </h2><p>  This method can be called a simplified version of the previous method.  If your mobile gadget supports working with external memory cards, the download procedure is significantly simplified.  To transfer files, you need to remove the external media from the tablet and connect it to the computer.  Instead of a PC, you can use another mobile device with equal success. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="upload a movie to a tablet from a memory card" class="if uuid-3175637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3175637.jpg"></div><p>  The procedure for copying to a personal computer is described above.  In the case of tablets, the process is slightly different.  To work with files, we need a dispatcher.  If there is no staff, then you can download any other on the same Google Play, only so that he can copy and transfer information, and not just read it. </p><p>  Having selected all the necessary videos in the file manager, you need to call the context menu and click on the ‚ÄúCopy‚Äù item.  Then go to the memory card in the same manager and click ‚ÄúInsert‚Äù in the same way.  It remains only to remove the memory card and place it in the desired tablet. </p>
