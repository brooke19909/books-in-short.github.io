There may be several options.  Each person must independently choose the most suitable option for themselves. </p><h2>  By car </h2><p>  Many people are used to traveling in their own car and do not like public vehicles.  There are many reasons for this.  Basically, with the fact that it becomes possible to independently plan your journey and path.  A similar movement can be made from Penza to Samara.  In total, several features of this route can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  On the way there will be several cities, namely Syzran, Gorodishche and Zhigulevsk.  Each of them has interesting places.  You can independently create a multi-day trip by studying the beauty of each of them. </li><li>  It is difficult for each driver to sit in one position for a long time, if necessary, you can rest in a comfortable hotel, have a bite to eat in a cafe or go to the supermarket for groceries.  All objects are located directly on the highway. </li><li>  Across the entire perimeter of the highway, there are 87 gas stations.  And they are all from different companies.  You can choose the best option for yourself. </li><li>  The distance from Penza to Samara is 416 kilometers, if you do not make long stops, then you can overcome it by car in just 5 hours 48 minutes. </li><li>  The entire route is one continuous line, so it will be quite difficult to get lost. </li><li>  New asphalt has been laid out from the city of Penza to Syzran.  Closer to Samara, the road noticeably worsens.  It is recommended to reduce the speed in this area. </li><li>  In some places, CCTV cameras are installed, if there is no desire to earn a fine, you should follow the rules of the road. </li></ul><p>  There are many advantages of moving from one settlement to another by personal transport.

    <p>  Once a day, an electric train runs from Samara to Penza with the symbolic name "day express".  The train number 101 leaves from Penza 1 station, and arrives at the Samara railway station.  This is one of the fastest ways, since the total travel time is exactly 4 hours 20 minutes.  He leaves the station at 7 o‚Äôclock in the morning, and already at 11.20 the passengers disembark at the appointed point.  Many people neglect this method because of the high cost.  The minimum ticket price for an adult is 772 rubles. </p><h2>  By plane </h2>

    <p>  Although there are airports near these two points, there is no direct flight for the aircraft.  Perhaps this is due to the small distance from Penza to Samara.  However, if such a need arose, then you can make a flight from one point to another with an additional transfer.  Of the two cities there are direct flights to Moscow.  Tickets for them can be bought at any box office of the airport. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  From the station "Penza 1" to Samara, in addition to the train, ordinary trains also leave.  This happens once a day.  This is not a direct flight, so problems often arise with tickets, especially in the summer.  The total travel time is 7 hours 50 minutes.  That is, at 6 o‚Äôclock in the morning he leaves, and already at 13.50 he is in the appointed place.  A ticket can be bought at one of the ticket offices of the station.  Approximately its cost will be 650 rubles.  Naturally, if you need to buy a ticket in a compartment, the price will increase markedly. </p><h2>  By bus </h2><p>  In addition to the Samara-Penza train, the most tiring vehicle - a bus - passes from one point to another every day.  Not everyone will decide to make a trip in this way.  Unfortunately, direct flights do not exist.  Therefore, you will first need to buy a ticket at the Penza bus station to Moscow.  From the capital of Russia you can already buy a bus ticket to the city of Samara.  The path has to be considerable, so it is better to go on the very first flight at 7 hours and 30 minutes.  The total travel time will be about 18 hours.  Accordingly, this option is suitable only for those who need to call on any business in Moscow.  The cost of moving from Penza to Samara will be 3800 rubles. </p><p>  Penza and Samara are two incredibly beautiful cities that every resident of Russia should visit.  On what to overcome the distance between these two points?  There are several options.  However, it is preferable to use a car or train for this purpose.  This will save money and time on the road.  Currently, there are a huge number of Internet services on which you can find travel companions on the road, it is convenient for those who do not have their own vehicle. </p>
