After all, this helps to find the best options for the flight, learn more about the country, and also choose the right hotel.  Tourists are advised to pay special attention to the last point, even if you do not plan to spend a lot of time at the hotel.  Therefore, in order not to spoil their impressions of the rest, travelers try to collect as much information as possible about a particular hotel.  An invaluable help in this, according to them, is provided by studying the reviews of those who have already had occasion to stay here.  Indeed, in their comments, former guests narrate about the shortcomings of a particular hotel, not focusing solely on a description of its merits.  Therefore, even before the trip, you will be able to get a close-to-reality idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat will await you during your vacation.  To save you time and effort, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized reviews of tourists from Russia who recently stayed at Resort Rio during their trip to Goa.  Just note that the vast majority of comments are positive.  Our compatriots really liked the hotel, and they are ready to recommend it to all travelers.  But we learn more about everything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="resort rio 5 goa" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1086532.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  Our compatriots practically had no complaints about the work of the hotel maids.  According to them, the cleaning was carried out every day and was carried out quite qualitatively.  Towels were also updated daily, stocks of drinks in the minibar, tea and coffee making facilities and personal hygiene items in the bathroom were replenished.  In addition, maids constantly add bottled drinking water at the rate of half a liter per person.  Bed linen was changed several times a week.  If you find that for some reason the maid did not clean the floor or forgot to put something for you, tell her about it at the meeting or inform the reception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel resort rio 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1086535.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  The guests of the Resort Rio 5 * hotel (India, Goa), according to them, were pleasantly surprised by the attention to them from the staff.  So, the guests note that all the staff here are always friendly, helpful, smiling.  The hotel staff will always open the door for you, will be happy to answer any question and fulfill any request.  However, please note that almost no one speaks Russian here, with the exception of one of the administrators at the reception.  Therefore, you need to recall a little the English curriculum. </p><p>  A pleasant addition to the relaxation of some guests of the Resort Rio was the fact of receiving compliments from the hotel.  So, those guests can count on them for the duration of their stay at the hotel their birthday, wedding anniversary, as well as those tourists who plan to spend their honeymoon here.  Special attention is also given to regular customers of the hotel.  As for the compliments themselves, they usually include a delicious cake, a basket of fruit and a bottle of good wine or champagne. </p><h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, the Resort Rio 5 * hotel in most cases adheres to the checkout time.  Therefore, if you arrive at the hotel in the morning, then be prepared for the fact that you will receive the keys to your room only after two in the afternoon.  However, this does not mean that you have to spend several hours in the lobby near the reception.  So, you can leave your things in the luggage room (then the employees of the Resort Rio will transfer them to your apartment) and begin to relax, going to the pool, to a restaurant or directly to the beach. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, the occupied room should be vacated before noon.  If you plan to leave the hotel only in the evening, then there is the opportunity to extend your stay for several hours at an additional cost.  However, it is advisable to notify the administrator at the reception in advance of such an intention so that there are no misunderstandings with the settlement of new guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel resort rio 5 goa" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1086536.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Resort Rio 5 * hotel (Goa, India) is located at some distance from the coast, most tourists found its location very successful.  So, according to them, the hotel is in a quiet and peaceful place, away from the busy roadway.  In the vicinity of Resort Rio there are a lot of shops, cafes, excursion bureaus, car rental points, etc. You can take a taxi or tuk-tuk to any place from here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="resort rio 5" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1086537.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  This hotel offers guests a choice of several options for which meals will be provided.  So, guests can only pay for breakfast, half board or the all-inclusive concept.  However, experienced travelers advise all tourists going to Goa to stay on the option that involves only breakfast.  Indeed, in this case, you will not be attached to the hotel, but you can safely explore the sights of an amazing country, visit any beaches, try new dishes in various cafes and restaurants, etc. </p><p>  As for the quality of food at Resort Rio, on the whole it satisfied our compatriots.  True, some of the guests who, for an additional fee, had lunch and dinner several times at the hotel, claim that the prices here are, in their opinion, too high.  Therefore, they whenever possible preferred to eat outside the hotel, especially since there are a lot of cafes in its vicinity. </p>
