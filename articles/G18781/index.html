If you have not been lucky enough to visit the kingdom of sand, be extremely careful - it is very easy to fall in love with him at first sight.  Dubai safari is a bright and memorable entertainment for tourists.  To visit the UAE and not go on this exciting journey - perhaps this can be considered a crime. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.godesto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dubai safari" class="if uuid-2562431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2562431.jpg"></div><h2>  You are ready? </h2><p>  It is worth mentioning right away that a safari in Dubai is an entertainment exclusively for those who prefer an active holiday and cannot sit in a stuffy hotel room.  Gold sand dunes await tourists from all over the world.  Only here you can feel the adrenaline rush, breaking dunes on a comfortable and maneuverable SUV.  Particular pleasure will be given in the evening in the desert, when in the rays of the setting sun you can look around at the sandy silk waves. </p><p>  It is not surprising that travelers bring thousands of vivid photographs from the Dubai Safari tour.  As part of the excursion program, tourists will be able to feel like locals, try on traditional costumes, ride a camel, and also enjoy all the charms of the life of nomads.  And in the evening, at sunset, the master will skillfully decorate the body with exquisite mehendi patterns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="mytravellerschoice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="safari dubai tour" class="if uuid-2562419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2562419.jpg"></div><h2>  What to wear? </h2><p>  At first glance, it may seem that this issue is not appropriate or, at least, not so important as to pay priority attention to it.  But, as practice shows, it is the wardrobe of an unprepared tourist that causes considerable discomfort during a safari in Dubai. </p><p>  Many tour operators specializing in trips to the Emirates, offer to make an exciting journey through the desert.  However, not many of them give recommendations for choosing clothes. </p><p>  Tourists should remember that they will have to spend the whole day in the desert (some excursion programs are designed for the whole day), so when choosing clothes, you should focus on the variability of weather conditions in the desert.  So, for example, in the morning and at night it can be quite cold, and in the afternoon there is a high probability of getting sunburn due to high air temperature. </p><p>  Therefore, you should take a warm tracksuit and a headdress with you in case of gusty wind.  During the day you should put on spacious and bright clothes.  It is important to close the body as much as possible to protect it from the harmful effects of sunlight.  As for shoes, lightweight, breathable, but completely enclosed sneakers or sneakers are the best option. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="cityonetours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="safari dubai photo" class="if uuid-2562432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2562432.jpg"></div><h2>  Briefly about travel </h2><p>  Dubai safaris are entertainment for strong and active tourists.  It all starts with the fact that travelers are picked up from a comfortable hotel and taken to the nearest desert, located outside the city limits.  The road will take about 60 minutes.  After that, tourists change to jeeps specially prepared for trips along sand dunes.  Typically, this is a Toyota Land Cruiser with a powerful inner frame (for protection against upheavals). </p><p>  Arabs do not like measured and calm trips in the sand.  They overcome the Golden Mountains assertively and extremely.  For this reason, the car must be durable, reliable and hardy.  Endurance and a healthy spine will be needed by the extremals themselves. </p><p>  A walk through the dunes is not a test for tourists pampered by blissful idleness.  This is a real trip for those who are tired of standard sightseeing programs with architectural and historical sights.  A walk through the desert is quite extreme - many experience emotions comparable to those experienced during the Paris-Dakar rally.  Therefore, people with a weak vestibular apparatus should not rely on an extremely pleasant experience.  Unfortunately, motion sickness is one of the most common problems among tourists pampered by the sun.  Also, pregnant women should not go to the desert - this can adversely affect their health.  A desert jeep safari in Dubai is not just a sand trip.  This is a real surge of adrenaline and a lot of impressions.  Experienced travelers recommend that you do not overeat before the trip, as well as stop drinking strong drinks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tribaltrailstours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="safari park dubai" class="if uuid-2562418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2562418.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  It should immediately be said that jeep safaris in Dubai are not cheap.  According to tourists, rest here provides for the presence of a significant amount on the map.  But it's worth it. </p><p>  It must be remembered that Dubai is primarily an active vacation.  Reviews warn that in local hotels you can not find huge pools, such as, say, in Turkey.  Here tourists are not spoiled with opportunities for SPA-relaxation (there are salons at hotels, but you can‚Äôt spend the whole day there - they will quickly get tired, vacationers say). </p><p>  In addition, a hot climate reigns here, and the sea, although warm, is rather dangerous.  There are many reviews that poisonous jellyfish swim in the coastal waters, so sitting idly in the hotel will not work.  So it turns out that tourists come to the UAE for vivid impressions. </p><p>  Experienced travelers recommend taking a lot of money with them - this is a kind of guarantee of quality relaxation.  And what more could you want millionaires from the city?  Tourists traveling to Dubai are advised to take at least $ 500 with them. </p><p>  According to reviews of tourists, a night safari is worth a visit, if only because it is thanks to it that you can fully experience the spirit of the East and plunge into its flavor and originality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.platinum-heritage.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="safari dubai reviews" class="if uuid-2562428" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2562428.jpg"></div><h2>  Safari (Dubai): tour </h2><p>  It is worthwhile to dwell in more detail on what constitutes a typical travel program in a vast desert.  It should immediately be said that it will take at least half a day: </p><ul><li>  Collection of tourists at the hotel. </li><li>  Transfer to the desert. </li><li>  A trip through the sand dunes in specially equipped jeeps (sometimes on ATVs) is about one hour. </li><li>  Special skiing and snowboarding on the sand dunes. </li><li>  PHOTOSESSION. </li><li>  Dinner in a Bedouin camp, camel riding, henna tattoo, bright and colorful performance in the Arabic style, photo at sunset, trying on national costumes. </li><li>  Return to the hotel. </li></ul><p>  Some tour operators offer tourists an overnight stay in the desert and meeting dawn.  You can buy the Desert Safari Tour (Dubai) directly from the travel organizer or at the hotel.  The cost varies between 45-65 dollars per person.  You can buy all the seats in the car - such a service will cost a little more, but you won‚Äôt have to adapt to anyone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thedubaisafari.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="safari park dubai" class="if uuid-2563850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2563850.jpg"></div><h2>  How about a desert night trip? </h2><p>  For Arab nomads, the desert has always been a home.  In its boundless sands and zones they were born, led their caravans, lived their usual lives and ended the earthly journey.  The desert is not as simple as it seems at first glance.  Under the seeming calm hides her wayward character, which can present an unexpected surprise.  The Arabian desert is mysterious, mysterious and unique.  An archaic past lurks in its sands, the present lives and the future is slightly foreseen.  And the night desert is a fairy tale! </p><p>  Night safari is an unforgettable experience and vivid landscapes.  This is a unique opportunity to spend an unforgettable night under the starry sky in the Arabian desert.  This is the only way to experience the full flavor and beauty of oriental culture.  This is another adventure without which it is impossible to call a full visit to Dubai - safari (photo below) in jeeps in the night desert.  This tour is also offered by tour operators. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.northtours.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dubai safari" class="if uuid-2563854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2563854.jpg"></div><h2>  Weapon selection </h2><p>  Some travel companies offer tourists not just a ride in the golden sands of the Arabian desert.  Hunting for wild animals is what will be interesting for real men. </p><p>  Before traveling, the question of choosing a weapon will certainly arise, so it‚Äôs worth giving some recommendations: </p><ul><li>  It is impossible to bring firearms with you to the Emirates. </li><li>  Safari organizers will offer several models from which you can choose one or another weapon, depending on who will be hunted. </li><li>  It is better to give preference to lightweight models. </li><li>  A hunting tour is not cheap, so it‚Äôs worth taking a few hundred euros with you. </li><li>  Removing trophies from the country is difficult, but quite real. </li></ul><p>  It remains only to wish good luck! </p><h2>  The most vivid and unforgettable impressions of tourists </h2><p>  Desert travel is a unique opportunity to plunge into the wonderful world of nightly adventures and unforgettable emotions.  For those who want to escape from the bustle of the city, a night safari is what you need.  From the first minutes you can feel the spirit of adventure that reigns in the air. </p><p>  Extreme jeep ride through the desert, overcoming the dunes, meeting with amazing animals - all this awaits tourists who decided to go on an exciting journey through the Arabian desert.  After a trip on four-wheel drive SUVs, tourists will be given the opportunity to enjoy the view of the setting sun from the top of the dune. </p><p>  In addition, acquaintance with the ‚Äúdesert ships‚Äù - pacified camels.  In the middle of the desert - in an oasis - tourists will be able to try on the traditional clothes of nomads, take vivid photos and enjoy the colorful presentation in the Arabic style.  There, travelers can taste the delicious dishes of traditional cuisine, as well as enjoy the aroma of real coffee.  As numerous reviews of the safari in Dubai show, the day spent among the dunes will leave the most vivid impressions. </p><p>  Tourists can take with them a piece of the desert - an intricate body pattern in the style of mehendi, made by a real master. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestdesertsafariindubai.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="safari in dubai" class="if uuid-2563845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2563845.jpg"></div><h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  Jeep safaris are organized every day.  You can find out the time of group gathering from the hotel administrator.  As a rule, the duration of the tour is 24 hours.  There are excursions that last 9 hours.  In this case, tourists will spend the night at the hotel.  But, as practice and numerous reviews of excursionists show, it is better to give preference to a daily trip, since it is a night spent in the desert that will give unforgettable emotions and vivid impressions. </p><p>  The price includes: </p><ul><li>  Transfer of tourists from the hotel and back. </li><li>  Lunch, dinner and breakfast at the Bedouin camp. </li><li>  Colorful performance. </li><li>  Soft drinks. </li></ul><p>  For a fee, tourists will be offered low-alcohol drinks of local production, a camel ride, dressing in traditional costumes and much more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.desertsafariguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai desert jeep safari" class="if uuid-2562433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2562433.jpg"></div><h2>  Safari Park </h2><p>  Opened recently - in mid-December 2017.  Almost 150 million dirhams were spent on its creation.  The administration of the largest leisure center plans to populate more than 5 thousand animals by 2020. </p><p>  The zoo is open daily from 9 am to 5 pm.  The cost of tickets is different: </p><ul><li>  Without safari: 50 AED (adult ticket) and 20 units (children). </li><li>  With a safari, the cost of visiting will be slightly higher: 85 dirhams for adult tourists and 30 dirhams for children. </li><li>  Safari separately: for adults 50, for children - 20 units. </li></ul><p>  Dubai Safari Park consists of several areas: Safari Village, Arabian and Asian Village, picnic and hiking area, as well as African Village. </p><h2>  Safari Park Tour </h2><p>  First, tourists enter the Arab village - they are transported in small trains with open windows to the habitats of wild animals.  Here you can meet a married couple of wolves, business ostriches, horned ungulates, etc.  Gazelles lie right on the road, preventing tourists from following the route. </p><p>  Then the excursionists enter the Asian village - here you have to move on foot.  Here is the Theater.  Tourists will be able to watch a couple of flashy gibbons, Himalayan bears and crocodiles. </p><p>  Most of all expectations from the Safari zone - tourists will be able to ride on buses to the habitats of unique animals.  Giraffes and lions, tigers and zebras, hippos and other species - a meeting with such representatives of the animal world will remain in the memory of tourists for a long time. </p><p>  To all of the above, it remains only to add that a desert safari is an amazing adventure that should take pride of place in the memory box. </p>
