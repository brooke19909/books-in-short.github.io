    <h2>  Postal transfer </h2><p>  One of the oldest and most proven ways to send money to Ukraine is a regular postal order.  To do this, you need to have a passport, money, and the contact details of the recipient (his last name, first name, middle name and full home address).  If there are problems with the address, you can make a demand transfer, but for this you will have to find out at least the post office index. </p><p>  In other countries, mail transfer will reach in the same way as in Ukraine.  You can send money using the services of the “Russian Post” through the nearest branch.  The negative sides of this method are a rather high commission (about 8%) and a low transfer rate (more than two weeks). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transfer to a current account </h2><p>  If you have a <span>bank account</span> , then the question of how to transfer money to Ukraine is solved quite easily.  This can be done by <span>bank transfer</span> to the beneficiary's account, of course, provided that you know him.  It is very important that the sender and the recipient have accounts opened in the same currency. </p><p>  In this case, the SWIFT payment system is very convenient, which allows forwarding, although not very quickly (up to five <span>banking days),</span> but rather inexpensively.  A feature of this system is that the commission for services is charged from the sender (1–5%) and from the recipient (0.5–2%).  You will also have to pay a commission from a transit bank (1–5%) if the money is sent from a financial institution that does not have a <span>correspondent account of the</span> Bank of Ukraine.  However, here you can trick a little: in order not to pay a commission when withdrawing money, you need to open a “call deposit” deposit, which allows you to withdraw funds at any time, and transfer it there, and not to the current account. </p>

Use the Internet banking system for this.  Such a service as round-the-clock access to accounts and operations with them is provided by every self-respecting bank today, and the payee's bank details (except for a current account, of course) can be easily found on its official website.

You can use international money transfer systems, such as: </p><ul><li>  Western Union - the commission will be 3% if the transfer is urgent, and 0.5% when you are in no hurry. </li><li>  MoneyGram - will take an additional 2.5% with a minimum commission of 2.5 €. </li><li>  Anelik - will take from you 2% of the transfer amount. </li><li>  Contact - will also offer to pay an additional 2%. </li><li>  Unistream - ask for a little less (from 1 to 1.5%). </li><li>  “Golden Crown” - the commission here is even less (from 0.5 to 1%). </li></ul><p>  However, it should be borne in mind that the larger the transfer amount, the lower and more loyal the tariff will be offered to you. </p>

    <h2>  Transfer through the terminal </h2><p>  Some money transfer systems partner with the QIWI terminal network.  It is possible to make transfers from Russia to Ukraine through such “columns” almost instantly, in addition, you can also send money to Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, etc. </p><p>  For example, a money transfer of PrivatMoney via QIWI-wallet to other CIS countries is carried out as quickly as to Ukraine.  It is very simple to send money in this way, you only need to have a current account in Privatbank, know the name of the recipient, the country of his residence.  To send money, you need to select the "Money Transfers" section in any QIWI terminal, then PrivatMoney and fill out a special form.  After that, the sender will receive an SMS indicating the cipher, which must be reported to the recipient.  If, when filling out the form, you enter the recipient’s mobile phone number, he will also receive an SMS notification that the money has arrived.  Money will be sent from Russia in rubles, and US dollars will be delivered to Ukraine.  Delivery is carried out almost instantly, and the commission will be about 2%. </p>
