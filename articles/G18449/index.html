The most popular hotels in Cancun are a real fairy tale, regardless of their "star". </p><p>  <strong>Fiesta Americana Grand Coral Beach (5</strong> <strong>stars</strong> <strong>)</strong> </p><p>  This is a modern, chic hotel, considered central in Cancun.  Everything shines here like in a fairy tale.  The hotel staff is first-class, qualified and polite.  <span>The suites are</span> surprisingly large and comfortable.  However, the standard rooms are equipped with all modern amenities.  Some rooms have sea views.  Here you will be provided with a full range of hotel services and will provide all the conditions for an upscale vacation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the hotel you will find an excellent spa center, the latest equipped gym and tennis court, a beautiful pool and a magnificent amazingly clean and beautiful beach. </p><p>  The hotel stretches along the promenade, which is very picturesque and romantic.  All hotels in Cancun are very well and harmoniously fit into the surrounding nature. </p><p>  Guests can enjoy local and French dishes at the local restaurant.  Breakfast in the restaurant is free of charge on the basis of the "buffet". </p><p>  <strong>Radisson Hotel Hacienda Cancun (5</strong> <strong>stars</strong> <strong>)</strong> </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>  The hotel is located in a residential area in the city center, very close to local attractions.

It is located away from the routes of mass movement of tourists and city noise. </p><p>  Here you will enjoy impeccable service, magnificent, simply chic, rooms with all amenities.  Here you will find air conditioning and even <span>ironing boards,</span> as well as all the equipment that vacationers may need. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel is surrounded by magnificent landscapes that make the rest especially enjoyable.

Day and evening you can visit the restaurant with first-class cuisine. </p><p>  <strong>Holiday Inn Express Cancun Zona Hotelera (3</strong> <strong>stars</strong> <strong>)</strong> </p><p>  This hotel is located in the center of Cancun Recreation Area. </p><p>  It features a fitness room with a lot of cardiovascular equipment, an outdoor pool, free breakfasts, and wireless Internet. </p><p>  All hotels in Cancun have a very high level of service and practically do not cause complaints from tourists.  You can, of course, find single negative reviews (such as about the Dreams Cancun 5 * and Holiday Inn CANCUN ARENAS 4 * hotels), but it‚Äôs not worth drawing conclusions on them that the hotels are not good enough.  No wonder Cancun belongs to the <span>best resorts in the world.</span> </p>
