    <h2>  The origin and characteristics of Lake Amut </h2><p>  According to scientists, this reservoir was formed as a result of a landslide that blocked the river.  Thus formed Lake Amut.  <span>Khabarovsk Territory</span> can no longer boast of such a clean reservoir.  Its average depth is 12 - 15 meters, and the maximum depth is about 70 meters.  And the total area of ​​the lake is 450 by 130 meters. </p><p>  As a result of rapid water exchange, this pond warms up very slowly.  The best time for swimming in Lake Amut is mid-July and until the end of August.  During this period, the water warms up to 17 - 18 degrees Celsius. </p><p>  For the same reason, Lake Amut is not rich in fish.  She simply has nothing to eat.  But the nature around the lake fascinates with the beauty of even a sophisticated tourist and traveler. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amut lake" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/1527421.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Amut Lake, Khabarovsk Territory: how to get </h2><p>  To get to this place, first of all, you need to get to Komsomolsk-on-Amur.  From there, take a bus to the village of Gorny or Solnechny.  And from there it is recommended to transfer to an SUV, since a mountainous rocky road is laid to the lake.  You can, of course, walk a distance of about 7 - 10 kilometers and walk or use a bicycle.  But, despite such difficulties, Lake Amut attracts many tourists all year round. </p><h2>  Reviews about this place </h2><p>  You can find a lot of reviews about Amut Lake and its unique Amut Snow Lake camp site.  And they are all very controversial.  Almost all the reviews speak of the magnificent nature, the purest mountain air, a wonderful sports vacation, especially in the winter season.  But the reviews regarding the camp site are quite contradictory.  Many argue that the service at the camp site leaves much to be desired, while others, on the contrary, are delighted with a comfortable stay.  Most reviews say that you can spend a day at the camp site, but staying overnight is not advisable.  Therefore, everyone must decide how to relax. </p>
