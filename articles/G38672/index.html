    <p>  ASUS is able to make quality gadgets.  If you like the best games for your Windows tablet, then pay attention to the interesting Transformer Book T100HA model.  The manufacturer awarded its offspring a new, modern Atom x5 Z8500 chip, which allows you to work with demanding programs.  RAM is only 2000 MB, which is one of the disadvantages of gadgets.  The model also does not please the internal memory - 32 GB.  The situation can correct memory cards.  The screen here is 10.1-inch, made using IPS technology, the resolution is 1280x600 pixels.  It is quite clear, but the sun does not have enough brightness, so you have to peer.  The manufacturer did not save, but on the cameras, installing a 5 MP module (main).  The front camera is only 2 MP, but this is quite enough for Skype.  Really happy with the USB 3.1 port, which demonstrates excellent speed.  There is also HDMI, which allows you to connect the tablet to TVs and monitors.  The manufacturer claims 12 hours of battery life at medium loads, which is very pleasing. </p><p>  For the model, the user will have to pay more than 20,000 rubles.  The kit also includes a removable keyboard that can help out on long trips.  From user reviews, it becomes clear that the main drawback is 2 GB of RAM.  Otherwise, the tablet is the best option for purchase today. </p><h2>  Lenovo ThinkPad 8 128Gb </h2>

    <p>  Lenovo was one of the first to install Windows on its devices.  To date, the company introduces the market some of the best tablets with this OS.  The best tablets on Windows 10 are hard to imagine without models from this company. </p><p>  Recently, the ThinkPad 8 appeared on the shelves, which was positioned as a solution for students.  The device turned out optimal sizes.  The screen is not the largest, but it‚Äôs convenient to use.  The diagonal is 8.3 inches, the display is made using IPS technology and is coated with gloss.  A clear and rich picture is provided by FullHD resolution.  The "heart" of the model was the 4-core Atom Z3770 processor, clocked at 2400 MHz.  The manufacturer pleased the user with a capacious 128 GB drive, and even support for memory cards.  But I would like more RAM - only 2 GB.  There are all modern wireless interfaces, but you will have to go online via Wi-Fi or a third-party modem.  There is an HDMI port, but unfortunately there is no separate USB.  Over time, the battery is in good order.  Even with severe loads, the device demonstrates autonomy up to 7 hours. </p><p>  The cost of the ThinkPad 8 is about 25,000 rubles, which is quite expensive, despite the wide functionality.  In general, users respond positively about the tablet.  However, many call the disadvantage of uncomfortable touch screen operation. </p><h2>  4Good T100i WiFi 32Gb </h2>

For user needs, only 1 GB is available, of which the operating system takes part.  Due to the small volume, brakes and freezes often occur. </p><p>  The internal drive is 32 GB, which also can not be called ideal capacity.  However, the volume can be increased by another 64 GB using memory cards.  Two cameras are installed, and on the main one you can take good pictures thanks to 5 MP.  Front only 2 MP, which is enough only for video calls.  The disadvantages include the lack of a full USB port.  The battery is installed at 6000 mAh, which is enough for 4 hours of serious work. </p><p>  The cost of the tablet does not exceed 9000 rubles, which makes it almost the most affordable in the segment.
