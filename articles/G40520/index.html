Almost the entire history of the country since its separation from Colombia is inextricably linked with the Panama Canal.  This building is rightfully considered one of the most important in the history of mankind, as it allowed ships to get from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic without having to go around the whole continent - South America.  And can you show where the capital of Panama is on a world map?  For those who do not know - on the shore of the bay, a little east of the entrance to the <span>Panama Canal.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="panama city" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/437751.jpg" width="508"></div>

    <h2>  Capital of panama </h2><p>  The main city of the country (the inhabitants call it Panama City) is a modern metropolis with more than a million people, where a significant part of the largest enterprises of the state is concentrated.  In addition, many large international corporations have headquarters in Panama City, and the city is rightly considered the most important cultural and educational center of Central America.  In recent years, the already extremely diverse population of Panama City began to replenish at the expense of Indians from neighboring villages, emigrants from Arab states and India, as well as thousands of pensioners from the United States of America and many countries of Europe.  The latter circumstance is another confirmation that this city is considered the safest and most comfortable for living in the <span>western hemisphere.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the capital of panama is" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/437748.jpg" width="415"></div>

Due to its favorable location, the city soon became a major shopping center on the border of two continents.  However, in the second half of the seventeenth century, old Panama was burned to the ground almost as a result of an attack by English pirates, and it was restored only several years later, seven kilometers from its former place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="panama city" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/437749.jpg" width="517"></div>  The first impetus that led to the rapid economic development of the capital was received in 1848, when gold was found in California, and the city became a transit point for those heading to the <span>west coast of the United States of America.</span>  And its true heyday began with the construction of the Panama Canal.  In <span>addition, the capital of</span> Panama experienced a banking boom during the seventies and eighties of the last century, which was associated with the opening of branches of most major world banks.

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  The capital of Panama is a great place for relaxation and excursions, especially since there are many interesting sights.  Of particular interest are the ruins of Panamo Viejo - what remains of the medieval <span>Spanish city</span> after the pirate attack.  Despite the past centuries, these ruined houses, ramparts and temples make a rather strong impression and allow us to imagine what a flourishing city was the "first" Panama.  An excursion to Casco Viejo, the old city from where the modern capital of Panama originates, will be no less interesting.  Many colonial-era structures have been preserved there, and most of the city‚Äôs museums are located, including the Panama Canal Museum.  In addition, in Casco Viejo you can see the elegant snow-white palace of Palacio de las Garzas, which today is the residence of the president of the country, and the main cathedral of the state is the Metropolitan.  Also, tourists should visit the Opera House, or at least examine <span>this building</span> from the outside, as it is one of the oldest and most colorful in the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the capital of panama on the map" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/437747.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Panama is a holiday city!  There are several hundred clubs, bars and discos.  The main entertainment area extends along the new promenade, where in the mornings you can meet hundreds of jogging and cycling enthusiasts.  In general, bicycles are very popular in Panama.  For example, tourists are happy to go to the gateway of the Panama Canal - Miraflores, next to which is the artificial spit El Casuwei to ride on a rented tandem or a single bike.  During such a journey, they have a unique opportunity to admire the panorama of Panama, spread out on one side of the spit, and the views of the canal through which giant ships sail.  But nature lovers can get real pleasure by going on a funicular tour through the rainforest of Ramboa Rain Forest. </p><h2>  The festival </h2><p>  However, to really have fun in Panama, you need to come there at the end of winter - the beginning of spring, when the whole country is having fun and dancing, rejoicing at the Humbo Rumba Carnival.  The main part of the events of this colorful celebration takes place in the Old Town, where cheerful performances are played right on the streets, and the residents of Panama City and the city guests who joined them tirelessly pour water over each other and showered with confetti. </p>
