  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Polyunsaturated fatty acids - biological value.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Polyunsaturated fatty acids in the structure of their molecules have double bonds.  Aliphatic acids, in which double bonds are localized at the 3rd carbon atom, on the methyl end, are called polyunsaturated fatty acids.  The most studied fatty acids of this class are Œ±-linoleic, eicosaghexaenoic, clupadonic, eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids.  We can say that these <span>carboxylic acids</span> are the building material that is necessary for the construction of cell membranes.  Most scientists believe that more than 80 percent of the population of our country consumes insufficient polyunsaturated fatty acids.  The population of many CIS countries consumes a significant amount of refined (synthetic) fats, while natural fats occupy second place.  This leads to the fact that our body is simply not able to absorb transformed fats, in addition, they have a carcinogenic effect. </p><p>  …∑-3 fatty acids cannot be formed in the body.  They come to us only with food, and they are also called essential or essential fatty acids.  Greenland is a scientific center for the study of the biological role of these acids.  It is scientifically proven that the Eskimos who live in this territory have a low cholesterol concentration.  They rarely register myocardial infarction, vascular atherosclerosis, and arterial hypertension.  Researchers have found that about 16 grams of fish oil is included in the daily diet of local residents.  This suggests that it is he who should have a beneficial effect on the heart and blood vessels. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Polyunsaturated fats are essential for human health.  Regular use of œâ-3 acids prevents the development of various pathologies of blood vessels, heart, and digestive tract, positively affects sperm function, optimizes lipid metabolism, blood pressure, helps with migraines, and accelerates <span>wound healing.</span>  In fish products, vegetable <span>oils (rapeseed,</span> linseed), vegetables (spinach, cabbage, beans, nuts), there are a lot of essential fatty acids.  Another option to replenish their deficit is to take various biological additives and pharmaceuticals.  When used, you can fully provide your body with these extremely necessary compounds.  The most popular additives on the pharmaceutical market are Katranol +, Eikonol, Polyen, Poseidonol, Energomax Reishi Omega-3, etc. </p><p>  Polyunsaturated fatty acids are an integral part of phospholipids.  These biocompounds exhibit antitumor properties.  Therefore, their lack leads to various anomalies in the structure of cell membranes.  Polyunsaturated fatty acids are used to prevent neoplasms in the body.  You should not abuse such drugs, before starting the course you need to consult with specialists, since there are a number of contraindications regarding their use.  Polyunsaturated fatty acids are not recommended for people with allergic reactions to fish products, liver dysfunction, <span>hemorrhagic syndrome,</span> children under seven years of age.  Side effects include: disturbances in the functioning of the digestive system (constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting).  The taste of <span>fish oil</span> in the mouth can be easily removed with bread, fruit, pickles and juices.  People taking drugs containing polyunsaturated fatty acids claim that their well-being has improved, the functioning of the digestive system has normalized, and the concentration of cholesterol in the blood has decreased as a result of laboratory tests. </p>
