At this moment, you may find yourself in a difficult situation, because it‚Äôs good if you had to call just because of boredom, and if you need to urgently call a taxi, because you do not have time for an important meeting or train. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="no money on balance" class="if uuid-2842132" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105510/2842132.jpg"></div><p>  How to call if there is no money on the phone with a MTS SIM card?  To make the life of subscribers more comfortable and better, the mobile operator has developed a special group of services called ‚ÄúOpportunities at zero‚Äù, knowing about which you can contact a person even without money in the account.  The Opportunity at Zero structure includes five different services: Help out, Positive Zero, Promised payment, Top up my account, and Full trust.  Below we consider in more detail each of them. </p><h2>  Service "Help out" </h2><p>  Any MTS subscriber, if there is a question, how to call, if there is no money on the phone, can use this service.  It makes it possible to make a call not only at zero, but also with a negative account balance.  To do this, dial on your phone a combination of four digits 0880 and send a call.  Next you need to follow the prompts of the autoinformer.  The essence of the service is to make a call at the expense of the subscriber to whom the call will be made.  "Help out" does not need to connect and disconnect, the service is provided free of charge and automatically. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Promised payment" </h2><p>  This service is especially relevant at the moment when the balance on the phone very soon becomes zero or has already become, and this raises the question of how to make a call if there is no money on the phone.  Having ordered the Promised Payment service, the MTS mobile operator instantly replenishes the account of its subscriber for an amount of 20 rubles or more.  The maximum amount depends on the tariff plan and the total cost of the client for mobile communications.  After a week, the debt should be paid back together with the commission, which also depends on the amount of payment.  To replenish an account using this service, you need to use the USSD - command - * 111 * 123 # and press send call </p><h2>  "In full confidence" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.makeuseof.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="important conversation" class="if uuid-2842138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105510/2842138.jpg"></div><p>  This service will allow you to forget about the question of how to call, if there is no money on the phone, for a long time.  Its essence is the ability to communicate on credit on an ongoing basis, that is, with a minus on the balance, you can safely call any subscriber, as well as use the Internet.  The maximum limit of the negative balance depends on the tariff plan and the amount of expenses per month.  To activate the service, you need to dial the following combination on your phone: * 111 * 32 # and the call key. </p><h2>  "Top up my account" </h2><p>  This option allows you not to think about how to make a phone call without money, but to send a free message to a subscriber of any Russian operator with a request to replenish your account.  In order to use this opportunity, you need to send a request from your phone to the number * 116 * the number of the subscriber, whom we ask you to top up, # and the call key. </p><h2>  "Call me back" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="m.blogs.christianpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="telephone call" class="if uuid-2842131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105510/2842131.jpg"></div><p>  In the event that the subscriber cannot contact the person he needs on his own, you can send a beacon: a message asking "Call me back, please."  The service is free, to activate it, you need to dial the combination: * 110 * number of the subscriber to be contacted, # and the call key. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Out of money on the phone?  How to call in such a situation?  The mobile operator MTS allows its subscribers to communicate even in such moments.  Therefore, do not worry if the money runs out at the wrong time. </p>
