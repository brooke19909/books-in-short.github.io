This is an important question for everyone who plays with plastic beauties or cares about their wardrobe.  And it‚Äôs not at all necessary to be a little girl.  Puppets are loved by both children and adults.  Not only daughters, but also their mothers are happy to sheathe the little princess. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jacket dolls" class="if uuid-3113668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3113668.jpg"></div><h2>  Favorite toy </h2><p>  The doll is the most favorite toy among all generations.  What forms she does not accept.  Matryoshka dolls, tumblers, talking baby dolls smoothly changed to more modern ladies: Barbie, Monster High, LOL dolls and interior beauties.  And each of them has its own style and a unique world: Barbie's pink romance, the impudent teenage mystical atmosphere of Monster High, the tenderness and tenderness of a big-legged doll. </p><p>  Having bought or received a doll as a gift, every small or adult owner wants to take care of her: make hairstyles, equip a doll house, sew fashionable and beautiful clothes.  How to sew a jacket for a doll is an important issue.  The main thing in this process is to stock up with desire, inspiration and various shreds, and a pretty new thing will soon appear in the wardrobe of the little fashionista. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="doll in a sweater" class="if uuid-3113764" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3113764.jpg"></div><h2>  Sewing procedure for doll wardrobe </h2><p>  Before opening your own tailoring atelier, you should decide for which plastic beauty this thing will be made.  If the doll is large, then the role of a blouse can be a sweater or a payte of a grown child who sat down during washing.  A doll jacket can not only be sewn, but also knitted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After choosing a doll, you should decide on a model of clothing.  What are you going to sew: a jacket, a hoodie or a sweatshirt?  Before you sew a jacket for a doll, you need to make sure that all the necessary items are cooked.  Before sewing, you should do the following things: </p><ul><li>  take measurements from a doll; </li><li>  make a pattern in full growth; </li><li>  pick up the material. </li></ul><p>  Choosing a fabric for a new thing, it is worth starting from the desired model.  Jackets for dolls are sewn from more elastic dense fabrics, and jackets from jeans and pants.  Bright socks can be used for sewing a thin sweater or sweatshirts with a hood.  It is convenient to work with such textiles.  "Socks" clothes look interesting to whom they are convenient for use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Doll in a sweatshirt" class="if uuid-3113761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3113761.jpg"></div><h2>  Barbie Doll Sizes </h2><p>  Barbie is the most frequent guest and a member of the family in almost every house where the girls live.  Each young lady received a welcome blonde beauty as a present.  In this regard, the first thing we will consider is how to sew a jacket for a Barbie doll.  To make the correct pattern, you need to take measurements from the "client". </p><p>  Among the inexpensive models there are Barbie with such forms: </p><ul><li>  height - 29 cm; </li><li>  chest girth - 14 cm; </li><li>  1 chest width - 6.5 cm; </li><li>  2 chest width-8 cm; </li><li>  back width - 6 cm; </li><li>  hip circumference - 12.5 cm; </li><li>  neck circumference - 6 cm; </li><li>  from the base of the neck to the shoulder - 2 cm; </li><li>  from the base of the neck to the chest line at the back - 4 cm; </li><li>  from the base of the neck to the waist at the back - 6.5 cm. </li></ul><p>  To create a suitable pattern, you will need a sheet of paper, preferably in a box, a simple pencil, an eraser and a ruler. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Doll sweatshirt" class="if uuid-3113760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3113760.jpg"></div><h2>  Step-by-step master class </h2><p>  Before you sew a jacket for a doll, you need to cut it out on a piece of paper.  Acting strictly according to the scheme, even a beginner can draw out the exact patterns for the doll: </p><ol><li>  In the middle of the checkered sheet, draw a vertical line. </li><li>  On a vertical line, draw two horizontal lines parallel to each other, at a distance from the desired length of the future sweater. </li><li>  Mark the point on top of the vertical line bordering the horizontal.  We apply the place of the neck.  To do this, divide the neck circumference into two.  If the OR is 6 cm, mark 3 cm, 1.5 centimeters on each side of the vertical line. </li><li>  Step back 4 cm - the length of the neck, and draw a horizontal line.  Thus, the shoulders loom on the pattern.  Do not forget to measure the desired width of the shoulders and mark on the pattern. </li><li>  Down, from the shoulder line, we retreat 4 cm. We draw a line.  From the line mark the width, chest circumference.  When building the shelf, we divide the resulting measurement into two: Exhaust gas - 14 cm, which means 14: 2 = 7 cm. It results in a half-girth of the chest. </li><li>  The armholes can be drawn by eye. </li><li>  We measure the width of the doll clothes by eye, if desired.  If the jacket is fitted to the hips, then at the bottom of the pattern we measure the half circumference of the hips: we divide OB by two, for example: 12.5 cm: 2 = 6.25 cm. </li><li>  Having drawn the pattern, we apply the doll to the paper, "trying on" a pattern on our model. </li><li>  We carefully cut out the pattern and proceed to sewing clothes. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="babiki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern sweatshirts for barbie" class="if uuid-3113792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3113792.jpg"></div><h2>  How to sew a jacket for a doll with your own hands </h2><p>  Before making clothes, the needlewoman must have experience with tools such as a sewing machine, needle and scissors.  If you have such a skill, you can safely proceed to the creation of a new puppet wardrobe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  First, we will prepare the necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  sweatshirt pattern; </li><li>  fabric, shreds; </li><li>  remnant or chalk; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  pins </li><li>  needle, thread; </li><li>  sewing machine. </li></ul><p>  Work algorithm: </p><ol><li>  We select the right fabric.  It should be smooth and smooth.  For tailoring a warm blouse, fleece, velvet, velor, knitwear are suitable.  We impose a pattern on the prepared patch, fasten it with a pin and carefully outline with remnant or chalk. </li><li>  We cut the workpiece with sharp scissors, not forgetting the seam allowances.  With manual sewing - 5 mm, with sewing stitch - at least 7 mm. </li><li>  Sew the cut parts manually or sew on a typewriter. </li><li>  Do not forget about the clasp.  It can be located at the back, on the back, or in front of the sweatshirt, depending on your preferences and on the model of clothing. </li><li>  To sew the sleeve, we attach a piece of the flap to Barbie‚Äôs hand, fix it with pins and carefully draw the desired length and width.  Cut out the part.  Sew on the wrong side of the sleeve edge and sew it to the jacket. </li><li>  We turn the thing on the front side.  The edges of the sleeves can be sewn with a blind seam, or decorated with a cuff, ribbon or lace. </li><li>  The neck of the sweatshirt is processed by sharpening or decorated with a collar.  To make a collar, cut it out on paper.  To do this, circle the neck of the jacket on the sheet, draw the desired model of the collar and cut it out.  Sew to the neck from the inside. </li></ol><p>  The new blouse for Barbie is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="konstanna.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater barbie" class="if uuid-3113749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3113749.jpg"></div><h2>  Sock sweater </h2><p>  Consider the simplest way to make a doll jacket from socks.  Your dresser must have some interesting socks without a pair.  From them pretty cute and unpretentious doll sweatshirts can turn out. </p><p>  So, before you sew a jacket for a doll, you need to put the following items on the desktop: </p><ul><li>  sock; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  needle and thread. </li></ul><p>  To make the product you need to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Cut off the top of the toe above the heel area. </li><li>  The gum position will be the part wrapping around Barbie‚Äôs shoulders.  Below the elastic should be noted the line of the sleeves. </li><li>  Make scissors cuts on the sleeves on the toe.  From the wrong side, sew the cuts of the sleeves manually.  The fabric of the sock is very elastic and will perfectly embrace both the body and arms of the pupa. </li><li>  The edges of the clothes need to be sewn or trimmed with a ribbon.  A cute turtleneck or sweater for the beautiful Barbie will complement a fashionable wardrobe. </li></ol><h2>  New clothes for "Monster High" </h2><p>  The bright and unusual doll "Monster High" is an image of a daring, mystical schoolgirl from the fantasy world.  Her wardrobe is dominated by things with the image of evil spirits, skeletons and other Gothic paraphernalia.  Pretty cute clothes come across, but more often than not, the doll‚Äôs cabinet is filled with flashy colors and original models.  We offer to complement the doll wardrobe and sew a jacket with a hood for the doll. </p><p>  You need to choose the color of the material depending on the style demonstrated by Monster High.  It can be black, gray, blue and bright pink fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hoodie for monster high" class="if uuid-3113739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3113739.jpg"></div><h2>  Sweatshirt for Monster High </h2><p>  Before you sew a jacket for a doll "Monster High", you need to build a pattern. </p><p>  A drawing of a sweatshirt is constructed in the same way as a sweater pattern for a Barbie doll, but taking into account the characteristics of the Monster High parameters.  The sizes and shapes of the mystic lady are slightly different from the figures of the American blonde - fashionistas. </p><p>  Dimensions "Monster High": </p><ul><li>  breast volume - 7.5 cm; </li><li>  width under the chest - 5.5 cm; </li><li>  waist volume - 6 cm; </li><li>  thigh volume - 10 cm; </li><li>  line from shoulder to waist - 3 cm; </li><li>  arm length from shoulder to hand - 6 cm. </li></ul><p>  Necessary materials to create a new thing: </p><ul><li>  fabric of two colors: for sweatshirt and trim (hood, pockets, cuffs); </li><li>  needle and thread, sewing machine; </li><li>  pins </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  tissue marker or chalk; </li><li>  pattern. </li></ul><p>  Step-by-step instruction on how to sew a hoodie for a doll: </p><ol><li>  Fold evenly ironed fabric with the front side inward.  Apply a pattern from above: front shelves, back, sleeves.  Circle the patterns with a marker.  Cut the back on the fold of the fabric, so that you get not two parts, but one. </li><li>  Cut the details with sharp scissors, not forgetting the allowances for 0.5 cm seams. Connect with pins and gently sweep with large stitches. </li><li>  Sew blanks manually or by machine.  Unscrew on the front side and sew 1 mm from the shoulder seam, on two shelves. </li><li>  Fold the cuffs in half, attach the front side to the bottom of the sleeve.  Then make a seam. </li><li>  Stitch the top okat in the same way to the armhole of the jacket. </li><li>  To tailor the hood, you need to measure the neck.  First, draw a line on a piece of paper and use a protractor to draw a semicircle of the hood.  From the fabric, cut two parts.  Stitch facing inwards and weld with a zigzag or overlock. </li><li>  Stitch the hood to the sweatshirt and process the seam. </li><li>  Cut patch pockets.  They can have both a square shape and a semicircular shape.  Sew oblique or even sections of pockets beforehand, and then, bending the edges by 0, 2 cm, sew to the jacket.  Lay a seam on top. </li><li>  At the bottom of the sweatshirt, sew on an elastic band or a hem according to the cuff principle. </li><li>  As a fastener use a small "zipper", Velcro, hooks. </li><li>  Without a hood and a fastener, you will get a sweatshirt for the doll.  To do this, you need to tailor and stitch the front shelves according to the method of cutting the back. </li><li>  You can decorate the jacket with beads, sequins. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="play.monsterhigh.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hoodie for monster high" class="if uuid-3113770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3113770.jpg"></div><h2>  Dolls for beauty </h2><p>  Interior dolls are becoming very popular among lovers of "little princesses" of older age.  Dolls for the interior are not so much entertainment and play as a cute decor, which is handled very carefully. </p><p>  Interior dolls are divided into several types: </p><ul><li>  soft grandiose; </li><li>  porcelain young ladies; </li><li>  knitted amigurumi; </li><li>  graceful rags; </li><li>  pumpkin head. </li></ul><p>  Many of these sophisticated princesses are quite fragile and not suitable as a children's toy.  They are collected or used in the interior. </p><h2>  How to sew a jacket to an interior doll </h2><p>  The Piggy - a doll girl with a pretty face made of soft materials, earned its name by the size of its large feet.  You can play and change clothes with your little foot without fear of damaging it.  You can sew a sweater for a doll-millipede, using the recommendations described above.
