    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  As a material, the developers used ordinary plastic.  Also, the device has a fringe made for metal.  The design is made pretty well: it doesn‚Äôt play anything, it doesn‚Äôt creak or stagger.  The device lies perfectly in the hand, does not slip and is good to the touch.  The unpleasant minus of the Micromax Canvas Spark Q380: the cover for it is quite difficult to find. </p><p>  On the front panel there is a gadget screen.  Above the display is a conversational speaker, a front camera, a light indicator and <span>a proximity sensor,</span> under the display are three touch keys without backlight. </p><p>  The left side of the device is empty, while on the right is the volume rocker and the device shutdown button.  At the bottom there is a micro-USB slot and a microphone, at the top there is a 3.5 mm headset jack.  Two slots - for SIM cards and a slot for memory cards - are located under the back cover;  the battery cannot be removed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the rear panel is the main camera, LED flash and music speaker.  The overall dimensions of the device are 68.9x137.9x8.5 mm and weighs 134 g. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  In size, the display reaches 4.7 inches.  The screen has an IPS matrix, which allows it to achieve bright and clear color reproduction.  Also, this technology does not allow the screen to fade under light or direct sunlight and maintains decent viewing angles, which is why the information on the display can be seen from different angles. </p><p>  Perhaps the biggest drawback of the screen is the resolution, which is only 960x540 here.  So when watching videos and in games, owners will not be able to enjoy high-quality and smooth HD images.  Pixels are highly traced in the video, which makes the picture less attractive.  A similar flaw is almost invisible on static images, but in dynamics they produce blur. </p>

    <p>  The multi-touch here is set quite modest and supports only 2 touches.  Only suitable for scaling pages and photos. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The screen glass is protected by <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3 technology, so do not be afraid of scratches or falls of the device.  Unfortunately, fingerprints are very noticeable on the display, and without using a special protective film, the fingers on the sensor are somewhat sticky, so the operation of the device may not be quite comfortable. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The Micromax Canvas Spark Q380 smartphone has a <span>MediaTek MT6582M</span> quad-core processor running at 1300 GHz.  Also, 1 GB of RAM is responsible for the processing of information, and the Mali-400 MP2 video accelerator is responsible for the graphics.  At the disposal of users 8 GB of memory for data storage, which is expandable using microSD flash drives up to 32 GB.  The platform uses Android 5.0.  Among other technologies, the gadget has support for 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, USB and GPS networks. </p><h2>  Apps and games </h2><p>  For a budget device, the filling of the model is quite acceptable.  The presence of the Android 5.0 platform is encouraging, but there are clearly not enough technical characteristics for working with TOP toys and advanced programs.  During the use of demanding games, there is a shortage of system resources, which is why graphic images that should look colored are displayed as dark faceless objects - watching this is not entirely pleasant. </p><p>  As for the main software - navigation, the Internet and so on - here Micromax Canvas Spark Q380 8 GB does its job perfectly.  Routes on maps are laid instantly, satellites are quickly located, pages on the network are displayed quite quickly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The main camera installed in the Micromax Canvas Spark Q380 phone has 8 megapixels, autofocus and LED flash.  Photos with proper lighting are worthy, so they can be printed or expanded on a large screen.  Macro shooting works great, I was also impressed with a wide range of various functions such as white balance, contrast, brightness, panorama and other interesting options that are useful during shooting.  With a shortage of light, optics shoot much worse. </p>

    <p>  The front camera has a much more modest resolution: only 2 megapixels.  This is enough to take a modest selfie picture and make a video conference, but the quality leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  As for the video, the Micromax Canvas Spark Q380 Black can make videos in HD-resolution, but only at 15 frames / s.  From which it follows that to achieve high quality shooting will not succeed: the image will slow down pretty much.  Highlight the good work of macro photography. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The speakers are quite loud, so there will be no problems with talking or listening to music.  The sound reproduction level is above average.  The player cannot be compared with mp3 gadgets, but it is quite suitable for listening to tracks in standard quality.  A nice feature is that <span>vacuum headphones are</span> supplied with the gadget <span>,</span> but you should not flatter yourself, since they are entry-level. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery here is mediocre, only 2000 mAh, but it is worth noting that the screen resolution is quite low, and the characteristics of the system are not the most impressive, so the battery sits down quite slowly.  The developers assure that in the talk mode the device is able to work up to 7 hours, and in standby mode - up to 335. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Micromax Canvas Spark Q380, a review of which reveals its pros and cons, is a budget device worth 5390-6990 rubles.  Although the gadget looks stylish, has a bright screen and good technical specifications, the lack of HD resolution is the most significant drawback that makes the smartphone unsuitable for games and watching movies, at least that's what the reviews say.  Micromax Canvas Spark Q380 provides good color reproduction and viewing angles - everything looks great, but these advantages fade without high resolution.  Most competitors in this price segment can boast a 720p image, and the Q380 is not easy to compete with.  There are no other obvious shortcomings, but there is nothing to praise for the device at all: everything is pretty standard, without any outstanding indicators.  We only note loud sound and a good camera device. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Micromax</span> Canvas Spark Q380 Reviews: Pros and Cons </h2><p>  There are practically no complaints about the assembly of users, however, units indicate a small backlash.  The device lies comfortably in the hand, a matte surface that does not collect fingerprints was also noted.  The paint from the frame gradually peels off.  Due to the non-removable battery, the device looks thinner and more convenient to use.  There is only a slight minus in the case of the Micromax Canvas Spark Q380: the case is not sold everywhere. </p><p>  Most owners are delighted with the vivid color rendition and the overall quality of the display, but all complain about the main drawback - the lack of HD.  For some, this nuance is not significant, but a larger percentage of buyers consider it a significant minus.  The dimensions of the display seemed acceptable to everyone and especially suitable for those people who are uncomfortable using devices with very large diagonals. </p><p>  As for the technical characteristics, opinions differ.  One user of iron is enough to carry out a number of basic tasks, and even to install quite powerful toys.  Also, owners praise the Android 5 platform. Others complain of constant brakes and freezes, as well as <span>incorrect</span> system <span>behavior</span> .  They believe that the device can not cope with demanding applications, and therefore it is not suitable as a smartphone. </p><p>  That's what the following reviews say: The Micromax Canvas Spark Q380 has a clear and loud speaker that produces good sound.  But not everyone liked the quality of the music played through the headphones: some consider it average, while others say that it is simply terrible. </p>

    <p>  Owners are happy with the way the battery holds the charge of the Micromax Canvas Spark Q380.  The review showed that even with the active use of various functions that require a lot of energy, the device still "lives" for a long time.  However, problems with energy replenishment were noticed: some owners note that it takes at least 3 hours to fully charge, others complain that after a couple of months of use the battery stopped charging at all. </p><p>  Most users are generally satisfied with the device.  They believe that it is worth the money, and for such an amount it would be naive to expect something more.  All the disadvantages of the device, this category of buyers refers to minor. </p><p>  But there are also negative reviews: the Micromax Canvas Spark Q380 is strongly criticized due to the lack of HD, poor sound in the headphones, the inability to change the battery, as well as incorrect multitouch operation, poor technical stuffing and long system load. </p>
