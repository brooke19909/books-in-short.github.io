It is considered the most romantic place in Sri Lanka.  Bentota is a beach that the newlyweds choose to spend their honeymoon in harmony with nature.  Judging by the reviews, beauty, originality and exoticism are merged here. </p><p>  The next in the list of the best swimming areas is Unawantuna Beach, located in the village of the same name on the highway leading from Colombo.  This place is quite popular, so you can often meet lovers of a party getaway.  Despite the fact that Unavantuna is not as wide as Bentota, the sea is calmer, and the water warms up well throughout the day.

On its west coast, the peak season falls between November and April.  At this time, however, there are strong waves in the ocean, so lovers of water sports come here more often.

At this time, the temperature rises to thirty degrees, in contrast to January-February, when only +22 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  How much will the vacation cost? </h2><p>  Sri Lanka, the prices for tours of which depend primarily on the season, as well as on the choice of hotel, in any case will give an unforgettable vacation.  And the cost of trips here is quite reasonable, because in this direction there is fierce competition of tour operators, which does not allow them to rise in price. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sri Lanka is a country in which, judging by the reviews, tourists do not need to spend much money to have a good time.  Twenty dollars a day may be enough for food and accommodation.  Of course, in the high season, tours to Sri Lanka from Moscow are much more expensive.  If in January for a six-day stay in a three-star hotel for one person the ticket will cost about 50 thousand rubles without food, then in May you will have to pay a lot more.  Tours to Sri Lanka from Moscow in the high season cost about 90 thousand rubles.  for each without meals with accommodation in a hotel with a category of 3 *, for example, in "Induruva Beach Resort". </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The hotel was built on the shores of the Indian Ocean, in the midst of palm trees and other tropical vegetation.

For sunbeds and mattresses you do not have to pay.  In addition, the beach offers a fairly wide range of entertainment for outdoor enthusiasts. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The hotel has two small pools - relatively deep for adults and a shallow one for children.  Around are umbrellas and deck chairs.  If there are waves at sea, you can have a great time here. </p><p>  For those who are primarily interested in health and beauty, a jacuzzi is provided, there is a massage room (paid service), as well as a sauna and a fitness center.  To come to Sri Lanka and not visit the spa, where you can get a course of Ayurvedic procedures, is unforgivable.

In addition, here you can play volleyball or billiards, buy sightseeing tours to local attractions. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  On the shore, tourists can rent a <span>scooter, water</span> skiing or catamaran, do bananasailing, under the supervision of instructors diving and windsurfing.

In order to have fun, young people need to go a little along the beach, where there is an entertainment center and discos are held every evening. </p><h2>  Impressions of vacationers </h2><p>  Induruwa Beach Resort 3 *, reviews about which Russians mostly leave immediately upon arrival home, in their opinion, corresponds to the declared category.  The hotel is compact with a small area that is always clean.  Tourists say the same thing about the pool, in which it is impossible to find even a fallen leaf. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Induruwa Beach Resort 3 Sri Lanka" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1067820.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Induruwa Beach Resort 3 * is located right on the beach.  It is built so close to the water that the sound of the waves is heard very clearly in the rooms.  This, of course, annoyed some, but the vast majority was enough.  A motorway passes by, there is a <span>bus stop</span> where you can leave to anywhere.  In walking distance there are many cafes and shops, there are jewelry and souvenir shops. </p><p>  Settlement is carried out quickly, if there is a free number, the registrar does not wait for the set hour, but immediately gives the keys.  The rooms are clean, cleaning staff carries out conscientiously, decorating the beds with flowers and compositions, rolled up from towels. </p><p>  And although none of the employees speaks Russian, judging by the reviews, even for those who know only a few phrases or words in English, there was not a single unresolved problem.  Communication can take place with gestures, but, most importantly, always with a smile. </p><p>  Of the minuses of the hotel, Russians note the following points: firstly, some remoteness from the airport.  A long transfer is due to traffic jams, which exhausts, especially children.  Another minus tourists call the big waves.  However, tour operators always explain that there are months in which surfers come to Sri Lanka.  Vacations are the cheapest at this time.  Another drawback, according to some, is the lack of animation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Induruwa Beach Resort 3 reviews" class="if" height="231" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1067830.jpg" width="600"></div>
