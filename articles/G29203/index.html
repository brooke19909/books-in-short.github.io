And let each conquer its own genre, but the theme of children is affected in most of them.  Surely you have more than once been fascinated by the obscure game of teenagers of about 12 years old in American TV shows.  When they spend days on end sitting in the basements of their houses with friends, dressed in strange suits and with cards in their hands.  They cry out loudly, proving something emotionally, argue, and do not want to go home at all.  What kind of board game could have so fascinated them?  Today this secret is revealed.  The game, which has conquered millions of American, French, German children and not only, is now available to our consumer.  Her name is Dixit. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  It was created relatively recently, in 2008 by Jean-Louis Rubier, but an unlicensed analogue called the Imaginarium hit the Russian market.  Its authors are our compatriots - Timur Kadyrov and Sergey Kuznetsov.  Being ardent fans of the original, the guys decided to make their own adjustments to this game and present it to the general public in 2011.  The sponsors are the company Stupid Casual, specializing in creating jokes.  Now, based on reviews of the board game Imaginarium, Cosmodrome games is responsible for the series. </p><p>  The design of the cards themselves looks gloomy and grotesque when compared with the original, but this is understandable.  After all, Marie Cardua, Xavier Collette, Clement Lefebvre worked on the creation of Dixit cards, illustrators whose works adorn mostly children's literature and postcards.  Our compatriots went further and concentrated in the imagination of more than a dozen authors.  This allowed to significantly expand the range of additions, and according to reviews, the game "Imaginarium" of the Russian version even surpassed the original. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="im-possible.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="box &quot;Imaginarium&quot;" class="if uuid-3057378" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116800/3057378.jpg"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  There is a kit, which, judging by the reviews of the Imaginarium game, includes a box, which in combination is a playing field, cards with illustrations, chips in the form of elephants and giraffes, tokens.  These are basic sets. </p><p>  Due to the loose fit of the cards, there is a place in the box, which, by the way, is not in the original version - Dixit.  This is a very convenient unplanned "expansion" that allows you to dilute the base deck of 98 cards with additions to the game. </p><p>  For example, focusing on reviews of the board game Imaginarium.  Childhood ‚Äù, users note that the sets are fully compatible, despite the fact that the equipment is the same. </p><h2>  rules </h2><p>  About the rules of the game is replete with more than one page on the Internet.  For starters, you should know this.  Information regarding the maximum participants varies, but from 2 to 7 people are considered optimal. </p><p>  Nastolka is designed for its target audience.  From 6 years and older.  Her task is to develop the imagination. </p><p>  The reviews about the Imaginarium are ambiguous, some attribute it to a game for adults with a non-standard sense of humor, some refer to a child‚Äôs game, while others still consider that only the additions to the game in children‚Äôs game.  In fact, all opinions hold.  On the box there really is a marking ‚Äúage 12+‚Äù, but depending on the issue of cards, the age limit will also vary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To begin with, we determine the number of players.  We distribute cards, chips and tokens between them - according to the rules.  Next, we determine the leader, who opens the party with a hidden picture.  He puts the card face down and voices his association aloud.  Depending on the number of guessing (guessing) points are awarded, moves are made and the right to be the leader passes to the next player. </p><p>  Reviews about the Imaginarium say that the playing field is a cloud with numbers up to 39. At the same time, some have additional markings in the form of ‚Äúcomplication icons‚Äù.  According to the rules of the game, they can be ignored, but with them it is more interesting.  When the figure appears on a cloud with an icon, depending on its direct purpose, the presenter makes a map according to the terms of marking the ‚Äúcomplicator‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.andrew-lebedinsky.com" data-author=": Andrew Lebedinsky, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Illustrations for the Imaginarium" class="if uuid-3059287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116800/3059287.jpg"></div><h2>  How to win </h2><p>  The game ends when all cards or moves on the map are over.  But as practice shows, starting, it is impossible to stop.  On average, the course lasts about 30 minutes.  Therefore, it is better to record the number of laps completed.  Winning the game is just a convention.  The rules can be specified so much that there will simply be no losers.  This is especially pronounced in the children's series of the game.  So long days and evenings of an active ‚Äúimaginarium‚Äù are provided for you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Editions for children </h2><p>  The "Childhood" series is fully adapted for children from 6 years old.  The playing field has the appearance of sea pebbles, with numbering up to 30 and its "complication icons", different from the adult version.  The rules also vary somewhat, removed fines that can upset the child and discourage the desire to play.  The illustrations are made in a positive manner and are as simple as possible to perceive.  After all, the task of the game is primarily to develop the flexibility of imagination, innovative thinking.  Understand the train of thought of the "enemy." </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.behance.net" data-author=": Victor Eredel, "><img itemprop="image" alt="series &quot;Childhood&quot;" class="if uuid-3059302" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116800/3059302.jpg"></div><h2>  For the smallest, "6+" </h2><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the release of the Imaginarium.  Soyuzmultfilm ".  This series presents pictures from famous cartoons.  They will also add variety to the game with children, because they look not of abstraction, but of specific characters.  And if you focus on reviews about the Imaginarium.  Childhood ‚Äù, the cards are quite simply deciphered. </p><p>  For beginners - the most successful solution.  The set allows you to expand the basic equipment and generates an additional series of fascinating associations.  For an adult player - an immersion in the world of childhood, positive, memories.  And the most fascinating thing is the reviews about the Imaginarium.  Childhood ‚Äùfrom adults is only positive.  Nastolka brings children closer and allows you to understand the train of thoughts of the child, to plunge into his imagination.  And who is not interested in plunging into young years or visiting once again as a kid, well, at least mentally ?! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.behance.net" data-author=": Victor Eredel, "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Imaginarium Childhood&quot;" class="if uuid-3059300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116800/3059300.jpg"></div><h2>  Imaginarium for adults </h2><p>  This can be called the predominant majority of releases and additions to the game.  The complexity and unusualness is that the series is as abstract as possible.  Additions include the following issues: </p><p>  - ‚ÄúAriadne‚Äù (2012), 98 cards.  Contains elements of famous brands in illustrations.  Generally performed in a positive manner, but not without elements of black humor.  The shirt is decorated with a judo philosopher with a maze, which looks very funny. </p><p>  ‚ÄúPandora.‚Äù  The name speaks for itself.  Perhaps the most difficult addition, because it contains ambiguous illustrations.  Each of them is able to interpret in their own way.  Consequently, it will be soon to finish the game.  Based on the reviews about the Imaginarium, we can conclude that users recommend this deck for sophisticated players. </p><p>  ‚ÄúPersephone.‚Äù  Another character in Greek mythology.  Also, one might say, a symbolic name.  Like Pandora, it is suitable for experienced players.  Contains 98 images on the eternal questions of life and death, which can be traced even in the cover illustration.  A shirt of a card deck is decorated with a strange tree surrounded by mysterious creatures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hobbyjapan.games" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="box with Imaginarium" class="if uuid-3059310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116800/3059310.jpg"></div><h2>  Special issues </h2><p>  "Chimera".  Has an age qualification of ‚Äú18+‚Äù, since it basically contains illustrations on mystical themes.  Therefore, the faint of heart and ignorant in horror is not recommended for use. </p><p>  "Odyssey".  The 2D format of illustrations is consonant with the original Dixit and complementary to the Imaginarium 3D set, as a series of pictures is repeated.  But with the original they are united only by the name.  The shirt is decorated with an illustration of a ship with unusual passengers. </p><h2>  Travel sets </h2><p>  Special attention should be paid to the mini-kit called Road Repair.  He has his own field (in the form of a puzzle), tokens and chips, but they are more likely to complement the main set.  For example, if some elements were lost.  Contains three new cards.  Convenient to travel. </p><p>  As a separate set presented "Marsupial Imaginarium."  Reviews of him say that this is a complete set with 64 cards, 36 tokens and 6 chips in the form of giraffes.  Traditionally, the box itself is the playing field, and the chips are attached to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crossroad.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cards &quot;Imaginarium&quot;" class="if uuid-3059293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116800/3059293.jpg"></div><h2>  Limited Editions </h2><p>  If you can call it that.  These are special issues, unlike the main ones in format.  One of them is the Imaginarium.  Anniversary".  Reviews indicate that the kit was released for the fifth anniversary of the game.  The developers made some changes to the rules, changed the recognizable color scheme of card shirts, and expanded the elemental series of figures.  Judging by the reviews, ‚ÄúImaginarium.  5 years ‚Äùincluded figures of duck, whale, aliens, a car, a ship and a chess horse.  The box itself contains 98 completely new illustrations and is made with cells for storing additional cards. </p><p>  About "Imaginarium 3D" reviews are only enthusiastic.  Still would.  Now, players have discovered the world of three-dimensional stereo images.  Similar illustrations, as mentioned earlier, appear in the Odyssey supplement.  Favorite game is equipped with 3D glasses, so using cards from other releases will not work.  But perhaps this is temporary.  And the world will see additions to this series. </p><h2>  On the eve of the new year </h2><p>  The gamers of the Imaginarium publishers could not deprive attention on New Year's holidays.  When the maximum number of days off, you want to have fun in your free time.  Therefore, reviews of the Imaginarium.  New Year's ‚Äùagreed that this issue as well as possible creates the atmosphere of a holiday.  That is why the set includes 64 cards collected from previous issues and additions to the stated topic.  The developers also included 7 new cards.  The set is positioned as independent, with its own field, chips and tokens.  It will not be boring! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.boardgamegeek.com" data-author=": BoardGameGeek, "><img itemprop="image" alt="game in the Imaginarium" class="if uuid-3057379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116800/3057379.jpg"></div><h2>  In conclusion </h2><p>  In addition to all of the above, the peculiarity of the additions to the Imaginarium is that the rules of the game do not change, regardless of the choice of the deck.  And if the playing field is not important, then you can play only with additions.  The reviews of the Imaginarium are broadcast: just turn on the imagination.  This is the main emphasis in the game.  Uncover the subconscious, expand the boundaries, go beyond the ordinary. </p><p>  The board game is classified as associative, so those who are not ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with the imagination have a unique opportunity to develop it in a circle of loved ones.  For introverts, a game involves a certain number of players.  So, communication skills can also be tightened, and without prejudice to their inner "I". </p><p>  Therefore, if you have many, or, conversely, few friends, or you want to know their inner world better, it‚Äôs better not to find fun.  Learn the thoughts of rivals.  Show your "imaginarium".  Do not be afraid of your thoughts - be afraid of desires!  The Imaginarium will reveal everyone from a new perspective and there will be no turning back.  You will remain a loyal follower of this game for many years. </p>
