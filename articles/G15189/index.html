Every year, in the summer season, tens of thousands of tourists come here who want to comfortably spend their holidays or vacations.  In this Zaporizhzhya town there is entertainment for every taste and age, and the hotels of Berdyansk, numerous hotels and pensions will be happy to open their doors for new arrivals. </p><h2>  About Berdyansk </h2><p>  The history of Berdyansk begins in the 1830s, when a marina was opened on the site of the current city and the first foundation was laid.  Over the next century, initially a tiny settlement was built up and expanded - educational institutions, ports, lighthouses, factories and museums were opened and modernized.  In the post-war period, cable and fiberglass plants were launched in Berdyansk.  The population in 1838 was only 3,000 people, and today, according to the latest data, more than 140,000. </p>

    <p>  Despite the status of a resort city, in Berdyansk there are enough food shops, shopping and business centers.  There is no problem with the connection: at any time you can buy a SIM card of a local mobile operator or go online via the free Wi-Fi zone, which is more than enough in the city. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Holidays in Berdyansk, as in any other city, is closely related to accommodation of tourists.  There are several ways to stay here for a short period, and they can be divided into the following categories: </p><p>  - private sector (own houses, rooms, apartments); </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - mini-hotels; </p><p>  - hotels and hotels; </p><p>  - motels and pensions. </p><h2>  Private sector Berdyansk </h2><p>  The rental of houses, apartments and apartments is most often used by travelers who want to save on accommodation and meals.  The choice of such housing in Berdyansk is extremely wide, but if the trip is planned for the peak season (July-August), then it is best to attend to its searches in advance, using the recommendations and reviews of friends and online message boards. </p><p>  The cheapest option is a room in a private house or apartment.

    <p>  If tourists travel with kids, they should rent a private cottage on the coast.  This is the most expensive resort housing option in this category, but it has many advantages, the main of which is the proximity of the house to the sea and the presence of its own fenced yard, on which the child can stay from morning to evening. </p><h2>  Mini-hotels of Berdyansk </h2><p>  One of the most popular options for temporary residence in the city of Berdyansk is mini-hotels or, as they are also called, home hotels.  Most often they are a private cottage with rooms converted into cozy rooms.  At the same time, do not confuse mini-hotels with cottages in which rooms are rented.  The differences are that the home hotel is an officially registered legal entity.  In addition, the mini-hotels have a reception, and the apartments are equipped with private bathrooms.  Here are just a few times less rooms than in a regular hotel - no more than 8-10 (and even in the best case). </p><p>  Prices in this segment are higher than for rental apartments, but lower than in the hotel business.  In addition, each client will be guaranteed to be provided with individual attention of the owners and homeliness.  At the request of guests, breakfast is prepared, and sometimes lunch and dinner. </p><p>  If tourists come to Berdyansk for the first time, and it is difficult for them to navigate in an unfamiliar city or it is not very convenient to get from transport hubs, the mini-hotel can send either its own car, or order a taxi for the guest. </p><p>  ‚ÄúMalibu‚Äù, ‚ÄúGulliver‚Äù, ‚ÄúEdelweiss‚Äù, ‚ÄúQuiet courtyard‚Äù, ‚ÄúDream‚Äù are some of the most popular mini-hotels among tourists.  They are located both on a sand spit and in the city itself. </p><h2>  Hotels in Berdyansk </h2>

    <p>  The hotel sector in Berdyansk is diverse: numerous hotels are ready to provide tourists with their rooms, which have a wide variety of categories - from ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù with a shared bathroom on the entire floor, to luxury and super-luxury apartments.  Many hotels include breakfast for their room, which eliminates the need for travelers to look for the nearest cafe or dining room in the morning. </p><p>  However, there are a couple of drawbacks that are inherent in this type of accommodation in the city of Berdyansk: hotels, hotels are mostly located far from the front page.  The minimum distance from the nearest hotel to the sea is 700 m, so returning from the beach is sometimes quite tiring.  Car enthusiasts should carefully familiarize themselves with the services of each hotel they like - not all of them have free parking. </p><p>  The most famous hotel in the city is, of course, Berdyansk.  It is even a kind of business card and an unofficial attraction, but it is located 2 km from the sea.  But the Maxim Hotel (Berdyansk), which is very popular among tourists, is a kind of exception to the rule - its buildings are located almost at the very edge of the water.  From here you can walk to the water park and the local market. </p>

    <p>  The hotel sector is expanding every year, and now Berdyansk hotels with a swimming pool are at the disposal of holidaymakers - a convenience that was previously considered a privilege of individual VIP complexes.  The most famous and popular are three hotels: Villa Bavaria, Elite and Arthurs.  The first two complexes are equipped with rather small pools, and they are suitable for tourists who came to rest with children in Berdyansk.  The Arthurs Hotel has a huge open bowl. </p><h2>  Sanatoriums and pensions Berdyansk </h2><p>  Resort tourism in Berdyansk is not only limited to beach vacations: here are excellent recreational conditions that will help to recharge your health and energy for the year ahead - just before your next vacation.  Despite the fact that many sanatorium complexes were built back in Soviet times, their condition and material base will surprise even discerning travelers.  European standards of service, accommodation and treatment are manifested even in small things. </p><p>  Mostly <span>Berdyansk resorts</span> specialize in recreational activities and procedures for the treatment and prevention of gynecological, gastric diseases, diseases of the circulatory and nervous systems, and treatment of the musculoskeletal system. </p><p>  The following pensions and sanatorium-resort institutions are currently operating in the city and the region: Berdyansk, Lazurny, Neftekhimik Ukrainy, Azov, Slavutich, Agarsky Cape. </p><h2>  Rest in Berdyansk </h2><p>  The next pressing issue after the problem of accommodation among tourists is leisure activities.  Lying all day on the beach is boring enough, and most vacationers like to spend an evening at the summer sea resort. </p>

    <p>  In Berdyansk, choosing a vacation to your liking is not difficult.  The city's guests are provided with the following entertainment: </p><p>  - restaurants, bars, cafes; </p><p>  - clubs, bars, discos; </p><p>  - amusement park; </p><p>  - aquapark; </p><p>  - zoo and dolphinarium; </p><p>  - sightseeing and horse riding tours; </p><p>  - boat trips, windsurfing, fishing; </p><p>  - shopping; </p><p>  - festivals, exhibitions, concerts; </p><p>  - cinemas. </p><p>  Evening life begins to rage in Berdyansk from 18.00-19.00 - at that very time most entertainment venues open their doors, and numerous shops open on the promenade.  If the interests of travelers relate to visiting local attractions or marine activities, then it is worth remembering that most excursions will start no later than 10.00 in the morning. </p><h2>  Reviews about the rest in Berdyansk </h2><p>  Tourists arriving in Berdyansk, note the unusual hospitality of local residents and their willingness to help.  Among other resorts, the city stands out for its well-equipped recreation area and climatic conditions that are most suitable for families with children.  However, this also has its minus - at the peak of the season there are so many vacationers that the nearest beaches are crowded, and therefore you have to go further along the coast or come to a familiar place earlier than usual. </p><p>  If you want to relax in silence and comfort, then the best month to visit Berdyansk will be the middle and end of August.  Water and air are still warmed up at the level of July temperature, but the bulk of tourists move out on the eve of the new school year. </p>
