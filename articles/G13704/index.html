And therefore, the prices for various services for tourists here are not very high.  The resort is actually inexpensive.  But this does not mean at all that the service for lovers of beach vacations here is of poor quality.  You can rest in Okurdajalar no worse than, for example, in the same Antalya or Kemer. </p><p>  There are not too many kinds of entertainment at this resort.  Therefore, Okurcalar is preferred mainly by lovers of a relaxing beach holiday.  Such tourists may very well approach in this village, for example, the Delphin Botanik Hotel 5 *.  The hotel is actually comfortable, and many vacationers speak well of it. </p>

    <h2>  Guest reviews about infrastructure </h2><p>  To relax in the Delphin Botanik Hotel World of Paradise 5 *, according to many tourists, is quite convenient.  The hotel territory is planned, according to many of its guests, very successfully.

At least that was the case for 2017. </p><h2>  Delphin Botanik Hotel staff reviews </h2><p>  Guests of this hotel usually do not make any special complaints against Delphin Botanik employees at specialized forums of tour operators.  Most of the hotel staff, judging by the reviews, behaves courteously and courteously with the tenants.

    <h2>  Beach Hotel Reviews </h2><p>  The Delphin Botanik Hotel Resort 5 * is located, as already mentioned, on the seashore.  The road to the beach from its buildings takes tourists no more than 3-4 minutes.  The hotel beach itself has earned pretty good reviews from its guests.  The coastline at this place is covered with a large jackdaw.  But there are no big stones and boulders on the hotel beach.  Walking along the seashore next to the hotel is barefoot.  Experienced tourists recommend that beginners must purchase special slippers in coastal shops. </p><p>  Entering the sea on the beach of the hotel, judging by the reviews, is quite convenient.  But those tourists who are still disturbed by large pebbles can jump into the water right from the pier.  There are no dangerous animals in the sea in this place.  The hotel guests respond well about the work of the beach staff. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are no particularly interesting historical or cultural places in Okurcalar.  However, guests of the Delphin Botanik Hotel 5 * hotel can go to nearby regions, where there are many of them.  Tourists can receive recommendations on visiting certain sights directly at the hotel - in the tour desk belonging to it.  For example, residents of the hotel can visit: </p><ul><li>  Sapaderi Canyon; </li><li>  Church of St. Nicholas; </li><li>  Red Tower in Alanya. </li></ul>
