We will tell about the most significant events of his fate in this article. </p><h2>  Pilot Biography </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Biography of Kirill Evstigneev" class="if uuid-2631832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2631832.jpg"></div><p>  Kirill Alekseevich Evstigneev was born in 1917.  He was born in the small village of Khokhly in the territory of modern Kurgan region.  At that time it was the Chelyabinsk district of the Orenburg province.  The family of Kirill Alekseevich Evstigneev was poor and very large.  Parents worked as peasants, they had two sons and five daughters.  By nationality, Kirill Alekseevich Evstigneev was Russian.  His mother died very early - in 1920, when the boy was only three years old, so his father was mainly involved in his upbringing. </p><p>  Until 1932, Cyril's father worked on the land, and then decided to go to work on the construction of the Yar-Phosphorite railway line in the territory of the Kirov Territory.  There he worked for two whole years. </p><p>  When his father left, Cyril remained in the family for the chief with his brother Alexei, by then they were in school, responsible for their sisters, were in charge of the household, and the Father regularly sent them money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Kirill Alekseevich Evstigneev graduated from school in the village of Maloye Dyuryagino, which was larger than his relatives Khokhlov.  Soon he went to build a road to help his father.  At the same time, he began to study there at a secondary school at the railway stations of Peskovko-Omutinsk, Yar, and Kirs.  Schools had to be changed as the team of builders who built the railway line advanced. </p><p>  In 1934, the hero to whom our article is devoted came to a city called Shumikha, where he began working as a lineman.  By that time, the features of workers in the railway professions were well known and known to him.  The future pilot worked on the Ural railway lines mainly on a site called "Stone Booth".  His father died during the war, he died on the battlefields in 1943. </p><h2>  Education </h2><p>  Evstigneev graduated from seven classes at the Shumikhinsky railway school in 1934.  In the same year he moved to Chelyabinsk, where he was admitted to the number of students at the factory school.  Cyril decided to master the profession of a turner at a tractor factory.  He successfully graduated from college in 1936.  The year before, he joined the Komsomol. </p><h2>  Labor career </h2><p>  Evstigneev began to work fully in 1936 at a pilot plant located in Chelyabinsk.  After about six months, the leadership noted his hard work and zeal and transferred it to the fuel equipment workshop on the basis of the tractor plant.

Until 1939, he served in the field repair base in the Far East with the rank of Red Army.  In 1941, he successfully graduated from the military school of pilots in Birmsk.

He stayed there as an instructor until the very end of 1942. </p><p>  Only after that did significant changes take place in the biography of Kirill Alekseevich Evstigneev.  He is sent to Moscow to the main headquarters of the air forces of the Soviet troops in order to begin to distill the American Aero Cobra aircraft from the United States of America; the Soviet Union receives them under Lend-Lease.  But Evstigneev does not dream about this, he wants to go to fight to the front.  He manages to realize this idea after a meeting in the capital with the famous Soviet pilot Soldatenko, who contributed to his sending to the front. </p><p>  Around the same time period, Evstigneev became a member of the Communist Party, which was then also called the CPSU (B.). </p><h2>  Evstigneev at the forefront </h2><div class="photo" data-original="legendary-aircraft.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="La-5" class="if uuid-2631844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2631844.jpg"></div><p>  At the forefront of the confrontation with the Nazis, the Evstigneev appears only in March 1943.
