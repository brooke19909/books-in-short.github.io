The areas of their application are quite diverse - from the backlight in the car to the zoning of residential premises.  However, the light strip itself will not work - it needs additional equipment, which can be purchased at any electrical goods store or ordered via the Internet.  Today we will talk about how to choose a power supply for the LED strip, what characteristics it should have and why it is needed in the backlight circuit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.qutee.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="IP68-protected RGB tape perfect for the bathroom" class="if uuid-3153914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3153914.jpg"></div><h2>  What is a light strip and what types of it can be found on the shelves </h2><p>  In fact, there are few types of LED strips.  They are distinguished by color (monochrome or RGB), degree of protection against moisture and the number of elements per linear meter.  The LED strip itself is a product for creating decorative illumination of ceilings, niches or furniture.  However, do not forget about the high power band with many chips.  It can also be used as the main lighting. </p><p>  You can get some more useful information by watching the next video. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="uVV_VnDJX64" data-url="https://youtu.be/uVV_VnDJX64" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/8/5/9/15859.jpg"></div><h2>  Why do I need a power supply for LED strip </h2><p>  Such a lighting device is not able to work from an alternating voltage of 220 V. It requires a constant stabilized current, which is issued by the power supply.  Such devices can convert the mains voltage into stabilized 12, 24 or 36 volts. </p><p>  Some LED strips, in particular RGB, in addition to the power supply, require a controller.  This device controls the colors of the LEDs, dimming or shutting off at the command of the user through the remote control. </p><p>  The most popular models of power supplies for LED strips 12 V - in the event of failure of such a device, he can easily find a replacement.  24 are much less common.  The 36 volt blocks were the last to appear on the market, however, they were not in demand, as a result of which almost all manufacturers abandoned their production.  In addition, a voltage of 36 volts is already considered dangerous to human health. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mcpisos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LEDs can also be used as the main lighting" class="if uuid-3153930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3153930.jpg"></div><h2>  LED adapter: selection criteria </h2><p>  In addition to the output voltage, before purchasing it is necessary to determine the power supply for the LED strip.  Performing the necessary calculations is easy.  The power consumption planned for connecting the LED strip can be found in its technical documentation, and then simply multiply these figures by the number of meters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another important selection criterion is the IP protection class.  The possibility of using a light strip in certain conditions depends on this indicator.  For example, for a bathroom and other rooms with high humidity, a sealed silicone product with an IP of at least 66 is required, while a cheaper power supply for IP20 LED strips is suitable for a living room or bedroom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.honglongled.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="This unit is suitable for dry, dust free rooms." class="if uuid-3153935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3153935.jpg"></div><h2>  Using low power supplies </h2><p>  If the home master does not have the opportunity to purchase a PSU for an LED strip, it is quite possible to use an adapter from a broken TV.  The main thing is that its output voltage is suitable.  However, most often the power of such power supplies is small.  If it is not enough, for example, for two segments of tape 5 m long, it is quite possible to use two separate rectifiers connected to one disconnector.  In addition, each adapter will be responsible for its segment of the light strip.  Similar 12V power supplies for LED strip can be asked from friends or search for flea markets, which are again gaining popularity in the suburbs of megacities.  Also to help the home master and thematic groups on social networks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Three power supplies for LED strip: RGB connection without controller </h2><p>  There is a rather interesting way of switching such a multicolor strip.  For such a connection, a controller is not required.  Of course, there will be few opportunities for an LED strip powered by a three-key switch, but such installation can cope with the main task. </p><p>  To connect, you need 3 adapters from 12 V TVs and a 3-pin disconnector.  The negative terminals from the power supplies must be connected to each other and soldered to the corresponding contact of the LED strip.  The three remaining ones connect the positive outputs from the adapters.  Each unit is powered by a separate switch button.  The result is this.  When the contacts are closed individually, green, red or blue light will light.  If you experiment, you can get different shades by pressing the breaker keys in different variations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="famecart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Such a power supply from a 12V TV is perfect" class="if uuid-3153925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3153925.jpg"></div><h2>  What power supply to choose for the bathroom and toilet </h2><p>  For such rooms with high humidity, special requirements are placed on electrical equipment.  An output voltage of 24 or 36 V is not suitable here.  Therefore, if the home master has at hand an LED strip that requires voltage above 12 V to operate, it is better to put it aside and use it for rooms with normal humidity. </p><p>  The only true answer to the question "which power supply for the LED strip to use in the bathroom" will be one word "tight".  Moisture and vapor impermeability to such devices is provided by the housing, which can be made of plastic or aluminum.  Here is just the option when the used adapter from the TV will be very helpful - almost all of them have a protection class of at least IP66. </p><p>  Another way out may be the acquisition of a low-power compact power supply, which has a fairly low cost.  Such an adapter can easily be placed even in a junction box.  Moisture from the bathroom will not get there, which will ensure its trouble-free operation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="guide.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The adapter in an aluminum case is expensive but of high quality" class="if uuid-3153918" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3153918.jpg"></div><h2>  Power supplies for lighting furniture and false ceilings </h2><p>  If the LED strip is located in the bedroom or living room, you should not pay special attention to the protection class of the adapter.  Here, the main thing will be to determine the power of the equipment.  When installing furniture lighting, the power supply can be quite simply hidden in one of the cabinets or inside a folding sofa.  The only thing worth paying attention to is that the stabilizer should be in close proximity to the LED strip.  The greater the distance to it, the more difficult it is for the adapter to work, with an increase in the length of wires, the load on it increases. </p><p>  When installing the lighting of the false ceiling is still easier.  The power supply is hidden between levels anywhere. </p><h2>  Where to buy the adapter: expert advice </h2><p>  Today, many began to order various products on Chinese resources.  Experts do not recommend purchasing such equipment of dubious quality.  If you plan to buy a really high-quality product, then before you select a power supply for the LED strip, you must at least hold it in your hands.  The fact is that the description of the technical characteristics of goods from China is not always true.  It should be understood that an adapter with a high rated power cannot weigh like a pair of LED bulbs.  In addition, the certification of the ‚ÄúCelestial Empire‚Äù is quite confusing, and if you now check their equipment for compliance with Russian standards, then at least 99% of the goods will not pass it. </p><p>  Another plus in the piggy bank of real stores is the ability to check the adapter's performance.  Here, the buyer is sure that after completing the installation and pressing the switch button, he will see a luminous LED strip, and not a "dead" strip with bulbs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="architizer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="With the right selection of equipment, the design is limited only by the level of imagination of the home master" class="if uuid-3153937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3153937.jpg"></div><h2>  An example of the calculation of the required adapter power </h2><p>  Most often, in order to find out how many watts an LED strip consumes, it is enough to clarify the marking of the SMD elements and check the table.  For example, the strip indicates that the SMD5050 is used.  In this case, the power consumption of the segment, 1 m long, will be 7.2 watts. </p><p>  Let it be planned to connect two strips of the maximum permissible length (5 m each).  In this case, the required adapter power rating is 7.2 √ó 10 = 72 watts.  However, this is not a reference indicator, which should be considered before choosing a power supply for LED strip.  To this figure, you need to add 20-30% so that there is a small margin, and the device does not work to the limit of its capabilities.  It turns out that the power supply must have a rated power of at least 90 watts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smartermood.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="This LED strip can be controlled without a remote control" class="if uuid-3153934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3153934.jpg"></div><h2>  Summing up the information reviewed </h2><p>  It‚Äôs easy to get an adapter for the light strip.  However, before choosing a power supply for an LED strip, you should take into account many nuances, starting from the room where the equipment will be used and ending with its rated power.  It must be understood that insufficient technical parameters will lead to a quick failure of the adapter.  At the same time, buying a converter with a rated power several times higher than necessary is also unacceptable.  After all, the cost of such a device will be very significant and, in fact, it will be money thrown to the wind.  But on a sealed enclosure, if you plan to use it in a bathroom or other room with high humidity, you should not save.  First of all, this advice concerns the security problems of people living in an apartment or a private house. </p>
