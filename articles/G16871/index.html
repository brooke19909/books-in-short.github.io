    <p>  This model will look great, for example, against the background of a classic suit.  But no matter what color the phone is, whether it is a stylish White model or a strict Explay Tornado Black smartphone, user reviews are unanimous in one thing: the devices are quite in line with modern trends in the design of mobile devices.  It is noted that the build quality and materials in all color modifications are the highest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  What does the device look like?  Appearance Explay Tornado (reviews of many users confirm this) - modern, stylish, moderately conservative.  The device in this point of view is suitable for people with a wide variety of preferences in the field of fashion and style, as we noted above.  On the back of its panel there are quite unusual patterns, stylized under the skin. </p><p>  The camera is not located in the center of the device, but in the upper left corner.  It is equipped with a rather spectacular flash of the LED type.  At the bottom of the case is a speaker covered with a delicate perforated damper.  On the right side of the device are the power button of the device, as well as a key to control the <span>sound volume.</span>  There are no items on the left side of the device.  At the top of the device is a slot for connecting a microUSB wire, as well as a headphone jack.  Below is a microphone. </p><p>  The display of the device is covered with a strong protective glass.  Above it is a speaker, an additional camera, as well as <span>light</span> and proximity <span>sensors</span> .  Here is a signal LED.  Under the screen are the standard touch buttons - go to the menu, "home" and "return".  Screen - with support for multi-touch (up to 5 clicks at a time). </p><p>  To install a SIM card in the device, you need to remove the back cover and remove the battery.  Each of the three SIM cards is installed in a separate way.  It can be noted that the formats of the slots for the 1st and 2nd cards are standard, for the 3rd - only micro SIM. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Display is another key feature of Explay Tornado.  User reviews regarding this component are positive.  First of all, this concerns the size of the screen - it is 4.5 inches, this figure can be considered optimal for this type of device.  The manufacturing technology of the display matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãIPS, the image quality is excellent, but, as some experts note, the margin of brightness of the screen is not very large. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The main camera of the device has a resolution of 5 MP.  This is a good indicator.  True, there is no autofocus on it - however, a similar option is absent in many "premium" devices.  The <span>software</span> uses the interface from Google, which is characterized by simplicity and ease of use. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The Explay Tornado mobile phone (reviews of many users characterize this property on the positive side) is controlled by Android OS in version 4.4.2 without any localizations and additional interfaces.  This impresses many mobile electronics enthusiasts who are tired of certain branded concepts.  Among the notable software options is the ability to organize smartphone control using a variety of finger movements across the screen thanks to the display‚Äôs multi-touch support. </p>

    <p>  Software features are standard for devices running Android OS.  Apart from downloadable applications from the corresponding online stores, the smartphone‚Äôs software shell includes very useful options for the owner.  This is an alarm clock, scheduler, a convenient application for working with the camera.  Regarding the installation of third-party software, the performance of a smartphone can be described as sufficiently high so that it runs common programs, as well as undemanding games. </p><p>  Actually about performance.  Let's consider this aspect in more detail.  How impressive is it, based on the hardware characteristics of the smartphone?  And what do users say about this? </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  To what extent can the Explay Tornado be considered productive?  The reviews of users who tested it using games and various applications generally characterize the device as quite suitable for launching common games and programs.  Due to the fact that the device has a relatively small amount of RAM - only 512 MB, demanding games, unfortunately, will slow down slightly. </p>

    <p>  However, a powerful processor with a frequency of 1.3 GHz and 4 cores, as well as an integrated module for processing graphics such as Mali400MP, largely compensates for the lack of RAM. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  As we noted above, the battery capacity in the smartphone is 1550 mAh.  By the standards of the modern market this, I must say, is not enough.  What do experts say about this, who tested the Explay Tornado smartphone for battery life?  Expert reviews, as well as users, generally characterize the device as very average regarding the function in question, which is not surprising, based on battery capacity indicators.  The batteries last for about one day with fairly intensive use of the device. </p><p>  It can be noted at the same time that battery life for many smartphone users is far from the most important criterion.  And therefore, if one device has more attractive performance characteristics than a similar one with the same cost and with a battery capacity higher, then the first one will be most likely selected.  Surely, many mobile electronics enthusiasts who wanted to buy Explay Tornado did the same.  Perhaps it turned out to be preferable for them to have a device with a processor in 4 cores and 1.3 GHz, an excellent display and a modest battery, than a gadget with not the most powerful hardware, but a capacious battery. </p><p>  In addition, not every similar smartphone can support on all three SIM-cards - like Explay Tornado - 3G.  The reviews regarding this remarkable property of the phone are the most positive. </p>

    <p>  A tool with a characteristic that is very important in a number of cases falls into the hands of the user, for example, if on a trip you need to urgently switch from one operator to another with a cheap tariff option for accessing the Internet. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  This is our small Explay Tornado features review.  User reviews, however, will also be important to us in terms of a better study of the smartphone.  What do the owners of the device who thoroughly tested it in terms of design, and on the subject of performance, and regarding its remarkable features? </p><p>  Users characterize the device as a whole as a device that has very few analogues in the aspect of correlation of quality, performance and price.  It can be noted that such a feature of the device as a modest battery, although noted by users, does not imply a significant adjustment to the opinion on the smartphone. </p>

    <p>  Design, as we noted above, the owners of the device praise, and this applies to the phone in all its color solutions.  Using the device, as many mobile electronics enthusiasts believe, is convenient.  In many ways, this is facilitated by a functional screen with multitouch support. </p><p>  Opinion regarding the device among Russian users is generally positive.  Undoubtedly, the Russian brand Explay has managed to offer the market a competitive, high-performance, stylish and sought-after device.  And for an adequate price - about 4900 rubles. </p><h2>  Older brother </h2><p>  The smartphone we are considering has a brother - the Explay Tornado tablet, reviews of which are also popular on the thematic portals of mobile electronics enthusiasts.  What are the features of this device?  Consider its key characteristics, and also compare them with the corresponding parameters of the Explay Tornado smartphone.  Of course, the comparison will be very conditional - since the devices belong to different classes.  But we are focusing precisely on possible similarities. </p><h2>  Explay Tornado Tablet Features </h2><p>  The display size of the device is 7 inches, the resolution is 1024 by 768 inches.  The type of matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãIPS.  It is clear that in terms of display size, the tablet will be larger.  Similarly, the screen supports the multi-touch function.  Technologically, the displays on the smartphone and tablet are very close. </p><p>  The processor installed on the tablet is MediaTek MT8312.  Unlike the chip that the Explay Tornado smartphone is equipped with, it has 2 cores.  The clock frequency of both processors is the same.  However, the MT8312 microchip has been adapted - specifically for the tablet.  In this sense, the corresponding hardware components, like the devices themselves, are of different classes. </p><p>  The amount of RAM in the tablet is 1024 MB.  This is 2 times more than in a smartphone - in fact, due to the difference in the classes of devices. </p><p>  The amount of internal flash memory is 8 GB.  It is possible to connect additional memory modules - up to 32 GB. </p><p>  A feature in which the Explay Tornado smartphone even outperforms its older brother is the resolution of the main camera.  On a tablet, the corresponding figure is 2 MP - much less than on a smartphone.  The additional camera of both devices has the same resolution - 0.3 MP. </p><p>  Both devices support connecting to a computer via microUSB, working with wireless networks, and communicating via Bluetooth.  There is GPS support. </p><p>  On the tablet, you can install 2 SIM-cards of a usual format, and it, like a smartphone, supports Internet connection via 3G. </p><p>  Well, despite the fact that the devices belong to different classes, their technical characteristics are quite close and indicate that the devices are designed to solve approximately the same tasks: access the Internet from any available channel, whether WiFi or 3G, launch undemanding games and applications, amateur photography. </p><h2>  Benefits of the Explay Tornado Tablet </h2><p>  Note that not every device of the corresponding class supports, like an Explay Tornado, 3G tablet.  Reviews from many users and experts on this subject are very enthusiastic.  At the same time, the tablet is characterized by very decent parameters in the aspect of ‚Äúiron‚Äù, which makes it competitive also when compared with analogues in the aspect of other functions.  Regarding prices - in this sense, the Russian brand adheres to its traditions: to deliver to the market not only productive, but also inexpensive devices.  There is an Explay Tornado tablet about 6500 rubles.  Not every competing brand will be ready to offer an analogue comparable in key characteristics to the Russian user at the same price. </p>
