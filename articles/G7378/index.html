Several times will change the power, the usual way of life and the political system.  The country will be destroyed by large-scale revolutions, and a different, completely new state will be built on its ruins.  After 70 years of existence, it will be destroyed and erased from the memory of the modern generation.  Millions of people over a hundred-year period of historical drama will once again learn to live, adapt, and believe. </p><p>  100 years - 4 political revolutions, an economic abyss and incredible rise, unquestioning faith and contempt, unification and collapse.  This is too much for one generation of a simple Russian family. </p><h2>  Forerunners of trouble </h2><p>  Peter I in 1721 officially created the Russian Empire, the power and significance of which for almost 200 years of history has been questioned and criticized.  However, it was during this period of time that the Russian state expanded its borders, achieved worldwide recognition in the fields of science, literature and education. </p><p>  But while the monarchy was drowned in gold, absorbing more and more entertainments, traveling around the world and filling its palaces and cities with luxury, ordinary Russian people often went hungry.  The illiteracy rate of people during this period reached critical levels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.artsait.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Imperial time" class="if uuid-2910185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2910185.jpg"></div><p>  The Northern and Russian-Japanese wars worsened the already deplorable state of ordinary people.  A low standard of living, high mortality, a huge social gap between rich and poor - that was how life in the country was.  Russia has long been in need of new reforms, but the monarchy hesitated, only exacerbating its position. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All these circumstances became the reasons for the first political revolution in Russia. </p><h2>  Russia at the beginning of the 20th century </h2><p>  In 1894, Alexander III dies and Nicholas II, his son, ascends the throne.  At that time, absolute autocracy was already weighing on the people.  The country demanded change.  After the abolition of serfdom in 1861, in fact, the life of a whole class, namely the peasant population, has not changed. </p><p>  In addition, the hard work of the working class in factories and factories gave rise to excitement and indignation.  Working conditions were extremely difficult and pay was very low. </p><p>  The Russo-Japanese War exacerbated the already difficult situation of the people.  Russia's struggle for the Far East was very crumpled and indecisive.  As a result, the Japanese inflicted a crushing blow to the empire, which overnight undermined the authority of the Russian authorities in the ranks of the already tired population of the country.  More than 50 thousand people were killed, more than 70 thousand were taken prisoner.  All these events were the impetus for the first political revolution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian-Japanese war" class="if uuid-2900589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2900589.jpg"></div><h2>  First revolution </h2><p>  The depressing position of the majority of the population ensured the emergence of "their" leaders.  These leaders interpreted the conditions of the state in order to facilitate the life of an ordinary person.  One of the main conditions was the restriction of autocracy.  In fact, people demanded basic things: shorter working hours, freedom of speech, equality before the law for all citizens of Russia.  In early January 1905, a strike that arose at the Putilov factory forced the workers to write a petition to the tsar asking them to take action.  It was a peaceful demonstration of ordinary Russian workers tired of their desperate situation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bloody sunday" class="if uuid-2900585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2900585.jpg"></div><p>  On January 9, a peaceful march to the Winter Palace turned into a bloody massacre.  About 200 people died, which marked the beginning of the first political revolution.  Faith in the king was undermined, a wave of uprisings and rallies swept across the country.  This revolution will last 2 years.  Later it will be called the "Bourgeois Revolution," which means it is directed against the bourgeoisie and the monarchy.  To a large extent, it will weaken the tsarist power, becoming a kind of first stage to a large-scale second revolution. </p><h2>  Second revolution </h2><p>  The February Revolution of 1917, or the Bourgeois-Democratic Revolution, finally resolved the question of monarchy in Russia.  This political revolution was caused by the same problems: the peasant and land issues were not resolved, the plight of the workers and the military associated with the First World War (1914-1918).  People were killed in the war, Russia was clearly losing, the country was in economic decline.  Strikes and rallies continued, gaining a crushing scale.  Power was powerless, and this was perfectly understood by Nicholas II.  Finally, he decides to abdicate on March 2, 1917. </p><p>  Now the Bolsheviks entered the game.  Their task was to create an interim government, solve the issue of Russia's participation in the First World War, and improve the life of the country's population.  The death penalty was immediately abolished, political prisoners were released.  In Russia, chaos began, which was the harbinger of a third political revolution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Third revolution </h2><p>  On October 25 (November 7), 1917, the Bolshevik party led by Vladimir Lenin and Leo Trotsky completely seized power in the country.  The new proletarian government set clear and significant goals for the people.  All property has been nationalized.  Private property liquidated.  "Factories - to the workers", "Earth - to the peasants" - the main slogans of the new government.  Religion and the church did not stand aside.  Churches were transferred to the state, atheism became the new religion in the country. </p><p>  A strong and educated leader Vladimir Ulyanov-Lenin led the country on a new road into a bright socialist future. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sovietpatriot.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Great leader" class="if uuid-2910174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2910174.jpg"></div><p>  The political revolutions of 1917 gave a countdown to a new era in the history of Russia.  For almost 70 years of history, Russia has experienced a lot of ups and downs.  However, the amplitude of terrible and good events was so great that it is difficult today to objectively discuss the pros and cons of the Soviet government. </p><h2>  The Consequences of Three Revolutions </h2><p>  The political revolutions of 1917 did their job, the power completely changed, the Soviet era began.  The most high-profile events of this era from 1917 to 1991: </p><ul><li>  1917 - seizure of power by the Bolshevik party. </li><li>  Nationalization of land, banks, private property, churches. </li><li>  March 1918 - Brest Peace with Germany, exit from the First World War. </li><li>  1918 - the beginning of the Civil War, the creation of the Red Army. </li><li>  July 1918 - the shooting of the last representatives of the royal family. </li><li>  July 1918 - The creation of the first constitution. </li><li>  August 1918 - the beginning of the Red Terror, the extermination of people who disagree with the revolution. </li><li>  The transfer of the capital of Russia from St. Petersburg to Moscow, renaming the city of St. Petersburg to Leningrad. </li><li>  1922 - formation of the USSR. </li><li>  Since 1928 - collectivization, the creation of collective farms. </li><li>  Since 1932 - a terrible famine, the beginning of industrialization. </li><li>  Stalinist repression. </li><li>  1941 -1945 - The Great Patriotic War. </li><li>  1949 - The creation of the atomic bomb. </li><li>  1961 - the first manned space flight. </li><li>  1961 - The construction of the Berlin Wall. </li><li>  1962 - Caribbean Crisis, conflict between the USSR and the USA. </li><li>  1979 - The introduction of troops in Afghanistan. </li><li>  1986 - Chernobyl accident. </li><li>  In Russia, the heyday of entrepreneurship, the fall of the Berlin Wall. </li><li>  1991 - collapse of the USSR </li></ul><p>  All these events led the country to the fourth political revolution. </p><h2>  Fourth revolution </h2><p>  The latest Russian revolution is also called the "criminal revolution."  After the desperate attempts of Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev to improve the life of the population by trial and error, Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev comes to power.  Economic stagnation begins.  Over the next 30 years, the country is rapidly falling into the economic and social abyss.  In an attempt to create a more democratic state, Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev proposes a new economic policy.  People are given the opportunity to do business, privatize housing and government facilities.  Strikes and riots begin in the country.  The illiterate policy of the highest echelons of power results in the collapse of the USSR, not without the participation of Western countries.  People who are tired of incompetence, war and the absurdity of decisions taken, for the most part do not support change, but, alas, they are already inevitable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="brezhnevnews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The collapse of the Soviet Union" class="if uuid-2910179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2910179.jpg"></div><h2>  What do dreams lead to? </h2><p>  Throughout the history of mankind, people just wanted to live well.  These are the main reasons for the political revolution.  Russia suffered a lot, as a result, under the leadership of strong leaders, it stepped into a new era, having begun enthusiastically building a new state.  Perhaps if the leaders of this state were more patriotic and educated, we would not have to experience another split in society.  In the pursuit of power and empty rewards, we have lost the most important thing - respect and faith. </p><div class="photo" data-original="therealmovement.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where dreams come from" class="if uuid-2910197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2910197.jpg"></div><p>  Often the October Socialist Russian Revolution is compared to the Great French Political Revolution, which occurred more than 100 years earlier and as a result of which the Bastille was taken and the monarchy was overthrown.  The desires of the French and Russian citizens coincided - everyone wanted to live better.  But France went its own way, eventually creating a strong democratic state and giving hope that changes for the better are possible for other countries, including Russia. </p><h2>  Forgotten story </h2><p>  Political revolutions in Russia were organized by the brave and strong leaders of that time.  With the help of "Western" funding and a rather illiterate population, a new state was created.  Today, in the public domain you can find many films, historical references and archives, there are no more secrets and prohibitions on knowledge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.russianinsight.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia and the revolution" class="if uuid-2910186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2910186.jpg"></div><p>  The history of political revolutions is fascinating, but very cruel.  This is the story of a whole generation, individuals, cultures.  The whole world is involved in its consequences!  Do not forget about the exploits of your people, trust only one point of view, because we have the opportunity to be objective, thanks to the invaluable work of writers and historians. </p><h2>  Will there be a fifth revolution? </h2><p>  Today, a lot of controversy is ongoing about the current government.  Someone actively supports it, someone, on the contrary, is looking for all kinds of errors.  There are few who are indifferent, and those who are indifferent are arguing whether there will be a fifth revolution.  The new political revolution can be justified by the change of a strong leader, which has already happened in the Soviet Union, as well as by the enormous social gap between the layers of the population.  The difference between rich and poor in Russia has reached the maximum mark in the entire history of the state.  Whether this will cause a new round in the history of revolutions is not yet known. </p>
