Moreover, there are a huge number of resorts, and everyone can choose what suits him.  So, you can go to the islands, for example to Samui, while booking a room or a bungalow in a five-star hotel.  And you can relax at a lower cost by choosing economical hotels.  Pattaya, 3 * hotels which is no worse than 4-star Europe, mainly attracts lovers of not so much beach relaxation as nightly entertainment.  Indeed, this resort has a large number of entertainment venues, including transvestite shows.  When making tours to Pattaya, operators almost always take this into account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ambassador city jomtien inn 3" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/753673.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is interesting in Pattaya? </h2><p>  Many Russian tourists have the following stereotype regarding an ideal holiday.  It should include: a wonderful room with all amenities, meals throughout the day and until late at night, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãalcohol (free of charge), animation both in the morning and in the evening, the beach, evening walk.  Those who dream of this type of vacation, it is better not to come to Pattaya.  But lovers of outdoor activities - excursions, trips, various entertainments, including sports - will find something to their liking here.  Pattaya is often called a watchful city.  Visitors get the impression that he never sleeps, even an hour a day.  The most popular street in the resort is the legendary Walking Street.  There is an unimaginable number of bars and nightclubs.  In addition, in the city you can always meet ‚Äúcall girls‚Äù.  It is with this that Thailand (Pattaya) is often associated with most Russian tourists.  Hotels surrounded by entertainment venues are simply contraindicated for families with children.  Despite the soundproofing, it‚Äôs almost impossible to sleep there because of screaming music, the buzz of thousands of crying voices, etc. In short, Pattaya is a dormant city of free love. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ambassador City Jomtien" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/753676.jpg" width="600"></div>  As in all of Thailand, this resort has many massage centers where you can inexpensively undergo a therapeutic and relaxing massage.  In addition, tourists are attracted by the goodwill and hospitality of the local population.  It is not for nothing that Thailand is known all over the world as a country of 1000 smiles.

However, this is not at all true.  At first glance, you can understand that Thailand is a country of incredible contrasts.  Near the magnificent palaces, the shacks of the poor can be huddled; next to the most modern shopping centers (malls), you can find street markets where ordinary people sell fruits and vegetables, etc. The same applies to hotels - next to luxury deluxe hotels you can find a completely dilapidated two-star hotel or hostel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel room" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/753675.jpg" width="600"></div>  However, the best option - the golden mean - these are hotels and mid-level complexes, for example, Ambassador City Jomtien 3 *.  As already noted, such hotels in terms of service cannot be compared with European ones.  They are quite respectable and are quite consistent with higher class hotels.

    <h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  Every tourist, knowing that Thailand is located in the very east of the <span>continent of Eurasia,</span> having bought a tour to the Ambassador City Jomtien Inn 3 * hotel in Pattaya, of course, begins to wonder how to get there.  From Moscow and other major cities of Russia there are regular and charter flights to the capital of Thailand - Bangkok.  After that, tourists change to a bus and get to the resort within two hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews Ambassador City Jomtien" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/753674.jpg" width="600"></div>  Pattaya is a city located on the shores of the <span>Gulf of Thailand.</span>  To get to it, tourists usually fly to Bangkok and then go by bus for about 2 hours (185 km).  Usually a transfer from the airport to the hotel is included in the price of the tour.  By the way, in the past, Utapao Airport operated near Pattaya, but today it is closed.

The only negative is a long flight.  And, accordingly, not cheap air tickets.  But in the country itself, almost all services are available.  In terms of prices, the most convenient is the resort of Pattaya.  Here, rooms in four-star hotels cost about the same as in three-star hotels in Europe.  But sober-hotel hotel complexes, for example, Ambassador City Jomtien, despite the fact that they correspond to the four stars in Europe, provide tourists with rooms at ultra-low prices.  That is why young people like to come here.  Holidays in the resort of Pattaya can not be specialized, since most tourists who come here, stop on <span>combined tours.</span>  And each of them does not want to be limited to one thing.  However, there is so much entertainment that everyone will find something for themselves to their taste.  And such factors as age, religion, culinary preferences, etc. are absolutely not important. Of course, those who come here for nightly entertainment prefer to stay in hotels near vicious places, for example, on Walking Street.  But couples with children like to buy tours to areas remote from the center. </p><h2>  General characteristics of Pattaya: beaches </h2><p>  This resort, along with the coastline, is conditionally divided into southern, central and northern zones.  Fans of water activities like windsurfing like to come to the last.  Unlike other areas of the bay, it is relatively windy here, which means there are much more waves.  In short, beach life here is in full swing, which cannot be said about the central region.  Many tourists who came here, the central beach was very disappointing.  Environmentalists believe that swimming in the waters near the central beach means harming one‚Äôs health. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Jomtien Beach </h2><p>  The beach, next to which the Ambassador City Jomtien Inn 3 * hotel is located, as noted above, is not entirely suitable for a comfortable stay.  Moreover, it is not the property of the hotel, so you have to pay for all amenities.  And some tourists in their reviews complain that it is very narrow and does not at all look like other snow-white shores of Thailand.  Therefore, if the purpose of your trip is primarily a relaxing beach holiday and various water activities, then Jomtien is not the best option for this.  But for tourists who are not so important, because they are more attracted to nightlife, as well as shopping, this area is just a godsend.  After all, there are many ‚Äúgo-go‚Äù clubs, shopping centers, etc. Here is the famous ‚ÄúAlcazar Show‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="additional services at the hotel" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/753677.jpg" width="600"></div>

By the way, room prices in different buildings vary greatly.  So a suitable option can be found for the owner of any wallet.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex is directly adjacent to Jomtien Beach.  However, guests of the Ambassador City Jomtien Inn 3 * hotel still prefer to sunbathe and swim in one of the many pools.  And all because the beach, or rather sea water off the coast, does not differ in the purity that Thai resorts are so famous for.  Here, by the pools, unlike the beach, crystal clear reigns, moreover, umbrellas, sun loungers, towels and mattresses are provided for free.  There are also bars near the pools. </p><h2>  Number of rooms and description </h2><p>  In total, the hotel has 1666 rooms of various categories: Standard Room (32 sq. M.), MN Room (area - 25 sq.

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel has one cafe, restaurants of Japanese, Italian, Chinese and international cuisines.  There are also six bars, some of which are located near the pools. </p><h2>  Reviews of tourists about the hotel Ambassador City 3 * </h2><p>  When choosing a tour, many of us begin to look for sites of various hotels on the Web.  Of course, the information presented there is promotional in nature.  And this is natural.  Yes, these sources provide complete information about the location, infrastructure, number of rooms, type of food, types of entertainment, etc. Nevertheless, it is very important to look in the ‚ÄúReviews‚Äù section.  "Ambassador City Jomtien" as a comprehensive hotel chain, according to estimates of tourists left at various tourist portals, may well correspond to 4 European stars.  Here, in <span>Pattaya, the Ambassador Hotel</span> pulls only for a C grade.  In terms of its location, exterior and interior conditions, and the level of services it is simply ideal for a beach holiday.  However, there is one thing but ... This is a polluted sea, not a beach, namely the sea.  True, the hotel, as already noted, has 6 pools at once.  So tanning tourists can be guaranteed in the solarium area next to each of them.  In principle, for parents of young children - this is the best option.  In the children's compartments of the pools, the children will be completely safe.  In addition, the water in the pools is almost always crystal clear.  This is also evidenced by the positive reviews of vacationers.  Naturally, those tourists who don‚Äôt imagine their vacation without water activities, swimming in sea water, etc. give negative ratings to the hotel. However, let them not forget that it was their choice.  After all, you can always find out about this feature of the beach in advance.  From the point of view of food, excursion program and level of service - the hotel is quite suitable for a good budget holiday. </p>
