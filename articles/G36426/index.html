  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to remove scratches from the touch screen without stress</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The aesthetic appearance of the subject of affection and, to some extent, pride, which for some of the users is a mobile phone or, perhaps, another digital device, can sometimes significantly underestimate its indicative ‚ÄúWow‚Äù!  The reason this can happen is because of some point in operation.  Agree, a mobile phone is a device that is at great risk of being mechanically damaged.  Therefore, the question of how to remove scratches from the <span>touch screen is</span> most often of interest to users of modern devices equipped with a touchscreen.  Today, this difficulty can be resolved in several ways, read which. </p><h2></h2><h2>  We increase the "efficiency" of the friction force </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to remove scratches from the touch screen?" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/349845.jpg" width="225"></div></h2><p>  It is probably no secret to anyone that today in the <span>consumer goods</span> market there is a huge assortment of polishes, grindings and abrasive pastes.  Such products allow you to restore the pristine condition of surfaces made from almost any material.  In our case, this is an indispensable tool for effectively resolving the issue of "how to remove scratches from the touch screen."  In order to hide damage in the form of microcracks and other minor consequences from mechanical stress, it is enough to apply polish to the display, body parts or other surface area with a flaw.  Using microfiber, wipe the ‚Äúaffected‚Äù element of the device in a circular motion.  The effect is not long in coming.  The only and, perhaps, a significant minus of this recovery method lies in an unpleasant moment - soiled.  So, you see: how to remove scratches from the touch screen - the issue is being solved.  By the way, it is extremely not recommended to use abrasive pastes, since there is an incredible risk of disabling the ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù, but still working control panel.  However, it is advisable to use <span>GOI paste</span> for glass touchscreens <span>.</span>  The main thing is not to overdo it during the grinding process, as careless actions or excessive pressure can reduce all efforts to nothing! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Remove scratches from the touch screen" class="if" height="494" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/349846.jpg?1394321936444" width="497"></div></h2><h2>  A trick worthy of being considered a universal solution </h2><p>  In the case when it is not possible to remove scratches from the touch screen with polishing and other means of grinding, an incredibly simple and at the same time effective way of masking the damaged area should be applied.  ‚ÄúDrying for varnish‚Äù - a substance that is quite common and, in general, inexpensive.  Using a brush, apply the above remedy to the ‚Äúsore‚Äù spot, then remove chemical residues with a soft cloth.  The fact is that this method of ‚Äúrehabilitation‚Äù of the touchscreen panel does not quite correspond to the restoration of surfaces with the anti-glare technology used today.  Therefore, with some moments of "exposure" will have to get used to. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Revitalizing and protecting film </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Touch screen scratches" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/349844.jpg?1394321983776" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Scratches on the touch screen will become completely invisible if you cover the front of the device with a <span>protective film.</span>  Of course, this was worth doing earlier, or rather, immediately after buying a phone, tablet or other electronic device.  Pay special attention to the moments of positioning the protective element directly in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãdamage.  The edges of the furrow must be more thoroughly ‚Äúrubbed‚Äù so that an air bubble does not form at the place of its connecting space.  By the way, today the ‚ÄúPVC guard‚Äù pasted on the ‚Äútouch‚Äù can have truly unrealistic properties and even be a competent shockproof security guarantor for your gadget. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Those who are interested in a high-quality answer to the question ‚Äúhow to remove scratches from the touch screen‚Äù can recommend an effective absolute solution to such an unpleasant situation.  Contact a specialized service center.  Replace the ‚Äúcharming‚Äù touchscreen.  Firstly, defects of a considerable depth on the screen are a predetermining factor of the obviously ‚Äúdying‚Äù sensor module.  The second argument is the almost imperceptible price of repairs.  Be prudent! </p>
