  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The main features of the state as a unity of law and power: the main milestones in the history of the concept</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The phenomenon of the state has a special place in the political system.  He gives the latter stability, integrity and focuses on social activities.  The main features of the state are that it plays an exceptional role in this system, performs the necessary amount of activity and management, manages the resources of society, and also acts as the main regulator of its life.  This is a fundamental tool that incorporates power functions and helps to exercise this power.  It embodies sovereignty, being its bearer. </p><p>  This concept took shape about three or even five millennia ago, during the time of ancient Sumer, China, Egypt and the Cretan-Mycenaean civilization.  However, a clear theory of <span>what the state,</span> its main features, forms of government was first created by Plato.  He also created the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ideal type of governance of society, which he described as a hierarchy of three classes - rulers, sages, warriors and officials, as well as peasants and artisans.  The philosopher also pointed out that the whole complex of economic, political, social and cultural interests of various sectors of society is concentrated in the state, and it should seek and practice the best ways to resolve the contradictions between them and resolve conflicts. </p><p>  Thus, the main <span>features of a state</span> that would exercise fair governance were formed in antiquity.  First of all, this is the presence in him not only of coercive power, but also of law.  At that time, descriptions of various types of government appeared and their typologization as right and wrong.  Almost all the classics of antiquity spoke out on this subject - from Aristotle to Cicero.  In addition, in this era some Roman lawyers came up with ideas about the law, which belongs to a person only by the fact of his birth, and about the equality stemming from this theory.  Theorists of Roman law have developed many interesting and subsequently needed concepts - such as about the state-republic as a ‚Äúpeople's business‚Äù, which carries out the rule of law and communication between subjects of law within a certain framework. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the Renaissance, theories about the ideal of government became fashionable again.  So, <span>Nicolo Machiavelli,</span> analyzing the history of various political entities, tried to isolate the main features of the state, which would be ideal.  One of such features, he considered giving all citizens the opportunity to dispose of property and ensuring their personal safety.  However, recognizing the important and necessary <span>functions of the state,</span> many thinkers of that era spoke very critically about it, as, in particular, Thomas More, who stated that in reality this was an agreement between the rich and the poor.  Since he was a royal chancellor for a long time, he obviously knew what he was talking about. </p><p>  However, only from the 17th century did thinkers come close to the concept of what the <span>rule of law is.</span>  Its main features were first described as meeting the laws of reason and justice.  So, Hugo Grotius considered such an integral property of this form of government a social contract, at the conclusion of which both the people and the rulers were imposed certain duties.  This would ensure, in the opinion of the famous lawyer and the creator of international law, at the same time individual freedom and public consent.  Didro specified the concept of such a treaty and declared it the main source of power as such.  Thus, the thesis was formulated on the sovereignty of the people, which in our time is recorded in the constitutions of most countries.  Under such a rule, the enlightener was sure, it is possible to ensure not only rights, but also the happiness of most people. </p><p>  The main features of the state described by Diderot, designed to confirm the power of the people and the rights of the individual, were supported by Spinoza and Kant.  Moreover, Spinoza suggested limiting the ability of the state to manage the life and property of subjects within the framework of laws, and Kant specified that with this form of government, not only the government can force citizens to comply with the requirements of the law, but people themselves must be able to force the rulers to obey the laws and monitor this process.  John Locke and <span>Thomas Hobbes</span> added to this the principle of the rule of law (when everyone, including those in power, must bear equal responsibility) and the distribution of power between different branches, which can mutually restrain each other and resist tyranny and despotism. </p>
