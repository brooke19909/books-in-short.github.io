  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Dominant" in Volgograd: description, infrastructure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the southeast of the European part of Russia there is a rather large city - Volgograd.  He is often chosen for permanent residence when moving from the Far North and the Far East due to the temperate continental climate.  Developers are offering more and more new projects for implementation, including the Dominant residential complex in Volgograd. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Construction progress" class="if uuid-3190317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3190317.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit about the city </h2><p>  Volgograd is a city with a population of more than a million people.  Mild winters, quite hot and long summers attract residents from more unfavorable regions in terms of climate.  A well-developed construction, chemical, metallurgical industry, the presence of numerous manufacturing enterprises - all this only contributes to the fact that the influx of population does not stop.  Many people prefer not to purchase real estate outside the city, but to use all the benefits of urban infrastructure.  For those who wish and built LCD "Dominant" in Volgograd. </p><h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  On the border of the Sovetsky District, on Turkmenskaya Street, three 24-storey residential buildings were built and commissioned - this is Dominant residential complex in Volgograd.  The apartments here are different: from one-room to three-room.  Thanks to such a good choice of location, from the complex to the city center, you can quickly reach major transport routes, both with your own car and public transport.  Travel time does not take more than 10 minutes.  Also within walking distance is the metro station "Elshanka". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Yard area" class="if uuid-3190318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3190318.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  The construction company in Volgograd "Peresvet-South" LCD "Dominant" designed in such a way that residential buildings are significantly different from those already built in the city.  The number of storeys of houses allows you to enjoy not only the view of the Volga River flowing nearby, but also the whole city.  The large area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments in the Dominant residential complex in Volgograd is perfect for implementing even the most innovative ideas for planning residential premises.  High-speed elevators will quickly deliver to the desired floor.  For owners of their own vehicles, open and closed parking is provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Towers connect" class="if uuid-3190319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3190319.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Due to its location in Volgograd, Dominant residential complex can offer its residents the most comfortable life and the opportunity not to experience inconvenience from the lack of social infrastructure.  The first floors of residential buildings are given for the placement of objects of trade, the provision of services to the public.  This will allow residents to get everything they need outside the complex. </p><p>  On the nearby Turkmen street there are also many shops, cafes, and pharmacies.  Little residents can walk to the nearest school and kindergarten in just a few minutes.  For walks and relaxation, the Volga River embankment located within walking distance is perfect. </p><p>  The delivery of apartments by the builder without finishing allows future residents to significantly save on the "dismantling" of the repairs made and to realize their even the most daring ideas for creating an interior.  A large area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments only contributes to this fact. </p><p>  Houses in the Dominant residential complex can be attributed rather to business class residential real estate.  This is indicated by the location of the complex (it is located almost in the center of the city of Volgograd), its individual and unique architectural solution, well-developed infrastructure around and a panoramic view of one of the largest rivers of our vast country. </p><p>  The Peresvet-South construction company, which proposed such an original project for decorating Volgograd, rightfully earned the title of the most conscientious and largest developer of the region.  Moreover, such work has been done in just 7 years since its inception. </p>
