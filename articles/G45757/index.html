    <p>  What were the prerequisites for the forced industrialization of the <span>Soviet Union?</span>  The failed new economic policy, or NEP, namely <span>the grain procurement crisis</span> in 1927-1928, led the leadership to decide on a change in the economic course and to begin reforming the entire Union system. </p><p>  The years of the first five-year plan - 1928 (the date the plan was adopted) - 1932 (the deadline, that is, the completion of all the tasks of the first stage of industrialization). </p><p>  The transition to a new policy and the adoption of the first five-year plan was voiced at the 16th conference of the CPSU (B.).  The first five-year plan began in October 1928.  It was then that the plan was adopted, but there were still no clear objectives. </p><p>  What are the goals set by the government of the USSR?  Firstly, it was necessary to overcome the technical and general backwardness of the country;  secondly, the Soviet Union had to get rid of economic dependence, primarily from military supplies;  thirdly, the authorities faced an important task: the creation of a powerful military-industrial complex;  fourthly, industrialization was to provide a strong foundation for collectivization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first five-year plan has its own characteristics: </p><ul><li>  high rates (industrialization was called "forced"); </li><li>  tight deadlines (famous calls "Give 5 years in 4 years!); </li><li>  imbalance in development: the prevalence of <span>heavy industry</span> over light; </li><li>  implementation of industrialization due to internal savings. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first five-year period results" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10508/31702.jpg" width="547"></div></li></ul><p>  The leadership of the Soviet Union used all means to attract people to the mass "construction".  Hundreds of people, seeing agitation calls, set off and built factories, laid railways, and participated in the construction of power plants.  A lot of famous Soviet posters appeared in this era, reflecting the whole essence of the self-consciousness of the people at that time. </p><p>  Also during the first five-year plan, collectivization began, which was accompanied by dispossession.  The second year of the first five-year plan will later be called the "year of the great turning point."  However, not everyone knows at what cost collective farms and factories were created.  How many ruined families were deprived of their homes, how many people died from the cold ... </p><p>  In 1932, the first five-year plan ended.  Its results were as follows: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="years of the first five-year period" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10508/31701.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <ul><li>  a powerful defense complex was created; </li><li>  unemployment has been eliminated; </li><li>  the economic independence of the USSR was achieved; </li><li>  the planned system of the economy of the <span>Soviet Union</span> ; </li><li>  the five-year period stimulated the extensive development of the country. </li></ul><p>  The first five-year plan was successful in terms of tasks: DneproGES, Uralmash were created, giant metallurgical plants appeared, including a plant in Magnitogorsk, Chelyabinsk, Norilsk and Novokuznetsk.  The first metro was opened in Moscow, tractor plants in Stalingrad and Kharkov began their activities.  Thus, the USSR received tremendous military power and industrial independence. </p>
