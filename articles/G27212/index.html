    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  This is the first plus that the Yuzhnaya Hotel (Volgograd) conquers its guests.  Only seven minutes separates it from the city center, that is, all city objects are available to you.  You can go to dinner every day at the new restaurant, attend city exhibitions and the museum during leisure hours, and all this does not take much time.  For visitors, the hotel is also very convenient, since it is only 20 minutes from the airport.  A shuttle service leads the hotel, so you don‚Äôt have to spend time looking for the right transport.  By the way, it will be useful to remember where the Yuzhny Hotel is located.  Address: Rabochoe-Krestyanskaya Street 18. This is the legacy of socialism. </p><h2>  It offers guests </h2><p>  This is probably the most important thing.  Hotel Yuzhnaya (Volgograd) offers its guests comfortable rooms that have everything you need for work and leisure.  In order for you to relax after a working day, there is a restaurant and bar, a fitness center.  For seminars and trainings, negotiations of varying complexity, there are well-equipped conference rooms and a business center.  Guests enjoy 24-hour free internet.  It is impossible to leave here unhappy, because the quality of service is at the highest level.  At the same time, the Yuzhnaya Hotel (Volgograd) has a fairly modest status - 3 stars.  This determines the low prices that tourists really like. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels of volgograd" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1111071.jpg" width="600"></div>

The building has 190 rooms of various categories.  Students and budget tourists can stay in standard single rooms.  If you like luxurious and sophisticated interiors, then the hotel can offer you a magnificent grand suite.  Absolutely all rooms are equipped with necessary appliances.  It has a TV and fridge, telephone, kettle, hairdryer and air conditioning.  The administrator is always ready to listen to any of your request and try to fulfill it.  By the way, I would like to emphasize separately that in 2011 all Volgograd hotels participated in the competition "Leaders of Travel Industry".  In the nomination "Best Hotel" won "South". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel south volgograd" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/1111141.jpg" width="600"></div>
