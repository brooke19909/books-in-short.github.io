    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel Dive Inn Swiss Resort 4 * excellent cuisine.  The main restaurant, where the main buffet-style meals are held, has a terrace, from where people sitting at tables can enjoy beautiful panoramic views.  There is an evening Sailors bar in the lobby.  It closes only at one in the morning.  Another lobby bar welcomes customers all day.  For a bite to eat, a cocktail or fresh drinks by the pool at Palms.  The food is very diverse, the choice is great.  The service is excellent.  Good breakfasts: omelets, cheeses, jams, buns, pancakes with all kinds of fillings, including chocolate.  There are a lot of different dishes, and I want to try all of them.  Daily give two types of meat, fish, poultry, vegetables, fruits.  Very tasty sweets, especially baklava.  Of the fruits there are pomegranate, watermelon, melon, oranges, dates, guava.  Well, dinner is, according to tourists, just a "feast of the stomach."  By the way, you need to keep in mind that there is a special system for serving drinks - both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.  For them you need to sign in a special check.  This is not done for payment, but for statistics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dive inn resort reviews" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/605570.jpg" width="312"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  Dive Inn Resort is not on the front line.  But at the same time, a regular shuttle service is organized to the sea.  Yes, and go there - some two or three minutes.  Those who wish can get on foot.  To go - about fifteen minutes past various shops with clothes and souvenirs.  True, the beach is small, and there are at least amenities.  But he is in the best in Sharm Bay Om al-Sayed.  There is a great reef with fish, and dozens of divers bring excursion boats and yachts to these shores daily.  For children, such a beach is not very suitable, but for those who like to dive - that's it.  Without a mask, a tube, and also special slippers for corals there is simply nothing to do there.  If there are really not enough places, you can go to the beaches of neighboring hotels.  The sea here is amazingly beautiful, and the fish swim right near the shore.  Twenty meters from the hotel there is a paid beach of El Fanar.  Tourists who come here not for the first time argue that it is best to walk or go to the sea in the morning and return to the hotel for dinner.  And spend time by the pool.  It is clean, it is cleaned constantly, and also large.  It is pleasant to swim in it, and there are enough sunbeds around on the terrace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dive inn resort 4 reviews" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/605574.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  A lot of entertainment for tourists offers a fun resort Sharm.  Dive Inn Resort 4 * for this reason in the evenings sends free minibuses to Naama Bay.  This bus leaves at nine in the evening, and returns around midnight.  There you can not only go to clubs and discos, but also just take a walk - this street is interesting, fun and safe.  In addition, you can buy a sightseeing tour of the resort.  As is often the case in the Egyptian desert, one of the best trips is an evening ATV ride to the "Bedouin village."  A colorful sunset among the mountains, camel riding, dancing and delicious food cooked at the stake, skating under the light of the stars are the usual set, which, as a rule, is very popular among the participants in the entertainment.  Other local attractions praise a boat trip to Tiran Island.  And, of course, many Russians use their stay on the Sinai Peninsula to drive to Israel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Dive inn resort" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/605575.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The cost of a room in this hotel varies in the region of one thousand six hundred rubles per room (for two).  For three dollars in a hotel you can smoke a hookah.  On the market in Naama Bay, you can buy delicious ten-pound freshes.  Taxi from the beach to the hotel costs one dollar.  To get to Naam Bay, you have to pay $ 2.  Signature soup at Il Mercato costs thirty pounds.  A set of masks with a tube costs four dollars.  Slippers in the shops near the hotel are usually bought for $ 5, and in the old town - for 3. Our compatriots advise taking excursions at local agencies, and not from tour operators in the hotel.  For example, a trip to Jerusalem at a hotel will cost one hundred and thirty dollars per person, and in Naama Bay you can buy it for sixty-five to seventy. </p><h2>  Dive Inn Resort 4 *: holiday reviews </h2><p>  The hotel is very comfortable and green.  It is small, but very calm and clean.  There is no fuss and mass, as in many other <span>Sharm hotels.</span>  The atmosphere is hospitable, all friendly.  Tourists write that after a while they feel like in a big family.  If something breaks down at your desk, it‚Äôs worth saying at the reception, and in about ten minutes the issue will be resolved.  There is no loss of things or money, and if you forget to close the safe door, the cleaner will make an inventory of the things that were there and give them to the manager.  Animators are very fiery.  The contingent of vacationers is intelligent, although more than half of tourists from Russia.  Do not scandal, do not get drunk, do not make noise at night.  Many write that they will return to this hotel, and if possible more than once.  After all, it guarantees one hundred percent rest.  Of course, if you are inclined to passively spend time by the pool with a cocktail, maybe you will find some disadvantages here.  But most travelers think that the Dive Inn Resort is the best budget four in Sharm. </p>
