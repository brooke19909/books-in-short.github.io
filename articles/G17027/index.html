    <p>  This place is unlikely to appeal to young people due to the small number of bars and restaurants.  Here you will not find noisy discos.  The resort is far from the airport, but it is precisely with its calm and silence that it will attract those tourists who are tired of the hustle and bustle of modern megalopolises.  Now it remains to decide on the hotel.  When choosing a hotel in Vietnam, you should be extremely attentive and prudent, be sure to get acquainted with the reviews of real vacationers.  Hotel Sai Gon Hotel 2 * - a budget option, which managed to find its fans.  A detailed review will evaluate the hotel from all sides and determine whether it is suitable for a quality vacation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  Hotel Sai Gon Hotel 2 * refers to beach hotels, and all because it is located on the first coastline.  This option is ideal for beach lovers who want to meet the sunrises and watch the sunsets on the coast.  The hotel is remote from the center of resort life, literally immersed in the greenery of tropical plants, so it will be a great place for lovers of nature and real exoticism. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  This small, cozy hotel is the jewel of Phan Thiet Resort.  It is located in a picturesque area, surrounded by chic virgin nature.  The center of resort life is only 10-15 minutes away.  There everyone can take advantage of the developed infrastructure: visit bars and cafes, night clubs and discos, buy souvenirs for friends and relatives.  Sai Gon Hotel 2 * (Nha Trang) gets positive reviews.  But this city hotel is definitely not suitable for beach lovers.  Yes, Sai Gon Hotel 2 * (Nha Trang) is located in the center of resort life, but two blocks from the coast.  It is more suitable for those tourists who prefer a more civilized vacation. </p>

    <p>  This is the most remote place from the airport, so the transfer can be a real challenge after a long flight.  But the only way you can find yourself in a truly paradise place and enjoy its exotic to the fullest.  You can get to the nearest resort and tourist areas not only on a rented motorbike, but also on public transport - bus.  Surely such a colorful trip will leave a vivid impression and will remain in your memory for a long time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Of course, all tourists want to understand what rooms and what level of comfort the Sai Gon Hotel 2 * hotel can offer them.  Reviews of tourists say that the rooms are quite small, but quite comfortable.  It‚Äôs stupid to count on a luxurious design while going to a 2 * hotel.  Nevertheless, there is everything you need on vacation: beds with comfortable mattresses, a wardrobe, a private bathroom with a shower and a set of necessary bath accessories.  The furniture is old, but quite colorful. </p>

    <p>  For the coolness and freshness in the Sai Gon Hotel 2 * hotel (Vietnam), air conditioning is responsible.  In some rooms it can junk, make strange sounds, but it does its job perfectly.  They also include a mini fridge, satellite TV and a telephone for contacting hotel staff.  Some vacationers complain of power outages, but for Vietnam, in particular the exotic resort of Phan Thiet, this is a common occurrence.  Some vacationers found exotic resort residents in their rooms - cute lizards.  For any Asian and so colorful resort, this is quite a common occurrence. </p><p>  Now for the room service.  Cleaning is daily and superficial; towels and bed linen are changed as needed.  For those tourists who can clean their things themselves, wipe the floor, this does not seem like a huge drawback. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  In Vietnam, in the resort of Phan Thiet, in particular, motorbikes are the most popular means of transport.  Rental locations are literally everywhere.  Those tourists who want to travel the entire resort on their own, to get acquainted with the most beautiful and secluded places, will surely take a motorbike.  If they stay at the Sai Gon Hotel 2 *, there will definitely not be any problems with parking, because there is a guarded parking lot on the hotel territory. </p>

    <p>  All vacationers will be able to use the outdoor pool.  It is small but fairly clean, equipped with comfortable and safe slopes.  Near the pool there are sun loungers and umbrellas, they are free for all guests.  The hotel area is quite small, but quite clean, well-groomed, lots of greenery. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Sai Gon Hotel 2 * does not offer food, which, perhaps, is even better.  Phan Thiet is the richest seafood in the Vietnam region, so tourists and vacationers should not deny themselves the pleasure of enjoying delicious national masterpieces.  The range of seafood dishes is so wide that every time you can order yourself a new dish.  The food here is very tasty and very inexpensive. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  A hotel of such a small category is unlikely to offer excellent service.  Sai Gon Hotel 2 * was no exception.  Reviews of tourists confirm the availability of wireless high-speed Internet, but connection to it is paid extra upon arrival.  The signal is excellent: it is enough to browse social networks, chat with friends and family, and even download movies. </p>

    <p>  The reception is open around the clock - the staff is quite polite and helpful, trying to solve problems as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately, the hotel staff does not understand English at all, so tourists may have difficulty explaining. </p><p>  For an additional fee, you can order a shuttle to the airport, as well as get acquainted with even the richest and most intense excursion program. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The main pride of the Sai Gon Hotel 2 * hotel is its own sandy beach.  The beach is excellent: fine white sand, gentle entry into the water, crystal clear sea water and a diverse underwater world.  It is an ideal place for a beach holiday.  Of course, given the remoteness of the hotel from resort life, there are very few vacationers on the beach. </p><p>  Here you will not find rental water and sports activities, along the coast do not sell seafood and soft drinks.  But tourists come here for the sake of peace and tranquility, so nothing will disturb their peace. </p>

    <p>  All vacationers should be very careful with the sun: it is very active here.  A few minutes of exposure to the sun without a protective measure can be burned.  That is why you need to pre-purchase sunscreens with the maximum protection factor and products that will help remove irritation from the skin in case you can not avoid a burn.  There is also nothing to do without a headdress on the coast. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  If you are used to relaxing in luxurious luxury hotels, you are unlikely to like the Sai Gon Hotel 2 * hotel.  He is certainly far from ideal.  But for those tourists who are looking forward to a beach holiday, want to enjoy the sea, the sun and stunning Asian nature, even this modest option is a good fit.  That is why all unpretentious natures are advised to pay special attention to it. </p>
