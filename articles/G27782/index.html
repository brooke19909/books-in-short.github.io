The modern market for baby products offers an extremely wide range for newborns.  Beautiful jumpsuits and rompers, blouses and pants - all this, no doubt, is.  However, alas, one can hardly vouch for their quality.  Of course, if you buy children's clothing in expensive company stores, then the quality issue is automatically removed.  But not every family is ready to give 500-1000 rubles for children's sliders.  And why, if the baby grows out of them in 2-3 months?  And I also really want the clothes of the crumbs to be not only high-quality, but also unusual, not like the clothes of hundreds of other such children. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt have enough money to buy expensive exclusive items, then why not take this matter into your own hands?  Do not just buy another jumpsuit or sweater, but show your imagination and create a beautiful and <span>unusual thing</span> with your own hands <span>.</span>  For example, knitting overalls for a newborn is a very interesting thing, although not quite simple.  Of course, you should not start learning how to knit with children's overalls, first you need to practice something simpler, for example, a scarf, hat or blouse.  And when, as they say, the hand is full, you can take for <span>knitting overalls for the newborn.</span>  It‚Äôs not really that difficult to knit.  Overalls for your baby can be created in a few days if there is a desire and perseverance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Why are self-related things so good?  Firstly, quality.  You choose the yarn so that it is soft and comfortable, to reliably protect from the cold and let air through.  Secondly, uniqueness.  You yourself choose the color and style, pattern and ways of decorating things.  Thirdly, the love invested in this work. </p><p>  A tiny jumpsuit for a child will need only 200 grams of yarn, knitting needles, the size of which must be chosen in accordance with the pattern and model of the jumpsuit, as well as some free time.  In addition, you will need to get patterns with patterns (there are a huge number of them on needlework sites and the like). </p><p>  Also, if you are planning to start knitting overalls for kids, a few tips will come in handy. </p><p>  1. The choice of yarn.  You have to knit overalls for the newborn, so the yarn should be soft, light, thin and natural.  If we are talking about a winter jumpsuit, then a merino or cashmere thread is suitable, and if you are preparing to knit a spring jumpsuit, you need to choose a thinner yarn.  Pay attention to its ‚Äúfluffiness‚Äù: a too long pile can get into the child‚Äôs eyes and mouth.  In addition, the yarn should in no case be pricked. </p><p>  2. Color.  Here, of course, everything rests on the personal taste of the parents.  Some choose discreet pastel colors, some are non-fading and dark, while others prefer to see their baby in clothes of bright green or sunny yellow color. </p><p>  3. Figure.  If you have the first experience and want to learn how to knit overalls for a newborn, then it is better to start with the simplest pattern - a scarf or <span>hosiery.</span>  And even if you already knit perfectly, try not to get carried away with complex patterns and especially seams and elastic bands.  Also pay attention to the density of the knit: the jumpsuit should be soft. </p><p>  size 4.  When choosing a knitting pattern, be sure to consider the growth of the baby, as well as a certain reserve "for growth". </p><p>  5. The model.  Since we are talking about overalls for a very tiny child, you need to knit it so that it is convenient to put on and take off.  Between the legs and on the shoulders should be fasteners, or another option is a zipper.  You can also tie the jumpsuit on the straps, with which you can adjust the growth, thereby increasing its service life. </p>
