Interest rate, age limit</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sberbank of Russia today is the most reliable and universal bank in our country, the trust in which has been confirmed by years and millions of satisfied customers.  A variety of <span>credit programs,</span> money transfers, fast payments and other high-class services provided by Sberbank are highly valued by Russian citizens. </p><p>  One of its main features is the social orientation of credit and financial products.  In particular, I would like to note that Sberbank gives a loan to pensioners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank loan terms for senior citizens" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39719/1051065.jpg" width="373"></div>  And he distinguishes them into a separate social group, because their income, although stable, is, in most cases, small.  It is in connection with this circumstance that the conditions of a loan at Sberbank are favorable for pensioners.  Moreover, a pensioner at the time of <span>obtaining a loan</span> can work, and maybe even be unemployed.

    <h2>  Preferential conditions </h2><p>  The conditions of a loan at Sberbank for pensioners provide for special privileges to persons receiving a pension in an account with this bank: </p><p>  · Reduced interest rates on any loan product; </p><p>  · Presentation of only one document (passport) when applying for a loan; </p><p>  · A loan application is considered as soon as possible (the decision will be known within 2 hours); </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  · A pensioner can come with an application to absolutely any branch of Sberbank that issues loans (moreover, regardless of where it is registered); </p><p>  · There is an alternative related to the method of receiving money: whether they will be issued in cash or transferred to the borrower's card. </p><h2>  Types of loans </h2><p>  In addition to the fact that Sberbank provides loans to individuals, among them it also allocates a separate category - pensioners.  Types of loan products for people of retirement age are quite diverse, but the bank is very strict about their approval, understanding that this category of citizens implies a rather high risk of non-payment of funds.  Therefore, Sberbank of Russia grants loans to pensioners only if the credit history of the borrower is impeccable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank loan for senior citizens interest rate" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39719/1052725.jpg" width="553"></div>  Sberbank divides loans for seniors into several categories:

The minimum amount is 15,000 rubles (for Moscow consumers of banking services - 45,000), and the maximum loan maximum is 1,500,000 rubles. </p><p>  <span>Sberbank</span> provides a <span>loan</span> for pensioners, the interest rate for which is determined depending on the loan term: </p><p>  · A loan issued for a period of up to 2 years will be taxed at least 17% per year; </p><p>  · Borrowing money from a bank for five years will cost a pensioner 18.5% a year or more. </p>

    <h2>  Borrower age limit </h2><p>  Since Sberbank provides these loans to individuals whose age is retirement, it is logical to note that at the time of the application, the borrower should already have a pension, and it must be no older than 65 years.  In addition, it is important that, at the time of fulfillment of loan obligations, the borrower is under 75 years of age. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Bank employees consider the submitted application within two business days, and it can be executed within a month from the moment of receiving a positive response.  Repayment occurs in equal monthly installments.  Early repayment will not require any additional fees from the borrower.  Sberbank does not establish either the minimum part of the prepayment in advance or the minimum term for the prepayment of the loan in full.  Forfeit for late payment is standard and amounts to 0.5% of the amount of the monthly installment.  She adds to the debt in this amount every day. </p><h2>  Surety loan </h2><p>  The conditions of the loan at Sberbank for pensioners provide for the possibility of a loan of large sums of money, only for this it will be necessary to attract guarantors without fail.  The presence of people who increase money back guarantees automatically increases the credit ceiling to 3 million rubles.  The process of obtaining and servicing a loan is identical to the usual consumer option.  The repayment period varies from 3 months to 5 years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank gives a loan to pensioners" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39719/1051045.jpg" width="600"></div>  The main advantages of this type of lending are attractive interest rates and the absence of payment commissions.

    <p>  Pensioners serviced by Sberbank can obtain a consumer loan guaranteed by individuals at a rate of 16.5% per annum, and those wishing to borrow money in dollars or euros will receive even greater benefits.  For them, the annual percentage will be at least 13.5%. </p><p>  Sberbank gives a loan to pensioners whose age at the time the contract expires does not exceed the threshold of 75 years. </p><h2>  Credit cards </h2><p>  Favorable credit card service tariffs with a large limit amount are available to pensioners who are participants in Sberbank's salary or pension projects.  Also, this product can get borrowers with a positive credit history and customers with a debit card.  In such cases, a credit card is offered to the customer pre-approved.  And the application for it is considered by the manager of Sberbank as soon as possible, he immediately reports the available limit on it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank loan to senior citizens percentage" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39719/1051029.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is enough for a pensioner to present a passport with Russian citizenship and registration.

    <h2>  Car loan </h2><p>  Bank loans for retirees can be provided for the purchase of a car, both new and used.  If a car of domestic or Chinese production was already in use, then its age should not be older than 5 years, and if the foreign car was manufactured in another country, then it should be produced no more than 10 years ago. </p><p>  <span>Sberbank</span> does not provide for a <span>car loan</span> .  You can not provide proof of income if you make a down payment of 30% of the loan amount for your favorite car.  You can also provide the bank with any of its property as collateral. </p><p>  To buy a car, I’m ready to give Sberbank a loan to pensioners, the percentage of which will vary from 13.5 to 15% at a minimum rate depending on the loan term.  Preferential interest is also charged for using a loan in foreign currency: a loan up to 1 year, up to 3 years and up to 5 is taxed 10.5%, 11.5% and 12% respectively.  The indicated prices are valid for pensioners serviced by Sberbank as pension recipients, while other customers will receive a loan with a rate of 1% more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank loan for senior citizens interest rate" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39719/1051022.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Up to 5 million rubles can be obtained as a loan, and the smallest amount - 45,000 rubles.  As soon as the bank has approved the application, the countdown begins to select the object of lending, which lasts 90 days. </p><h2>  Mortgage credit lending </h2><p>  For the purchase of housing, one can find quite acceptable loan conditions at Sberbank for pensioners.  This participant in the financial and credit market offers elderly clients three housing lending programs: </p><ul><li>  purchase of finished housing; </li><li>  acquisition of an object under construction; </li><li>  building a house on your own. </li></ul><p>  It provides Sberbank a loan for pensioners, the interest rate on which is one percent lower than the standard annual mortgage interest. </p><p>  By purchasing finished or under construction housing, persons of retirement age are entitled to take a loan in the amount of 45 thousand rubles.  The minimum down payment in this case will be 15% of the price of the house. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank loan to retirees age" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39719/1051020.jpg" width="600"></div>  The maximum term for a home loan is 30 years.  With an initial payment of half the cost of the apartment, the borrower can make the loan more profitable, that is, the interest rate on it will decrease to 12% per year.
