    <p>  Ada Boyana in Montenegro was first mentioned in the annals only in the late 1850s.  During a storm, a ship sank at the mouth of the Boyana River.

At the same time, the island receives about 1000 tourists who want to visit the resort of Ada Boyana in Montenegro.  In the photo above you can see the small size of the island. </p><p>  Today, about 1 thousand vacationers can come to the resort at the same time.  The official language of the inhabitants of the island of Ada Bojana in Montenegro is Serbian. </p><h2>  Tours to Montenegro </h2><p>  Ada Boyana is one of the largest resorts in the country, therefore it is most popular among tourists.

Or inside the island, hiding from everyone in a hotel, wrapped in pine forests and mountains.  The first thing that people on the island say is a small number of vacationers.  This is what helps to feel unity with nature, to feel free. </p><h2>  Holidays on the island </h2><p>  There are not so many entertainments at the resort, since tourism began to develop only in recent decades.  And more people come here for privacy and silence.  However, you can still have fun. </p><ol><li>  Once a week, the resort organizes ‚Äúfishing gatherings‚Äù, during which everyone is gathered on the beach.  You can learn fishing completely free of charge, for an additional fee your local cook will prepare your catch. </li><li>  During the "river tour" tourists are shown the local beauty of the island, circling it on all sides by boat.  Sometimes guides negotiate with boat drivers and tourists to the border with Albania, sometimes making stops so that guests can swim in the Adriatic Sea. </li><li>  One of the island‚Äôs most famous attractions is Fish Picnic.  All comers go by boat along the coast of the island to a picturesque bay located in the cliffs of Ulcinj.  Tourists catch fish with experienced fishermen, and then cook it on the grill according to an old recipe.  This is delicious. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ada Boyana Montenegro" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56088/1945573.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Ways to get to the island </h2><p>  The cost of air tickets from Moscow to Montenegro is different.  So, for example, to Tivat from Moscow in September you can get from 4 to 7 thousand one way.  To Podgorica, the price is approximately the same: in September it varies from 4 to 10 thousand rubles.  Flight time takes from 3 to 5 hours. </p><p>  The distance from the above cities of Montenegro to the island is the same.  Buses run from the bus station of Podgorica daily to the island.  The price is about 300 rubles, the trip time will be about 90 minutes.  From the airport to the city station, you can get for <span>500-700 rubles</span> using a taxi.  Total: from the airport Podgorica to the resort can be reached in 2 hours, while spending about 1000-1500 rubles. </p><p>  From Tivat station to the city located on the island only one bus runs, only at 9 am.  The ticket price is about 600 rubles.  If you got later than the specified time, it does not matter - you can get with transfers.  At Tivat Airport you need to walk to the Yadrinsky Way and take any bus going to Budva.  The ticket cost will be 200-250 rubles, and only 30 minutes on the road.

Getting this way is much cheaper if you are traveling not alone, but with your family. </p><h2>  What to bring from Montenegro </h2><p>  The most important souvenir from Montenegro is, of course, wine.  It is made from red and white grape varieties, and has an exquisite taste.  The drink will delight even the most avid gourmet.  Prices will especially surprise: the cost of a bottle starts from 200 rubles. </p>
