Today, beadworks are striking in their beauty.  Masters offer real masterpieces.  Among the many works, one can see amazingly beautiful bracelets, chic necklaces, as well as do-it-yourself beaded rings.  This stuff is back in fashion. </p><h2>  Do it yourself </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ring from beads how to make" class="if uuid-3135945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3135945.jpg"></div><p>  You do not have to go to the store for a beautiful decoration.  You can make a ring from beads with your own hands.  This has a number of advantages.  Firstly, the decoration will cost a small amount.  Secondly, the creator will have an exclusive little thing, because no one will definitely have such a ring.  And you can have a wonderful time with the child, together creating simple jewelry.  They also say that the best gift is one that is made by oneself.  Therefore, the decoration can be presented for a birthday to a fashionable girlfriend or sister. </p><p>  We turn to the main question, how to make a ring from beads with your own hands.  About it further. </p><h2>  The choice of materials for work </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.davidjones.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Earrings rings" class="if uuid-3135933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3135933.jpg"></div><p>  Some rings are real masterpieces that are not inferior in beauty even to jewelry.  Naturally, such products need high-quality materials.  The cheapest and most affordable beads is Chinese.  It is inexpensive, but its quality leaves much to be desired: beads of different sizes, uneven edges, chips.  In weaving, all its flaws will be noticeable - it is hard to make such a beautiful product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many needlewomen use Czech beads.  It is more expensive than Chinese, but the quality is better.  The most expensive and highest quality is Japanese beads.  It has smooth edges, it does not fade and has a rich color palette. </p><p>  To create a ring with your own hands from beads, you will also need auxiliary materials: </p><ul><li>  thin eye bead needle; </li><li>  thread (you can also use monofilament, wire or fishing line); </li><li>  sharp scissors; </li><li>  beads, rhinestones, bicones, rondels, natural stones or pearls; </li><li>  base for the ring (if necessary). </li></ul><h2>  Simple weaving </h2><p>  The first type of bead rings is completely made of beads.  Such a force even for beginners.  It is very simple to make rings from beads with your own hands: you need to string the beads on a thread, and then close it into a ring.  It remains only to fix the ends - and the jewelry can be worn.  For such a model, it is best to use wire: with it, the ring will be tougher and it is better to keep the shape. </p><p>  The following weaving pattern is a little more complicated, but it can be dealt with in 10 minutes.  Three beads are strung on a thread, then their two ends pass through the fourth (in the opposite direction). </p><p>  This pattern is called the "cross".  Then, again, one bead is put on each tip of the thread and, with the help of another, is brought out in the opposite direction.  Weaving is necessary until the length of the workpiece is not equal to the girth of the finger. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Weaving pattern" class="if uuid-3135879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3135879.jpg"></div><p>  Then you should close the weave into a ring, tie a strong knot and hide the ends of the weave in the holes of the beads.  If the work was carried out on a fishing line, then it can be melted with a lighter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But you need to do this carefully so as not to touch the knot. </p><h2>  Metal rings </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Metal ring" class="if uuid-3135920" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3135920.jpg"></div><p>  The next type of jewelry that you should know about is metal-based rings.  When creating, only the upper decorative part is weaved from beads and beads, and the grasping finger remains in its original form.  For such jewelry, it is advisable to use not only beads, but also beads, as well as crystals or rhinestones.  Work with them will look much richer.  The braided element is attached to the base with glue or fishing line, if there are special holes for attaching decor. </p><h2>  DIY Bead Ring Earrings </h2><p>  Many needlewomen, having mastered the technique of weaving, can not stay on one product.  If you made a large number of rings with your own hands from beads, then earrings can also be made from them.  To do this, you need studs, special metal fasteners.  Two identical rings must be attached to them.  Although asymmetrical earrings are in fashion now (when they are similar to each other, but still have some difference). </p><p>  If the ears are not pierced, then clips can be made from the rings.  The manufacturing technology will be similar to earrings: the rings must be fixed on a special metal base.  You can also make a bracelet, necklace or pendant from the rings in the kit. </p>
