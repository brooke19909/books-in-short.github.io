    <p>  According to the experience of experienced tourists, the view from the window should not be the main criterion when choosing a room.  Vacationers, as a rule, spend most of their time outside the hotel, and only in the evening can they watch paintings outside the window.  But in Nha Trang it gets dark very early, and from the windows of the rooms you will not see either the sea or beautiful landscapes.  Many even advise choosing apartments with a view of the street or city.  In the night lights it looks more impressive than the dark sea. </p>
