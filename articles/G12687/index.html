The explanation is simple: some models look much more interesting than others.  And there is nothing to be surprised at: manufacturers use various tools (marketing, design, price) in order to ‚Äúhook‚Äù the buyer, hold on to this market at a time of such a high saturation.  Someone succeeds better, someone worse.  As a result, there are popular smartphones that a large number of people are eyeing, and there are less successful instances that are left somewhere in the shade. </p><p>  In this article, we describe those devices that are in high demand in their segment.  These are the most popular smartphones from different categories.  We give such a division into classes in order to more accurately characterize the market.  Indeed, you must admit that each gadget model has its own price, which is why even the most popular smartphones with a high cost are inferior to the less bought, but more affordable gadgets due to the insufficient <span>purchasing power of</span> our consumers. </p>

    <h2>  Demarcation criteria </h2><p>  In the article, we will divide the entire smartphone industry into 4 parts: budget devices, the middle class, above the average, as well as top gadgets.  If we talk about digital expression, then the scope is approximately the following: up to 10 thousand, from 10 to 20, from 20 to 30 and over 30 thousand rubles per device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Budgetary </h2><p>  Obviously, the most popular smartphones in this category are the best-selling, in principle, due to the low cost of one device.  Judging by the reviews on the electronics sites, as well as on the statistics published on the mobile retailer sites, representatives of the brands Samsung, Lenovo, Nokia, and LG are popular. </p><h2>  <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Star Plus </h2>

    <p>  At a price of just 4,500 rubles, this model turned out to be a real bestseller both in the Asian market of developing countries and throughout the CIS.  On the one hand, the gadget has a very affordable price (quite capable of competing with the cost of Chinese smartphones).  On the other hand, this is the Samsung brand, known worldwide for the high quality of its products.  These two factors determining the choice in favor of Star Plus are complemented by a 4-inch screen with a resolution of 800 by 480, support for two SIM cards, as well as preinstalled Android 4.1.  It turns out that for a little money the gadget is equipped with everything necessary.  And while there is nothing superfluous. </p><h2>  Lenovo S660 </h2><p>  It would be surprising if there was no ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù in the list of budget smartphones.  Consider the Lenovo S660.  This device is included in the ‚ÄúPopular smartphones‚Äù category both due to its price of 9 thousand rubles, and because of the stylish design (the back cover looks like a metal one).  There is also a tenacious 3000 mAh battery, a high-quality HD screen and all the basic characteristics of any other Android device (with version 4.2 of the operating system). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nokia Lumia 530 </h2><p>  Another representative of ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù phones, which at the same time operates on the basis of the Windows Phone OS, is the Lumia 530 smartphone. Its price is very low: only 4 thousand rubles.  For the money you get a device with an excellent camera, a colorful screen and a cool case design (made in bright colors, Nokia's proprietary move).  Again, the phone can be called practical, as it accepts 2 SIM cards.  And you still wonder why it is included in the section ‚ÄúMost popular smartphones in Russia‚Äù? </p>

    <h2>  LG L90 </h2><p>  Another best-selling phone is the product of a Korean company, sold for 9 thousand rubles.  Android 4.4 is preinstalled on it (as you can see, the latest of all presented in this section).  Here, there is practically everything that the user may need: a 2540 mAh battery, a powerful Qualcomm processor, a powerful 8 megapixel camera. </p><h2>  Middle class </h2>

    <p>  The next segment that we are describing includes telephones, which at a price exceed the performance of ‚Äústate employees‚Äù, but do not go beyond the mark of 20 thousand.  This includes, for example, the once popular smartphones from higher classes (like the iPhone 4S) and its competitor counterpart with the Android operating system - Samsung Galaxy S4.  These phones, which have a strong technical background, can also boast of a serious image and design, due to which they continue to be bought by those who set a budget of 20 thousand per device. </p><p>  A pair of high-tech ‚Äúex-flagships‚Äù is complemented by LG Nexus 5 and HTC One mini 2. Both devices boast powerful equipment and an affordable price of 20 thousand rubles.  However, according to the criteria of the processor, RAM and battery, the duel between them clearly wins the Nexus 5. </p><h2>  "Above average" </h2>

    <p>  If in the previous section we described popular smartphones that were previously at the peak of the technological industry, being flagships, then this section presents those devices that are still relevant on the market: they have modern parameters, support working with a mass of marketable ones (today) functions.  These are the popular models of smartphones that are not flagships; rather, they play a secondary role in their lineup.  At the same time, they are cheaper and more affordable, which has a positive effect on their popularity. </p><p>  For example, take at least Samsung Galaxy Alpha.  The device is really strong (4.7-inch screen with HD technology, a 12-megapixel camera, a powerful Exynos processor and a stylish case) - all this for 25 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The same price is another representative, included in the group of ‚Äúpopular smartphones in Russia‚Äù - LG G3.  The device has a colorful QHD screen, a camera with laser auto focus, a decent Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor. </p><p>  Among the most purchased devices at a price of up to 30 thousand is also the HTC One M8.  The device has a display with Full-HD, the same as in LG, a processor, a large supply of RAM (2 GB).  Of course, these are not all popular <span>smartphones.</span>  <span>The rating</span> can be expanded indefinitely, including various Chinese devices (which, by the way, are in great demand) from Meizu and Xiaomi, and Nokia Lumia 930 (made in a classic bright case and equipped with a powerful camera on Windows Phone OS).  This also includes the outdated generation of the flagship Samsung Galaxy S5. </p><h2>  Top class </h2>

    <p>  Finally we got to the most expensive popular devices.  As you can guess, this includes ‚Äúapple‚Äù products - Apple iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S.  The first one costs about 35 thousand rubles, the price of the following rises to 37-42 thousand per copy (depending on where you are thinking of purchasing them).  Smartphones should not be characterized separately - and it is so clear that they embody the latest achievements of the giant company, have a stylish appearance and, in general, set the trends in the mobile industry for many years to come. </p><p>  <span>Samsung Galaxy Note 4</span> , an even more expensive gadget, belongs to the same category <span>.</span> The device, offered for 37-40 thousand rubles, is equipped with three gigabytes of RAM, it is offered with a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù stylus and a 16 megapixel camera that can take cool pictures in any conditions.  On the market, this phone is positioned as the most technological of all the gadgets presented in the Android segment. </p><p>  Another model that deserves the title of one of the most popular, released by Lenovo.  This is the Vibe Z2 Pro, available for 35-40 thousand rubles.  The device has a strict style defined by a metal case with cross-shaped engraving on the back cover.  A powerful 4000 mAh battery, a Snapdragon 801 processor, 3 GB of RAM and 16 and 5 megapixel cameras (main and front, respectively) are still the limit of technology that is on the market.  It is this device that is in high demand in its price class. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  As you can see, each of the presented segments has its own leaders who are in higher demand among users than their competitors.  This is determined by different factors, but, as you can see, having seen the sales leader, we see really the most technologically advanced and optimal in terms of price / quality device that deserves attention. </p>
