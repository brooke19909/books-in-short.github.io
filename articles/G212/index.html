    <h2>  Hydroelectric Power Station and Reservoir </h2><p>  Since 1935, the Chemal River (photo is in the article) has a hydroelectric power station.  Today it is the only one in the nearby territory.  The hydroelectric station is named after the river.  It is noteworthy in it that it was built by prisoners from the Siberian camp.  The dam of the described station blocks the river 300 meters from the area where Chemal flows into Katun. </p><p>  In the confluence area, the reservoir of the same name was formed.  In addition, this area is a visited attraction.  Throughout the entire coastline, the Chemal River (mainly in lowlands) has a large number of recreational opportunities (for example, equipped campsites and tourist camps). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Unfortunately, due to the hydroelectric power station, there are not very many fish in the pond.  The fact is that the hydroelectric station does not allow vertebrates to enter the stream.  In addition to the place where the two rivers merge, in this area the most visited sights include the Chemal hydroelectric station and the island of Patmos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chemal river mountain Altai" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1374236.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The current status of the station </h2><p>  The Chemal hydroelectric power station supplied electricity to a sanatorium functioning nearby and some nearby settlements.  However, after 75 years of operation in 2011, an accident occurred, as a result of which the station temporarily ceased operations.  After 3 years - in 2014 - there was a flood known to many in Altai.  As a result, part of the dam was flooded.  Since then, the Chemal River and hydroelectric power stations have become a place for tourists to visit, a kind of museum.  There are also guided tours.  Due to the popularity of this blurry dam, tents with local souvenirs, cafes and various attractions were set up nearby. </p><h2>  What attracts this river? </h2><p>  Those who have not visited this area are wondering what is remarkable about the Chemal River and the Katun pond, in addition to fresh air and pleasant landscapes.  After all, the same atmosphere can be obtained in other regions of the immense Russian Federation.  And the thing is that when the crystal clear Chemal flows into muddy Katun, the border becomes noticeable for several hundred meters.  To observe this natural wonder, you can climb the high ledge, which is located directly above Katun. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Due to the frequent attendance of these places, a small market has appeared here.  Most often they sell souvenirs from Altai artisans, honey, medicinal herbs.  Moreover, there is also an amusement park nearby, and on the Chemal reservoir itself, tourists are offered to ride motor boats, catamarans and carry out rafting on the rivers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation facilities on the river Chemal" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1374243.jpg" width="600"></div>
