  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What hot springs of the Chelyabinsk region to visit? Short review</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Even in ancient times, people believed that if a wounded or exhausted person plunges into a thermal spring, then he will immediately regain strength.  The water in them is heated by the heat of magma and, rising from the bowels of the earth to the surface, is enriched with minerals and other useful substances.  Sulfur cures skin diseases, calcium, radon, zinc and sodium help eliminate problems with the musculoskeletal system, and magnesium soothes the nerves.  Some sources even cope with female infertility.  The main thing when visiting such places so that the disease is not in the phase of exacerbation, otherwise hot water can only do harm. </p><p>  Thermal keys have made the tourism industry flourish in Hungary, Japan, the Czech Republic, Italy and France.  But it turns out that this exotic is also found in the Urals.  Below you will find a brief overview of the hot springs of the Chelyabinsk region. </p><div class="photo" data-original="istochniki-tyumeni.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hot springs of the Chelyabinsk region" class="if uuid-2240695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2240695.jpg"></div><h2>  Yetkul Village </h2><p>  The village is located on a huge <span>underground reservoir</span> with thermal water.  Therefore, wherever you drill a well, there will appear a swimming pool comfortable for swimming at any time of the year. </p><p>  Etkul village is famous for its picturesque nature.  This is probably why the village is crowded with recreation facilities and has long been considered a recreation zone among residents of Chelyabinsk.  A suburban bus number 140 even goes here. But not all residents of the regional center know where the hot springs are in the Chelyabinsk region.  Therefore, many trust their leisure travel agencies.  In the city, many agencies organize trips to thermal pools.  There are weekend tours or short sessions (morning and evening) in Etkul, because the village is located some 42 km from Chelyabinsk.  Almost all bases in Etkul have their own pools with thermal mineral water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.google.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where are the hot springs in the Chelyabinsk region" class="if uuid-2240711" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2240711.jpg"></div><h2>  To the <span>hot springs of the Chelyabinsk region on</span> their own </h2><p>  Nobody forbids you to come to the village yourself.  Almost all recreation centers let (though tightly) everyone who wants to plunge into the pool.  And for this, it is not at all necessary to check into hotels or come with an excursion organized by travel agencies.  If you are a motorist, leave Chelyabinsk and move southeast of the city.  After half an hour drive along the highway E123, you will reach the village of Kalachevo.  Next, continue along the A310 road.  Excluding traffic jams at the exit from Chelyabinsk, you will reach Etkul in forty minutes.  Route No. 140 goes from the bus station of the regional center ‚ÄúCity Hospital‚Äù to the village. By paying directly to the recreation center for using the hot springs of the Chelyabinsk region, you will save money and avoid the hustle, and it will inevitably happen if all passengers of the sightseeing bus get into the tank at once. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": -, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hot springs of the Chelyabinsk region on their own" class="if uuid-2240718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2240718.jpg"></div><h2>  What recreation center to choose </h2><p>  Mineral water in all thermal pools of Etkul has one chemical composition and approximately the same temperature.  After all, these are only different wells, and the underground lake is one for all. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But still, the choice of a recreation center is of no small importance.  In some institutions, the pools are small and are only indoors, in others - in the open.  In some places, pleasure is limited to a simple tank in which you can stand. </p><p>  Sanitary and hygienic conditions and the concomitant rest in the hot springs of the Chelyabinsk region also vary.  Judging by the reviews, the most comfortable and acceptable services are two bases in Etkul - Forest Tale and Terme Alexandria.  We will now briefly characterize them. </p><h2>  "Baden-Baden" or "Forest Tale" </h2><p>  This double-name establishment has been operating since 2015.  This summer, three more were added to the existing large swimming pool: two indoors and one outdoors next to the exit from the building.  According to tourists in the reviews, the temperature in all tanks is very comfortable.  Guests are offered all types of hydromassage: guns, underwater jets, countercurrent, etc. </p><p>  Near this hot spring of the Chelyabinsk region there is a sauna and a salt cave.  A fungus-fungus is equipped for children.  The complex includes a decent hotel, cafe, a small zoo.  In winter, ice skating is free at the nearby lake. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vershinatur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hot springs in the Chelyabinsk region photo" class="if uuid-2240725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2240725.jpg"></div><h2>  "The Baths of Alexandria" </h2><p>  Just one photo of a hot spring in the Chelyabinsk region makes you want to plunge into these clear blue waters and relax in a comfortable temperature of + 39 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  What are the advantages of this place?  The pool is outdoors in the heart of a pine forest.  In summer, its edges are lined with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Numerous hydromassage installations make wellness more effective. </p><p>  Fun for children.  But there is one ‚Äúbut‚Äù: the water for the pool does not come from the well, but from Gorky Lake.  It is heated to the desired temperature, and this reduces the concentration of mineral salts.  But the leisure infrastructure at Alexandria is at its best.  The term complex, which includes a Russian steam bath, sauna and hammam, is especially pleasing to visitors. </p>
