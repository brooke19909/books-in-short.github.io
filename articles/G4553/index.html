There is also a nearby town of Apatity.  There are also ski slopes and lifts.  And what do tourists themselves say about the Khibiny?  How to get to this harsh region?  What period will be the best for a ski holiday?  Where to stay?  What are the prices at the resort?  Read about all this in this article. </p>

    <h2>  Where are the Khibiny Mountains </h2><p>  This is a very old array.  He is already more than 350 million years old.  The highest point of Khibin is Mount Yudychvumchorr (1200 meters above sea level).  Despite their modest size, they are the highest mountains of the Russian Arctic.  And tourists report that the air here is rarefied.  But this effect does not come from altitude, but from the Arctic air itself.  Khibiny on the map of Russia can be found on the <span>Kola Peninsula.</span>  The main city of Kirovsk is located in the <span>Murmansk region,</span> near Helsinki, the capital of Finland.  On three sides it is surrounded by mountains, and on the fourth it adjoins Big Lake Wudyavr.  The city appeared relatively recently, in the 20s of the last century, as a result of industrial development of apatite rocks.  Kirovsk lies on the southern slopes of the Khibin.  Apatity is located twelve kilometers from it, on the banks of the Belaya River.  The entire territory is part of the Zasheykovsky forestry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Khibiny located north of the Arctic Circle.  This means that from mid-December to the second half of January, the sun does not rise here at all.  But almost a month lasts a <span>polar day.</span>  Here in June and early July the sun does not set at all.  The climate in the area where the Khibiny Mountains are located is not as severe as you would expect from the Arctic.  Affects the proximity of the Gulf Stream - a warm current that softens crackling frosts.  Although tourists say that sometimes in January a thermometer here can show minus thirty-five.  But winters are mild and very snowy.  Sparkling cover in some places lasts in the summer.  In the “hottest” July, the average temperature fluctuates around twelve degrees, although there are really warm days when the air warms up to + 20 ° C. Tourists claim that it is worth going to Khibiny <span>(ski resort</span> Kirovsk) in April-May.  At this time it is not so windy, there is hope to find clear weather, and daylight hours are great.  But there is no shortage of vacationers at the resort in the winter.  People come here to celebrate New Year and Christmas.  After all, the tracks are well lit on a polar night.  During this period, you can admire the northern lights. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  How to find Khibiny airport on a location map?  The facility is located a forty-minute drive from the city of Kirovsk.  It takes regular flights from Moscow and St. Petersburg.  The airport is small, and most tourists arrive through the hub of Murmansk.  Airliners from Nord Avia, Russia, RusLine, UTair and others fly there from various cities of Russia.  Regular buses run from Murmansk to Khibin.  Travel time is about three hours.  The distance between the capital and Kirovsk is about 1400 kilometers.  You need to travel by train for about a day.  Moreover, in Apatity you need to do a transplant.  Therefore, tourists recommend: choose air transport.  From Khibiny airport to the hotel you will take a taxi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khibiny Resort" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/678832.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Natural attractions </h2><p>  At the entrance to Kirovsk (Khibiny) the ski resort appears in all its glory.  Two mountains rise above the city: Aikuayvenchorr (which means “Sleeping Beauty”) and Vudyavrchorr.  On the slopes of the last peak is a unique botanical garden - one of three on the planet located beyond the Arctic Circle.  If you climb up the slope, you can observe a change in natural landscapes: the valley tundra, spruce taiga, birch twig, alpine mosses and the Arctic desert.  In addition to the mountain trails, there is also a flat ski stretching for fourteen kilometers.  You can ride it on a snowmobile.  Hiking enthusiasts are advised to take a helicopter tour: it delivers tourists to one of the four peaks, and you can go down, admiring the pristine nature of the Khibin.  The resort also has plenty of entertainment for fans of heli-skiing.  However, both tourists and rescuers warn that the slopes are avalanche-dangerous, and you need to go on such a trip with an instructor. </p><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Khibiny is a ski resort that is currently undergoing rapid development.  Infrastructure still, as noted by the reviews, does not reach the European one, but in recent years many new and comfortable hotels have appeared in Kirovsk and Apatity.  You can also stay in the private sector.  Tourists advise: when looking for housing, take into account the proximity of the track where you are going to ride.  In total, there are four ski resorts in Khibiny.  Each of them has its own hotels and hostels.  For example, at the KolaSportLend GLK, you can stay at the Sport Hotel.  Out of ten hotels located in the center of Kirovsk, tourists distinguish Severnaya, leaving extremely positive reviews about it.  The price includes a transfer to the ski area "Big Woodyavr". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where are the mountains of the khibiny" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/678328.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Trails </h2><p>  What to expect skiers coming to Khibiny?  The ski resort provides a lot of opportunities for outdoor activities.  In addition to the usual tracks of varying difficulty, there are ski jumps, a modular stadium, and an ice rink.  The track is rammed by Austrian snow groomers.  Seven tows and two chair lifts deliver upstairs tourists.  There are cafes and equipment rental facilities.  You need to choose a complex based on how confident you are skiing.  Ases are attracted by the slopes of Mount Kukisvumchorr.  Those who prefer a board to skis will find a lot of interesting things for themselves in Khibiny Snow Park.  Novice athletes have chosen the "North Slope".  They also ride on the so-called "Twenty-Fifth Kilometer".  A bus runs from Kirovsk there.  There is a very developed tourist infrastructure, and experts advise to go "25 km" at least once.  In Apatity, skiers ride on the slopes of Vorobinoy Mountain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khibiny ski resort prices" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/678299.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Khibiny, ski resort: prices </h2><p>  Tourists define Kirovsk and Apatity as places of inexpensive rest.  This is evidenced by at least ski pass prices.  They are different depending on the ski area and the length of the lift.  For example, on the southern slope of Mount Aikuayvenchorr, a 60-season pass will cost 3,550 rubles.  On the northern routes of the same peak, a completely different ski pass system is practiced.  They introduced temporary subscriptions - for four hours (650 rubles) and for the whole day (850 rubles).  Kreselnik costs 110 rubles.  At the 25th kilometer, the cost of one lift will be 60 rubles, and you will have to pay 25 rubles for the baby lift.  Equipment rental will empty your pocket by an average of one thousand rubles a day.  Khibiny is a ski resort that is only developing.  Perhaps in the near future its services, including Apres-ski, will be closer to European standards. </p>
