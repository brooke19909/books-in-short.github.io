    <h2>  General characteristics </h2><p>  This is a free-standing narrow dishwasher for 9 sets.  The model belongs to the category of fully built-in, therefore, the facade and the walls of the headset will hide it entirely during installation.  In terms of capacity, the dishwasher is suitable for a family of 3-4 people.  The device comes with electronic control: the on and off buttons, as well as program adjustments, are located at the top of the door.  There is no display, but there are LED indicators by which you can track the stages of the program and the selected mode. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Washing, drying and energy class </h2><p>  Dishwasher manufacturers around the world are trying to make their products as efficient and economical as possible.  The <span>Bosch</span> SPV 40E10RU <span>dishwasher</span> was no exception.  Reviews indicate that for all three indicators, it shows maximum results.  The washing class, which is determined by the number of food residues left after washing specially contaminated dishes, is A (the highest existing).  The drying class is also A. This means that the dishes remain completely dry after the end of the cycle, there are no drops of water or condensation.  <span>Energy class</span> A, the most economical of the existing ones.  About 0.8 kW is spent on one sink of medium-soiled dishes. </p><h2>  Water consumption for washing </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dishwasher rating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/832069.jpg"></div>  Nowadays, when everyone has their own water meters, the indicators of water consumption are of great importance, which can attract buyers a Bosch SPV 40E10RU dishwasher.  Reviews indicate that it consumes only 11 liters per wash cycle, which also includes rinsing.  Given that it includes 9 sets of dishes, and one set consists of 11 items, including cutlery and mugs, it turns out that this technique in one bucket of water can wash almost 100 items.  Such low flow rates are obtained because the water in the machine is constantly circulating, passing through a filter system and repeatedly dousing dishes.  Fresh comes only at the rinsing stage.

Since the model is also fully integrated into the cabinet, which will damp out sounds, during operation it will be practically inaudible. </p><h2>  Programs </h2><p>  Bosch SPV 40E10RU dishwasher cannot boast of many programs.  The reviews, however, indicate that these modes are quite enough for effective work. </p><ol><li>  Rinse.  Designed to remove large food debris.  It is used to prevent the appearance of a smell when the dishes will not be washed immediately, but after some period of time, or used as a soak to increase the washing efficiency. </li><li>  Wash program at 45 degrees.  This mode is designed to remove food debris from dishes immediately after eating. </li><li>  Wash program at 50 degrees.  This is an economical mode for removing slightly dried out food debris.  Electricity is saved due to the low temperature of the water, and the quality of the washing does not decrease due to an increase in the cycle time. </li><li>  Delicate wash at 40 degrees.  The program is intended for washing crystal, glass and other fragile materials. </li><li>  Normal washing at 65 degrees.  Designed for cutlery and other slightly empty dishes.  The program is suitable for daily use. </li><li>  Intense at 70 degrees.  It is intended for removal of strongly dried up and burnt food remains from pots and pans. </li></ol><h2>  Engine </h2>

EcoSilence Drive is an engine that does not have carbon brushes that create basic noise.  Instead, the rotor itself is equipped with powerful magnets.  Due to the design features, the engine does not heat up and does not wear out, accordingly, its service life is increased.  The reliability of EcoSilence Drive is so great that the manufacturer sets a ten-year warranty on it.

The interval here is strictly fixed and is 3, 6 or 9 hours.  For user convenience, each delay is equipped with an LED that lights up when the right time is selected.

    <h2>  Aquastop system </h2><p>  This 100% leakage protection system is provided by the Bosch dishwasher.  The instruction indicates that it consists of a float, which, when water enters the pan at the bottom, floats up and shuts off its supply, and a double hose, when the inner layer breaks, the water flows through the cavity, reaches the <span>safety valve</span> and also closes.  Thus, both the case of the device and the hose are protected from leaks.  However, this technology is not unique.  Every third Whirlpool, Ariston or Electrolux dishwasher boasts the same system. </p><h2>  Design features </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bosch smv dishwasher" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/823796.jpg"></div>  This model is equipped with two drawers, the upper of which can be removed and rearranged to optimize the workspace.  A plastic cup holder is attached to the upper box.  However, all household appliances of this type are equipped with such coasters, as well as cutlery baskets.  Almost every Whirlpool, Beco or Indesit dishwasher is equipped with 2-3 of these supports at once.

    <p>  But DuoPower technology is not found everywhere.  In fact, this is a double rocker that distributes water jets in different directions to improve the quality of washing.  Largely thanks to this system, dishes on the upper basket are washed without residues in accordance with class A. </p><p>  In this model, a ServoSchloss lock with a special closer is installed.  Thanks to him, the car itself closes a loose-fitting door if its angle of inclination is 10 degrees or less.  Many are attracted by Vario boxes, which allow you to model the space of the dishwasher according to your needs.  The metal rails in the lower basket can be folded.  In ordinary dishwashers, they are motionless, so large dishes (pans with a diameter of 28 cm, five-liter pots) lie at an angle and occupy most of the space in height.  Thanks to the folding guides, the dishes go flat, so it takes up little space and rinses better. </p><h2>  Dosagessss </h2><p>  This is another useful option that this dishwasher boasts.  The manual states that, in addition to the standard detergent container, the device is equipped with a special tablet compartment.  During washing, the pressed product is lowered into the cuvette from a special dispenser, which is protected from food residues.  Thus, the tablet dissolves evenly, at the right washing stage.  The situation is excluded when it flies out of the compartment, clogs into the corner of the camera and is not consumed to the end. </p><h2>  Device dishwasher </h2><p>  It is known that the device of any dishwasher includes the following components: </p><ol><li>  Water inlet and discharge hoses. </li><li>  Inlet valve. </li><li>  Electronic control board. </li><li>  Charge pump. </li><li>  Drain pump. </li><li>  Heating element. </li><li>  Rocker arms for spraying water. </li><li>  Ion exchanger. </li><li>  Sensors (water level, water flow, pollution). </li></ol>

In essence, it is a container that is filled with special softening salt.  In the process, it replaces calcium and magnesium ions with sodium ions and vice versa.  As a result, washing the dishes takes place in soft water, and rinsing in hard water, which is considered the most effective.

    <p>  The Bosch dishwasher circuit has been adjusted to the smallest detail.  Various innovations, which the consumer is not even aware of, provide maximum work efficiency, save water and electricity, protect from flooding and power surges. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The Bosch brand has never been cheap.  Any equipment manufactured by this company costs a lot, including this Bosch dishwasher.  The price consists of many factors, such as the cost of spare parts, duties, transportation costs.  The Bosch company pays a lot of attention to <span>quality</span> control <span>of goods,</span> respectively, this also requires money.  As practice shows, the amount of defective equipment of this brand is extremely low, you can even say that the name of the company has become synonymous with the quality of the goods.  This model is worth about 20 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Repairs </h2>

In small towns, the main problem is the lack of authorized service centers and the difficulty of acquiring any spare parts for dishwashers.  In addition, since the model itself is not cheap, replacement parts will also cost a pretty penny.  Bosch SPV 40E10RU (the price of which is about 20-25 thousand rubles) is assembled directly in Germany, like most of the household appliances of this company, respectively, parts for dishwashers of this type cannot be found in Russia.  Very often, service centers have to order them from abroad, which cannot but affect the duration of the repair and its cost.  However, the Bosch SPV 40E10RU dishwasher is supplied with a one-year warranty from the manufacturer.  Owner reviews also indicate that complaints about this model are extremely rare.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Most owners are satisfied with their purchase, even many months after the start of operation.  They argue that the machine is well washed, takes up little space, it is easy to connect and operate.  Large families of 5-6 people note that there is little space in the dishwasher for a large number of dishes.  Therefore, a Bosch SMV dishwasher 60 cm wide is more suitable for them. In this model there is an <span>audible signal</span> indicating the end of the wash, the popular program ‚Äúbeam on the floor‚Äù is missing.  Therefore, if the owner did not hear the signal, he can only find out the completion of the cycle by opening the dishwasher and looking at the indicators.  Some also note the inconvenience of using a door closer - you cannot leave the car on airing, leaving a small gap, since the door will still close automatically.  However, the listed shortcomings, perhaps, are not even shortcomings, but the features of this model are the only things to complain about.  For all other items, this is an excellent unit, worth the money. </p>
