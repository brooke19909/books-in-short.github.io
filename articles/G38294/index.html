This is the oldest and most experienced builder of this city.  The company has long specialized in the construction of multi-storey monolithic houses and various infrastructure facilities. </p><p>  The company is considered one of the largest vertically integrated construction companies in the Moscow Region.  It accounts for a significant part of the new buildings of the entire Leninsky district. </p><p>  The company has a full production cycle, therefore, it is able to control the entire chain, starting from the production of building materials, design, direct construction, ending with the sale of finished apartments.  In total, it employs about two thousand people who have long taken her into the leaders in the real estate market of the Moscow region. </p><p>  Over the years, this developer has commissioned approximately half a million square meters of housing.

The progress of construction of the residential complex "Birch Grove" in Vidnoe can be impressive for many. </p><p>  Currently, the monolithic reinforced concrete frame is being installed in the third building, but the work on connecting the external networks has already been completed.  In the fourth building, the installation of internal engineering networks was completed, commissioning of elevators, decoration of common areas, and improvement of the courtyard area are carried out. </p><p>  Residents assure that the company responsibly and thoughtfully approached the process.  They did not set themselves the task of simply building several houses in a clean field, as some builders do.  We did not use the Stakhanov pace of work, having begun to systematically build the entire infrastructure of this microdistrict.  As a result, by the end of 2015, a fairly clear and precise picture began to emerge of how everything will look here after the completion of work. </p><p>  By that time, two of the six buildings of the residential complex were already completed and put into operation.

The sixth phase should be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.artdev.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apartments in residential complex Birch Grove" class="if uuid-2941778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2941778.jpg"></div><p>  Layouts of apartments in the residential complex "Birch Grove" in Vidnoe are very diverse.  There are one-room apartments, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is from 45 to 47.5 square meters.  They have a combined bathroom, the cost of one square meter is from 72 to 104 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwo-room apartments is from 64 to 77 square meters.  They have a separate bathroom, the kitchen area varies from eleven and a half to fifteen square meters.  One square meter costs from 72 to 96 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Four-room apartments with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost one hundred and three square meters are also currently available.  The kitchen area will be twelve "squares".  The cost of one square meter is seventy thousand rubles.  Thus, you can purchase this apartment for seven million 189 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The apartments that are offered here are very spacious.  Separately, it is worth noting the ceilings, whose height is about three meters.  Such an advantage is rarely found.  Since the work is being carried out in stages by those who wish to purchase an apartment in this residential complex, an alternative appears, which consists in paying more and stopping right now or saving by investing in an apartment that is not yet completed. </p><p>  The sales department will help you choose an apartment.  Specialists are ready to tell in detail about each of the buildings under construction, list all the materials used, provide photo reports on the stages of work, and documents of title. </p><p>  It is worth noting that most of the apartments are sold without decoration, the internal partitions are only indicated by a brick, which is laid in one row on the floor.  But in all window openings there are high-quality two-chamber double-glazed windows.  Directly under the windows are steam heating radiators, which are connected to the floor. </p><p>  Electricity is supplied in each apartment to an individual shield, in addition, each is equipped with a special niche along the facade of the building.  In some cases, this is a shelf with a decorative shield.  This is done so that the owners have the opportunity to install any attachments, most often, it is used for an individual split system. </p><p>  In all houses, the two lower floors are non-residential, they are intended for commercial use.  The premises located in them are put up for public sale. </p><p>  If necessary, you can go on a tour of the apartments that have not yet been sold to see what the layout looks like on the spot.  At the same time, the apartment manager himself does not go with you: a pass is issued to the potential buyer, through which the concierge accompanies him to the desired apartment.  By the way, they are rented with already high-quality entrance doors with a safe lock. </p><p>  In already rented houses, apartments can be purchased under sales contracts, in those that are just getting ready for rent, under equity contracts.  In both cases, it is possible to use a mortgage loan from several large and well-known banks; you can also connect maternity capital or one of the subsidies to payment. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroykin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is LCD Birch Grove" class="if uuid-2941777" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2941777.jpg"></div><p>  According to experts, this residential complex has many obvious advantages.  These include the presence of apartments with or without decoration, located in the immediate vicinity of the forested area, the presence of a bus that runs from the micro district to the railway station, high ceilings in apartments, the ability to purchase housing on a mortgage or by installments. </p><p>  Also an indisputable plus is a well-developed infrastructure, a large number of kindergartens and schools within walking distance.  A shopping center is under construction on the territory of the residential complex itself. </p><p>  Of the main disadvantages, it is worth noting the lack of a metro in the city and the location of the microdistrict directly next to the industrial zone in which the concrete plant operates. </p><h2>  The impression of the tenants </h2><p>  You can find a lot of positive reviews about the residential complex ‚ÄúBirch Grove‚Äù in Vidnoye from interest holders who have already purchased apartments, made repairs and moved to this residential complex. </p><p>  In general, there is a persistent feeling that this LCD has no serious problems.  They speak well of the developer, emphasizing that this is a local company that does its job efficiently, uses decent materials, but at the same time, in fact, it is a monopolist in the maintenance of its housing stock. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>  Of the negative aspects, residents say that the apartments are quite expensive, especially considering that they are located not in the capital itself, but in the Moscow region. </p><p>  Some argue that for about the same money you can buy an apartment in Moscow itself within walking distance from the subway. </p>
