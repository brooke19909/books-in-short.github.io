Moreover, his cost is very modest. </p><h2>  Smartphone Computing Heart </h2><p>  Be that as it may, the main component of any computing system is the central processor.  The more productive it is, the better.  Huawei G700 is built on the basis of the 4-core processor of the Chinese company MediaTech MTK6589 model.  Its <span>clock frequency</span> is 1.2 GHz.  Each core is based on the Cortex architecture of revision A7.  Simply put, the performance of each of them individually is low, but if you combine them together, you get a pretty good solution that allows you to easily cope with most tasks today.  At the same time, the energy efficiency of such a chip is impeccable.  Depending on the complexity of the task, the clock frequency of each of the cores can vary in the range from 300 MHz to 1.2 GHz.  And that's not all.  The core can shut down to save battery power if it is not currently being used to process information. </p>

    <h2>  Graphics </h2><p>  No less optimistic about the Huawei G700 <strong> </strong>  and with a graphics adapter.  This device integrates the SGX544 chip developed by PowerVR.  Again, one should not expect phenomenal performance from him.  But still, his computing resources are enough for most everyday tasks, from surfing websites to browsing books and mediocre toys.  The screen size of this smartphone is 5 inches.  Its resolution is 1280 pixels in height and 720 in width.  Their density is 294 PPI, that is, the image displayed on the screen is presented to the user in HD quality.  The hardware provides processing up to five touches on the surface of the sensor, which is made by capacitive technology.  The display is based on a high-quality IPS-matrix, which is capable of displaying about 16 million colors.  That is, the image is high-quality, pleasing to the eye, the color rendering on the display of the Huawei G700 smartphone is ideal.  All in all, an excellent combination of price and quality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  But what about memory? </h2><p>  The strength is the memory of the Huawei G700.  Most of the analogs of this device are equipped with RAM (capacity of 1 GB) of the fastest standard that is currently on the market (DDR3), as well as built-in, capacity of 4 GB.  As for the gadget we are considering, we are talking about 2 GB of RAM with the same level of performance and 8 GB of integrated memory.  That is, both in the first and in the second case, the volume is doubled.  This is the best effect on the final performance of the device.  There is also a slot for installing a memory card.  In this case, modifications to the MicroSD format up to 32 GB are supported.  This is enough to place on the gadget a whole bunch of different applications, films and music. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance and body </h2><p>  The classic all-in-one with on-screen input support is about the Huawei G700.  The photos presented to your attention are another confirmation of this.  The device is presented in two color options: white and black.  The dimensions of the device are 142 millimeters in height and 722 in width.  At the same time, the thickness of the gadget is only 9 millimeters.  As for the device of the middle class, these are excellent indicators.  Its weight is 155 grams.  Front (bottom) are three classic buttons: menu, main page, previous screen.  Here you can also find a thin hole in the microphone.  The bottom panel shows the microUSB standard port.  With it, the battery is charged or you can connect to a personal computer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Above the screen is the earpiece, which is covered by a metal mesh.  On the left, like most models of this class, the volume swing is located.  On the opposite side of the case there is a power button.  But the top hid a 3.5 mm jack for an external speaker system.  On the back side, below, there is a speakerphone covered by a decorative metal grill.  Case material - plastic.  The display is made of the same material and does not have a protective coating.  It is surrounded around the perimeter by a chrome insert.  In general, without a protective film just can not do.  A similar situation with the case - you need a cover. </p><h2>  About the camera </h2><p>  The main camera of the Huawei G700 is located on the back side.  It is based on a matrix of 8 megapixels.  Also there is a technology for automatic image stabilization.  For photography and video recording in the dark, an LED flash is displayed next to it.  The maximum resolution of digital photographs is 3264 by 2448 pixels.  For video, this value is 1920 by 1080 pixels, that is, in HD-quality format.  But the front camera can not boast of such characteristics.  It already uses a 1.3 megapixel sensor.  The image quality is mediocre, but this is quite enough for making video calls (and this is exactly what it is intended for). </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Another strong point is the battery for Huawei G700.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  Satisfied owners of this smartphone model is another confirmation of this.  In this case, we are talking about a <span>lithium battery</span> with a capacity of 2150 milliamps / hour.  Users say that with a minimum load, its volume is enough for a week of work.  But with more intensive use - for a day, maximum - for 2. Given the diagonal of the display of 5 inches and a fairly productive hardware platform, this is an excellent indicator that not every device of this class can boast of. </p><h2>  System software </h2><p>  Not quite an ordinary operating system installed on the Huawei G700.  Firmware, <strong> </strong>  Installed on this device now, it speaks of the version of Android under the number 4.2 with the code name "Jilly Bean".  It seems to be out of date.  But still, it is quite enough to run all applications.  But the feature of this gadget is the special configuration of Emotion from the same company Huawei.  When you first meet her, it‚Äôs not very convenient to work.  But if you get used to it, you will get a significant increase in performance. </p>

    <h2>  Settings </h2><p>  In addition to the previously specified Emotion shell, quite a lot of other software is installed.  First of all, social services.  There are Twitter and Facebook.  But the domestic VKontakte and Odnoklassniki will have to be additionally installed from the Play Market.  Widgets are also installed.  But games for the Huawei G700 in the basic configuration are not provided.  So they will again have to be installed from the same "Market Play".  To listen to music in MP3 and radio format, the necessary software is present initially.  There are also classic utilities: calendar, alarm clock, gallery (for viewing pictures and photos) and a calculator.  True, the last of them is suitable for simple calculations.  But complex mathematical calculations using it are difficult to do.  Therefore, it is better to download a special mathematical calculator for these purposes. </p><h2>  Additional software </h2><p>  Virtually all tasks without exception can be solved by the Huawei G700.  Its characteristics, which we examined a little higher, allow us to draw such a conclusion.  As for Internet access, it‚Äôs better to use a third-party browser, for example, ‚ÄúOpera‚Äù.  It, besides viewing pages, allows you to easily upload files of any size.  To view books in the ‚Äú* .pdf‚Äù format, you need to additionally install Adobe Reader or any other similar application.  For text and table files, it is recommended to use Kingsoft Office.  Its main advantage is that it is free.  To watch movies you need to install a specialized program, for example, MX Player.  Again, this player is free.  Most of the toys will go without problems on this device.  So you can install everything that your heart desires, with rare exceptions. </p>

    <h2>  Data exchange </h2><p>  As for communications, here everything is fine with the Huawei G700.  His characteristics in this regard are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Dual band data transmission module.  It allows the device to function successfully in networks of both the second generation and the third.  But the lack of support for LTE (that is, 4th generation networks) is not critical: the phone is in the middle price range.  Integration of such an advanced module would significantly increase the cost of the device. </li><li>  Wi-Fi standard transmitter.  It provides the maximum speed of data transfer to the Internet.  But the range of such wireless networks is small. </li><li>  To connect to other similar devices installed Bluetooth revision 4.0.  It is backward compatible with pre-existing standards, so there should be no problems with the transfer of data through this standard. </li><li>  To connect to a personal computer, the USB revision 2.0 interface is used.  The same socket is also used to recharge the battery. </li><li>  Separately output connector 3.5 mm.  A convenient and practical solution in case you want to listen to music <span>while charging the battery</span> . </li><li>  Another feature of the device is the presence of a GPS transmitter.  With it, you can easily and simply get directions on unfamiliar terrain. </li><li>  For a more accurate positioning, an A-GPS transmitter is used.  It determines the distance to the nearest mobile communication towers and, based on these data, corrects GPS data. </li></ul><p>  The only drawback of this model is the lack of an infrared port.  But this remark is irrelevant.  Most modern devices of this class already come without this option.  And the radius of action of 10 centimeters is not relevant.  It has been successfully replaced by Bluetooth.  So its absence cannot be considered a disadvantage.  Otherwise, the set of communications is similar to other models of this class. </p><h2>  User Feedback </h2><p>  An excellent ratio of hardware and software resources is about the smartphone of the Huawei G700 model.  The reviews of the satisfied owners of this gadget only confirm this.  What did users especially like?  Firstly, an ideal processor that can cope with most tasks today.  Secondly, sufficient memory.  Problems when installing applications should not arise.  A powerful graphics subsystem will fully reveal the potential of this device.  At the same time, his autonomy is at an acceptable level. </p>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  The perfect combination of performance and autonomy - this is how the Huawei G700 can be briefly described.  Price <strong> </strong>  at the same time it currently amounts to about $ 250.  All in all, a great mid-range smartphone.  His resources will suffice for the next 2-3 years.  Therefore, if you are thinking about buying such a device, you can safely pay attention to this particular model.  It is ideal for all occasions. </p>
