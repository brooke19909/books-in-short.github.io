Models with a similar design are already outdated, but have not yet completely transferred.  This is confirmed by the <span>LG G360</span> phone <span>, reviews</span> of which we will consider in this article. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Appearance, according to most, turned out to be quite attractive: there are no problems with the assembly.  The phone lies well in the hand, not overall, and therefore convenient for storage and carrying in your pocket;  The colors are bright and attractive.  We note the large buttons that are pleasant to work with: there is no risk of pressing several keys at once.  The keyboard is very concise and does not require additions. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The reviewers of the <span>LG G360</span> model <span>,</span> owner <span>reviews</span> and advertising indicate a decent screen device.  The display was to the taste of most: large print, vibrant colors and excellent display of information in the sun.  Tilting the phone at different angles, it becomes noticeable that the labels and pictures on the screen are distorted (it's still a simple TFT), but not much.  Owners are somewhat upset by the lack of an external display on the gadget cover, which would be convenient to check missed calls, see incoming calls and just watch the time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Users believe that the bright and reasonably large display (3 inches) is great for older people.  Many took the model for their mothers or grandmothers, and argue that the older generation is quite a device: the text on the screen is clear, large, the colors are saturated, the screen almost does not fade in the sun.  In addition, a large keyboard facilitates convenient dialing of a phone number or text message.  I would especially like to highlight the last advantage, since many aged people often suffer from farsightedness, and a large keyboard and font make it possible not to strain your eyes.  <span>Phone LG G360</span> Red, the reviews about the coloring of which are only positive, will especially please the ladies. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The camera here is only 1.3 megapixels.  It was installed, rather, just to be, since there is no need to talk about acceptable quality of photos.  Shooting settings are scarce, no flash.  Optics come in handy, perhaps, for capturing some interesting frame and further viewing it on the phone screen.  To deploy pictures on a computer monitor and even more so print them out there is no sense: the text is blurry, the pictures are distorted, the color rendering is very weak.  By the way, the camera also knows how to shoot videos, but it's better to keep silent about their quality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, the camera in the LG G360 phone - the confirmation of this is confirmed unanimously by the device owners as one of the main disadvantages of the gadget.  Indeed, optics could not be installed at all, thereby reducing the cost of the device. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The volume of the speakers and the sound quality of the owners will be satisfied.  The music is played clearly and clearly, the phone supports mp3 and has an FM receiver, so theoretically the model can be used as a player, but a decent effect should not be expected. </p>

    <p>  Speaking about the speaker, it is worth mentioning that it is combined here, that is, one for conversation and for multimedia.  However, when the clamshell is closed, it can still be heard more than clearly, so do not worry about a quiet call signal. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The developers installed a very ridiculous amount of memory - only 20 MB for storing data in the LG G360 phone.  User reviews indicate a negative attitude to such a small volume.  Part of it is already occupied by the system, so that nothing remains for the owners of the model.  The problem is solved when buying a memory card, because, fortunately, a connector is provided for it.  When the phone was purchased not only for calls and SMS, but also to satisfy any multimedia requests, buyers were forced to immediately pay for a memory card. </p>

    <h2>  Other features </h2><p>  Of the nice features, the <span>LG G360</span> cell phone <span>, reviews</span> of which is very mixed, offers the presence of two SIM cards, Bluetooth and a Wi-Fi receiver.  The battery, according to the owners, is rather weak: not everyone needs 950 mAh to carry out their tasks.  However, the battery lasts for 13 hours of telephone calls, in standby mode, the gadget will last 485 hours.  The indicators are not the most impressive for a phone with a weak filling. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Before us is an ordinary ‚Äúdialer‚Äù in the ‚Äúclamshell‚Äù style, which copes well with ordinary tasks: making calls, writing text for SMS messages, data transfer.  Model LG G360 Red - reviews confirm - more suitable for a female audience.  The strong half most often prefers a noble black or steel color. </p><p>  Thanks to the large keys and a good display, the device can be purchased for the older generation.  Some users say they abandoned more expensive gadgets, because redundant functions only cluttered the interface, and switched to this simple device.  Others purchased the G360 as a second phone. </p>

    <p>  Users note a rather high price bar: from 3,860 to 5,754 rubles.  For such an amount, you can purchase an inexpensive Chinese smartphone.  The G360 phone, in fact, is nothing special, except for the practical style, comfortable keyboard and ease of operation. </p><p>  The camera here is weak: you could completely abandon it.  There is not enough memory for storing data (many have noted this minus more than once), and of the additional functions there are only Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and the ability to use 2 SIM cards.  The owners believe that the fair price of the model is 3000 rubles.  However, the overestimated amount did not prevent them from acquiring the LG G360 mobile phone.  Reviews about the cost, although negative, but still not every lover of mobile devices, nostalgic for the era of clamshells, can refrain from buying this model. </p>
