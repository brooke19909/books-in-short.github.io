Description, varieties, price</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The coin of 10 kopecks 1980 evokes a double feeling among collectors.  Some people like these coins, others do not pay attention to them.  The thing is that, despite the large circulation, among these ten-year-olds there are special specimens.  What is unusual about them?  How to distinguish cheap coins from more worthy ones? </p><div class="photo" data-original="coins.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="10 kopecks coat of arms" class="if uuid-3137112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3137112.jpg"></div><h2>  general description </h2><p>  Coins of 10 kopecks in 1980 were issued in a rather solid circulation.  There are no exact data on the number of coins produced.  The weight of a ten-kilometer is 1600 milligrams.  Coins have no magnetic properties.  On both sides there is a cantik characteristic of those times.  The product belongs to the mint of the city of Leningrad (only without a monogram). </p><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  In the upper part of the coin of 10 kopecks in 1980, there is a figure identifying its face value.  It occupies a space that is slightly less than the diameter of the entire coin.  Two lines follow.  On one the year of manufacture is indicated, on the other the inscription "cents".  A non-closing wreath of ears bypasses both inscriptions and runs along the edging.  On a coin of 10 kopecks 1980, the stems intersect, the lower part of each is decorated with oak leaves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chervonez.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="10 kopecks 1980 obverse" class="if uuid-3137097" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3137097.jpg"></div><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  The central part is occupied by the image of the coat of arms of the Soviet Union.  The basis and center of the 10 kopeck coin of 1980 is the image of the globe, as well as the shape of the sickle and hammer, which are located above the Earth.  The planet is framed by wheat ears. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Below, where the image begins, the sun's rays come out and illuminate the earth with a sickle and a hammer.  The lower part of the heavenly body is not visible.  On a coin of 10 kopecks 1980 depicts only the upper part of the sun.  Wheat ears are divided into two bundles, each of which is decorated with an elegant lush ribbon.  Each personifies the republic of the USSR, their number corresponds to their number.  There is also a common dressing for the two tapes, which combines the composition. </p><p>  At the top of the obverse is a five-pointed star.  It is located right in the center of contact of the two ears framing the coin.  The details of the coin described above can be called one common word "coat of arms".  Under it is the inscription "USSR". </p><div class="photo" data-original="auction.violity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="10 kopecks 1980 reverse" class="if uuid-3137102" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3137102.jpg"></div><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  In 1977, the mint began to use several different stamps to print coins.  That is why 10 cents of 1980 are different.  Some coins were printed using an old-style stamp, while others were made using a new one.  Modernization, ideas, design - everything had to be subordinated to fashion, the latest trends and time.  Therefore, on old coins (products of 1977) in the region of the back ridges there were noticeable ledges.  The products of 1980 of release in this place already have no ledge, here the tips of the ears look more uniform, the lines are uniform and smooth. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As new stamps began to be used almost at the end of the year, the number of ‚Äúnew‚Äù coins with a changed image was minimal.  The cost of 10 kopecks 1980 on new stamps will be higher. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.washingtonpost.com" data-author=": Jabin Botsford, "><img itemprop="image" alt="the cost of 10 kopecks 1980" class="if uuid-3137127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3137127.jpg"></div><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The coin, which has a ledge in the upper part of the image of ears, is estimated at between two and fifty-seven rubles (in some sources there are amounts slightly more - 68 or 72 rubles). </p><p>  Coins that do not have ledges on the spikelets in their image, as they were minted a bit later using new stamps, will be valued at 100 - 250 rubles. </p><p>  There is also a third option - coins with improved coinage - their cost starts from three hundred rubles and approaches the figure of 550 rubles. </p><p>  Note that the cost of coins depends not only on the year, the number of stamped pieces and the presence of marriage.  The price will also depend on the degree of demand for a given coin for a given period of time.  The cost may also be affected by the quality of preservation of the specimen. </p><h2>  Coin marriage </h2><p>  Such a mistake occurs with many coins, 10 kopecks of 1980 cannot be called an exception.  Caught copies with a curved stamp.  This is because during manufacture the coin blank falls into the minted area.  Chasing, as you know, is carried out outside the ring with which the coin is centered.  Also, a stamp can be responsible for the deformation, which can cause the appearance of steps and protrusions. </p><p>  It would seem that marriage is a marriage, what‚Äôs good.  In fact, in numismatics, such monetary deformations are very, very appreciated, since there are stamp shifts or difficulty in coinage is quite rare.  From a small number of "spoiled" coins, the price rises on them.  Moreover, the more noticeable the marriage on the coin, the higher its cost. </p>
