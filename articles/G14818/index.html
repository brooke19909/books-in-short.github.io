The Indian state of Goa is a former <span>colony of Portugal.</span>  This is the smallest of all states, the most sparsely populated, but at the same time the most famous state in India, which is especially popular with lovers of beach holidays, couples, families with children, and youth. </p>

    <p>  North Goa is one of the three counties of Goa.  It was formed relatively recently, but, despite its youth, it already has worldwide popularity.  The fame was brought to him by the hippies who chose him in the turbulent 70s of the 20th century, and it was thanks to the hippies that the glory of this heavenly place was spread all over the world. </p><p>  North Goa is not a place for a calm, quiet and secluded vacation, although, of course, not everything is so categorical.  There are more or less calm places here, but there are few of them. </p><p>  For a quiet measured rest, South Goa is better.  And to the north come those who prefer dancing until the morning on the beach to trance music, parties, freedom of movement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are practically no expensive hotels, since they do not make much sense.  Tourists who arrive on vacation in North Goa, appear in hotels for a short time.  A hotel room for them is an opportunity to spend the night, relax, take a shower and change clothes, that is, prepare for new adventures.  Therefore, almost all hotels are small, budget and very modest. </p><h2>  The village and beach of Baga </h2><p>  In Goa there is no generally accepted division into resorts.  Here, for a better understanding of the location of hotels, a territorial division according to the names of the beaches is generally accepted.  The beach to which the <span>hotel Hotel</span> Lua Nova 2 * belongs is Baga. </p>

    <p>  Baga Beach is located between famous beaches such as Anjuna and Calangute.  This is a very popular place among young people.  Here every night chic noisy beach parties are held.  It is never quiet here.  Those who want to relax peacefully, this region can greatly shock.  And also this place is famous for the Baga river of the same name, which flows into the Arabian Sea, kids love to splash around in it. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  <span>Hotel</span> Lua Nova is one of many such establishments on the coast of North Goa.  Cute, modest and almost imperceptible, he hid in the dense greenery of a beautiful garden, about 700 meters from the beach, in a quiet place away from the road, allowing you to hide at least for a short while from the unceasing noise of the resort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel consists of one two-story building, in which there are only twenty-five small, modest, but quite comfortable rooms.  It was built and opened back in 1987.  That is, it is far from new, and in 2017 the anniversary will be celebrated, thirty years from the date of opening.  But tourists should not be at all afraid of this for two reasons: firstly, only a few years ago the hotel was completely renovated, and secondly, good hotels, like good wine, only get better over time. </p>

    <p>  Compared to new hotels, hotels that span more than a dozen years have their own advantages.  This is their personal, individual history and, perhaps, some interesting traditions that exist only in this place. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The main advantage in the location of the Hotel Lua Nova, however strange it may seem at first glance, is its distance from the beach.  After all, the fact that the hotel is located about 700 meters from the main road and from the beach gives it the unique uniqueness and comfort of a "hotel in the jungle", as it is surrounded by a chic garden. </p><p>  From the main <span>airport of Goa (Dabolim),</span> where the main charter flights arrive, bringing tourists to rest, the hotel is about 47-50 kilometers or an hour's drive. </p><p>  Panaji, the state capital, is just 12 km away.  And the nearest towns of Candolim and Manus are even less - only 7 km. </p><p>  Near Lua Nova 2 * there are shops and markets, a bank, a currency exchange and a post office, a tourist and tour desk, that is, all the necessary resort infrastructure for a comfortable stay.  Now let's discuss the service. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Service at the Lua Nova 2 * hotel (North Goa) is represented by the basic necessary services: </p><p>  1) 24-hour reception; </p><p>  2) luggage storage; </p><p>  3) laundry; </p><p>  4) library; </p><p>  5) the ability to call a doctor; </p><p>  6) free parking. </p>

    <p>  Some of the services listed are provided free of charge, and some are only available at an additional cost. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Lua Nova is surrounded by a chic, well-tended garden - the main attraction of this establishment.  Since it is very small, the infrastructure on the territory is minimal, only the most necessary for a comfortable and convenient stay. </p><p>  In a small restaurant, the local chef will offer guests a choice of Indian, Chinese and European dishes, as well as various types of barbecue, seafood and vegetarian dishes. </p><p>  The local bar has a large selection of non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks of local and foreign production.  Also, if you want, the bartender professionally mixes for you a delicious cocktail. </p>

    <p>  Another highlight of the Hotel Lua Nova (1 visit here is clearly not enough) is its outdoor pool.  It is made in an interesting and unusual form - in the form of a guitar, where the head of the neck acts as a children's pool, and the neck itself is a smooth transition from a shallow zone to a common one. </p><p>  The area around the pool is neatly tiled.  Umbrellas and sun loungers are free of charge for hotel guests.  While relaxing by the pool, guests can use free Wi-Fi access, just like in any public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The mini-hotel Hotel Lua Nova 2 * has only 25 rooms.  All rooms in the same category are Standart.  The only difference between the rooms is that some are air-conditioned and some are only equipped with <span>ceiling fans.</span>  All rooms have either a balcony or a terrace. </p><p>  All rooms are decorated in a simple style, equipped with the necessary set of high-quality and comfortable furniture and equipped with the necessary details for the maximum comfort of holidaymakers. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Hotel Lua Nova does not provide any animation or entertainment programs, as they are not necessary. </p><p>  Hotel guests spend most of their time either on the beach, or on excursions around the country or on their own trips to the sights and beaches closest to the hotel. </p><p>  For independently organized trips at the hotel, you can rent almost any means of transportation: car, scooter or bicycle.  A travel agency and tour desk are also open daily in the lobby. </p>

    <h2>  Sea / beach and reviews </h2><p>  Lua Nova (Goa) is located 700 meters from the world famous and beautiful in its pristine beauty Baga beach.  The sandy beach and the gentle entrance to the sea are ideal for families with young children and tourists who do not like great depth.  Along the coast, in walking distance, on both sides of Baga beach, there are two more amazing beaches: Calangute and Anjuna. </p><p>  Many visitors are positive about this hotel.  Almost everyone likes the service and attitude towards customers.  Many people notice that the hotel is regularly cleaned, which, of course, is very good.  Of the negative aspects, it is worth noting that some complain about the arrangement of the rooms in which they are populated. </p>
