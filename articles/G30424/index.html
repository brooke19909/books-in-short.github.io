Despite the relative youth, this financial institution was able to achieve significant success in its field of activity.  Due to what <span>competitive advantages</span> did the bank succeed?  What are the features of the mortgage programs offered by DeltaCredit?  What are the remarkable mechanisms of interaction between this bank and its customers? </p><h2>  About the bank </h2><p>  Commercial bank "DeltaCredit" (DeltaCredit) is considered one of the first credit and financial organizations in Russia specializing in the mortgage market.  While many other organizations are trying to offer as many services as possible, DeltaCredit focuses specifically on the housing lending market.  There are not so many highly specialized credit and financial organizations in Russia like DeltaCredit Bank.  You can‚Äôt get a consumer loan in it, but there is a wide range of options for arranging a mortgage. </p>

    <p>  The first information about the implementation of mortgage programs by the bank was recorded in 1998, when the corresponding market segment was just beginning to take shape.  However, the active banking activities of DeltaCredit in Russia began only in 2001.  According to some analyst reviews, DeltaCredit is a bank with good credit ratings.  This factor may be important from the point of view of interaction, for example, with the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and foreign financial organizations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mergers and Reorganizations </h2><p>  As we noted above, in 2001, DeltaCredit, a mortgage bank, began to work actively in our country.  This was due to the fact that this structure absorbed the capital's representative office of another credit and financial organization - JP Morgan.  After 4 years, DeltaCredit shares were fully acquired by the Societe Generale financial group.  According to some analysts, it was the merger of the bank with this major European market player that largely predetermined the active expansion of DeltaCredit in the Russian mortgage market.  At the disposal of the structure were a significant amount of Societe Generale resources, the experience of managers and relations with the largest financial players in Europe. </p>

    <p>  For a long time, a credit institution functioned as DeltaCredit.  The Bank, at the same time, will have to bring its name in accordance with some changes in the legislation of the Russian Federation.  The fact is that such forms of business as CJSC and OJSC are now abolished.  Now, if an organization, including banks, is issuing shares, its name can only sound like AO. </p><h2>  Bank and market </h2><p>  The mortgage market in Russia has been growing steadily over the past few years.  For example, in 2013, revenue in this segment increased by more than 31% compared with 2012 figures.  The total volume of loans issued exceeded 1.35 trillion.  rubles, the number of loans - more than 800 thousand units.  In addition, the volume of delinquencies slightly decreased - according to the results of 2013, it amounted to 2.04%. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  DeltaCredit analysts expect that by the end of 2014, Russia's mortgage market will grow by about 15%, in money terms its volume will exceed 1.5 trillion.  rub.  Particularly active growth is expected in the segment of new buildings - the corresponding dynamics, according to bank experts, will be 35%.  This segment will remain one of the key factors in the growth of the mortgage market in Russia.  And not only because of the greater in many cases the attractiveness of buying new housing in comparison with the secondary.  The fact is that Russians are considering investing in new buildings as a way to preserve savings in terms of purchasing power.  The ruble is the currency that has not recently been stable.  While the real estate market as a whole is characterized by progressive growth.  Investing in new buildings is an attractive prospect for many residents of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  At the same time, in some regions there is also a demand for a secondary housing.  The fact is that many families feel the need to move into new housing as soon as possible.  They do not have time to wait until the apartment is completed, and even more so to pay the mortgage at the same time.  In addition, many Russians buy apartments not so much to live in them, but for the purpose of subsequent rental and conversion into a <span>liquid asset.</span>  For this purpose, buying a new building is not necessary at all: you can invest in a quality apartment in a good area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, even if it is represented in the secondary housing segment. </p><h2>  Network structure </h2><p>  DeltaCredit is a mortgage bank that operates in Russia both within its own network of divisions and through partner channels.  Now this financial institution is among the leaders in terms of the volume of issued mortgages, and in many respects experts believe that the bank received this status thanks to an efficiently built system of interaction with other organizations in its segment of work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  DeltaCredit is a bank whose branches are represented in the largest cities of Russia: Moscow (7 Mokhovaya St.), St. Petersburg (Nevsky Prospect, 114-116), Kazan (Ostrovsky, 87).  In turn, partner structures are present in most regions. </p><h2>  Activities "DeltaCredit" in numbers </h2><p>  The weighted average mortgage rate at DeltaCredit depends on the region where the bank operates.  In Nizhny Novgorod, for example, in 2013 it amounted to 12.4% in rubles (a little more than in 2012) and 9.6% in foreign currency (this, in turn, is lower than in the previous year) .  Due to the fact that in 2014 the Central Bank of the Russian Federation increased its <span>key rate,</span> experts expect further growth in the relevant loan terms offered by Russian banks.  DeltaCredit is likely to be no exception to this trend. </p><p>  The average mortgage loan at DeltaCredit is also an indicator that is highly dependent on the region where the bank is located.  If we also take Nizhny Novgorod as an example, then the corresponding indicator in 2013 amounted to about 1 million 357 thousand rubles.  On average in Russia - a little more, about 1.64 million rubles.  Of course, the figures will be completely different if the focus is on the largest Russian city, where DeltaCredit Bank is present - Moscow.  But any indicators - for the capital or for Nizhny Novgorod - will give a rather conventional idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe dynamics of the market: one way or another, due to the natural rise in price of housing, the numbers will increase. </p><h2>  Loan programs </h2><p>  DeltaCredit offers citizens of the Russian Federation several noteworthy mortgage programs.  The conditions under which this financial institution proposes to issue a housing loan are generally comparable with the proposals of other market leaders.  If any of the loan programs have a high rate, then this is usually offset by lower requirements for the borrower. </p>

    <p>  Among the most noteworthy features that characterize DeltaCredit Bank is that the mortgage in it is largely foreign currency.  Credit products of the type offered by the organization are usually characterized by a low rate.  But at the same time, with a significant <span>drop in the ruble exchange rate</span> , borrowers may have difficulty repaying loans. </p><p>  According to data in a number of public sources, the total volume of foreign currency mortgage loans in Russia is very modest - about 0.3% of the total loans.  Due to the instability of the financial markets of the Russian Federation, the popularity of mortgages in foreign currency is likely to remain low in the coming years. </p>

    <p>  DeltaCredit has attractive offers adapted to the needs of young families.  There is also information about programs that provide for a very low rate for the Russian market - 9.75%.  There are seasonal offers of the bank, as well as various kinds of shares, accompanied by offers to get a loan at reduced rates. </p><p>  The types of housing that DeltaCredit borrowers can acquire are very different.  It is possible to purchase real estate in full or in shares.  You can purchase apartments, rooms, and houses on credit. </p><p>  In some regions of DeltaCredit's presence, there are <span>banking products</span> adapted for the borrower to find the necessary amount for the down payment on the mortgage loan.  It is possible to use, as in many other banks, maternal capital as a source of financing when buying an apartment. </p><h2>  Customer interaction </h2><p>  One of the requirements of the market that any modern (including DeltaCredit) bank must comply with is that customer reviews must somehow be accompanied by feedback from the financial institution itself.  In the case of the bank we are considering, we can fix a rather interesting model of the institution's compliance with this criterion.  In particular, it is a system in which both online and offline reviews can be left.  DeltaCredit is a bank that offers customers to leave their opinions in the form of estimates on paper forms at offices, as well as in the framework of interaction with consumers through online channels.  What is the specificity of the second line of work? </p>

    <p>  The interface of interaction with the virtual community (integrated, with the feedback form) is built into the widget on the start page of the bank's website.  Clients of a financial institution, using it, can leave their feedback.  DeltaCredit is a bank that seeks, above all, for openness.  The level of moderation in the communities is minimal.  That is, if the problem really exists, it is not hushed up by the bank.  From a technical point of view, the interaction between DeltaCredit and customers is implemented quite conveniently. </p><p>  What are the priorities in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork that DeltaCredit defines for itself?  <span>The Bank (reviews of</span> employees responsible for interacting with customers online confirm this) largely focuses on approaching the problems of its current or potential borrowers with an emphasis on localization.  That is, the recommendations of managers are not limited to certain general phrases: as a rule, the client facilitates communication with representatives of the bank in a particular city or region.  For example, if one or another question is asked by a resident of St. Petersburg or a neighboring city, then probably the answer will be given based on the characteristics of the locality where DeltaCredit Bank operates - St. Petersburg or any city in the Leningrad Region.  This characteristic of the system of interaction of a financial institution with customers is appealing to many experts and borrowers who leave their comments and comments on a branded online portal or thematic resources. </p><p>  DeltaCredit pays great attention to the training of its employees in competent communication with customers.  Bank specialists aim at interacting with consumers in terms of creating a public information base that can attract other borrowers.  In this sense, any - including negative - reviews can be good.  DeltaCredit is a bank that can, by solving real problems of current customers, form a positive image in the eyes of borrowers.  According to experts, public information on the bank‚Äôs feedback portal plays an important role in attracting new borrowers.  If, for example, a user is interested in a mortgage at DeltaCredit Bank, reviews <strong> </strong>  and the requests of current consumers of this financial service on a branded portal can become the main factor in making decisions in favor of obtaining a loan in this particular credit and financial structure. </p><h2>  Work "online" </h2><p>  How is <span>working with clients</span> online carried out by the bank in practice?  Some sources indicate, for example, that several dozen DeltaCredit specialists are involved in communicating with consumers of services via the Internet.  The bulk of the work is carried out by the marketing department of the bank, as well as the structures responsible for the technical status of processing client requests.  How actively the circulation of consumers of banking services through online channels is going on, as well as the quality of problem solving are factors that directly affect the performance indicators of bank employees in the relevant areas of work. </p>

    <p>  "DeltaCredit" - a bank whose customer reviews that are received via the Internet are sent to competent employees of specialized departments.  The specific destination is determined by the nature of the request.  It is possible, for example, that an ordinary marketing employee can answer a customer‚Äôs question.  If a specialist has doubts, then he redirects the request to his supervisor.  If, in turn, participation of other divisions of the bank is required, the question is sent to them.  Once a competent response has been prepared, a comment from DeltaCredit is published in the online community. </p><p>  Of course, there is a more ‚Äústandardized‚Äù resource for the market that DeltaCredit Bank offers: ‚ÄúPersonal account‚Äù of the client.  In it, the borrower can receive detailed information about the products used, make inquiries to the customer support service of the bank, make some transactions and payments.  According to many experts who have evaluated this kind of tool that DeltaCredit Bank offers, the Personal Account of the consumer of the services of this financial institution is a fairly convenient and useful tool. </p><h2>  Customer reviews: statistics </h2><p>  What are the practical results of the bank‚Äôs interaction with customers via the Internet?  You can cite the figures published in a number of sources.  From February to August 2014, for example, more than 700 unique topics initiated by customers were created in the "virtual" community of DeltaCredit Bank.  Over 1 thousand comments were recorded.  Over the same period, the community was visited by more than 43 thousand unique users.  The number of portal views exceeded 329 thousand. The community interface includes options that increase the comfort of using the resource.  In particular, at the moment when the client begins to write reviews or appeals, the formulations are automatically substituted based on information from the search system within the current knowledge base.  Thanks to this, the person who writes the request to the bank is likely to express the essence of the problem most correctly, and in many cases will even find a ready-made answer to his question.  For example, if a person is interested in where DeltaCredit Bank is located, the address in Moscow or St. Petersburg of this financial structure, then there is every chance of finding the necessary information in the existing database. </p><p>  Statistics published in a number of sources indicate that about 70% of the bank's customers solve the difficulties without contacting the support service.  That is, they find the necessary answers in the already formed database. </p><p>  Another interesting feature of the DeltaCredit virtual feedback system is that it has a wide range of opportunities for bank customers to communicate with each other (and not just with employees of a credit institution).  As noted in a number of sources, about 12% of requests left by consumers of bank services are ‚Äúclosed‚Äù due to comments from other customers. </p><h2>  Borrower Assessment Mechanisms </h2><p>  As we have already said, the segment in which DeltaCredit Bank specializes is a mortgage.  Since this format of activity involves long-term interaction with the client, the criteria for assessing its solvency should be balanced.  That is, on the one hand, the bank should not allow the issuance of loans to borrowers with dubious sources of income and potentially unprepared for strict financial discipline.  On the other hand, strict criteria should not provoke the reluctance of a potential client to work with a financial institution. </p><p>  Bank "DeltaCredit", working in this area, is actively improving its own system for evaluating borrowers.  Recently, emphasis has been placed on process automation.  The final decision on the loan is still made by the person, but he has at his disposal a multi-factor report, which sets out in sufficient detail an analysis of the solvency of the client who left the application for a mortgage.  One of such solutions, for example, implies a product resulting from the mutual integration of CRM modules and analytical systems supplied to the bank by well-known Microsoft-level brands, as well as DeltaCredit's own databases and those provided by partner organizations. </p><p>               ,    ,    ,        . ,             "-".           . </p><h2>    </h2><p>  ,   IT-      -         . ,                     .   ,  ,  CRM- (    ).     -     ,   .   ,        -    ,    ,   ,   .
