  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Decoupage technique on furniture for beginners</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern interiors often require exclusive <span>furniture decor.</span>  It‚Äôs often impossible for ordinary people to buy designer options, but there are always options.  The decoupage technique on furniture will help to make unique furniture on its own from the materials that were used in the interior.  Yes, and it will cost much less than in professional workshops. </p><p>  To begin with, it is worth deciding on the furniture.  If you use old, but high-quality furniture, then it must be thoroughly cleaned of varnish and dirt, and then degrease the surface.  New options that do not contain decor should also be lightly sanded (usually this stage is carried out by the master who made this or that item) and also degreased.  If old furniture has slightly lost its stability, it is important to carry out repair work to strengthen the structure before the preparatory stage. </p><p>  Now let's move on to the selection of materials on which the drawing is applied.  Fabric decoupage is the most commonly used fabric.  However, you can always apply other types of decor.  For example, the decoupage technique on furniture allows you to use special cards for this type of work, wallpaper, decorative stickers, volumetric options and three-layer napkins.  All this and much more can come in handy, so do not throw away small pieces that are not suitable for repair. </p><p>  When using paper drawings, the surface of hard, thick sheets can be thinned with tape.  It is glued on the back of the picture and carefully removed with pieces of paper.  Napkins need to be peeled and leave only the top layer with the image.  The next step is the cutting of the element with which we will decorate the furniture. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The decoupage technique on furniture requires careful preparation of the work surface.  After grinding and cleaning, the main color or background is decorated.  This can be a <span>water-based paint,</span> stain, primer, etc.  After the final drying of this layer, decoupage takes place. </p><p>  We lay out the prepared fragments on the surface of the furniture and determine their final location.  Further, the decoupage technique on furniture can be carried out in different ways.  If paper drawings are used, then it is glued using a special composition or diluted in half with PVA water.  You can apply glue both on the surface and on the back of the element, but more often this is done on top of the fragment attached to the furniture.  The brush should be driven carefully and from the middle to the edges.  After this, the drawing must be covered with transparent polyethylene, for example, a file, and ironed with a soft spatula so that all air bubbles come out. </p><p>  Decoupage on furniture with fabric also has some options.  If decorating is carried out with textile on textile (for example, floor lamp shade), then only textile adhesive is needed.  It does not leave stains after drying and copes with its task even applicable to furniture.  If fabric fragments are attached to a tree, textile glue can also be used, although other options listed above will work. </p><p>  The textile base is not processed in any way, but wooden, metal, plastic, etc.  surfaces require fixing.  Here, the materials are also different.  If the surface is absorbent, then a varnish on a water-based basis is suitable.  If not, then ordinary varnish.  For all options, you can use a special varnish for decoupage.  Apply any of the above fixers in several layers.  Each time, varnishing is carried out after the final drying of the previous one. </p><p>  Decoupage of children's furniture - this is an option to transform not only the child‚Äôs room, but also attract him to active decor.  Naturally, such work requires caution and they are usually carried out in well-ventilated rooms or in the fresh air.  Decoupage of children's furniture, in addition to the main decorative function, can also hide some problem areas, such as dents or scratches.  Children who help you should be old enough to comply with all the safety rules that you explain to them.  It is better to use materials that are special, which will not cause allergies and, moreover, will not be toxic. </p><p>  We wish you many ideas and successful work! </p>
