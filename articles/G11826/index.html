    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  In a beautiful old city, calm as the water of Russian rivers, solid and knowing its worth, since it keeps the memory of many centuries, a residential complex is being completed a kilometer from its historic center.  Its location will allow its residents to work within the city.  And after a hard day, they will enjoy the cleanest air in the new buildings of the Arkazhskaya Sloboda residential complex. </p><p>  There is a convenient transport interchange, with a lot of public transport, an area with excellent infrastructure.  That is why the inhabitants of Veliky Novgorod so impatiently (probably because for a long time - since 2011) are waiting for the completion of construction.  But the Volkhov, flowing far and long, still gets to his Ladoga.  So the newcomers will soon, soon receive the keys to new apartments in the residential complex "Arkazhskaya Sloboda". </p><h2>  Town </h2><p>  It was here, in Veliky Novgorod, that the first birch bark letters were found, the first books in Russia were written here, merchants from the most distant countries came here to a huge bargain, taking with them to different corners of the earth incredible stories about the greatness of cities and settlements, about rich stone temples Novgorod, about the strong people of the Russian people.  And now the monuments of the city and its environs, recognized by UNESCO decision as a historical world heritage, are treasured by local residents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But the city, nevertheless, is developing, since it is not static, although it is truly monumental.  It develops neatly, the bustle of megacities and modern glass and metal buildings are not allowed in these ancient alleys.  However, the city is growing quite rapidly, and not far from the historical center, like micro-mushrooms, new micro-districts grow for those in need.  Such is the LCD "Arkazhskaya Sloboda", a long-awaited and lively discussion.  Particularly often questions arise to the developer - now it is Concord LLC. </p>

    <h2>  New apartments </h2><p>  In this <span>residential complex</span> are a variety of apartments from thirty-two to eighty-six square meters, and three, and two, and one-room apartments.  The layouts are individual, they are ergonomic and modern, and special attention is paid to the possibility of increasing the kitchen. </p><p>  Naturally, the most burning issue is housing prices in the Arkazhskaya Sloboda residential complex.  Reviews say that they are quite affordable - from 1,700,000 rubles.  The official representative of the developer always shares the most detailed information with buyers, and also helps in obtaining a mortgage or installment plan.  Military mortgages and investments in maternity capital are also possible in the Arkazhskaya Sloboda residential complex.  Reviews contain many hopes for a speedy completion of the construction. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  About prices in detail </h2><p>  On a land plot of 405964 square meters along Yuryevskoye Shosse, Concord LLC is constructing three-story brick buildings in which apartments are sold unfinished.  Ceilings with a height of 270 centimeters, comfort class housing.  Parking is only at the house.  The developer in the city is considered the most responsible and reliable. </p><p>  The price per square meter depends on the location of the apartment.  Thirty-four meters cost from 1,867,000 rubles (from 52,000 per square meter), as well as one-room, but thirty-eight-meter ones will cost 1,977,000 (55,000 rubles per square meter).  The same picture emerges with two- and three-room apartments.  The scatter is small.  The most expensive apartments can also be considered budget - 4 069 000 rubles (49 000 per square meter). </p>

    <h2>  From the developer </h2><p>  Of course, an apartment at the excavation level will cost less than an already built one, but construction with intensive sales will go faster.  That is why the developer is interested in buyers in the very early stages of construction.  The area is wonderful, the microdistrict is compact and, importantly, it is the first low-rise in the city.  Coziness, prosperity, comfort await future residents here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The houses are being built with high quality, the layout of the territory is well thought out, the infrastructure leaves much to be desired, transport accessibility is at a high level, prices are also quite competitive.  Novgorodians do not make such a choice in vain, acquiring housing here, in the residential complex "Arkazhskaya Sloboda".  Veliky Novgorod will soon take under its wing a new microdistrict, and we can say that he has already fallen in love with him, because he is constantly worried about the pace of construction. </p>

    <h2>  Dolgostroy </h2><p>  This <span>residential complex was</span> planned to be completely commissioned in 2011, but the constant lack of funds not only slowed down, but also stopped the construction several times.  So, from 2012 to 2014, work on the site was not carried out.  In May 2014, the first phase of the buildings was undertaken by a new developer, Concord LLC.  However, he did not succeed right away, the deadlines were postponed many times, until the summer of 2015. </p><p>  Finally, Sberbank allocated additional funds, after which the first phase was completed at the end of 2016, and the full completion of construction is planned for 2017.  This is a difficult story survived "Arkazhskaya Sloboda".  Veliky Novgorod is certainly great, but today this city cannot be called rich.  That is why the dreams of its inhabitants have been fulfilled for so long. </p>

    <h2>  Start </h2><p>  The implementation of this project began in the distant 2009, after the allocation of forty hectares of land at the site of the former airport.  It was then that the Novgorodians began to wait for the delivery of the first ten three-story houses with attics - five hundred forty-four apartments were promised to the residents of the city, plus more than two thousand square meters of infrastructure were commercial premises.  The dates were constantly postponed: from 2011 to the spring of 2012, then to the end of this year, then the construction stopped altogether.  The facility has been frozen for more than two years. </p><p>  In this state, apartments in the Arkazh Sloboda could not be sold.  Veliky Novgorod was afraid to invest its last funds in this project, and Sberbank had to persuade for a very long time.  Therefore, developers even avoided conversations with journalists - there was not a single positive moment with which to reassure the population.  And when the construction was resumed, the developers did not reassure people, because there was no one hundred percent guarantee that the dates would not have to be postponed again.  Many buyers are so imbued with this honesty that they took back their money. </p>

    <h2>  Road </h2><p>  The main stumbling block, and for quite some time, was the unfinished road connecting the Yuryevskoye Highway with the Arkazhskaya Sloboda residential complex.  Veliky Novgorod, where the main road construction department is located, promised developers not only to design it, but also to build it.  However, for the private land that was to be pre-purchased, the construction of the road has long been an impossible task, since the price is too high - fifteen million rubles per hectare. </p><p>  In total, it was necessary only seven and a half million, but in order to spend them, it took a lot of time, in 2013 they were only laid down in the budget.  The existing road is too bad, and although it was difficult to drive along it, four almost finished buildings were not to be surrendered.  Now everything is in order with the road, it is equipped with everything necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãtwo layers of asphalt, curbs, outdoor lighting, rainfall.  And it grew into a new cozy residential complex of Novgorod - "Arkazhskaya Sloboda" reached the finish line of its long history of construction. </p>

    <h2>  One-room apartments </h2><p>  The most interesting is the description of the apartments in the "Arkazhskaya Sloboda".  Veliky Novgorod is not surprising with high ceilings - after all, the city is old.  But here the height reaches five and a half meters!  All apartments, even the smallest in size, have beautiful arched windows and balconies.  The heating in the apartments is autonomous (the developers have installed a double-circuit gas heating boiler Elsotherm B23Fi). </p><p>  The future owners of photos of apartments in the "Arkazhskaya Sloboda" are delightedly considering.  Veliky Novgorod, perhaps for the first time acquired a neighborhood so comfortable.  One-room attic type apartments are only thirty-two or thirty-six square meters, but the feeling of spaciousness, open space, air is constantly indescribable.  No wonder it was these apartments that turned out to be the most liquid.  Broken lines of roofs look amazing. </p>

    <h2>  Readiness </h2><p>  The first phase has already been completed, almost all work has been completed.  The heating is installed, and the first four buildings are connected and heat is supplied.  The gas control point, which supplies already completed <span>houses</span> and will supply the subsequent ones, is owned by the developer.  Individual apartment heating in combination with high-quality finishing materials not only meets the highest modern requirements of environmentally friendly housing. </p><p>  Utility payments for hot water and heating services will be literally halved due to the cost-effectiveness of this system.  The gas issue has been resolved not only in relation to the completed houses, but also all the others without exception.  The second quarter of the residential complex is being intensively rebuilt, four out of six buildings are already under the roof, the yard area is being improved and commissioning is being carried out on schedule. </p><h2>  "New town" </h2><p>  This is the name of the social movement, vitally interested in the fastest pace of completion.  Participants constantly visit the residential complex "Arkazhskaya Sloboda", reviews of the owners are considered.  As a result, social activists came to the conclusion that this microdistrict has its own minuses.  Not enough inhabitants of an accessible environment.  There is a lot of comfort - low-rise buildings first of all, the architecture is laconic, but with flying, the hull finishes in natural colors, good landscaping.  Very pleasing are children's playgrounds, which are designed for a variety of ages. </p><p>  But the problems are as follows: as in many other new buildings, courtyards are a parking lot, with rings surrounding all playgrounds.  The sidewalks are quite narrow, it is inconvenient to move on them with a pram - the two will no longer be able to leave.  The curbs are not lowered enough at the contact points of the sidewalk and the roadway, there are no ramps at the entrances.  Young parents and retirees will have to constantly experience some inconvenience, not to mention the disabled. </p><h2>  pros </h2><p>  Each house in the residential complex uses the latest technologies for providing Internet, digital television and fiber-optic communication (PON telephony), all apartments have their own access point to broadband high-speed Internet.  Doors occupy a special place in the description - the entrance to the apartment is designed almost like a fortress: a reinforced metal door with excellent sound insulation and locks of the highest burglar resistance.  Double-glazed windows on the windows are two-chamber with micro-ventilation.  The quality of the walls, ceiling and floor finishes is almost perfect, the plaster is improved (Knauf), and the piping is made of polypropylene.  The warm colors of the facades - from dark brown to the lightest beige - are decorated with forged delights that make up the <span>balcony fencing.</span> </p><p>  This is the largest of the projects - almost two hundred and sixty square meters of only living space, that is, five hundred and forty-four apartments.  All construction phases stipulated by the project are expected to be completed in 2017.  The building was solved beautifully and functionally: the neighborhoods are united by a system of streets interspersed with footpaths.  The living environment is calm and favorable, the apartment owners of the microdistrict are already writing their rave reviews.  The main thing is that not one of the historical traditions inherent in Veliky Novgorod is violated by the size and location of the quarters, the very scale of the microdistrict.  The composition is a quarterly perimeral building, which is so characteristic of every ancient city. </p><p>  Each house consists of 2-4 sections.  Sectional building forms quarter territories from 4-6 houses.  "Arkazhskaya Sloboda" - a three-story apartment building with a brick attic.  A warm, comfortable house made of bricks is maximally protected from the weather and the damaging external environment.  It will truly become your fortress.  The facade is made in warm colors from dark brown to light beige and is decorated with exquisite forged balcony fences. </p>
