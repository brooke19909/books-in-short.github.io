  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Details on how to turn on the camera on a Windows 10 laptop</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In almost every home of a modern person, one can find the property of computerization - a telephone or a computer.  These devices help us communicate with loved ones who are too far away from us, find tons of various information, play songs and much more.  Also a no less revolutionary creation is the camera.  After all, such a device helped people to visit different countries, without leaving their own home, capture pleasant moments and much more, so in the article below we will talk in detail about how to turn on the camera on a laptop with Windows 10, and why it may not turn on.  This article is recommended for novice users of the Windows operating system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcauthority.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="laptop - Windows" class="if uuid-2343864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2343864.jpg"></div><h2>  How to turn on the built-in camera on Windows 10 </h2><p>  To begin with, you should make sure that the camera is generally working, so if you are not sure about the camera‚Äôs performance, then immediately go to the second paragraph of the article.  Users of the Windows operating system complain that they often have to reinstall their operating system or do a complete reset of all data, which is not very convenient.  What is this happening for? </p><p>  Windows is the most common operating system in the world.  Therefore, it is used by both ordinary people and hackers, who every day find more and more new vulnerabilities in the system.  And then they are tested on the first type of people, from which they can fly off drivers (the connecting node between the physical device and the application software), break down hard drives, delete data and other no less unpleasant incidents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After reinstalling Windows, it is necessary to install drivers, but if there are none for each element of the laptop, the system itself searches for and finds them, but not always successfully.  After all, manufacturers are not so few. </p><p>  Instructions on how to turn on the camera on a Windows 10 laptop: </p><ol><li>  Go to the control panel, and then in the "Device Manager". </li><li>  Among the various devices, find WebCam - this is your main webcam.  Then right-click on it.  A context menu will appear, if there is a ‚ÄúEnable‚Äù button there, the device has been deliberately disconnected.  Click and wait. </li><li>  If the "Turn off" button, then go to the "Drivers" section and look for the latest versions, then update. <div class="photo" data-original="www.pcmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Windows drivers" class="if uuid-2343858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2343858.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  How to check webcam in Windows 10 </h2><p>  If you did everything, as in the instructions above, but you do not have devices for checking a webcam, then this item is for you.  First you need to decide how it will be more convenient for you to check using the Windows application or a browser program.  Both methods are very effective, but the latter may not work due to the lack of Flash Player. </p><p>  How to check the camera using a browser: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Visit any site that offers you services for creating photos. </li><li>  Allow the site to use your webcam. </li><li>  If there is an image, then the camera is fully operational.  If not, then the problem is either in the camera itself or in the operating system. </li></ol><p>  In the paragraph on how to turn on the camera on a laptop with Windows 10, it was already said that such an operating system often takes on the attacks of hackers.  In the next paragraph of the article, we will tell you how to determine that a hacker has taken possession of the camera and why it is not available for other applications. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Windows for tablet" class="if uuid-2343860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2343860.jpg"></div><h2>  Why is the camera unavailable for applications? </h2><p>  If the camera is used, then a red indicator lights up next to it - this was done for a reason.  If your camera blinks an LED for no apparent reason or is sometimes unavailable, for example, for Skype, then this is a clear sign of a virus infection of your computer. </p><p>  The specificity of Windows is that the camera can use only one application, not more.  To solve this problem, we recommend installing an antivirus.  After all, nothing will help so much as an antivirus, preferably acquired honestly. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  We hope that after reading our article on how to turn on the camera on a Windows 10 laptop, you have solved your problem.  If you invite a master to fix this problem, he will take a round sum from you only for the trip.  But now you know what needs to be done, and absolutely free. </p>
