Attractions of the capital of Andalusia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Seville on the map of Spain is located in the very south of the country.  It is the capital of the province of Andalusia.  It has a huge historical center, which occupies more than three hundred hectares.  Therefore, tourists come here all year round, and there is practically no ‚Äúlow season‚Äù in the city.  It is difficult to name a person who would not like the beautiful Seville.  Spain is a country in which there is no end to the guests.  But Andalusia is something special.  Amazing atmosphere in which languid Moorish notes and baroque Catholic piety, music and the smell of citrus, white houses and blue patterns, patios, twined with the color of pomegranate interweaved ... Mysterious and passionate Andalusia, like Carmen.  What can she offer us? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Seville Spain" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/275175.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <p>  The huge, third in Europe in its size <span>Gothic cathedral,</span> built at the beginning of the fifteenth century on the site of a mosque, and its bell tower Giralda are sights that first come to mind when the word ‚ÄúSeville‚Äù is heard.  Spain (especially southern) is known for such an interesting architectural style as Mudejar.  It is characterized by an alloy of Saracen and Christian motifs.  The cathedral and the bell tower are the brightest example of this style.  The ‚Äúdoor of forgiveness‚Äù (the gates of the temple) remained from the mosque that stood in this place.  And then the visitor enters the interior, which suddenly seems to expand from the stunning play of light and shadow due to the mirror built into the floor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Seville on a map of spain" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/275176.jpg" width="351"></div>  Many stand silently, shocked by the decoration, their eyes scatter from golden statues, carved wood, stained glass windows and columns.  The "Orange Courtyard", where most tourists go out of the cathedral, as well as the Giralda minaret, which is almost a hundred-meter high, also remained from the Muslims.  This tower, where a statue of Vera was erected as a sign of the triumph of Catholicism, has become a symbol of the city of Seville.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Spain is still a kingdom.  Andalusia has always been a favorite place where the <span>royal family</span> spent time <span>.</span>  Not far from the cathedral you can visit the amazing Real Alcazar Palace, the construction of which was begun by the Saracen rulers in the tenth century.  After all, it was Seville that was the capital of their kingdom.  Spain captured these territories in the thirteenth century.  The Arab buildings themselves were not preserved, and the royal residence at first began to be erected in the <span>Gothic style.</span>  However, the beautiful openwork art of Moorish architecture had such an effect on the imagination of the Spanish conquerors that Arab masters were invited from Granada (then Muslim), who created this miracle, similar to the palaces of the Alhambra.  And, as is usual in the east, around the royal ‚Äúpalacio‚Äù a huge, wonderful garden with green ponds, fountains and waterfalls, greening in winter and summer, was pitched. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain Seville Vacation" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/275442.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another amazing place that all those who come to Seville aspire to is Toro del Oro, the Golden Tower (former Moorish customs, now the Maritime Museum), located on the banks of the Guadalquivir.  Southern Spain is also often associated with this river.  Seville, a vacation in which has become a dream of many Russians, is washed by the waters of the Guadalquivir, and cruise ships are now cruising on it.  They depart just from the Golden Tower.  Also, tourists and city dwellers love to walk through the beautiful Seville parks, in particular the infants Maria Louise.  Statues, fountains decorated with tiles, arbor roses twined with roses - all this has a romantic promenade.  And the nearby <span>Plaza de Espa√±a</span> with colonnades, pavilions and benches, which coincide in number with the provinces of the state, is just a miniature country. </p><p>  There are many more places worth visiting in Seville for a curious tourist.  This amazing city is hard to describe in a nutshell.  But, believe me, when you visit there, your heart will contract at the words of a classic: ‚ÄúNight marshmallow streams ether.  The Guadalquivir is making noise. ‚Äù </p>
