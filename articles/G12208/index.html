  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pioneer controller: description, specifications, models and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Now the controllers are especially popular in the domestic market, because the sphere of DJing has become more popular.  Manufacturers represent a huge assortment of equipment in which any lay person can get lost.  You need to pay attention to the Pioneer company.  Her products are not only included in an affordable price category, but are also famous for their good quality. </p><p>  Any Pioneer controller differs from another in a host of factors: materials, functionality, design.  The article discusses the most popular models, describes the characteristics and prices. </p><p>  The controller, as a rule, always requires a laptop.  Without him, a professional and successful career cannot be made.  Due to the fact that the minimum price for laptop computers has been indecently low for a long time, even the cheapest option is quite suitable. </p><h2>  DDJ-SB </h2><p>  The Pioneer DDJ-SB is the best-known and best-selling device.  In the West, it has long been in demand.  This is due to the low price, but impressive potential.  The device can help any person realize themselves.  Cost and quality blend perfectly.  Note that even with a large set of functions of keys and levers, the minimum number is set.  This design will appeal to lovers of the classics. </p><p>  The Pioneer controller is supplied with a music book, instructions (there is no Russian language in it), a disk on which the installation file of the Serato program ‚Äúlies‚Äù.  Unfortunately, it has truncated functionality (demo).  Therefore, you will either have to buy a licensed version, or install a completely different program on the controller. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The average cost is $ 180. </p><h2>  DDJ-SZ </h2><p>  The next controller is one of the market leaders.  He is the only one from the entire range of the manufacturer has a jog display.  This allows you to interact with the device, despite the laptop screen. </p><p>  This controller "Pioneer" allows the DJ to work in different modes.  The pads, which are sensitive buttons, allow you to add additional sounds and effects.  Due to the available backlight, you can easily determine in which mode the device is turned on. </p><p>  The DDJ-SZ has a mixer that has four channels.  There are also microphone (two of them).  A sampler can activate several functions that are experimental in this model.  The track changes due to the work with the handles on the panel.  The Pioneer DDJ-SZ controller is a professional device. </p><p>  The average cost is $ 1,500. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer controller" class="if" height="172" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1512657.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  DDJ-SP1 </h2><p>  The next SP1 controller is designed to work only with Serato.  You can install other software, but it will function with errors and crashes.  The device is small, easy to carry.  There are other benefits as well.  This Pioneer controller (the price is written below) allows you to unrecognizably change the music track, revive it and diversify it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This appliance is a ‚Äúbaby‚Äù that came about through the collaboration of Pioneer and Serato.  He is guaranteed to facilitate the work of any DJ, and give guests an unforgettable experience. </p><p>  The appearance of the controller is elegant.  The dominant material is metal.  The case is durable, aluminum is used, which allows you to achieve low weight, but also good resistance to damage.  Weight - 1.4 kg. </p><p>  The average price is $ 350. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="controller pioneer ddj" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1512658.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  DDJ-S1 / P1 Comparison </h2><p>  The S1 / T1 device is no different from any other Pioneer model.  The dimensions also combine these devices - both devices are impressive.  If you look at it from the side of ergonomics, it is impossible to get the most functional device that would be distinguished by its compactness. </p><p>  The Pioneer DDJ-S1 controller has a pair of rulers on the mixer.  There are four of them in the related device with index T1.  This difference indicates that both devices work with different software. </p><p>  The playback quality of the models is at a high level, which is what was expected from the "Pioneer".  Devices are equipped with a built-in sound card.  If you believe the reviews, then the playback quality is a level better than that of competitors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The average cost of models: S1 - $ 300, T1 - $ 400. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer controller Price" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1512659.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  DDJ-RB </h2><p>  The controller works with software that is well known to every professional - Serato Dj.  However, the control panel interface is more like Recordbox. </p><p>  Reviews about the model make it clear that such a discrepancy in appearance does not distract from the strengths of the device.  The sound is top notch.  The design is a pleasant, intuitive control that does not require a long period of time to get used to it. </p><p>  The controller is designed in such a way that it can use both its sound card and the computer connected to it at the same time.  This increases the comfort of work. </p><p>  The average model price is $ 300. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="controller pioneer ddj ergo" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1512660.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  DDJ-RR </h2><p>  A review of the <span>Pioneer</span> DDJ-RR <span>controller</span> needs to start with the fact that the device has powerful characteristics and a pleasant appearance.  The price is fully consistent with all available indicators.  The controller can be confidently called professional, as its functionality is not suitable for amateurs or beginners. </p><p>  The device weighs a little, it is small, easy to carry from place to place.  It is convenient to perform with him on stage and hold discos.  User reviews are such that with confidence we can talk about maximum comfort when working with the device. </p><p>  The controller is capable of functioning both from the network and from the laptop's power (you can connect via USB). </p><p>  The average price is $ 700. </p><h2>  DDJ-RX </h2><p>  The controller of the RX model is a mixer that received a 7-inch screen and independent decks.  This device is positioned as a full-fledged and self-sufficient device.  He will save DJs from unnecessary gestures.  You do not have to transfer the laptop.  You just need to connect any device or flash drive with the Rekordbox application to the controller, and the music library will be available. </p><p>  The device has a pair of USB inputs.  In addition, there is another strong point of the controller - instead of the usual effects for the tracks, the manufacturer integrated two hardware sets into the mixer.  It's about Beat FX and Color FX.  This makes it possible to improve any composition.  Thanks to the installed programs, mixing tracks is easy enough.  Their menu is clear even to novice DJs. </p><p>  The average cost of the device is $ 850. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="controller for radio pioneer" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1512661.jpg" width="600"></div>

Moreover, it is not necessary to download all the tracks to the controller‚Äôs internal memory, you can perform manipulations by playing songs directly on iTunes. </p><p>  Special programs are loaded on the device, which will help beginners understand how synchronously the song plays and whether all connected effects work.  The device is sold in three colors: white, red and black.  You can choose the shade of the backlight of the jog yourself.  It is easy to transport WeGo2, and the handle for which the model is carried also serves as a stand for gadgets. </p><p>  The average price is $ 600. </p><h2>  DDJ-WeGo3 </h2><p>  The above device is practically no different from the first generation.

Often DJs in their reviews say that you need to press gently and smoothly. </p><p>  The case is made of metal and plastic.  Like the model described above, this one is also sold in three colors.  The dimensions of the controller are 3.8 √ó 0.5 √ó 2.4 cm. The weight is small - 1.8 kg.  Stands and carrying handles are not here.

    <h2>  DDJ-WeGo4 </h2><p>  This model is specially designed for beginner DJs.  Tracks can be used both from external drives or the iTunes library, and from internal memory.  The device was manufactured on the basis of the previous WeGo-3 model.  The difference in them lies only in an intuitive interface so that beginners do not experience difficulties when ‚Äúcommunicating‚Äù with the device. </p><p>  The reviews of both professionals and beginners are positive.  The device is small, easy to transport.  The sound, of course, is at a high level.  The manufacturer "Pioneer" does not happen otherwise.  The control panel is concise, convenient and understandable.  All keys are signed, pressed easily. </p><p>  The average price is $ 400. </p><h2>  Pioneer Controller DDJ-ERGO-V </h2><p>  The device has excellent sound.  It easily connects to external devices, which simplifies working with it.  Software is also included with the device.  It is immediately ready to work, so there will be no problems with installing the necessary packages.  The indicator lights that are on the keys and other details make it possible to understand in which mode the controller is operating. </p><p>  The device weighs a lot - almost three kilograms.  It works in conjunction with any operating system from the Windows family.  This is good news, since the list of connected devices is automatically expanding. </p><p>  The average cost is $ 350. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer ddj ergo v controller reviews" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1512663.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  DDJ-ERGO-V Reviews </h2><p>  Overall, the Pioneer DDJ-ERGO-V reviews are good.  You can make a small description, starting from the stories of DJs. </p><p>  So, the regulators are tight, dimensional jogs, pitch uncertain.  There are many functions that cannot but rejoice.  The keys creak a little when pressed.  If at home it is annoying, then at a disco or on stage does not hurt the ear.  The sound output is excellent.  Many people compare Ergo-V with WeGo, but Ergo is preferable.  This is due to approximately the same functionality, but a more convenient arrangement of keys for the described option.  The body is pleasant to the touch, the buttons are pressed well, all the levers are rubberized. </p><p>  The Pioneer DDJ-ERGO-V controller has almost no disadvantages.  Reviews make it clear that of the negative features, there is only the absence of light bulbs on the faders. </p><h2>  Price category </h2><p>  The article writes the average cost of each model.  If we take competing manufacturers in comparison, the prices are relatively low.  Most appliances are bought from $ 400 to $ 600.  For such a technique, such a good combination of quality and cost is a rarity. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Manufacturer "Pioneer" creates a lot of high-quality equipment.  Anyone is in great demand, because for all the years that the company has pleased its customers, it has never hit its face in the mud. </p><p>  The controller for the Pioneer radio is often installed by drivers in a car.  He has been working for more than 10 years with proper maintenance.  The operational period, functionality, design, intuitive management and price category correspond to each other as much as possible.  If there is any doubt whether to buy products from Pioneer, then a positive decision must be made. </p>
