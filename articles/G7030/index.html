Features of receiving compensation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Soviet times, the phrase "Citizens, keep money in a savings bank!"  It was very common and was considered the standard of civil liability.  He who listened to this advice could have no doubt that he had made the right choice.  For a long time, <span>Soviet citizens</span> were confident not only of tomorrow, but also that nothing bad could happen to their money.  During the collapse of the <span>Soviet Union,</span> many Sberbank depositors lost their savings due to the freezing of all accounts.  Unfortunately, so far the state has not yet been able to fully repay debts to the people.  Therefore, after so many years, many victims are still waiting for the return of their money and are wondering how to get compensation for the damage suffered. </p><h2>  Payment Procedure </h2><p>  At the moment, the <span>payment of</span> <span>Sberbank deposits to</span> citizens of the country who made deposits before the collapse of the USSR is still ongoing.  All accounts, according to the legislation of the country, which are subject to protection and restoration, are gradually paid by the Savings Bank of the Russian Federation.  The Law on Compensation for Damage to Citizens was adopted in 1995. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="compensation for deposits of Sberbank" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47218/1672154.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <p>  It became known that in the country's budget it is planned to continue payments to victims of bank bankruptcy in 1991.  Taking into account the adopted law on compensation for damage, from 2017 to 2019, consideration of citizens' applications will continue.  Five million five hundred thousand rubles were allocated from the budget for each year.  It is this amount that the current government has pledged to pay off debts to citizens of the Russian Federation in order to cover the debt that Sberbank of the USSR left. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Normative acts </h2><p>  Many citizens are interested in the basis of what regulatory acts the return of financial assets from investments will be carried out now until 1991.  All data is noted in the law on the state budget for this period.  Basically, the government refers to the law that was adopted back in 1995.  It is he who implies the return of depositors' money and the protection of their citizens by the state from such problems. </p><h2>  Payment Procedure </h2><p>  The state bodies have not yet approved the order.  It is only known that there are no changes in the payment scheme that were prescribed in the budget before.  The latest changes in the legislation regarding deposits made before June 20, 1991, were made in 2009, by decree No. 1092. Payments will start at the time the funds come from the state budget for the current year to Sberbank of Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="savings book of sberbank" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47218/1672153.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is worth noting that Sberbank will not make payments again.  In other words, according to the law, if a person has already received double or triple compensation, or payment of funeral services or other types of compensation has been made, he cannot receive money from this deposit again and the bank does not undertake to return the funds to the victims again. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Who can get compensation </h2><p>  The most interesting question for the population is information about who will be able to receive compensation for deposits in the coming years.  This information is spelled out in the law on the state budget for the current year.  Citizens of the Russian Federation will be able to receive the following amounts. </p><p>  Those depositors and heirs of deposits whose year of birth is up to 1945 inclusive are entitled to receive payments in the amount of threefold increased account balances in the state in which they were at the time of closing the bank, that is, by 20. 06. 91. Compensation on deposits of Sberbank is considered taking into account the nominal value of units of banknotes at that time.  The amount also depends on how long the deposit was kept in the bank.  And also the amount of money that was previously received during the previous issuance of compensations and commissions is deducted from it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sberbank phone" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/1672432.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  Affected by the bankruptcy of the bank in the early nineties, who were born between 1945 and 1991, including heirs who fit into this category, are entitled to receive account balances in an amount doubled.  Compensation for deposits of Sberbank is considered based on the nominal value of units of banknotes at that time.  The amount also depends on how long the deposit was kept in the bank.  And also the amount of money that was previously received during the previous issuance of compensations and commissions is deducted from it.

They are paid compensation for Sberbank deposits, which is required by the law of the country, to pay for funerals and other expenses.  In other words, a person who was involved in funeral matters has the right to receive 6 thousand rubles of compensation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="compensation of deposits before 1991" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47218/1672151.jpg" width="600"></div>  As for the heirs, they can receive payments on deposits of citizens born before 1991.  The age of the contributor is not important in this case.  The main thing is that before that no payments are made on this contribution.  If earlier compensation was paid on deposits of Sberbank for payment of funeral services, then when calculating the amount, it is not deducted from the total number of money returned.

    <h2>  Who cannot get compensation </h2><p>  Citizens who managed to close deposits for the end of 1991 will not be able to receive payments on deposits.  This category of people do not pay compensation in double and triple sizes.  Also, payments are not made to people who have already received doubled and tripled balances of money.  Heirs and persons who were involved in this process cannot receive compensation again in the amount of six thousand rubles for payment of funeral services. </p><h2>  The calculation of the amount taking into account the nominal value </h2><p>  Payment of funeral services in the event of the death of the depositor and compensation of deposits until 1991 is paid according to the federal law of 12.19.06.  in the amount of 6 thousand rubles, only if on the savings book of the deceased was 400 rubles or more.  If we take into account the nominal value of banknotes at that time, then the amount less than 400 rubles on the deceased's book is reimbursed to people or heirs involved in ritual expenses in the amount of the contribution increased by fifteen times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank of the USSR" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47218/1672150.jpg" width="324"></div>

    <p>  When an application for payment of compensation for covering funeral services is accepted in the appropriate body, a mark is made on the presented death certificate of the depositor.  It confirms the fact of payment of funds and prevents further fraud. </p><h2>  Calculation of the amount of payments, taking into account the deposit shelf life </h2><p>  Depending on how long the deposit was kept, a state calculation of subsequent payments on it is carried out.  To calculate the amount of compensation, a special coefficient is used: </p><ul><li>  For deposits that are currently valid, as well as for those accounts that were valid between 1992 and 2012 and were closed between 1996 and 2015, the number of this ratio is 1. </li><li>  For deposits that were valid between 1992 and 1994 and closed in 1995, the amount of the coefficient is 0.9. </li><li>  Closed deposits in 1994, valid for two years since 1992 - coefficient equal to 0.8. </li><li>  Closed deposits in <span>1993</span> and valid the year before shall be calculated with a coefficient of 0.7. </li><li>  If the deposit was closed in 1992, then the coefficient is 0.6. </li><li>  If the deposit is closed from 06/20/91 to 12/31/91, the coefficient is zero and the amount is not paid. </li></ul><p>  That is, if we look at an example, a person who made a contribution and was born after 1945, who made a deposit closure in 1995, will be able to count on double compensation for his money.  This is taking into account the fact that the amount is calculated using a coefficient whose value is 0.9. </p><h2>  Features of receiving compensation </h2><p>  Based on the information discussed above, it is worth paying attention to special points regarding compensation payments.  This will be useful to everyone who wants to receive redress and is interested in the details of who can count on redress. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="compensation for deposits of Sberbank to heirs" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47218/1672149.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Compensation will not be able to get people currently living in the country and their heirs who do not have the citizenship of the Russian Federation.  Such expenses are not provided for in the budget, and the law does not allow such payments.  Also, people who live in other countries who have foreign citizenship or do not have it at all cannot rely on payments.  More detailed information can be obtained by contacting Sberbank, the telephone hotline is indicated on the official resource. </p><p>  An important point is that Russian legislation does not provide for compensation for damage to citizens of countries formerly part of the USSR.  In other words, money is issued only to those who have Russian citizenship and live here.  All others must receive compensation in their own country in accordance with its laws. </p><p>  It is also important that if the deposit was opened after June 20, 1991, then you should not count on any payments. </p>

    <p>  By law, payment of such bills is not calculated.  Compensation for deposits of Sberbank in 2016 took place according to this scheme.  This year, all payments are made on the basis of legislative changes regarding the budget allocation for the current year. </p><h2>  What documents are needed </h2><p>  Compensation can be obtained at the branch of Sberbank where the deposit was originally made and where it is at the moment.  To receive money, you must provide a certain list of documents. </p><p>  The following papers must be provided for depositors and their representatives: </p><ul><li>  Documents confirming the identity of the recipient. </li><li>  If necessary, you need a document confirming that this is a person authorized to receive compensation for the deposit. </li><li>  Previously issued statement of desire to receive compensation, this must first be done at the bank branch. </li><li>  If available, you need a savings book of Sberbank. </li><li>  If not available, then a statement about the loss of a passbook. </li><li>  If the deposit was closed between 1992 and 2015, you need to provide a special application, which is pre-executed at the bank. </li></ul><p>  The heirs of depositors need to collect the same documents, but with one difference: instead of confirming a power of attorney, you must provide a document on the right to inheritance, a death certificate of the depositor, as well as a certificate that the depositor at the time of death was a full citizen of the Russian Federation.  Compensation for Sberbank deposits to heirs is made only subject to these conditions. </p><h2>  Where can I find out information </h2><p>  All necessary data can be clarified by Sberbank employees, including what documents are needed to pay compensation.  There is a form on the bank‚Äôs website for processing an application for receiving money; you can also personally contact Sberbank.  Phone and other coordinates are also on the official resource.  It is worth noting that any genuine documents that customers provide to fill out an application for receipt of payments, employees must return back after completion of all necessary actions with them. </p><h2>  What you should pay attention to when designing </h2><p>  If the deposit is closed, this information should be displayed in the account cash warrant.  A person receiving compensation is required to put his signature on it.  Before doing this, it is recommended that you carefully read the text of the order and check the amount indicated in it.  If you have questions, it is better not to receive a payment and wait for the recalculation.  In this situation, you should request one of the hand warrant copies.  Also, the savings book of Sberbank should contain a note ‚Äúcompensation‚Äù and it should be returned to the recipient upon completion of the procedure. </p><h2>  Compensation formula </h2><p>  You can calculate your own deposit amount.  To do this, use the following formula: multiply the balance of the deposit as of June 20, 1991 by the compensation coefficient by the increase number, in the case of a three-fold return by 3, in the case of a double return by 2, respectively, and subtract the amount of previously paid compensations for this contribution. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that two deposits are involved in calculating the amount, namely the main balance on the savings book and the amount of compensation calculated on March 1, 1991.  This does not apply to those people whose contributions have been registered after this date. </p><h2>  What does an additional account mean? </h2><p>  Given that food prices rose due to inflation, a decree was adopted to increase the amount of deposits by forty percent.  More precisely, those depositors whose savings exceeded the amount of 200 rubles received an additional account that contained funds in the amount of forty percent of the total amount.  They could take advantage of them by law only after three years.  If the amount was less than 200 rubles, then they could use the additional account after three months. </p>
