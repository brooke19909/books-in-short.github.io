    <h2>  What is a pedagogical technique </h2><p>  For the first time this term appeared in textbooks on pedagogy and didactics at the beginning of the last century.  Since then, many scientists who have not come to a consensus on the exact interpretation of this phenomenon have been engaged in and continue to be engaged in its research.  But if we combine all the works of great teachers, we can draw a generalized conclusion. </p><p>  So, the pedagogical technique is that set of tools, techniques and methods that helps the teacher to establish contact with students and correctly present information material.  She can express herself in practically everything that a teacher does: how he gives a lecture, how he sets up the necessary semantic accents, how he attracts the attention of the audience, and sets her up for work. </p><p>  Pedagogical technique is to some extent a teaching style.  It is based on certain rules, moral standards that a teacher should follow.  However, at the same time, each teacher has this style. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Components of educational technology </h2><p>  The first teacher who attempted to describe the structure of the concept under consideration was A. S. Makarenko.  This man entered the teaching literature on didactics as the greatest teacher of his time.  Of course, years later he had followers, and there were many.  Now, according to the results of accumulated experience, the following components of such a concept as a pedagogical technique are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Perceptual abilities, expressed in the development of memory, imagination and observation. </li><li>  <span>Communicative skills,</span> manifested in the ability to establish contact with the audience. </li><li>  The appearance of the teacher (grooming, as well as the general style). </li><li>  The ability to use verbal (wealth of vocabulary, technical literacy) and non-verbal (diction, intonation and semantic accents) <span>means of communication.</span> </li><li>  The pedagogical technique also includes the ability to control oneself (control gait, gestures, facial expressions, posture). </li></ul><p>  Each of these components plays an important role in the educational process, but separately we will focus only on two of them: the appearance of the teacher and his ability to use verbal and <span>non-verbal means of communication.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="belongs to pedagogical technique" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35566/994299.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The teacher and his appearance </h2><p>  As the saying goes, a person is always greeted by clothes, and escorted by the mind.  This proverb is true, from which side you look at it.  And in the <span>pedagogical process,</span> she plays a role.  After all, a teacher is not just a walking encyclopedia.  First of all, this is a person who transfers experience and knowledge to his students.  And in order for students to perceive the teacher as an authority, he must look respectable, causing respect. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The first thing that reveals the essence of pedagogical technology is clothing.  It should be convenient so as not to hamper the teacher‚Äôs movements and not interfere with him performing basic technological operations: moving around the audience, writing on the blackboard, etc. In addition, it is advisable for the teacher to choose a wardrobe in a restrained, classic style.  Otherwise, students will be distracted by the appearance of the teacher, which will prevent the assimilation of the material. </p><p>  In harmony with the clothes should be other components of the style of the teacher: hairstyle, makeup, accessories.  Perfectly selected details of the teacher‚Äôs image will be an excellent example for students, develop their taste, and also cause sympathy and respect for their teacher. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="improvement of the teacher‚Äôs pedagogical technique" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35566/994295.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Teacher management with his speech </h2><p>  Let us return to our proverb, which interprets that the mind is the second characteristic by which we are evaluated.  And since the pedagogical technique is primarily oral mastery, it is very important for the teacher to be able to correctly express his thoughts.  To do this, the teacher needs: </p><ul><li>  to be technically literate in the material that he explains to his pupils; </li><li>  observe the correct pronunciation of the text; </li><li>  state information in the simplest and most accessible way; </li><li>  decorate your speech with epithets and metaphors; </li><li>  own a rich vocabulary and good diction; </li><li>  correctly place pauses and semantic stresses. </li></ul><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the last point.  Pauses are necessary in order to attract the attention of listeners and give them time to reflect on what has been said.  They are made either after an important statement, or in front of him to create some kind of intrigue.  Meaningful accents are made in the text to create an emphasis on certain points.  With them you can begin to improve the pedagogical technique of the teacher.  Typically, stresses are manifested by a slight increase in the volume of the teacher's voice or a change in his tone.  For example, the semantic load can be done when reading out a term. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The main mistakes in pedagogical technique </h2><p>  Lack of mastery of teaching skills leads to a decrease in the effectiveness of the learning process.  As a rule, this is caused by such errors in the formation of the pedagogical technique: </p><ul><li>  monotonous, too fast speech without semantic accents; </li><li>  inability to regulate one‚Äôs psychological and emotional state (to overcome anger, excitement, etc.); </li><li>  lack of communication skills, which prevents the establishment of contact between the teacher and his students; </li><li>  meager use of gestures and facial expressions. </li></ul><h2>  Receptions of pedagogical technology </h2><p>  In order to conduct a lesson in an interesting and productive way, it is not enough for a teacher to be theoretically prepared for it.  A diverse flow of information is provided by the methods of pedagogical technology.  They are methods that describe how and in what form it is better to present this or that material to students.  Today's famous teacher Anatoly Gin presented to the world a book describing the techniques of pedagogical technology.  There are a huge number of them, so we will consider the most basic, so to speak, briefly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pedagogical technique srs" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35566/994294.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Organizational moments </h2><p>  To set students up for work, they need to be slightly encouraged.  To do this, at the beginning of the lesson, the following techniques are used: </p><ul><li>  Communicating with the audience in a slightly comic manner.  This will bring the group to the teacher and will develop interest in the upcoming topic. </li><li>  Use as an example of fantastic heroes.  It doesn‚Äôt matter whether it will be a person or an unusual plant, the main thing is that students want to join in the lesson. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Introductory survey </h2><p>  The best way to start a new topic is to move smoothly to it from the previous one.  All pedagogical techniques and technologies imply that the fragments of the material studied in the lessons should be interconnected.  But first, it is advisable to conduct a small warm-up in the form of: </p><ul><li>  small survey; </li><li>  intellectual competitions. </li></ul><p>  The survey can be conducted in a playful way.  For example, a teacher reads statements, and students are asked to determine which one is wrong.  Or it creates the likeness of famous intellectual games ("What? Where? When?", "Field of Miracles"). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pedagogical techniques" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35566/994297.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Assimilation of new material </h2><p>  It is known that during the course of the lecture, students remember only a small part of the information they hear.  Therefore, the teacher can apply additional methods for better assimilation of the material presented: </p><ul><li>  independent compilation of a <span>supporting abstract by</span> each student; </li><li>  preparation of a list of questions on the topic of the lecture. </li></ul><p>  This will develop the ability of students to highlight the main among a large amount of information.  In addition, in this way the topic covered will be better fixed in memory. </p><h2>  Refining acquired knowledge </h2><p>  In this case, student activity is more manifested than pedagogical.  Techniques of CDS (independent work of students) are used in many universities to improve the effectiveness of the educational process.  Here we are already talking about the practical application of theoretical knowledge.  The teacher can offer students any of the following options: </p><ul><li>  creating a small project; </li><li>  independent research; </li><li>  problem solving; </li><li>  performing exercises to find errors. </li></ul>
