However, in order to think over such a trip, you need to answer a number of questions: how many km are from Voronezh to Moscow, are there any paid sections where you can stay?  About all this in our article. </p><h2>  Do I need a navigator or map? </h2><p>  Traveling to the capital is the easiest thing you can do with your own car and it doesn‚Äôt matter how many kilometers from Voronezh to Moscow.  Novice traveler will help the <span>M-4 highway.</span>  This is a wide and multi-lane road that does not need to be turned anywhere.  You don‚Äôt even have to pay attention to the signs, just go along the main road until you reach the MKAD. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sircsyjoe.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="long winter road" class="if uuid-2340034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2340034.jpg"></div><h2>  What difficulties are expected? </h2><p>  The first and main difficulty is the long <span>route.</span>  <span>The distance from Moscow to</span> Voronezh by car is a little over 500 kilometers.  It seems like a lot, but it really is not. </p><p>  The second thing to remember is the abundance of paid sites.  For traveling on the M-4 in a car you will have to pay from 500 to 700 rubles, depending on the night or day time.  Operators of paid sites offer to buy a transponder, which will allow paying for the road cheaper by 30-40%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many also forget that Voronezh and Moscow are famous for their traffic jams.  Therefore, if the departure / arrival time falls in the morning or evening, then you need to lay an extra couple of hours on the way. </p><h2>  Road quality and speed </h2><p>  The problem of a car trip to the capital is not so much the km from Voronezh to Moscow, but the difference in speed limits along the route. </p><p>  In paid sections, the maximum speed reaches 110 km / h, but the route is periodically interrupted by sections passing through settlements.  And this means that you will have to slow down to 60 km / h, or even to 40 km / h.  Therefore, special attention will have to be paid to speed signs.  With due carelessness, you can collect a serious amount of fines, reaching 5,000 rubles on a journey in both directions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fengshuirealestate.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="road in Russia" class="if uuid-2340036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2340036.jpg"></div><p>  As for the quality of the road, then it is on top.  The road surface is in perfect condition and is regularly repaired by road operators.  You can safely ride at high speed without risk of breaking a wheel in an unforeseen pit. </p><p>  Also, throughout the route there are equidistant SOS buttons with which you can call an ambulance, police, tow truck or road commissars.  Problems on paid sites are resolved quickly and efficiently. </p><p>  Despite how many kilometers are from Voronezh to Moscow, a trip from the capital of Chernozemye to the capital of Russia will not only give a lot of pleasant impressions, but it will also not take much effort.  This distance can be traveled in 3-5 hours and on the same day to see the sights of Moscow.  The abundance of hotels and cafes will make the trip comfortable, well-fed and joyful.  And now, bolder on the road!  Meet new experiences. </p>
