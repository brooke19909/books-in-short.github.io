    <p>  This is Coral Castle, which was built by Edward Leedskalnin - a Latvian emigrant who came to the <span>United States at the beginning of the 20th century.</span>  An amazing building, built of huge boulders, since 1983 is located in the national register of historical places of the United States and is rightfully considered a modern miracle. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Who is Edward Leedskalnin?  At first, the biography of this Latvian was completely unremarkable.  Edward was born on January 12, 1887 in the Stameriene volost, located in the Valka district of the Livonia province.  Today it is Latvia, and in those years this area was part of the Russian Empire.  The only thing known about Edward Lidskalnin‚Äôs childhood was that he was not rich, and therefore he studied at school only until the fourth grade.  After that, Edward mastered the stone-cutting and stone-cutting business.  And it was very surprising, because a thin Latvian had a height of just over 150 cm and weighed only 43 kg. </p><p>  At the age of 26, Edward Leedskalnin got involved in the 16-year-old village beauty Agnes Scuffs.  What attracted the girl to this ugly thin shorty?  Most likely, his piercing eyes, which literally radiated love.  Young Agnes initially agreed to the engagement, and then tore it up just two days before the wedding, deciding that her fiance was too old and poor for her.  The wedding was upset, and Edward's heart was broken. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Emigration to America </h2><p>  After the engagement broke up, Edward Lidskalnin felt humiliated in front of his fellow villagers.  And, suffering from unrequited love, he emigrated away from his native home in America.  Without a penny in his pocket (all the savings were spent on a ticket), a poor man had a hard time.  For ten years he wandered around California, Texas and Canada, getting a job as a cattle driver, then a lumberjack, then an office worker.  This period was not easy, besides Edward still caught tuberculosis.  However, while working, the stubborn Latvian managed to save some money, which was enough to acquire a plot of land, a modest life and the realization of his dream, which he did not tell anyone about. </p><p>  In 1920, Edward Leedskalnin moved to Florida, whose warm climate was most suitable for his health.  There he acquired a small <span>plot of land</span> and began to realize his old dream. </p><h2>  Unusual construction </h2><p>  Wandering around the world, Edward Lidskalnin became interested in the study of sciences.  He was especially attracted to astronomy and the history of ancient Egypt.  How did Edward Leedskalnin apply his knowledge in life?  In Florida, he built a massive structure, which was originally called the Stone Gate Park.  This creation was dedicated to a girl who rejected his love. </p>

    <p>  Edward worked alone, and to hide from prying eyes, he did this at night.  As a result, he mined, and then processed more than 1100 tons of lime blocks.  Of these, Edward Lidskalnin built the ‚ÄúCoral Castle‚Äù (as this building was later called).  The author claimed that he was able to solve the mystery of the construction of the Egyptian pyramids.  He applied the same method in the construction of his castle. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description of Stone Gate Park </h2><p>  By 1936, the Coral Castle was completely completed.  According to the author‚Äôs intentions, it was an imaginary love abode for the girl of Agnes, whom she had never visited. </p>

    <p>  Edward installed giant coral chairs, chairs, tables, beds and a bathtub at Stone Gate Park.  In addition, a fountain, a grotto and a sundial are built on the territory of this castle.  Lidskalnin, who loved to watch the sky strewn with stars, created and installed eighteen-ton sculptures of Mars, Saturn and the Moon.  His Park also has a 20-ton ‚Äútelescope‚Äù made of stone, through which you can see the North Star.  The only residential building in the monastery is a two-story tower. </p><p>  Not far from it is a throne room with an obelisk, the mass of which is 30 tons.  All this splendor created from coral limestone is surrounded by a massive wall.  The height of the fence reaches 2.5 meters.  There are several gates in the wall.  The most famous of them are the opening, in which there is a perfectly fitted stone block.  This massive "door" opens with one small click of a finger, which causes amazement among modern builders. </p><h2>  The mystery of the construction of the Coral Castle </h2><p>  Edward Leedskalnin has been building his brainchild for twenty years.  He did this in the strictest confidence, working only at night.  This allowed him to avoid the prying eyes of his neighbors.  What is mysterious about what Edward Leedskalnin did?  The castle, which erected this small stature and does not shine with healthy Latvian, consists of huge wall blocks.  These massive blocks surrounding the courtyard of the park, Edward laid without the use of cement.  At the same time, he so perfectly fitted the blocks to each other that his creation resembles the Egyptian pyramids.  And the multi-ton front door, a gigantic stone table and the same armchairs and a bedroom?  But this is not surprising, but how and by what they are made.  Researchers have no answer to this question so far. </p>

    <p>  A strange builder erected his construction in some way unknown to modern engineers.  He did not even have the most basic equipment, but at the same time he managed to deliver massive coral boulders from the coast, after squeezing blocks out of them. </p><p>  The tools that Leedskalnin used were made by him from automotive parts thrown into the landfill.  So, to crack a block, Edward used a makeshift chisel.  He punched a hole in the limestone with them, and then inserted old shock-absorbing shock absorbers from the car into it.  Then the builder poured cold water on the metal.  Iron split the stone, increasing in volume.  And how did he manage to lift five-ton blocks to a multimeter height?  No explanation was found for this.  After the death of Edward in his workshop did not find any, even the most primitive lifting mechanisms. </p><h2>  Neighbor Observations </h2><p>  The question of how the unusual structure is being built was haunting the residents of nearby houses.  The most curious of them tried to ask for a visit to an unusual neighbor.  However, Leedskalnin cut off their attempts with his expressive, unblinking gaze, which made many feel uneasy. </p><p>  Once, the neighboring boys tried to solve the riddle of construction by stolen a night vision device from their father.  The guys climbed to the roof of their house and began to watch the work of Edward.  Their amazement knew no bounds.  Later, the boys said that Edward Lidskalnin himself was on the site, and the movement of huge stone blocks took place without his participation.  Multi-ton pieces of coral limestone literally floated through the air like balloons. </p><p>  There is evidence of another neighbor who allegedly saw Leedskalnin singing to the rocks.  According to her, the guy laid hands on them, and then made lingering sounds. </p><h2>  Unexpected move </h2><p>  In the late thirties, not far from the Edward plot, a lawyer from Louisiana bought the land.  The enterprising neighbor decided to build a multi-storey building on its territory.  This was not part of Leedskalnin‚Äôs plans, and he decided to move his Stone Gate Park to another place.  With his savings, Edward bought a new plot in Florida and hired a powerful truck.  The driver received payment in advance and should not have been present at the time of loading.  The car was served at nine in the morning.  Arriving at noon, the driver saw coral blocks already loaded into the truck and the owner calmly standing next to him.  Out of curiosity, he tried to question the neighbors if anyone had helped Edward in his hardest work, but no one was able to answer him. </p><h2>  Leedskalnin opens the veil of secrecy </h2><p>  The coral castle raised many questions.  However, at first the Latvian preferred to remain silent.  Only later, when the building was built a second time, did Edward slightly open the curtain of his secret.  To the most curious, he explained that he had learned the secret of the Egyptian pyramids. </p>

    <p>  At the end of his life, the unsociable Latvian, who never had a family and had no friends, began to let tourists into his castle, taking a quarter dollar for the entrance.  With this money he lived in recent years. </p><h2>  Fatal disease </h2><p>  Despite torturing Edward with tuberculosis, in the last days of his life he did not suffer at all from him.  11/09/1951 Leedskalnina registered in the Jackson Hospital, located in Miami.  The Latvian emigrant suffered a blow.  When he had an attack, it is unknown.  According to one version, Ed suffered a stroke and then went to the hospital, according to another - the heart malfunctioned directly in the hospital. </p><p>  After hospitalization, the mysterious builder returned to his Coral Castle and lay down in the stone bed he had built.  Three days later, at the age of 64, Edward Leedskalnin died.  The main cause of death, which was noted in the death certificate, was uremia - kidney failure as a result of infection and an abscess. </p><h2>  Inheritance </h2><p>  After the death of Lidskalnin, in his working chamber, which was the only enclosed premises of the castle, they found 3,500 dollars.  By American standards, these were mere pennies.  What other legacy besides this amount and Coral Castle did Edward Leedskalnin leave?  The work of the Latvian emigrant was also of interest in certain circles.  During his lifetime, Ed published 5 brochures, which were advertised in local newspapers.  The following are on their list: </p><ul><li>  Magnetic Flux (19 pages). </li><li>  ‚ÄúA book in every house.  Contains three subjects: Sweet Sixteen Ed, Internal and Political Views. " </li><li>  ‚ÄúMagnetic flux‚Äù (1945, 4 pages). </li><li>  "Magnetic base." </li></ul>

    <p>  The books of Edward Leedskalnin were also found in his working closet.  In them, he expressed his thoughts on the connection of all living organisms on earth, set forth his own views on the state system, and also narrated about the discoveries made by him in the field of terrestrial magnetism and the control of ‚Äúcosmic energy‚Äù. </p><h2>  Help from aliens? </h2><p>  The fact that Leedskalnin Edward managed to subjugate the <span>magnetic flux to himself was</span> very much doubted by the Americans.  And even when the country became aware of brochures written by a mysterious builder, the main version of the construction of the Coral Castle was ufological. </p><p>  There were rumors that the mysterious structure served as a refuge for alien scouts.  And it was for them that twenty-five gigantic armchairs were intended.  These aliens helped build the castle.  And the discovery made by Edward Leedskalnin, and the movement of huge stone boulders with his help - these are all tales for eye contact.  The ufologists' assumption was also confirmed by unusual astronomical instruments located in the castle.  These include a huge telescope, towering at the top of the tower-columns, aimed directly at the North Star. </p><p>  The sundial of the Coral Castle was also unusual for researchers.  They are so perfectly calibrated for the summer and winter solstices that they still show the time with the accuracy of electronic devices.  How and why did a person with only primary education do all these things? </p><h2>  Antigravity </h2><p>  In addition to the ufological, there is another version of the disclosure of the secret of an unusual structure.  So, in his book The Secret of the Coral Castle, Ray Stoner writes that Edward Leedskalnin most likely discovered antigravity.  According to the researcher, an invisible energy grid covers our planet.  It consists of power lines.  In places of their intersection, the internal energy of the Earth breaks out to the surface and has an unusual concentration.  In these areas, and you can create things that are not able to explain modern science. </p><p>  So, according to Stoner, the concentrated energy of the Earth will allow moving objects in time and space.  According to the author of The Secret of the Coral Castle, Edward Lidskalnin relocated his building not because of the threat of building a high-rise building on a neighboring site.  The Latvian simply discovered an error in his calculations and moved to South Florida, where a powerful dynamic pole is located.  In this place, it was much easier for the mysterious builder to apply his antigravity discovery. </p><h2>  Coral Castle Modern Life </h2><p>  The debate about the mysterious Latin continues to this day.  However, they are supported only by enthusiasts.  Official science, which failed to unravel the mystery of an unusual structure, prefers to simply remain silent. </p>
