All achievements are made only after much work, research and experimentation.  Only having done such a path can one count on a positive result and then use the acquired knowledge. </p><p>  But who really represents what scientific research is, what is its purpose?  This is only a general concept, which includes a very vast field of knowledge, and most importantly, it is not limited to only one science. </p><p>  Scientists are always faced with some tasks that they are trying to solve.  Sometimes they can simply study the materials received and the information gathered in order to learn how to use them in practice.  All this can be combined into such a concept as ‚Äúscientific research‚Äù. </p><p>  Scientific research can be characterized as a certain process during which the study takes place, or experiments are made, theories are checked or refuted, etc.  During this process, the acquisition of new knowledge in science or the concretization of old ones takes place.  In any case, every research scientist is faced with such tasks and is engaged in scientific research.  They are the main essence of the work. </p><p>  <span>The purpose of science</span> is to collect information that is of particular interest to humanity.  Any society that needs to evolve constantly needs information.  It is of particular value to a person because it helps him solve problems and rise to a new height. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Any science is a kind of collective action, with a constant exchange of information.  Under such conditions, research is taking place.  Moreover, as a rule, in order to start any research, a person must have a set of primary knowledge, from which he will build on his work.  Thus, the accumulation of knowledge in society occurs when data from early studies are used to obtain new ones, possibly even taking place several decades ago. </p>

    <p>  <strong>Pedagogy and research</strong> </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>  Many imagine that scientific research more often occurs in the <span>exact sciences,</span> when you need to study something, or discover something new, previously unknown.  Especially if it is associated with the production of new equipment, etc. </p><p>  But in some cases, the object of research may be the person himself.  Such knowledge is also crucial to society.  Indeed, not only new discoveries make life better, but also knowledge about the person himself, about his psychology also helps to live. </p><p>  In this light, pedagogy and the science of upbringing and training are of particular importance.  The volume of knowledge accumulated by mankind is enormous, every year it becomes more and more, and a person needs to master at least part of this knowledge that he will need in life. </p><p>  Pedagogy helps him master this knowledge, and scientific research in pedagogy is designed to find the best ways and <span>methods of education</span> and training.  For such studies, <span>goals and objectives are</span> also characteristic <span>,</span> there is also an <span>object of research,</span> and special tools and methods are used in the work. </p>

    <p>  <strong>Research in Psychology</strong> </p><p>  Psychology studies the <span>mental processes of a</span> person, as well as options for his behavior.  Each person is individual, he behaves in society only with his inherent manner.  This science helps to tear oneself apart in the features of its behavior, and, therefore, it can determine the state of the whole society. </p><p>  Scientific research in psychology is associated with man, he is the object of study.  Psychologists often make discoveries because this science is very complex, especially due to the difficulties of research in this area. </p><p>  But the achievements of this science are constantly used by everyone.  Without a doubt, these sciences help make our lives better, they help society move forward, and scientific research is an ongoing process. </p>
