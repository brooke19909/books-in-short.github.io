Visit the banks of the Moika River, where the Yusupov Palace, built in the 18th century, is located.  It well preserved front apartments, halls of the art gallery, a small home theater and residential quarters.  Restorers even managed to revive its artistic interiors bit by bit.  The soul freezes from contemplation of this beauty.  After all, it was here that Rasputin Grigory was killed under mysterious circumstances.  On <span>Hare Island,</span> we recommend visiting the Peter and Paul Fortress.  It was built at the base of the city itself on the Neva.  From afar her golden graceful spire is noticeable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of peter in the winter" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/769020.jpg" width="505"></div>  On the territory of this fortress there are several old museums.  It is impossible not to mention the Winter Museum, whose walls are witnesses to love affairs of emperors, important decrees, social events, revolution and magnificent balls.  The Winter Palace in our time is the main building of the Hermitage.  There are paintings by Titian, Rubens, Van Gogh, Cezanne.  Try it, and maybe you will personally see and discover the secret of Kazimir Malevich in his painting ‚ÄúBlack Square‚Äù.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  The Electric Transportation Museum is a very interesting place with retro-trolleybuses and retro-trams. </li><li>  ‚ÄúGrand Layout of Russia‚Äù - it is worth seeing this country in miniature. </li><li>  Museum ‚ÄúRepublic of Cats‚Äù - all cat lovers love it. </li><li>  ‚ÄúFloors‚Äù, a loft project where creative youth gathers, there are many interesting and unusual exhibitions. </li><li>  ‚ÄúErarta‚Äù - a museum of modern art. </li><li>  Theaters, for example, Komissarzhevskaya and BDT. </li></ol><p>  So we answered the question of where to go to St. Petersburg in the winter evening.  You can also add skating on an open or closed rink, games in a time cafe. </p><h2>  Engineering Castle, <span>Sheremetyevo Palace,</span> Museum of the Arctic and Antarctica </h2><p>  In the afternoon it is recommended to go to the Engineering Castle and listen to the guide, be sure to visit the Sheremetyevo and Stroganov palaces, touch the luxury and beauty in which noble and wealthy people lived in the past in St. Petersburg.  And the best thing, of course, is to read in advance, familiarize yourself, make a plan, and then go along the route that you have outlined.  After all, it all depends on your taste.  There are any entertainments in the city.  For example, go to the Museum of Antarctica and the Arctic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="night peter in winter" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/768987.jpg" width="600"></div>  These sights of St. Petersburg in winter can be seen much better.  The Arctic Museum opened in 1937.  After the intensive development of Antarctica began, in 1958 the same place was opened.  It more and more lost the direction of ideology, became a monument to the efforts of all generations of researchers and a good archive.  In 1998, the museum was separated from the institute and made a separate independent state institution with a new name - RSMAA.  From the same year, its exposition consists of the following sections: ‚ÄúAntarctica‚Äù, ‚ÄúHistory of development and research of the Northern Sea Route‚Äù, ‚ÄúNature of the Arctic‚Äù.  So if you decide what to do in St. Petersburg in the winter, consider this option.
