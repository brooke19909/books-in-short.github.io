Today, no one can deny the importance and underestimate the role of statistics in public life.  <span>Statistics</span> contribute to the formation of an adequate understanding of the current state of affairs in the country.  Due to this, in the event that any deviations or inconsistencies are detected, it becomes possible to take a number of corrective measures in time and significantly improve the situation. </p><h2>  Interpretation and meaning of the term </h2><p>  The term "statistics" comes from the Latin word status, which implies a certain state of things.  This concept was first used in 1749 by a scientist of German origin G. Achenwal, who mentioned it in his book on the conduct of public affairs.  To date, the term is used in three main meanings: </p><ol><li>  Statistics is a science that studies the processes and phenomena of public life, reveals the laws of development of these phenomena and explains the existing relationship between them. </li><li>  <span>This is a branch of</span> knowledge that studies the phenomena occurring in society from a quantitative point of view. </li><li>  This is some data presented by organizations under the guise of financial statements. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="statistics is a science" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22327/527363.jpg" width="280"></div></li></ol><h2>  The subject, object and tasks of statistics </h2><p>  Each science has its own specific features, its own subject and object of study.

    <h2>  <span>What is a variation</span> in statistics? </h2><p>  Variation in statistics is nothing more than a difference in the values ‚Äã‚Äãof certain signs characteristic of two or more units of a population in a similar period of time.  It arises due to the existence of different conditions for the existence of several units of the same population and is used in the process of sample observation, as well as for statistical modeling and planning of expert surveys.  In accordance with the indicators of variation, a conclusion is drawn regarding the uniformity of the units of the population, the stability of the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the attributes and their relationship.  It should be noted that variation is one of the prerequisites for both the development and the very existence of mass phenomena. </p><h2>  Who is the statistician? </h2><p>  The question arises of who such statistics are and what they do.  Initially, it should be said that statistics is primarily a profession.  Today, this profession has attracted the attention of an increasing number of young people who, after graduation, decide to devote themselves entirely to the study and development of statistical science.  They are well aware that a statistician is a specialist whose work is devoted to the processing and study of quantitative indicators of social processes and phenomena, the degree of their change and development.  He is an employee subordinate to state authority, or an employee of the statistical departments of various enterprises and organizations.  It should also be emphasized that the statistician is an expert whose activities are aimed at collecting, processing and analyzing the totality of information about the state and the events occurring in it.  His immediate responsibilities include the following tasks: </p><ol><li>  The collection of information and the preparation on its basis of reporting on certain indicators. </li><li>  Verification of the realism of the data collected and their comparison with indicators of the past period. </li><li>  Systematization, processing and analysis of data. </li><li>  Compilation of various kinds of certificates, based on the totality of the data collected and processed. </li></ol><p>  The subject of statistics is symbolic systems, that is, numbers, different tables and graphs, formulas, documentation.  The main goal pursued by him is the analysis of statistical data, their systematization, as well as the comparison of laws from a quantitative perspective. </p>

    <h2>  Role in public life </h2><p>  The role of statistical science and statistical accounting in the life of society cannot be underestimated.  Statistics give a real picture of the state of the economy, scientific activity, the level of culture of the population, the welfare and well-being of society in a certain period of time.  In addition, it becomes possible to monitor the implementation of various national economic programs, identify inconsistencies, deviations from the intended plan, and compare development indicators of various states.  Moreover, statistics are of great importance not only for the present, but also for the future.  Thus, they can be the basis for the scientific planning of tomorrow's development of society and its progress. </p>
