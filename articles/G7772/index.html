  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Turkey Alanya Hotels: Oriental Tale</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This city is one of the most interesting for tourists, one of the most beautiful and attractive in all of Turkey - magnificent Alanya, opening its arms to all guests from different parts of the globe.  It has a unique climate: long days are filled with heat, and nights are cool even in winter, which is provided by the location of the city in the mountains.  Tourists who come to this place on vacation can have at their disposal everything that is rich in it: a fabulous vacation in an unusual changeable climate, the best hotels in Alanya, walks along sunny promenades, visits to various taverns and restaurants, as well as a magnificent bay that creates a unique atmosphere romance and oriental tales.  When planning your future summer vacation, you should consider visiting Alanya.  Here, choosing one of the huge number of hotels as your place of residence, you have the opportunity to enjoy the wonderful view from the windows every day (mostly overlooking <span>orchards</span> and real plantations), take part in fascinating excursions and visits to dozens of historical and cultural attractions, as well as visit amazing natural monuments - stalactite caves. </p><p>  Turkey Alanya hotels are located on the picturesque sea coast, so living in them will certainly be like an Arabian fairy tale, secluded, but very romantic and beautiful.  Accommodation here is best suited for those who need a good rest away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  But solitude does not mean complete remoteness and separation from civilization - in the immediate vicinity of any hotel, not even the most "star", guests can find all the necessary infrastructure (restaurants, shops, pharmacies).  Everyone can go to local markets and buy a lot of souvenirs for relatives and friends - handmade carpets, leather goods and jewelry.  In addition, the list of advantages enjoyed by <span>Turkey Alanya</span> hotels includes, as already mentioned, their location.  Wherever you stay, a clean beach and a coastline with lots of resort and beach entertainment will be at your fingertips. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the best such hotels is the "Saphir Resort &amp; Spa Hotel 5 *", which is often chosen by our compatriots who come on <span>holiday to Turkey.</span>  However, many experienced tourists consider such evidence of the hotel‚Äôs popularity as the interest of Russian travelers rather a disadvantage than a virtue.  They prefer to relax where the speech of compatriots does not sound as often as here (hotel "Justinian Club" Alanya, for example).  But, one way or another, but ‚ÄúSaphir Resort &amp; Spa Hotel 5 *‚Äù, operating on the ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù system (like many other Turkey Alanya hotels) offers its guests all the best for relaxation.  It has comfortable rooms of various categories, including bridal apartments, family housing and standard rooms, restaurants and themed bars where you can try unusual dishes of Turkish and many European cuisines.  A special place in this hotel is given to creating and providing a variety of entertainment - guests can visit the pools for children and adults, theater and cinema, discos.  Adults will enjoy spending time in shopping centers, and their children in the playgrounds.  Water parks and clubs, sports fields and traditional Turkish baths are intended for the whole family. </p><p>  And for those who believe that the main advantage that Turkey Alanya hotels should have is a low price for accommodation and a good location in relation to crowded places, the best solution would be to stay at the Alangun 2 * hotel - not too prestigious , inexpensive, but very comfortable and cozy. </p>
