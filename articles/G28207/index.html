After all, this will seriously affect the quality of the vacation.  This is especially true for hotels operating on an all-inclusive basis, on the territory of which guests spend almost all their time.  But even if you plan to return to the hotel just to change clothes and sleep at night, for sure, you would like to do it in comfortable conditions.  Invaluable help in the process of choosing a hotel, according to many experienced travelers, is provided by reviews of real people who have already visited a particular place.  After all, on the basis of their own experience, they share information about the pluses and minuses of hotels.  This helps to create a more complete and closer to reality idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat will await you on vacation.  In order to save your time, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized comments of our compatriots regarding their stay at Mike Hotel Pattaya 3 * (Thailand, Pattaya).  Just note that almost all the reviews of tourists are positive, from which we can conclude that they really liked the hotel.  But we learn more about everything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand pattaya" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1053299.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Judging by their comments, Russian tourists who were offered the apartments in this hotel were satisfied.  Of course, according to them, the numbers here are small.  However, few people vacationing in Thailand spend a lot of time in their room.  After all, the weather in Pattaya and other parts of the country, as well as the presence of a lot of entertainment, do not have to sit at the hotel.  In general, the rooms in the hotel in question are very neat, clean, bright.  The equipment here works without interruption.  If, however, some kind of breakdown occurs, then after contacting the reception the wizard will fix all the problems as soon as possible.  Some guests considered the absence of balconies in the apartment a small minus.  So they had to dry wet things in the bathroom.  As for the indisputable advantages, our compatriots were pleasantly surprised by the excellent soundproofing of the rooms.  So the noise from the street does not interfere with your vacation.  Travelers pay attention to the fact that neither the rooms nor the hotel, in principle, have hairdryers.  Therefore, if you need this device, then grab it from home. </p><h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  Regarding this item, the guests of Mike Hotel Pattaya 3 * had no complaints.  So, according to them, the cleaning was carried out every day, and they did it quite qualitatively.  The maids changed towels and bedding several times a week. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya Mike Hotel" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1053300.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  Experienced travelers warn those who plan to arrive at this hotel that upon arrival you will be asked to leave a deposit (approximately one hundred dollars).  Therefore, expect this amount in advance.  By the way, this practice is observed in many hotels in Thailand, and Pattaya Mike Hotel is no exception in this regard.  The deposit will be returned to you on the day of departure. </p><p>  As for arrival, if the hotel has available rooms of the category you have booked, you will be offered to check in almost immediately after arrival, without condemning you to waiting.  However, if the apartments intended for you have not yet been vacated by the previous tenants, then you will have to wait for the checkout time (14:00).  As for the day of departure, the room should be vacated before noon.  If necessary, you can extend the stay for several hours at an additional cost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mike hotel pattaya 3 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1053301.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  According to the vast majority of our compatriots, the main advantage of the Mike Hotel (Thailand, Pattaya) is its location.  The fact is that it is located just five minutes walk from the famous Walking Street.  You can walk to the city port in a quarter of an hour, and to the popular Shopping Center Festival in 20 minutes.  In addition, from the street on which the hotel is located, you can easily reach any place in Pattaya.  It is enough to arm yourself with a card in paper or electronic form. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Since the hotel we are considering is urban, it does not have its own territory.  However, this did not prevent the builders of the hotel from providing guests with the opportunity to swim in the pool.  It is located on the roof, which offers magnificent views of the sea and the surrounding area.  So tourists always had the opportunity to spend time here, swimming or sunbathing in a sun lounger and admiring the surrounding landscape.  In addition, guests can visit the small gym, as well as play billiards. </p><p>  As for Internet access, according to our compatriots, Wi-Fi can be used not only in the public areas of the hotel, but also in many rooms.  The highest quality signal is observed in the apartments near the reception.  Therefore, if the availability of the Internet is very important for you, then upon arrival you can ask the administrator to put you in these rooms. </p><p>  Also, hotel guests have the opportunity to leave valuables in storage in the safe at the reception.  However, as many tourists claim, they did not use this service, and nothing disappeared from the rooms.  In addition, travelers can take their laundry and order room service (surcharge).  You can also exchange currency, book an excursion and rent a vehicle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mike hotel pattaya 3 thailand pattaya" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1053302.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The price for accommodation here includes breakfast only.  According to our compatriots, there is plenty to choose from, but the menu repeats every day.  So, in the morning you can eat rice, stew or chicken with vegetables, spicy soup with yum, fried eggs, sausages, toast, jam, fresh vegetables and fruits.  You can have lunch and dinner both in the hotel restaurant and in one of Pattaya's cafes.  According to tourists, food almost everywhere is very tasty and very inexpensive. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the weather in Pattaya is suitable for swimming all year round, many guests at the Mike Hotel, according to them, preferred to go to <span>Koh Lan Island</span> for these purposes <span>.</span>  You can get here from the city beach by ferry.  The road will take about 40 minutes.  Here you will find magnificent beaches, clear sea, developed infrastructure.  As for the <span>beaches of Pattaya,</span> they, according to some tourists, are poorly adapted for recreation, moreover, the water here is not very clean, muddy. </p>
