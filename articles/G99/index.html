It is recommended for tourists who prefer to spend money not on a luxury hotel with modern furniture, daily linen change, rich breakfasts, but on a meaningful cultural event: a bus trip to Dresden, visits to theaters and <span>museums in Prague</span> , etc. </p><p>  The rooms that are provided by the guests of the Olga Hotel (Prague), the reviews are called quite spacious, equipped with a separate bathroom.  Fena, as some claim, contrary to advertising, is not.  Like a safe.  A bathrobe with slippers should be taken on your own.  Everything in the hotel is arranged in a simple way, furniture since the Soviet era, no ‚Äúbells and whistles‚Äù are provided.  Yes, they are not needed, say the authors of the reviews.  In Prague there is something to see, they share, the hotel is needed in order to only spend the night.  Room cleaning daily, clean.  The TV is in Czech, but guests usually do not care.  Wi-Fi in the rooms is not always ‚Äúcaught‚Äù.  Smoking is allowed through the window, the room has an ashtray. </p>
