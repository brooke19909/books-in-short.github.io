The small island state of Malta enjoys well-deserved popularity, where there is everything to leave your impressions of rest with you for a long time: beautiful nature, the azure clear sea, excellent service, ancient history, amazing architecture, a lot of entertainment and the friendliness of the Maltese. </p><h2>  Malta: a bit of history </h2><p>  The history of Malta is rooted in antiquity.  The first traces of civilization discovered on the island date back to the Stone Age.  The mysterious stone monoliths of megalithic culture, as scientists have found, were older than the Egyptian pyramids.  This developed ancient civilization mysteriously disappeared, leaving behind many secrets and questions. </p><p>  The history of Malta is unique.  The island passed from one conqueror to another as many times as no other European state can mark.  Malta at various times belonged to the Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantines.  All of them left their mark on the history of Malta.  But the new culture, which became significant for Malta, was brought to the island by the Knights of the Order of the Johannites.  They later became known as knights of the Order of Malta.  With the arrival of the Johannites in a small state, life began to boil.  New fortresses and cities were under construction, active trade resumed, culture flourished.  Over the centuries, knights owned the island and protected it from invasion.  Napoleon put an end to the power of the order, capturing Malta without a fight.  Then, for a long time, the British ruled the island.  But in the mid-twentieth century, Malta declared independence and in 1974 became a republic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Geographical location and climate </h2><p>  Malta is located in the Mediterranean Sea, between Italy and Tunisia.  The republic consists of three main islands: Malta, Gozo and Comino, as well as many small islands.  This is the only European country where there are no rivers and other freshwater bodies of water.  Water is delivered to Malta from Sicily.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island state is only three hundred sixteen square kilometers.  There is little vegetation and land animals, which can not be said about the rich underwater diversity of flora and fauna. </p><div class="photo" data-original="effitimonholiday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta children reviews" class="if uuid-2310024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48915/2310024.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews, Malta is one of the most comfortable holiday destinations in the Mediterranean.  The climate here is subtropical.  In summer it is dry and hot, in winter it often rains and strong winds blow.  But it is warm in Malta all year round. </p><h2>  High season </h2><p>  The winter months in Malta are not cold, but not comfortable for passive relaxation.  The air temperature is kept at a mark no higher than +16 degrees, water in the sea - no higher than +15 ¬∞ C.  But this time of year is very suitable for active tourists who prefer to get acquainted with the sights of beach tranquility.  For example, in Malta in February, according to tourists, due to the lack of crowding, you can safely, without haste to inspect many architectural monuments and visit interesting places. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the first months of spring, the weather is still not much different from winter, it rains and the wind blows, but it is already getting warmer.  The temperature rises to +20 ... + 26 degrees, but the sea is still cool.  Although, according to tourist reviews, in April in Malta the most daring vacationers already go to the beach. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chevron.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta april reviews" class="if uuid-2310007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48915/2310007.jpg"></div><p>  The high season on the islands begins in May and lasts until the end of October.  The hottest months are July, August and September.  At this time, the sun constantly shines, the sky is cloudless, the sea is warm, and beach holidays are in full swing. </p><p>  The rainiest month of the year is November, although the air temperature remains high, +25 degrees. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists about Malta contain enthusiastic responses about the large number of historical, natural attractions and architectural monuments that are found here at every step. </p><p>  Of the natural beauties of Malta, beautiful cliffs, sea views, lagoons and bays are noteworthy.  For example, the Azure Window on the island of Gozo is a natural arch in the rocks, surprisingly harmonious and majestic.  This arch is most often seen in the photo in reviews of Malta.  Or the Spinolu Bay with a wonderful view of the sea and snow-white yachts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta holidays with children reviews" class="if uuid-2309997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48915/2309997.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists about Malta, historical artifacts from the Stone Age are always of great interest.  This is the Ghar-Dalam cave, where traces of the presence of ancient people are found, or the megalithic temple of Mnaidra, preserved almost in its original form. </p><p>  And, of course, architectural monuments occupy a worthy place in the list of island beauty.  There are many of them.  This is a fabulous medieval city-museum of Mdina and the airy and bright basilica of the Virgin Mary Ta-Pina, where the miraculous image of the Virgin Mary is stored.  This is the historical palace of Casa Ross Ross Piccolo and the palace of the Grand Master, which is currently the seat of the President and Parliament of Malta. </p><h2>  The best resorts </h2><p>  According to reviews, Malta is one continuous resort where you can relax everywhere.  Nevertheless, here you can choose a place to your liking and wallet.  The capital of the Republic of Valletta and the ancient Sliema are popular respectable resorts with well-developed infrastructure, crowded and noisy.  The calmer Aura and Bugibba are very beautiful and more affordable.  For fans of active and fiery recreation, the Pacheville area will be interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunshine.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta tourists reviews" class="if uuid-2309988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48915/2309988.jpg"></div><p>  Of special attention, according to reviews of holidays in Malta, the islands of Gozo and Comino are worthy.  Gozo is famous for its picturesque nature, excellent Mediterranean cuisine and beautiful architecture.  On the small Comino, nature has been preserved almost in its original form.  Fans of scuba diving, windsurfing and diving have a great time here.  The island is famous for the Blue Lagoon with clear water - the most beautiful place in the Maltese archipelago. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Most hotels are located on the island of Malta, Gozo has fewer hotels and prices are lower.  There is only one hotel on little Comino.  The infrastructure of hotels is diverse: from luxury five-star hotels to hostels and guest houses.  You can choose your hotel in Malta and a noisy youth company, and a family with children for a relaxing holiday.  Below is an overview of several hotels that are often highly rated in Malta travel reviews. </p><ul><li>  The five-star Hilton Hotel is one of the most popular destinations for a fashionable vacation.  The hotel provides all-inclusive services.  The hotel area is small, but there is a pool and access to the beach.  The Hilton is famous for its comfortable rooms with spacious balconies, verandas, with a gorgeous view of the sea.  It offers a tennis court, all kinds of water activities, a pool and a playground for children.  The level of service and staff training corresponds to the class of the hotel. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.holidaypirates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta beaches reviews" class="if uuid-2310019" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48915/2310019.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The 4-star San Antonio Hotel is owned by the well-known chain, which is famous for its spa centers.  "San Antonio" is located on the island of Gozo and is surrounded by beautiful nature.  The hotel does not have its own beach, but there are two beautiful pools, one of which is located on the roof.  San Antonio is also famous for its restaurant. </li><li>  Many reviews of Malta mention the Meridian Hotel, located in the bustling St. Julian's.  This popular fashionable place in the city center does not have its own large territory, but has a chic rooftop pool. </li></ul><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Malta's coastline is heavily indented, so there are many wonderful bays, lagoons and bays with clear azure water and beautiful beaches.  The natural beaches of the island are mostly rocky or pebble.  But there is no shortage of sandy beaches, most of them have artificial bulk cover.  Sand is found in a variety of colors: white, red, golden.  There are a lot of beaches on the islands of the archipelago, and you can easily choose a place to your liking. </p><p>  Not far from the city of Mellieha is the largest sandy beach of the island - Mellieha Bay.  This is a calm and quiet place where in shallow water it is good to spend time with children.  On the beach there are all kinds of water activities and the necessary service.  Another quiet place to relax is Paradise Bay.  A beach with amazingly clear water surrounded by beautiful nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="malta.intercontinental.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta photo reviews" class="if uuid-2309993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48915/2309993.jpg"></div><p>  Populous popular beaches are located in Pacheville, the center of the island‚Äôs nightlife.  For example, the beach of "St. George" with artificial sand cover has all the necessary infrastructure for a comfortable and varied outdoor activities.  Life here is in full swing around the clock.  Many tourists are attracted by white sand and excellent service "Pretti Bay" - one of the best beaches on the island. </p><p>  But Malta's most popular beach is, of course, Golden Bay.  It is always crowded, and there is everything you need for a comfortable stay. </p><p>  Tourists in their reviews of the beaches of Malta note such advantages and features of local recreation on the sea: a wide variety of beaches (wild, equipped, small, large, rocky, sandy, noisy, secluded), a clean and calm sea, the absence of dangerous marine inhabitants in coastal waters . </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  In addition to a beach holiday, Malta always has something to do.  Only a visit to all historical sights can take the whole vacation.  But you can still take a romantic walk in a chaise along the medieval Vallet during the day or hunt for ghosts at night.  Given that life in the capital freezes at night, the ghost hunt can turn into an exciting adventure. </p><p>  You must visit the village of Marsaxlokk with its huge fish market and immediately try the freshest lobster or octopus in local cafes.  In general, Maltese cuisine is a separate pleasure.  Here, Mediterranean cuisine has its own unique flavor, which is not found anywhere else.  For example, you can try pasta with octopus ink sauce. </p><p>  Advocates of outdoor activities will discover amazing diving in Malta, which is regularly included in the list of the best in the world.  Also, there are numerous thalassotherapy centers waiting for those who wish to improve their health and relieve stress. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dealchecker.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta february reviews" class="if uuid-2310021" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48915/2310021.jpg"></div><p>  And of course, the never-sleeping St. Julian's is waiting for lovers of rough rest at discos, casinos, night clubs and show programs. </p><p>  In fact, there are a lot of entertainment in Malta.  No wonder the island, despite its geographical location, is never associated exclusively with beach vacations. </p><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  For relaxation with young children, late spring or early autumn is best suited, when there is no strong heat and not so crowded.  Although Malta in June, according to tourists, is also good for a relaxing family vacation.  Many hotels on the island have children's play areas, swimming pools, special menus and entertainment.  You can rent an apartment that has its own kitchen and prepare your own meals for your child.  The cozy resort of Mellieha with a sandy beach and warm shallow water is ideal for such a holiday. </p><p>  Malta is a great place for teenagers to relax.  Firstly, the island is known worldwide as a center for learning English.  In particular, here you can combine relaxation with study in one of the children's summer camps.  In reviews of holidays with children in Malta, many parents note a high level and affordable training prices.  Secondly, from a cognitive point of view, Maltese history is priceless.  Thirdly, teenagers will be pleased with local diving and a variety of types of active water activities. </p><p>  Of course, all children without exception will enjoy trips to the zoo, water park, as well as to the fabulous village of Popaya.  Parents with children in reviews of Malta say that this place causes the greatest delight and impression among young tourists.  This village was once built as a backdrop for the shooting of the famous film.  When the film was shot, enterprising Maltese turned the settlement into a fabulous attraction. </p><h2>  Reviews and Tips </h2><p>  In the reviews of Malta, tourists primarily note the friendliness and openness of the locals.  But we must remember that, as in any warm Mediterranean country, no one is in a hurry here.  Therefore, having arrived in Malta, it is better to quickly enter this relaxed state, obey the special spa rhythm and enjoy the rest to the maximum. </p><p>  When going to the fabulous Malta, you need to take care of a visa, since the republic is a member of the European Union.  The island has rather strict customs control, so it is better to familiarize yourself with the rules in advance.  Malta is not included in the list of cheap resorts, but prices here are still lower than in many European countries.  Moving around the island is easier and cheaper by bus or even on foot due to the small size of the republic. </p><p>  In all hotels, the staff is English-speaking, but in some hotels with guests from our country they will speak Russian.  <span>The currency of Malta</span> is the euro. </p><p>  If you decide to spend a vacation in the Mediterranean, be sure to pay attention to these wonderful ancient islands, which have preserved their history, beauty and secrets that invariably attract travelers. </p>
