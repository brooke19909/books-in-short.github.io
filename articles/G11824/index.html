The capital of Russia is not an average city, so here the number of embankments exceeds ten.  And the coastline of <span>the Moscow River</span> is about 200 kilometers (including inflows and bays).  The embankment is not only a street near the river, but also a kind of ideology, which is also adopted in the capital. </p><h2>  List of embankments </h2><p>  Moscow is really famous for its architectural sights, including embankments.  Here is a list of them: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Name of the embankment </td><td>  Subway station </td></tr><tr><td>  Kremlin </td><td rowspan="2">  Borovitskaya </td></tr><tr><td>  Sofia </td></tr><tr><td>  Bersenevskaya </td><td>  Kropotkinskaya </td></tr><tr><td>  Cosmodamian </td><td>  Paveletskaya </td></tr><tr><td>  Raushskaya </td><td>  Novokuznetskaya </td></tr><tr><td>  Pushkinskaya </td><td>  Oktyabrskaya and Park Kultury </td></tr><tr><td>  Crimean </td><td>  "Park of Culture" </td></tr><tr><td>  Kadashevskaya </td><td>  Glade </td></tr><tr><td>  Ovchinnikovskaya </td><td>  Novokuznetskaya </td></tr><tr><td>  Derbenevskaya </td><td>  Paveletskaya </td></tr><tr><td>  Moskvoretskaya </td><td>  "China town" </td></tr><tr><td>  Presnenskaya </td><td>  "Exhibition" </td></tr><tr><td>  Kotelnicheskaya </td><td>  Taganskaya </td></tr><tr><td>  Nagatinskaya </td><td>  Nagatinskaya, Kolomenskaya </td></tr><tr><td>  Prechistenskaya </td><td>  Kropotkinskaya </td></tr><tr><td>  Frunze </td><td>  ‚ÄúPark of Culture‚Äù, ‚ÄúFrunzenskaya‚Äù </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Kremlin </h2><p>  This embankment is perhaps the leader among all in the center of Moscow.  It offers a beautiful view of the South wall of the Kremlin and Red Square, Vasilyevsky descent. </p><p>  It starts from Lenivka Street and ends on Vasilyevsky Descent.  This is the first embankment of the city, which was paved with stones.  In 1936, the inclined retaining walls were finished with granite, which has survived to this day.  The Alexandria Garden with the mouth <span>of the Neglinka River</span> and the Book Chamber overlook the embankment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="moscow.touristgems.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embankments of Moscow" class="if uuid-2236397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2236397.jpg"></div><h2>  Moskvoretskaya </h2><p>  It is located on the left bank of the Moscow river and is actually a continuation of the <span>Kremlin embankment.</span>  The street goes to Kotelnicheskaya embankment.  It is here that the remains of the walls of the ancient Kitay-Gorod are preserved.  And on the opposite side is Raushinskaya. </p><h2>  Sofia </h2><p>  This embankment of Moscow is located parallel to the Kremlin.  From here you can see the most recognizable sights of the capital: the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the Kremlin walls.  The embankment is located between the Bolshoy Moskoretsky Bridge and Serafimovich Street. </p><p>  This coastal zone has some of the most luxurious structures dating from the 17th-20th centuries.  This is the house of Lebedeva and Jacob Sivov, the bell tower of the church of Sofia the Wisdom of God. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embankments of Moscow: photos" class="if uuid-2236431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2236431.jpg"></div><h2>  Bersenevskaya </h2><p>  Located along the Yakimanka area, on the opposite side of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior.  This embankment of Moscow originates from the Bolshoi <span>Kamenny Bridge</span> and ends near the monument to Peter I. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are two theories of the origin of the name.  First: from the word "bersen", which means gooseberries.  The second - from the phrase "Bersnev lattice", which blocked the entrance at night to the embankment in the XVI century. </p><p>  There is a legend that back in the 90s of the last century, diggers discovered a notebook of the notorious boy Leva Fedotov called ‚ÄúHistory of the Future‚Äù under the quay in the catacombs, in which he predicted many facts confirmed to date, including the beginning and end of World War II. </p><h2>  Cosmodamian </h2><p>  It is located between two bridges: Shlyuzov and Bolshoi Ustyinsky.  The name was given in honor of the famous saints Cosmas and Domian in the XVI century.  The embankments in the center of Moscow are well-maintained, as comfortable as possible for long walks of residents and guests of the capital. </p><h2>  Raushskaya </h2><p>  Located between Baltschug Street and Bolshoi Ustyinsky Bridge.  It is here that the first power station of the capital, operating to the present, works.  There is a mark confirming the height of the water during the flood, which was in 1908 the largest in the city during the period of observing climate change.  Also on the waterfront is the first five-star hotel in Moscow - Baltschug. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.panoramio.com" data-author=": ordinarylawyer, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embankments in the center of Moscow" class="if uuid-2236454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2236454.jpg"></div><h2>  Pushkinskaya </h2><p>  This is the greenest embankment of Moscow.  Photos here are the most romantic.  Throughout the street, shady alleys and flower beds.  The embankment itself has two levels, the first is fenced by a low wall from the water, there are benches here.  And on the second tier there is a walking area.  It offers a magnificent view of the Pushkin and Crimean bridge. </p><h2>  Crimean </h2><p>  This street was made completely pedestrian only in 2013.  There are 4 zones: </p><ul><li>  territory under the Crimean bridge; </li><li>  Fountain Square; </li><li>  artists zone with the vernissage pavilion; </li><li>  Green Hills. </li></ul><h2>  Kadashevskaya </h2><p>  The street stretches from Bolshaya Polyanka to Pyatnitskaya Street and is assigned to the Drainage Canal.  The most significant attraction is the temple of the Resurrection. </p><h2>  Marsh </h2><p>  It is famous for its "trees of love", which the newlyweds come to, and is located on the left bank of the Vodootvodny Canal.  There is also an unofficial gathering place for informals, from punks to poisters.  Beginning: the western arrow of the island, between the Drainage Canal and the Moscow River, ends near the Small Moscow crossing. </p><h2>  Ovchinnikovskaya </h2><p>  This embankment of Moscow is small, located between Pyatnitskaya street and Runovsky lane.  It is famous for the architectural buildings of the XVII-XVIII centuries. </p><h2>  Derbenevskaya </h2><p>  It is located between the <span>Novospassky bridge</span> and the first Paveletsky passage.  Quite a long promenade - 1300 meters.  There are practically no attractions here and business centers are mainly located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embankments of Moscow: a list" class="if uuid-2236443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2236443.jpg"></div><h2>  Kotelnicheskaya </h2><p>  The embankment is 2.5 kilometers long, and got its name from the former Kotelnicheskaya Sloboda.  It was built only in 1870, but immediately paved with cobblestones. </p><p>  Naturally, this is not a complete list of embankments in the capital.  Since 2015, the My Street program has been launched in Moscow, under which more than a hundred streets have already been landscaped and thousands of trees planted.  The program provides for the reconstruction of 12 embankments with a total length of 40 kilometers.  And from 4 you get a whole arc along which you can go directly: Krasnopresnenskaya - Smolenskaya - Rostov - Savvinskaya.  The embankments of Moscow are a visiting card of the city and a comfortable urban environment. </p>
