Two manufacturing options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modeling is very useful for the development of fine motor skills of hands and fingers.  Fumbling plastic mass in hands, a person calms nerves.  All children love to work with plasticine, because this is a creative lesson.  Crafts from this material are not difficult to create, and if something does not work out the first time, you can always crush a piece and blind an object again.  Plasticine work can be located on a sheet of cardboard, but can be voluminous. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make a rose from plasticine.  At first glance at this beloved flower, it seems that creating such beauty is incredibly difficult, but in fact it is not at all.  There are two main ways to create a rose.  Firstly, they create crafts from numerous small details.  These are petals, which are made either in the shape of a circle, or with pointed tips.  Secondly, a flower is collected from a long strip, rolled out on a plastic wrap with a special rolling pin for plasticine.  Further in the article we will consider in more detail how to make a rose from plasticine using these methods. </p><h2>  Flower of circles </h2><p>  Before starting any work with plasticine, you need to thoroughly knead the material and warm it in your hands.  It is then that the plastic mass becomes usable.  After you have chosen the color necessary for the flower, you need to cut a piece of several identical parts.  The more details, the more magnificent the flower will turn out.  Each piece is subsequently rolled into a ball in his hands.  Then the rolled-up element by pressing the bottom of the palm of your hand turns into a "pancake".  Crushed circles are placed on a plank for modeling in an even row.  They are located with a slight overlap, overlapping a little less than half of the next petal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="elementaryartfun.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sculpt a rose" class="if uuid-2379111" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2379111.jpg"></div><p>  To prevent the craft from sticking to the base, it is recommended to spread the plastic wrap on the board. </p><h2>  Continuation of work </h2><p>  Then work is done on the first inner lobe.  It is made from the smallest circle by rolling into a tube with a pointed tip.  Then the middle is laid out on the first petal and the winding begins. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.playingwithflowers.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a rose from plasticine" class="if uuid-2379106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2379106.jpg"></div><p>  The photo above shows how to make a rose from plasticine in this way.  Thus, a flower is obtained in the phase of a half-opened bud.  All petals are the same size, and the rose has the shape of a cylinder.  It remains to fasten the petals from the bottom and attach the sepals and stalk. </p><h2>  Petal Expansion </h2><p>  How to make a rose from plasticine with your own hands, so that it is open, read on in the article.  To create a flower like in the photo below, the prepared circles must be of different sizes and shapes.  For the central part, according to the instructions described above, you can create balls first, and then flatten your palm in equal circles.  For large side lobes, you need to use a large amount of plasticine and make larger balls.  Then they are also flattened by squeezing the palms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plasticine rose" class="if uuid-2379115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2379115.jpg"></div><p>  However, there is a different way of fixing the parts together when assembling the flower.  Initially, the middle is twisted, but the remaining petals are attached separately.  Each in turn is attached to the bottom of the craft by pressing with your fingers.  Each subsequent petal is located with a shift.  They can be located either next to each other, or with a small overlap.  In each subsequent row, the number of elements increases.  The extreme petals are the largest.  Their edges are pointed in the central region.  Looks nice petals that are slightly bent in the middle. </p><h2>  Rose Tools </h2><p>  How to make a rose from plasticine in stages, it can be clearly seen in the next photo in the article.  This version of the craft is a three-dimensional flower worn on a wire.  To middle of the rose firmly sitting on the end, use pliers.  They clamp the edge, and the wire is bent by a loop.  Then, from the clay, the inside of the rose is created.  It is molded from a rolled ball by stretching one of its ends.  The shape resembles a carrot, only a small size.  Let's consider further how to make a rose from plasticine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="step-by-step modeling of a rose" class="if uuid-2379162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2379162.jpg"></div><p>  To cut all the circles of the same size, use a rolling pin, with which the plastic mass is rolled into a thin sheet.  Then, with a mold, identical details of future petals are squeezed out.  Further, a plastic knitting needle with a round tip on one side is useful.  The circle of the petal is bent by the sharp end of the needle around the perimeter.  A bulge is pressed into the bottom of the petal bulge.  This creates the shape of a real petal, which is attached to the bottom of the flower. </p><p>  Cut a thick layer of plasticine, formed by applying in one place a lot of petals, sharp scissors.  It remains to roll out a thin layer of green plasticine and squeeze the sepals with a mold. </p><h2>  Making roses from a strip </h2><p>  Let's consider one more option, how to make a rose from plasticine by rolling a long wavy strip.  First, a thin strip rolls on a plate with a rolling pin.  A wavy line is cut from one side of it.  This can be done with either a sharp stack or a special corrugated ruler, as in the photo in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plasticine modeling of roses" class="if uuid-2379125" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2379125.jpg"></div><p>  The middle of the flower is folded into a tube from a semicircle, then the edge of the strip is attached and winding begins.  Plasticine is pressed from the bottom of the craft.  It remains to create leaves, and a beautiful flower is ready! </p><p>  From the article you learned two of the most popular methods for making roses from plasticine.  Try to do the described work yourself.  Good luck </p>
