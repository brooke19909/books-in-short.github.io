    <p>  The company helps in difficult situations that may arise on the road.  Drivers do not have to decide where to take the car for repair after an accident.  Employees will choose the most convenient options.  Typically, a policy is issued when buying a vehicle on credit, so its high cost will not be very noticeable. </p><h2>  Loss compensation </h2><p>  In the event of an insured event, VTB Insurance will compensate for losses.  The CASCO policy includes the agreed amount, terms of reimbursement, limits and the procedure for performing the payment procedure.  The amount of payment in an accident can be of two types: unchanged or reduced at each incident.  Depending on the conditions, the driver may receive it once or several. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The company negotiates a limit with the client, which may be: </p><ol><li>  Unchanging.  With each insurance event, compensation will be the same. </li><li>  Single.  Whatever the number of accidents, the payment will be one, and it is assigned after the first damage to the car. </li><li>  Dynamic.  Amounts are paid after each case, but are reduced with each situation. </li></ol><h2>  Damage and settlement procedure </h2><p>  The company has the same CASCO rules for all customers.  VTB Insurance pays compensation with or without depreciation.  All information is entered into the contract, which affects the final price of the policy. </p><p>  The document must contain a clause when the machine cannot be repaired.  Constructive death occurs when damaged with more than 75% of all transport elements.  The company will not pay for repairs, but will indemnify for the complete loss of property. </p><p>  According to the rules, the client must notify the insurer within 24 hours.  This is done orally by telephone.  You can also write a letter to the insurance company and send it within 5 days.  The due date is 15 working days. </p><h2>  Car theft </h2><p>  VTB 24 Insurance also protects against car theft.  CASCO allows you to receive compensation.  Payment is transferred to the client no later than 30 days later.  The insured person must be informed about the event within 24 hours by telephone or 48 hours in writing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  There is a list of damages that are not compensated.  For example, if the car was scratched during towing or there was spontaneous combustion of individual elements of the car.  If defects are received in the parking lot due to poor-quality roads or during the evacuation of vehicles, the client has the right to claim damages. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Services are available in many companies.  But special conditions are offered by VTB Insurance.  CASCO from this company involves the participation of customers in various promotions, receiving discounts if the policy is ordered repeatedly and there was no accident. </p><p>  There are numerous reviews of VTB Insurance.  CASCO of this company provides other benefits.  You can buy an installment policy.  But with the advent of the insured event, first you need to fully pay the insurance, and then qualify for payments.  When preparing a document, you can choose to compensate for damage without taking into account the natural wear of machine parts.  VTB24 has no storage requirements for the machine, therefore this is not taken into account when paying compensation.  Transfer of funds is carried out without a long paperwork. </p><h2>  Fail-Safe Benefits </h2><p>  CASCO "VTB Insurance" is beneficial to issue regular customers who have been using the services for more than one year.  If there was no accident and the driver carefully controls the car, the company provides him with discounts with each new design.  But this advantage will not apply if the client has been involved in an accident more than once in 1 year. </p>

    <p>  This condition is valid to protect the institution providing insurance against unreliable customers.  These include citizens who are unprofitable to issue policies.  If a car loan is taken, then this condition will be relevant. </p><h2>  Policy registration </h2><p>  VTB Insurance calculates CASCO on the basis of several factors: </p><ol><li>  Region of residence. </li><li>  Type of transport - year of manufacture, make, model. </li><li>  Customer status. </li><li>  Additional equipment located in the car. </li><li>  Price of the insured property. </li><li>  The number of drivers who can drive vehicles. </li><li>  Types of insurance risks. </li><li>  Currency to pay out. </li><li>  Payment order. </li><li>  Duration of the policy. </li><li>  Additional risks. </li></ol><h2>  Risk insurance </h2><p>  The company offers customers additional protection with the occurrence of insured events.  You can insure property that is present during an accident inside the car for up to 30 thousand rubles. </p><p>  VTB Insurance protects the customers budget.  For example, if an accident occurred due to the fault of the driver himself, and he was sued, the company pays up to 10 million rubles.  The specific amount is determined by the terms of the contract. </p><p>  The company provides compensation for injuries in road accidents - up to 2.5 million rubles, and also reimburses the cost of legal services if criminal cases are opened. </p><h2>  When is no compensation provided? </h2><p>  There are a number of cases that are not compensated by the company, since they are not regarded as insurance risks.  These include: </p><ol><li>  Using faulty vehicles. </li><li>  Use of the car in competitions or other similar events. </li><li>  Auto is used as a training vehicle without the consent of the insurer. </li><li>  The car is rented, rented, leased without approval. </li><li>  Re-equipment of transport. </li><li>  If the driver drives a car in a state of intoxication. </li><li>  In case of violation of fire safety rules. </li></ol><p>  In these cases, even if the client applies for compensation, the company will reject it. </p><h2>  Car loan VTB24 and CASCO </h2><p>  Some motorists believe that the policy is expensive and takes a long time to complete, but you want to buy a vehicle.  For such cases, there is a car loan in which the cost of hull insurance is included in the price of the car. </p>

    <p>  This is the project "VTB24" and LIFAN.  Credit rate starts from 7.3%.  Insurance will cost 0.3% of the loan.  Detailed conditions for registration and programs can be found in the showroom. </p><h2>  CASCO loan </h2><p>  The client has the right to obtain a new loan and to prolong the expired CASCO insurance policy at VTB.  Then, in case of an accident, the loan debt is fully paid. </p><p>  The term of insurance must be no more than 7 years.  Usually it is equal to the period of validity of the loan agreement, but only on the condition that during this period the age of the machine will not be more than 10 years.
