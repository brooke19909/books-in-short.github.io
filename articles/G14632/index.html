This is no coincidence.  There is clear water, a comfortable climate, magnificent sandy beaches, fabulous nature, good food, excellent service.  This is a real paradise on the coast of the Indian Ocean.  Goa is a favorite place in the southwestern part of India.  This place is chosen by many for winter holidays, and some here even celebrate the New Year.  At this time, Goa has a real velvet season. </p><p>  The article presents a story about a fabulous place - Goa: the best beaches, attractions, reviews of tourists, etc. Here you can find out where it costs (according to many tourists) to visit the resort during your vacation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.noisyradicals.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.noisyradicals.com/2018/02/23/9-serene-secret-beaches-goa/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resorts Goa" class="if uuid-2474379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2474379.jpg"></div><h2>  General information about resorts in India </h2><p>  Indian resorts around the world are famous for their unique natural landscapes, historical architectural monuments, picturesque reserves and ancient settlements.  Therefore, during a beach holiday, you should certainly take part in some sightseeing tours. </p><p>  Goa's attractions are especially attractive.  Excursions with a general overview of the state acquaint with the history of its occurrence, with a multifaceted culture and legends.  Walks to the famous <span>Hindu temples</span> and architectural monuments, as well as trips to numerous metropolitan shops - all this is included in the program of most routes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Goa is not a typical tourist destination.  It does not (and never has) a large number of tourist buses.  Previously, people came here more on their own.  Today there is an increase in the number of tourists, and tour operators and small private companies distributing their advertising leaflets directly on the beaches are organizing excursions. </p><h2>  Description of Goa </h2><p>  There are 29 states in India.  Goa is one of the smallest, but it is also the most popular among travelers.  Sunbathers, families with children, avid amateurs of entertainment, as well as supporters of spiritual enlightenment, are resting here. </p><p>  The beaches of Goa are also magnificent.  The best of them are a wonderful natural attraction.  What could be more beautiful than sunset with a fiery disk extending beyond the ocean?  But travel programs are not limited to this.  Especially interesting in terms of excursions Old Goa (Old Goa).  When you are at the bus station in the capital - Panaji, it becomes somehow uncomfortable: a crowd of people, a huge variety of different vehicles.  Bus conductors rush about, waving their hands and shouting the names of the settlements where the shuttle buses go.  Old Goa is a 20-minute drive away from the capital. </p><p>  Old Goa was the state capital almost until the beginning of the 20th century; it was a center of shipbuilding and trade.  And today it is the center of Catholicism in the state, where almost 1/3 of the population is Catholics.  Many churches are periodically restored, and some of the existing services are held, attracting a huge number of believers from all over the region. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Se_Cathedral"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral of St. Catherine" class="if uuid-2474547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2474547.jpg"></div><p>  On the square of Old Goa (photo presented in the article) is the Cathedral of St. Catherine.  This is a huge gothic temple.  There is also the church of St. Francis of Assisi and several museums.  In the rooms of these ancient buildings you can feel the breath of the Middle Ages. </p><h2>  Panaji </h2><p>  The state capital is a small and very cozy city.  For walks it is better to use a map with pre-selected and marked attractions.  The most interesting places are the state museum and the park named after  Garc√≠a de Horta (Indian scholar), Church of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary, old quarters (mostly with Portuguese architecture) and the Science Center.  You can also take the opportunity to relax on the river tram or on the boat, where youth discos are held in the evenings. </p><p>  Many visit Panaji for shopping.  The city has inexpensive bazaars and markets where you can buy goods at very attractive prices.  You can also visit small shops of world famous brands: Levi's, Nike, Adidas, Wrangler, etc.  They sell the highest quality goods, the cost of which is much lower than in Russia.  This is due to the fact that many factories for the production of branded clothing are located in India. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Further, the article presents the most sought after by tourists and the most beautiful places of Goa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.facts4u.co.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital of goa" class="if uuid-2474383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2474383.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The most popular excursions to Goa are a trip to a spice plantation, to Dudhsagar (waterfall), to Salim Ali (bird sanctuary), to Panaji and to Old Goa. </p><p>  Often there are combined excursions, the route of which includes visits to several attractions.  Programs that include relaxing on the beach (for example, the Goa Pearl program), combined with visits to historical and other interesting places, are also popular. </p><h2>  Spice Plantation in Goa </h2><p>  There are several similar plantations in Goa.  On one of them you can visit a kind of ‚Äúelephant shower‚Äù - they put a tourist on an elephant standing knee-deep in a pond.  An animal pours water on a rider several times from its trunk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bitesandplaces.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spice plantation" class="if uuid-2474521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2474521.jpg"></div><p>  Spice plantation - an original nature reserve, which is the territory where a variety of plant species grow.  Some of them do not grow in the wild of India.  Here you can see with your own eyes such plants as cloves, cinnamon, coconut, banana, as well as many others.  The excursion program includes an open-air lunch and a tasting of local moonshine made from cashew fruits.  It should be noted that almost all dishes are quite spicy, but very tasty. </p><p>  Tourists in these places are especially attracted by the beauty of wildlife and fascinating stories of guides about the history of plants. </p><h2>  Dudhsagar Waterfall </h2><p>  This amazing natural wonder is located in Goa (photo below in the article).  It is located on the border with the state of Karnataka.  From the village of Kolem, the path to the waterfall begins.  First, a rocky mountain road is crossed in jeeps.  At the very end of a small section of the path you have to walk.  In just an hour, the tour continues around the waterfall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cornersofearth.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dudhsagar Waterfall" class="if uuid-2474528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2474528.jpg"></div><p>  The height of the waterfall is 310 meters.  At the foot is a cold fresh lake.  A unique feature is the unusual milky color of water.  In the vicinity there are different types of wild animals and funny tame monkeys.  They allow themselves to be fed bananas, cookies and tomatoes, purchased from local merchants.  In the lake with clear cold water you can swim, especially since it is considered healing.  The waterfall itself and its surroundings amaze the imagination with its picturesque. </p><h2>  Crocodile Ride </h2><p>  The most interesting excursion tour is "Meet Crocodiles."  This is a very exciting and rich in unforgettable impressions walk.  Tourists are taken to the place by boat.  The path leads to the mangroves of local rivers, where these terrible reptiles are found. </p><p>  From the boat you can watch how crocodiles bask in the sun and swim.  You can also see small fearful crocodile cubs who immediately hide under the water at the sight of people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="carambolimwild.blogspot.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://carambolimwild.blogspot.ru/2014/08/the-boss-gang-of-lake.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crocodiles goa" class="if uuid-2474540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2474540.jpg"></div><h2>  Other interesting places </h2><p>  Goa is interesting (the photo shows this) with both natural and historical sights.  Positive feedback from tourists is also associated with the following places of interest: </p><ol><li>  Arippa is a national reserve.  Stunning picturesque nature and exotic species of animals encountered on the way, amaze and charge with a positive mood. </li><li>  Hampi is the oldest Hindu city.  The Lotus Palace, symbols of the gods, a stone chariot and much more - all this is difficult to see in one day. </li><li>  Murdeshwar is a fishing village, which is a unique sculptural complex.  Here you can see beautiful towers and statues, as well as a magnificent granite temple. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://travelask.ru/india/hampi"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lotus palace" class="if uuid-2474545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2474545.jpg"></div><h2>  Tours in India </h2><p>  From Goa (photo in the article) you can take a sightseeing trip to the neighboring states of India: to Karnataka, to the town of Hampi (the former capital of the Indian Empire Vijayanagar).  They can also be reached on their own, using a slipper bass (a bus with recumbent seats) or a train. </p><p>  Excursions in Delhi and Mumbai are also popular, but they last for several days, since the distances are significant, sometimes you even have to use an airplane. </p><p>  The most common modes of transport are taxis and shuttle buses. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Goa fell in love with many tourists.  According to their positive reviews, you must visit the following excursions: </p><ul><li>  a walk to the Dudhsagar Falls; </li><li>  state survey; </li><li>  a trip to the jungle; </li><li>  trip to crocodiles; </li><li>  visiting a spice plantation, etc. </li></ul><p>  The general impression of the tourists who visited Goa: excellent climate, excellent beach, delicious food, rich and interesting excursions, interesting culture, low prices, friendly people.  During relaxation, a feeling of bliss and happiness is present.  Two minuses noted in the reviews: the tangible poverty of local residents and a large amount of garbage.  Many note that it is best to know the flavor of the Indian people by traveling on their own. </p><p>  When is it better to go on a vacation to Goa?  The month of December is the peak of the tourist season.  This time is perfect for sunbathing and swimming, as well as for active water sports.  You can visit the sights of Goa.  Also impeccable is a vacation in January-February.  The sky is always clear, and the sun gives a gorgeous tan.  Water at this time warms up to +26 degrees. </p><p>  In May, rains begin, and they end in September.  In November, there are 3-5 rainy days, and in December, rainfall is so rare that sometimes you have to dream about it under the hot sun.  In these months, the temperature reaches +40 degrees.  Only in the evening the air can cool to +21 degrees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="goaholidayguide.blogspot.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://goaholidayguide.blogspot.com/2013/12/panaji-vasco-and-velha-take-your-pick.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Panaji" class="if uuid-2474386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2474386.jpg"></div><h2>  About the time </h2><p>  For Moscow tourists who have chosen these places for relaxation, at first it is difficult to adapt to local time. </p><p>  It is important to note that in relation to Moscow, the time difference with India (Goa) is 2.5 hours.  At a time when dawn in Goa, the capital of Russia is still a dark night.  The Russian regions closer in time zones to Goa have a time difference of only 30 minutes.  But Kaliningraders were the least fortunate - in Goa, local time is 3.5 hours ahead. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The approximate cost of a trip for two in Goa for today is from 52,000 rubles.  The final price depends on the season and the number of days. </p><p>  Having at least some ideas about the most popular places in Indian resort areas, you can safely go on a trip for the most positive and vivid impressions.  It is worth seeing the colorful nature of India and its magnificent sights. </p><p>  With the development of an organized tourist flow, the state of Goa acquires all the signs of a civilized beach resort.  All-inclusive hotels are appearing (South Goa), exciting new excursion routes are being created, prices are rising, etc. But if you leave the resort area just a few steps, you can immediately find yourself in real India with crowded public transport and colorful markets.  And in the depths of the state you can generally visit the real jungle, where the real life of the Indian people is visible. </p><p>  Goa has it all: endless and deserted beaches in the southern part of the state, the tourist crowd of Calangute, the Catholic Old Goa and Panaji with a Portuguese look. </p>
