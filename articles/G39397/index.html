    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  First of all, I would like to note the attractive appearance of the hotel complex.  This chic building immediately catches your eye and attracts attention.  And, I must say, in this case, the appearance is not deceiving - inside the hotel is decorated in the same stylish and beautiful way.  It is really nice to be in such a place.  The hotel administration took care of creating the most comfortable conditions, both for leisure and for official meetings.  The hotel territory is well-groomed, clean, it is decorated with shady palm trees and a spacious pool in which guests can swim at any time or sunbathe nearby, on the terrace.  By the way, one more pleasant moment should be noted - this complex is located on the seashore, and the windows of the hotel rooms offer simply stunning views.  In principle, the hotel is in a rather favorable location, because next to it there is everything you need - various taverns, shops and much more, recommended for visiting. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Rest for the soul </h2><p>  I want to say that St.  George Hotel 4 * is not just a hotel where people stay to spend the night.  This is a truly full-fledged hotel complex with all the conditions that are needed for both leisure and entertainment.  For example, the hotel offers a huge selection of bars and restaurants of various formats.  Guests can drink aromatic coffee alone in a cozy cafe or take part in an incendiary dance program.  Organizers working at the hotel always offer interesting and non-standard events.  All guests staying at St.  George Hotel 4 *, left with a lot of impressions left by local shows.  About institutions should say a little more.  People sitting at tables in the restaurant can enjoy stunning views of the sea.  Only the best cocktails are served in the pool bar - any connoisseur of strong and weak drinks will find the one that he will like.  And, of course, it is worth noting the attention of the amphitheater, because there are twice a day there are various dance shows and musical performances. </p>

    <h2>  Sights and cultural heritage </h2><p>  People who like various archaeological <span>finds, sights</span> and much more will definitely be delighted when staying at the St.  George.  A five-minute walk separates guests from the stunning harbor of Paphos.  You can not ignore the church of St.  George Chapel, which is the most important historical monument.  By the way, it was she who was guided by the designers who developed the architectural plan of the hotel.  The complex itself is located between the picturesque hills and the Mediterranean Sea.  The hotel looks like a blooming garden - most of it is occupied by tall trees.  Museums, exhibitions, monuments, ancient architecture - all this is just a stone's throw from the hotel.  Certainly, while staying here on vacation, one cannot fail to devote at least one day to exploring local attractions.  By the way, the hotel even has a service for organizing excursions and hiking - this is especially true for those people who are poorly oriented in other cities, but want to enjoy the surroundings. </p><h2>  For body and soul </h2><p>  Girls who like to take care of themselves and cannot imagine life without cosmetic procedures will enjoy spending time in the spa.  In St.  George Hotel SPA 4 * has a professional beauty salon, which offers to go through a variety of procedures.  These are face masks, pedicures and manicures, instant tans.  You can combine business with pleasure and undergo procedures that help improve vision.  If you want to change something in yourself, then professional hairdressers will help with this.  By the way, girls can even undergo thalassotherapy, offered here, or sign up for yoga.  And finally, I would like to note that the hotel also has a fitness center.  Based on all of the above, it is safe to say that a good rest is possible even if guests do not want to leave the territory of the hotel complex. </p><h2>  Service and Facilities </h2><p>  The staff that serves guests is distinguished by friendliness, friendliness and understanding.  This is important, because the quality of rest depends on how the hotel treats its guests.  Here, guests can offer a variety of services, from early registration to the provision of individual services.  The hotel administration made sure that the guests did not worry about anything, and arranged parking at the hotel - especially for those people who do not part with the "iron horse" even on vacation.  The complex also has dry cleaning and laundry services, a point where you can exchange currency, car rental, as well as fax and mail.  A couple of words I want to say about room service - cleaning is regularly carried out and bed linen is changed.  All at the highest level. </p>

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  People who came to Paphos and stayed at this place were satisfied with the St.  George Hotel 4 *.  Reviews, at least, are direct proof of this.  Some even claim that the hotel matches all five stars.  First of all, the hotel staff is noted - friendly and polite, always ready to help in solving questions or problems.  Also, guests praise local dishes and drinks on offer - everything is tasty, high-quality and in large quantities.  The guests liked the rooms - clean, neat, bright.  They have everything you need to relax.  All in all, it is an ideal place for those people who love comfort and luxury.  And finally, it is worth noting the most important thing - the cost.  For a hotel of this level, it is very small.  For example, a luxurious Internet Rate with all conveniences will cost two people 66 euros per day.  If we summarize all the many reviews left by guests, then we can say something like the following:  George Hotels - this is an excellent cuisine, excellent service, first-class bars and restaurants, a huge selection of classes for various interests, and all this at an affordable price. </p><h2>  Bulgarian counterpart </h2>

    <p>  There is another hotel with the same name - St.  George Hotel Pomorie 4 *.  A complex located in Cyprus is often confused with this hotel due to its similarity.  If we talk about this hotel, it should be noted that it is not inferior to Greek in level, only here people go for a different purpose.  This is a four-star hotel located in a ski resort called Bansko.  It features an indoor pool, a picturesque garden, a lift shuttle service and free parking.  Spa-salon, infrared and aromatic sauna, mineral water pool, warm relaxation rooms - all this is here.  The hotel is a great place where you can not only relax, but also improve your health.  If you want to relax, you can go to the massage room or to cosmetic procedures using the best French cosmetics. </p><p>  A few words are worth mentioning about the accommodation - the rooms of the hotel St.  George Hotel Pomorie 4 * is furnished with new wooden furniture, comfortable beds, a TV, equipped with wired Internet (Wi-Fi is also available), a spacious bathroom and even a kitchenette.  The apartment has everything from a hairdryer to slippers and coffee makers.  In general, the level in both hotels is really worthy of respect.  Only here people go to Greece to enjoy the warmth and sea, and the hotel St.  George Hotel 4 * (Bulgaria) accepts guests who wish to be tempered and improve their health. </p>
