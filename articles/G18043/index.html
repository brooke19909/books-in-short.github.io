They arose as a way of depicting deities, supernatural and ordinary phenomena in the life of a people.  Most often, the symbols were directly related to religion, with the help of which the bearers of a particular culture cognized and explained the world around them.  Intricate images were used in various rituals.  Many of them were unraveled by historians and archaeologists only after lengthy research. </p><h2>  Ancient Slavs </h2><p>  They are known for their love of various images.  Ancient symbols of this people can be found on a vast territory from the Volga to Germany and the Balkans.  Even before it was divided into tribal unions and groups, common drawings appeared in everyday life.  This is including the symbols of Ancient Russia. </p><p>  Of great importance in the images played by the Sun.  There were several signs for him.  For example, it was a carol.  It was worn mainly by men who wanted to thus gain wisdom in battle and in everyday life.  The God of Kolyada was responsible in the Slavic worldview for the constant renewal of the world and the victory of light over darkness. </p><p>  The same grass was used as a talisman from evil lower spirits.  She was worn on clothes, armor, weapons, etc. The symbols of the ancient Slavs included the arbiter.  It was a sign of a warrior, for whom the most important was courage, courage and honor.  It was believed that the arbiter would bestow these qualities on anyone who sincerely and passionately loves his homeland and home.  Most often, he was portrayed using engraving - an art in which the Slavs knew a lot.  Like many other ancient symbols, the arbiter was a solar sign, a bit like the Sun.  In this series, the swastika, which denotes the eternal cycle of the Universe, stands out especially.  The man who wore it recognized his allegiance to the higher forces of nature. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The symbols of the ancient Slavs were identified with the family - the smallest unit of any society.  It was a wedding, meaning the fusion of the body, soul, conscience and spirit of those who enter into a marital union. </p>

    <h2>  Symbols of the elements of the Slavs </h2><p>  Many ancient symbols came from the tradition of worshiping fire as the greatest element.  There are several of them.  Yarovrat was worn by worshipers of God Yaro, who, with the help of the forces of fire, controlled the weather, which meant that he also managed the harvest.  Therefore, those who wanted to get a large number of cultures used this sign.  Dukhobor also symbolized fire, but only internal fire.  It was a sign of the flame of life.  If a person fell ill in a tribe, they covered him with bandages with Dukhobor.  Thunderstorm helped protect temples and houses from the weather, thunderstorms, storms and other disasters. </p><p>  The symbol of the earth among the ancient Slavs is a solard.  The soil was also associated with the cult of motherhood, which was practiced by some tribes.  The prosperity of the earth meant a steady growth of food and a satisfying life of the family. </p><h2>  Runic alphabet </h2><p>  The Scandinavian runes were used by numerous Germanic tribes.  They had a developed mythology with their unique images associated with the harsh living conditions of this people.  The runes were not only symbols, but also written signs.  They were applied to stones to convey a particular message.  They wrote epic sagas telling about the history and myths of the Germans. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, each sign, if considered separately, also had its own meaning.  The runic alphabet consists of 24 runes, divided into three rows of 8 in each.  About 5 thousand surviving inscriptions in this amazing language have been found in the world.  Most of these artifacts are found in Sweden. </p>

    <h2>  Rune examples </h2><p>  The first rune, Fehu, meant livestock, and in the broad sense - any personal property of a German.  Uruz symbolized a bull or a bison.  Thus, the difference between the first and second signs was that in one case it was a pet, and in the second it was wild and free. </p><p>  Turisaz designated the sharp thorn or hammer of Thor - one of the main gods of the German pantheon.  It was used to ensure that the wearer had good luck, as well as protection from hostile forces.  Ansuz is an image of open mouth, that is, a cue or said wisdom.  In addition, this is a sign of caution, as the Scandinavian peoples believed that an intelligent person would never be reckless. </p><p>  A raido is a wagon or a journey that awaits a wanderer.  The ancient symbols and their meaning among the Germans often had a double meaning.  Kenaz is a sign of fire.  But this flame is friendly.  Most often, such a fire signified a torch that would warm a person and give him a sense of comfort and homeliness. </p><p>  The next two runes symbolize joy.  Gebo is a gift and generosity.  He was portrayed as a sign of good intentions.  If the runes were used in fortune telling, then the Gebo that fell out was a great success for a man who had a pleasant surprise in the future.  Ancient signs and symbols even now often become material for occult services of neopagans.  Vunyo means joy.  It was often used in conjunction with Gebo.  If it was written next to another rune, then this meant success or luck in the sphere, which was symbolized by the neighboring sign.  For example, Wunyo and Fehu were an omen of a large increase in livestock. </p><p>  Some runes were synonymous with <span>natural elements,</span> their presence can be found in almost all peoples and cultures.  For example, Laguz is a symbol of water, a lake, or even intuition in a figurative meaning. </p>

    <h2>  Runic writing development </h2><p>  Interestingly, over time, the common runes broke up into several versions of the alphabet for different peoples, from the borders of the Roman Empire to the extreme polar north of Norway.  The most common is the so-called Praskandinavian version, from which all subsequent ones went.  It was used until the VIII century AD, which corresponds to the Iron Age in these territories.  Most often, such runes are found on ancient weapons, armor and roadside stones.  Such symbols were used in magical and religious rites in the future.  Sacred and memorial inscriptions are still found in necropolises and thickets. </p><p>  In Eastern Europe, Gothic runes brought here from Scandinavia became widespread.  They can be found even in Ukraine and in Romania.  After some Germans settled in the British Isles, they had their own variation of this writing.  This was due to isolation from the former homeland and assimilation with the ‚Äúnatives‚Äù - the Angles, Saxons, etc. They had new runes, many of which began to denote double sounds in writing (linguists call them diphthongs).  Such are preserved even in modern German. </p><p>  <span>Icelandic runes</span> are considered a special exotic <span>.</span>  They appeared on a distant island, which was then considered the northwestern edge of the world.  They are characterized by the use of dashed lines.  These runes were in use until the XIV century.  As for the Scandinavian signs, they disappeared with the advent of Christianity in the kingdoms of Sweden, Norway and Denmark.  The use of runes was considered heresy and severely punished by the authorities. </p>

    <h2>  Ancient Egypt </h2><p>  One of the most famous symbols of Ancient Egypt is Ankh.  This is a cross that is crowned with a ring on top.  He symbolized life and eternity.  There are also interpretations of the cross and the ring as signs of the rising sun, the connection of male and female principles.  Ankh was used in burial rituals, as the Egyptians believed that a person buried with Ankh in the sarcophagus would receive an eternal afterlife. </p><p>  In everyday life, a rounded cross also signified prosperity and happiness.  He was often carried with him as a talisman and a talisman for good luck.  Ankh was used to protect against dark magic.  In addition, his images were even found on the walls of river channels.  The Egyptians were very dependent on how the Nile spilled, what the crop would be.  That is why the Ankh was painted inside the canal so that no disaster would happen to him, and the natural elements remained friendly to the inhabitants. </p><p>  It is curious that after the ancient Egyptian culture went into oblivion, Ankh managed to survive.  For some time, ancient culture triumphed on the banks of the Nile, and later Islam came.  But even in the first centuries of our era Christians appeared here, who founded their Coptic community.  It was they who adopted Ankh because of its external resemblance to the cross. </p>

    <h2>  Eye of Horus </h2><p>  Another important Egyptian symbol is the all-seeing eye.  The image of the painted eye is a reference to the god Horus, who is the master of heaven.  The spiral, which was drawn under the eye, meant the eternal movement of energy.  This symbol was often used as a talisman against troubles and evil spirits. </p><p>  In Egyptian mythology there is a story about the battle of Horus and Seth.  This is a common metaphor for the struggle between good and evil.  Since Horus was the personification of all the light, healers and priests began to use his sign in order to treat the sick and injured in battles.  The Egyptians also developed mathematics.  The Eye of Horus found its application here - it denoted a fraction. </p><h2>  Scarabs and Isis </h2><p>  Another popular symbol of ancient Egypt is the scarab.  Beetles that lived in manure and sculpted balls out of it represented hard work.  In addition, they were associated with the god of the Sun - Ra, who, like insects, moved this light source every day.  Scarabs were popular talismans, seals and even medals for services to the Pharaoh.  Figures of beetles were used in afterlife ceremonies.  They were placed in the sarcophagus to the dead or even laid in the place where the heart used to be (all organs were cut out and laid out in separate vessels).  Ancient symbols often had such a double use - at home and at a funeral.  The inhabitants of the banks of the Nile had a reverent attitude to death. </p><p>  Figures of the goddess Isis often came across to treasure hunters in the treasures.  It was a symbol of land, fertility and prosperity.  Isis is one of the most revered gods of this pantheon.  The symbol of water in Egypt meant life.  And no wonder, because this culture was founded on the banks of the Nile, beyond which there was a dead and ruthless desert. </p><p>  Symbols of Ancient Egypt entered modern culture after the art deco fashion appeared at the beginning of the 20th century.  In the 1920s, all of Europe and the USA, with bated breath, followed the discoveries of archaeologists.  These were the pyramids and hidden tombs, the most famous of which is the <span>tomb of Tutankhamun.</span>  <span>Symbols of the ancient Egyptians were</span> left on the walls as plots and omens. </p><h2>  Rome </h2><p>  The Roman Empire was built around its capital.  For many centuries, the capital was a symbol of the center of the ancient world.  Therefore, in the Roman pantheon there was a special cult of this city.  Its symbol was the capitoline she-wolf. </p><p>  According to the myth, the founders of Rome, the brothers Romulus and Remus, were royal children.  After their uncle came to power during the coup, he ordered the babies to be thrown into the river.  This was done, but they survived after they were found by the capitoline she-wolf, who fed them.  When the children grew up, Romulus founded Rome and became the king of the new state, which lasted a whole millennium. </p><p>  That is why all the symbols of ancient Rome faded before the she-wolf.  Her bronze sculpture stood at the capital's forum, where the most important government decisions were made.  The image became a cult, it was often used by the townspeople. </p><p>  In Rome, ancient symbols and their meaning were often associated with power.  For example, when it was still only a small republic, magistracy played an important role in it.  It was an elected position for one year.  The lictor had a symbol of power, which distinguished him from the general number of citizens.  These are fascia - bunches of birch or elm twigs, fitted with a belt or cord.  An ax was also used as a symbol, which meant that the person who carried it could execute the guilty. </p>

    <h2>  Ancient Greece </h2><p>  Roman mythology was largely formed under the influence of another great culture - Greek.  Therefore, some designations of Hellas were relevant for Italians. </p><p>  For example, the symbols of ancient Greece include an image of the staff of Asclepius, the god of medicine and healing.  According to legend, he was called up by the Cretan <span>king Minos,</span> who asked him to resurrect his prematurely dead son.  Asclepius walked into the palace with a staff in his hand.  At some point, he was attacked by a snake, but a man killed her with his stick.  Following the first crawled the second reptile, which had grass in its mouth.  With her help, she raised the snake.  Asclepius then took this plant with him to the palace and helped Minos.  Since then, the staff with a snake has become a <span>symbol of medicine.</span> </p>

    <p>  Another variation that exists in modern times is the cup of Hygea with a snake.  This girl was the daughter of Asclepius.  The symbol has become an international sign of medicine. </p><p>  Another image of the staff, widespread in Greece and adopted by Rome, is Caduceus.  <span>This rod was</span> used by heralds who reported ending the war between states (for example, between Athens and Sparta).  Therefore, Caduceus became a <span>symbol of peace</span> among both Greeks and Romans.  The image migrated to medieval European heraldry. </p><p>  Ancient symbols of love of Greece included a butterfly.  This beautiful insect was associated with family harmony and happiness. </p>
