  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scientific knowledge in philosophy: means and methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Science and scientific knowledge is a whole system in philosophy, which is defined as knowledge obtained in a practical way, consisting of research and development of those processes and phenomena that occur in the environment, as well as in society and man himself. </p><p>  Scientific knowledge in philosophy has two main levels: <span>empirical and theoretical.</span>  <span>Empirical</span> knowledge includes information obtained in various ways through observation and experiment.  And theoretical knowledge is a more complex process and is based on the fundamental laws of science and systematizes disparate facts and phenomena, summarizes the initial conclusions. </p><p>  Scientific knowledge in philosophy uses many means and methods that depend on the levels of knowledge.  For empirical knowledge, observation and experiment are characteristic, as already mentioned above.  Observation is the perception of objects and phenomena by means of sensory cognition, and the experiment is ensured by an active practical impact on the studied phenomena and processes of the surrounding nature. </p><p>  Theoretical scientific knowledge in philosophy begins with putting forward a hypothesis, which is put forward presumably to explain what is happening.  For her, the <span>inductive method is used,</span> which consists in the transition from the particular to the general, from simple to more complex and deductive - consisting in summing up the results in accordance with the laws. </p><p>  The most important goal of the hypothesis is the discovery and formulation of laws, so it flows smoothly into theory.  And this is a whole system of evidence with a detailed explanation and further prediction of the occurring events. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The study of real-world objects is not only a matter of science and scientific knowledge.  Ordinary and scientific knowledge goes foot and foot because they are woven into each other and in close interaction contribute to the replenishment of the luggage of knowledge of mankind.  Science develops on the basis of everyday knowledge, which reflects only those objects and phenomena of reality that can be applied in real life in practice.  More often than not, what is considered reliable by ordinary and scientific knowledge is rarely rejected.  But science proves the reliability of that knowledge, and only then will it be recognized as true. </p><p>  What are the differences between scientific and ordinary knowledge?  First of all, they are determined by the features of the methods of cognitive activity.  Ordinary knowledge appeals more to daily practice.  The knower in this case does not define his actions as a process of cognition.  And the scientist considers all objects and objects of the surrounding reality as a cognitive task.  Ordinary knowledge does not require special training, without which scientific knowledge is almost impossible.  The first is carried out automatically when the person is socialized, in the process of development of mental organs, as well as in the context of the development of cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãand comprehension of the experience of previous generations.  Truth is established by ordinary knowledge only in a personal form, that is, it exists in a subjective form.  And scientific knowledge strives for <span>objective truth,</span> independent of the current conditions. </p><p>  Scientific knowledge in philosophy strives for honesty.  It does not allow rigging of results, prohibits plagiarism.  A repetition of the discovery due to lack of information is possible, but the authorship of an already made scientific discovery is considered a deeply immoral situation.  The scientific community categorically denies falsification of facts and is implacable in such cases. </p><p>  Thus, science always strives for objectivity and a departure from everyday experience for an independent study of the objects of reality. </p>
