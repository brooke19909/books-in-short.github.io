If you have to buy a jacket and boots, then you can knit a hat, scarf and gloves yourself.  However, beginners need a step-by-step instruction.  We present the master class on the topic ‚ÄúWe knit a baby hat with our own hands‚Äù in the current article. </p><h2>  Choose a model </h2><p>  Manufacturers offer us an unprecedented number of caps, among which it is not always easy to choose the right option.  Therefore, most people prefer to knit the desired model.  However, professional knitters still recommend going shopping and trying on a few products.  To understand which is more suitable for the appearance, type of face, eyes and other features of a person.  After that, you should think about what we are knitting a baby hat from. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.postila.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="baby hat" class="if uuid-2917879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2917879.jpg"></div><h2>  Buy yarn </h2><p>  In order not to get confused when buying knitting threads, you should focus on your type of appearance.  Colorists note that blondes are more suitable for blue, pink, gray and beige tones.  Red - green, yellow, orange and brown.  And brunettes - red, emerald, purple and blue.  For knitting children's things, it is better to choose juicy shades.  It is also recommended to buy yarn taking into account the pattern of the cap.  For the calm, you can choose a yarn of saturated color, muted tones are more suitable for patterned ones.  And if a person only masters the basics of knitting, then we even knit a baby hat with a front smooth surface, while using special yarn, which itself folds into a pattern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Choose a tool </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.postila.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit a hat" class="if uuid-2917885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2917885.jpg"></div><p>  On the shelves of shops you can see various models of hats.  The most popular are those that are knitted.  Although there are also models made by crochet.  However, professional experts are convinced that with this tool it is better to knit products that should keep their shape.  For example, hats.  Also, crocheting is convenient to create original openwork berets.  Therefore, the reader can choose the tool that is more to their liking.  Our workshop ‚ÄúKnit a baby hat‚Äù will explain the work with knitting needles and crochet.  Professionals advise giving preference to an instrument made of metal.  They work much more convenient and faster.  But before buying it should be carefully checked for defects.  If the knitting needles or hook are poorly turned, it will be impossible to knit them. </p><h2>  Take measurements </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knit hat" class="if uuid-2917883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2917883.jpg"></div><p>  To tie a product that fits perfectly on the child‚Äôs head, you need to prepare a centimeter tape, a notebook and a pen.  It is also important to note that in order to obtain the correct parameters, the head of beautiful persons should be measured only when the hair is loose.  After that, we proceed to take measurements.  We knit a baby hat for a girl or a boy, based on the following parameters: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Head circumference.  We measure the widest part, placing a centimeter tape just above the eyebrows. </li><li>  Cap depth.  We put a centimeter tape on the top of the head, we bring it to the base of the ear.  And measure the distance to the base of the second ear.  The resulting value is divided in half. </li></ol><h2>  Knit a pattern. </h2><p>  Having determined and written down the necessary parameters, we put them aside.  We take yarn and the chosen tool in our hands.  Then, according to the scheme for a knitted children's hat, we study the technology for performing the pattern.  And we knit a small fragment - a square with a side of ten centimeters.  After we count the number of loops and rows in it.  We divide both values ‚Äã‚Äãby 10. These mathematical calculations are necessary in order to find out how many units needed for knitting are contained in one centimeter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="hat for girls" class="if uuid-2917891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2917891.jpg"></div><h2>  We calculate the number of loops and rows </h2><p>  To knit a baby hat with knitting needles, you need to find out two parameters.  To do this, multiply the number of loops in one centimeter by the circumference of the head.  As a result, we find out how many loops you need to dial at the very beginning.  However, professionals recommend first tying several rows with an elastic band.  This will help to slightly tighten the canvas, so the product will not fall off.  If you want to make a tight-fitting hat, you will have to subtract one and a half to two centimeters from the head circumference.  And only then calculate the number of loops for the set.  Determining the minimum cap length is also easy.  Multiply the number of rows in one centimeter by the depth of the cap.  Hats with a hanging tip are now more popular.  We knit such a children's hat for the girl, as well as the classic one.  The only difference is that there will be a little more rows in it. </p><p>  To crochet a hat, you can act on a similar technology.  Experienced craftswomen are able to perform gum with a hook.  If the reader has not yet mastered this skill, experts advise dialing the number of loops calculated earlier for the fitted cap. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theit.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hat for boy" class="if uuid-2917898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2917898.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a crown easy </h2><p>  Professional knitters, talking about the technology of knitting children's hats, emphasizes that the most difficult step in the process is to complete the work.  And all because you need to carefully reduce the loops to get a beautiful tip.  Which will not puff or collect the cap on the top of the head.  It is very difficult for a beginner to cope with a task.  Therefore, experts advise to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Tie a hat in a circle using hosiery knitting needles.  That is, in this case, the product knits like a sock or mittens. </li><li>  Moreover, from the very beginning to the end, loops are not required.  But you have to knit for three to five rows more than the calculations require. </li><li>  Then break the thread, leaving a tip about ten centimeters long. </li><li>  After taking the hook and using it to stretch the thread through all the loops. </li><li>  Pull gently so that the web shrinks. </li><li>  Withdraw the tip of the thread from the seamy side of the cap, tie and hide it well. </li></ol><h2>  Top technology </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pinstake.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit a hat step by step" class="if uuid-2917910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2917910.jpg"></div><p>  If the reader is interested in how to knit children's hats according to the rules, you should carefully study this item.  In it, we will talk about how to reduce extra loops to get a neat tip.  The technology is pretty simple: </p><ol><li>  Subtract six from the total number of loops. </li><li>  And then divide by eight. </li><li>  Thus, we will determine how many loops to reduce in each row. </li><li>  Now you need to evenly distribute them.  But first we knit the product to the desired length: The depth of the cap is 8 rows. </li><li>  Divide the total number of loops by what we should reduce in each row. </li><li>  Subtract one from the resulting number. </li><li>  And we find out how many loops you need to knit two together. </li><li>  Then we also count the next row.  To do this, re-read the loops on the knitting needles.  And divide their number by the number of loops to reduce.  Subtract one.  By analogy, we develop a reduction scheme for the following series.  When at the end there are six loops, we break the thread and pass through them.  Pull from the wrong side, tie and hide. </li></ol><h2>  Pattern Patterns </h2><p>  Only professional craftsmen can independently come up with various patterns.  For beginners, it is better at first to knit according to the pattern, so as not to get confused.  Better to start with the simplest.  Further, we offer the reader to study structural patterns (in the photo on the left).  They knit with the help of the back and front loops and do not require special knowledge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern design" class="if uuid-2917917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2917917.jpg"></div><p>  For those who like to work with a hook more, we picked up simple schemes (in the photo on the right), which can also decorate a children's hat.  However, professionals advise those who decide to make a crocheted baby hat to sew a fleece lining.  Then the product can be worn even in the cold season. </p><p>  In addition, it is worth noting that you can combine several patterns, knit and crochet one hat.  But experienced knitters are not advised to overload children's products.  Better beat them with color or fancy yarn. </p>
