    <p>  When crocheting dolls, it is worth considering that girls like to change hairstyles for their toys.  Therefore, it is better to stop your choice on a lush-haired princess.  She will bring a lot of joy to the young stylist. </p><p>  In general, there are a lot of ideas for knitted toys.  So turn on your imagination, consider your abilities and start creating! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Materials for stuffing dolls </h2><p>  Needlewomen do not recommend using cotton as the stuffing material.  Over time, the pupa will lose its shape, and in some places lumps will form in the details.  To fill the head, trunk and limbs of a toy, it is best to take a quality sintepon or holofiber.  Sintepuh is also suitable if you want to make the toy more voluminous.  If you know how to work with foam, then you can take it. </p><p>  To fill the legs and handles, some craftswomen advise buying special plastic balls.  They are very evenly distributed in the details of a crocheted doll.  You can find them in handicraft stores. </p><p>  Sometimes for the manufacture of the frame of a complex toy with many parts of the needlewomen, copper wire is used.  It should easily bend and hold its shape, so three millimeters will be the optimal diameter. </p><h2>  Recommendations for the design of the face </h2><p>  In the manufacture of individual parts of the head, pay attention to the following fact.  If you take the crochet doll master-class with patterns and descriptions as the basis, but use different yarn, the result may turn out to be unpredictable.  If the threads are not very different, then this is not so critical. </p><p>  For the design of the eyes, you can take ready-made false eyelashes (choose the thickest).  For two centuries, one blank will be enough.  Cut it into pieces and glue with transparent glue from the outer edge of the eye to the center. </p>

    <p>  To create eyebrows, the remains of yarn of the same length are suitable.  They can also be glued with curved tweezers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is most convenient to embroider sponges with vertical stitches in three threads.  It is better to make the outline thick.  Then you need to smear with transparent glue from the wrong side of the edge, so that when cutting the embroidery does not blossom.  Sponges are not necessary, some dolls look much nicer without them. </p><p>  Cheeks are made using art pastels or dry blush.  You need to make a square template out of paper, and cut an oval in its center.  Attach the blank to the toy cheek and apply dry blush with a brush.  After they need to shade a piece of cloth. </p><h2>  Useful tips for beginners </h2><p>  Sometimes for beginners, knitted toys seem very difficult to perform.  In fact, this is not so.  It‚Äôs enough to pick up a simple crochet doll with diagrams and a description, then everything will become clear.  So you save time, and, most importantly - nerves and strength.  Try to choose master classes without small details. </p><p>  Use only simple types of loops.  As a beginner, this will be enough for you.  For example, this is a single crochet, single crochet and single crochet. </p><p>  Take the hook that matches the thickness of the yarn.  Typically, manufacturers indicate on the packaging recommendations for tools. </p><p>  When knitting, acrylic yarn behaves well.  In addition, she has a nice texture and a huge selection of colors.  You can also buy iris or wool. </p><p>  Perhaps it will be difficult for beginners to make small details themselves (eyes, nose, mouth).  Then you can buy ready-made ones, or replace them with buttons, beads and sequins. </p><h2>  Knitting a bobblehead doll in a scarf </h2><p>  To make crocheted dolls, schemes and description for them you can take any.  The article will present a simple master class that will tell you how to make a cute baby doll.  He will be about seventeen centimeters tall. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  On average, the process of knitting such a doll takes about nine hours.  But it already depends on the speed of the craftswoman herself.  The craft can be modified to your liking, from color to small details. </p><h2>  Knitting materials </h2><p>  What do you need? </p><p>  It: </p><ul><li>  Blue yarn.  Need for knitting the body and beanie.  About one third skein weighing one hundred grams with a thread length of 330 meters will go to one doll. </li><li>  Light beige yarn.  For pens and head.  It will take about one fifth of the skein. </li><li>  Yellow yarn for scarf.  You can use leftovers from any skein. </li><li>  Hook number 1.25. </li><li>  Two buttons or beads for the eyes with a diameter of about 0.7 ml. </li><li>  Sintepon or holofiber for stuffing (about one hundred grams). </li><li>  A piece of wire twenty centimeters long. </li><li>  Long needle. </li><li>  Five cotton swabs or a nylon dowel (12 by 60 millimeters in size). </li><li>  A piece of adhesive tape about ten centimeters long. </li><li>  Dry pink pastel or blush. </li><li>  Knitting markers and pins. </li><li>  Two buttons or other decor to decorate the hats. </li></ul><h2>  Amigurumi ring </h2><p>  Crochet dolls should start with an amigurumi ring.  From the end of the blue yarn at a distance of about 2.5 centimeters, make a loop.  Hold the working thread between the middle and index fingers.  Now enter the loop into the loop.  Grab a working thread and pull it forward.  Pull the yarn through the loop and tighten.  Note that it in the ring will not be considered the first column. </p><p>  From below, hook under both threads that form a large loop.  Grab the working yarn and pull out the loop.  Pull the main thread through the two loops that are already on the hook.  Thus, in the amigurumi ring, the first single crochet is made.  Further knitting will occur quite tightly, in a spiral in two loops. </p><h2>  Legs </h2><p>  In the amigurumi ring, knit five single crochet (RLS) columns.  Start the next row with one column, and then increase in each loop.  That is, it should turn out 9 sc.  The next fourteen rows are knitted with simple columns on nine loops.  At the end, tear the thread, leaving a sufficiently long tail. </p><p>  In the same way, you need to make the left leg.  You don‚Äôt need to break the thread, continue to crochet the doll‚Äôs body.  For beginner needlewomen it will be very simple </p>

    <h2>  Corpuscle </h2><p>  Connect the legs together, making for this an increase on the sides.  On the left, tie the five scs and hang a marker.  Next is a chain of ten air loops (VP).  Then, on the right leg, do 3 sc, increase, sc, increase and 3 sc.  Then knit ten VP.  Again, but already on the left leg, do 3 scs, increase, sc, increase and 3 sc.  Total should come out 42 sc.  Please note that on the legs you need to knit for two loops, and on the air chain - for one. </p><p>  The next 12 rows knit unchanged with the usual PRS.  Sew the hole between the limbs with the thread that remains from the right leg.  At this stage, you need to densely fill the craft. </p><p>  In the next row, make 5 sc and decrease.  So repeat 6 times.  It should turn out 36 sc.  Knit the next two rows unchanged.  Now do 4 sc and decrease.  Repeat the process 6 times.  On the canvas will remain 30 sc.  Knit the next two rows again without changes.  Now make a decrease every 3 sc.  It should turn out 24 sc.  It remains to finish the two rows with simple columns. </p><p>  It's time to tightly stuff the doll's body, crocheted, until about the middle.  In the next row, make 2 sc and decrease.  Repeat this 6 times to leave 18 sc.  Knit the last two rows without changes. </p><h2>  Head </h2><p>  Take light beige yarn and continue knitting the toy according to the following pattern.  In each row, repeat the rapport six times to get a certain number of loops. </p><ul><li>  2 sc, increase = 24 loops. </li><li>  3 RLS, increase = 30 loops. </li><li>  4 RLS, increase = 36 loops. </li><li>  5 sc, increase = 42 loops. </li><li>  6 sc, increase = 48 loops. </li><li>  7 RLS, increase = 54 loops. </li><li>  8 RLS, increase = 60 loops. </li><li>  9 RLS, increase = 66 loops. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, according to this description, it is not difficult to crochet a doll.  Stuff your body well.  Insert cotton buds previously fastened with adhesive plaster or a dowel into the neck.  Now enter the wire between the 23rd and 22nd rows of the calf.  Put it in the crevice in the dowel or wrap the sticks.  Bring the wire from the other side to the outside. </p>

    <p>  After that, in the next 12 rows, knit 66 sc.

Cut the thread, but leave a long ponytail.  Pull the hole well. </p><h2>  Utyazhka </h2><p>  Determine which side of the head the doll‚Äôs face will be crocheted on.  Although, this makes no difference.  Mark your chosen eye location with pins.  For example, it can be between 11 and 12 rows of the head.  Leave about seven loops between the eyes. </p><p>  Put the rest of the light beige thread into a long needle and stick it in the center of the crown.  Bring it out in the supposed place of the left eye, in an adjacent loop of the same row, and after that - in the intended point of the right.  Repeat several times, tightening the eye sockets.  Now put the thread on the crown and secure with a knot.  In places of tightenings sew on buttons-eyes. </p>

    <h2>  Pens </h2><p>  With light beige yarn, knit 4 sc in the amigurumi ring.  In each loop, make an increase.  It should turn out 8 sc.  Make the next row unchanged.  Knit 3 CCHs in one loop and 7 RLS.  For the other handle, this place needs to be done the other way around (7 sc and 3 ccn in one loop).  Knit 8 sc in the next row. </p><p>  Now take the blue yarn.  Continue to knit 19 rows of 8 sc.  Cut the thread, leaving a sufficiently long tail.  You can take any version of the handle of the doll crochet with schemes.  But this knitting method is very simple. </p><p>  Bend the wire so that it is approximately equal to the length of the handles.  It should be a loop.  With a band-aid, fix the wire.  Put the knitted handles on it, pull it to the body and sew it carefully. </p><h2>  Beanie </h2><p>  The hat can be made of blue yarn.  In the amigurumi ring, knit 6 sc.  In the next row, increase in each loop.  It should turn out 12 sc.  Next, knit according to the following pattern, repeating the rapport in each row 6 times. </p><ul><li>  RLS, increase = 18 loops. </li><li>  2 sc, increase = 24 loops. </li><li>  3 RLS, increase = 30 loops. </li><li>  4 RLS, increase = 36 loops. </li><li>  5 sc, increase = 42 loops. </li><li>  6 sc, increase = 48 loops. </li><li>  7 RLS, increase = 54 loops. </li><li>  8 RLS, increase = 60 loops. </li><li>  9 RLS, increase = 66 loops. </li></ul><p>  In the next 13 rows, knit 66 RLS.  Leave a long ponytail and cut the thread. </p><h2>  Scarf </h2><p>  Knit a scarf with yellow yarn.  Its desired width will be equal to the number of air loops.  For example, do so.  Dial six air loops and two for lifting.  Turn the work and knit 5 CCH.  Proceed in the same way until the required scarf length. </p>

    <p>  This accessory can not only be crocheted for a knitted doll.  For starters, it may be easier to make it with knitting needles.  Knit stitch an arbitrary number of loops to the desired length.  For example, you can take the number two knitting needles.  Dial 10 loops.  Knit one row with the front loops and the other with the back loops.  Alternate them until you get 140 rows. </p><h2>  Doll assembly </h2><p>  Put a hat on your head, it should sit tight enough.  If this is not so, it means that you were mistaken in knitting somewhere.  Sew on the part, grabbing it in several places with thread.  With yellow yarn, make a navel on the body in the form of a cross.  Sew jewelry on the side of the cap.  In this case, two buttons will look harmonious (one is yellow, the other is white, smaller in size). </p><p>  Using a brush, paint the cheeks with pink, dry pastel or blush.  Blend thoroughly with a piece of cloth.  It remains to tie a scarf on a baby doll, and she is ready!  You can modify the toy by adding hair, a handbag or by making the hat removable. </p><p>  Now you know how to crochet a doll.  As you can see, even a beginner needlewoman will cope with this task.  Knit with pleasure and delight loved ones with your creations! </p>
