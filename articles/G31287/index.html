It has been so for many years and remains today.  In the context of the economic crisis, this option is even more relevant.  When the market is unstable, prices for other types of investments, such as real estate or stocks, change unpredictably, and perhaps there is no better way to save and increase finances. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="precious metals sberbank" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56419/1986264.jpg" width="600"></div>

Below are the main types of deposits in precious metals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Options and Futures </h2><p>  This includes registered expiration contracts that are backed by gold.  As in the variant with securities, the use of futures or options can both bring a significant increase in funds and lead to losses.  This method is widespread both among those who produce gold and want to insure themselves against unexpected price drops, and among speculators. </p>

When buying, world prices for precious metals or quotes of the Central Bank of Russia are taken into account.  When the account is closed, the calculation is carried out at prices at the time of cancellation of the account.  A depositor in an account opened for one year receives up to five percent per annum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Gold bars </h2><p>  This method of investment is the most understandable and affordable type of investment in precious metals.

    <h2>  Gold coins </h2><p>  Paradoxical as it may sound, a profitable way to invest money is to buy money.  This is not about buying foreign currency, but rather about acquiring expensive numismatic or precious metals coins.  It is a good and compact alternative to gold bullion.  When determining the value of a coin, the amount of precious metal contained in it, its age, circulation and the condition in which it is sold are taken into account. </p><h2>  So, let‚Äôs take a closer look at how to buy precious metals in Sberbank </h2><p>  Sberbank of Russia has a leading position in the precious metals market today.  He offers the following investment methods in this area: </p><ul><li>  Collectible, commemorative gold and silver coins. </li><li>  Accounts linked to precious metals quotes.  They can be silver, gold, palladium or platinum. </li><li>  Precious bullion metals, also available in four versions. </li></ul><p>  It makes sense to monitor the market for quotations of prices for precious metals in order to invest their funds at the most suitable and favorable moment.  The cost of precious metals in Sberbank can be clarified in any branch of a financial institution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How is the formation of value? </h2><p>  Precious metals prices in Sberbank are based on the indicators of the Central Bank of Russia, prices on world trading platforms and average price indicators for the country.  Prices for precious metals may differ even in different branches of the bank.  The reason for this is that the leaders of each individual department can change the cost.  Therefore, when buying or selling, a comparative price analysis should be carried out for several departments and a choice should be made in favor of the best offer. </p>

    <p>  The value of a coin is determined by several factors, namely: the value of the metal contained in the coin, its collection value, circulation and even design.  Coins of such a plan usually grow in price over time, so buying them means investing your money profitably.  Among other things, such a coin can become a souvenir or souvenir.  Coins from Sberbank are sold in special cases, have a certificate of authenticity, which indicates the quality of the metal (fineness) and circulation. </p><h2>  Information support </h2><p>  To find out the current prices for precious metals in Sberbank is very simple.  Updated information is regularly posted on the bank's website, but this is far from the only source of information on the Internet.  It can be found on many online resources.  You can get all the necessary information directly at the department from a deposit adviser or by calling the Sberbank hotline.  When setting prices, a financial institution is guided by world trading platforms, but exchange rates, which have been showing instability recently, invariably affect the value of precious metals.  For this reason, you need to carefully consider the issue of monitoring quotes in order to choose the most favorable moment for investment. </p><p>  It is also possible to purchase precious metals at Sberbank through OMS.  It is worth considering the fact that quotes do not guarantee the purchase or sale at the indicated price.  This is due to the fact that the department has the right to change prices (with certain restrictions), as well as introduce commissions on operations with precious metals.  The price of gold bullion may vary during the verification of each bullion.  Even a small scratch on the surface can reduce the price of it.  With coins, everything is different.  Here, rather, the circulation is crucial for the price, as coins of this type are sold in impeccable condition. </p>

    <p>  The precious metals purchased are converted into rubles based on the US dollar rate, which is fixed on the day following the day the price was set.  The translation method is called in the financial sector ‚Äúgold fixing‚Äù and is used in various accounting and credit organizations.  This pricing method has been used on the London Interbank Exchange daily since 1919. </p><p>  The course of precious metals in Sberbank often changes.  As of September 2017, the prices in this financial institution are as follows (in rubles): </p><ul><li>  For gold: 2,314.00 - purchase, 2,577.00 - sale. </li><li>  For silver: 31.01 - purchase, 34.53 - sale. </li><li>  For palladium: 1 639.00 - purchase, 1 826.00 - sale. </li><li>  For platinum: 1 743.00 - purchase, 1 940.00 - sale. </li></ul><h2>  Cash metal </h2><p>  Ordinary investors who want to profit from the purchase or sale of precious metals are rarely thoroughly versed in the process of setting world prices.  But it is precisely on the basis of indicators of world trading floors that the quotations of the Central Bank are formed, and then Sberbank.  The cash metals market offers not only well-known and widespread metals, but also alloys and various processing stages: copper, nickel, zinc, lead, aluminum, etc. </p>

    <p>  The price of cash metal according to the law of any market depends on supply and, accordingly, demand.  In the current situation, when one economic crisis follows another, when military conflicts are spreading around the world, it is understandable that a person wants to find a reliable and stable way to store cash.  In this way, a contribution to precious metals in Sberbank can become.  The course is better to clarify in advance. </p><h2>  Precious Metals Exchange in London </h2><p>  The Central Bank of Russia is also based on the performance of the London Exchange.  Bankers created it in 1877 in response to the rapid industrialization of Great Britain.  Even today, it helps to maintain stability in the metallurgy of England, being with the latter in close and mutually beneficial cooperation.  World prices for metals are set twice a day - at 10:30 and at 15:00.  This is called morning and afternoon fixing.  Cost in other countries is based on the London Stock Exchange, but with certain adjustments depending on the purity of the sample and the price of transporting the ingot.  At the international auction are not taken bullion, the weight of which does not exceed one kilogram.  Quotes for precious metals in Sberbank also depend on this. </p>

    <p>  There are no customs or tax barriers on the London Exchange; participants themselves determine the rules of the exchange.  It is on it that the largest deals are signed.  Domestic prices are regulated by the state through the introduction of quotas, excise taxes and special tariffs.  Some countries close their precious metals markets by prohibiting the export and import into the territory of the state. </p><p>  The market of precious metals (Sberbank operates at retail) can be both retail and small or large wholesale.  It all depends on the number of intermediaries between the manufacturer and the final investor (in the wholesale version, metals are bought out by large companies, which later sell them further).  Mainly in the precious metals market are gold mining companies, central banks, dealers and consumers.  We examined deposits in precious metals at Sberbank.  We hope you find the information useful. </p>
