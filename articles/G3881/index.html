Even today, in some parts of the world there are armed confrontations that bring destruction and many casualties.  To get ahead of the aggressor who is about to start a war, the defending side can deliver a preemptive strike.  This concept arose 200 years ago, and today has become particularly relevant.  Let's try to understand its meaning and find out how these actions qualify in international law. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="preemptive strike is" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32303/809790.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The meaning of the term </h2><p>  A preemptive strike is the armed influence of one side of the conflict on the other in order to get ahead of the enemy and prevent the first from attacking.  The purpose of these operations is to destroy the strategically important objects of the enemy, which can give him an advantage in the possibly coming war.  Suppose a situation where State A is actively building up military power to attack country B. The aggressor strengthens the army, pursues an agitation policy to hostile the population.  In such a situation, country B can get ahead of the enemy and strike first. </p><p>  Unfortunately, many people abuse this rule, therefore, such actions are condemned by many politicians.  This is because, from a legal point of view, these actions can resemble an act of aggression.  This happens when a certain country builds up military forces to protect the integrity of its territory.  But another state can qualify such actions as preparation for war and deliver a preemptive strike.  This will be considered aggression. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="preventive nuclear strike what is it" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32303/809789.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of Preventive Attacks </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, similar military operations were carried out two centuries ago.  The first of them dates back to 1801, when the English fleet approached Copenhagen and opened fire on the ships of Denmark, as well as around the city.  Although these two countries were not at war, there were suspicions that the Danes were secretly helping the French.  Refusing to voluntarily provide their ships for inspection, they were severely punished by the British. </p><p>  The next famous incident occurred in 1837, where the British were also involved.  He was associated with the attack on the ship Caroline, owned by the Americans.  British intelligence reported the presence of weapons, which were supposed to reach the Canadian separatists who fought for independence from Britain.  To avoid this, the British captured the ship, and then burned it. </p><p>  In 1904, Japanese ships attacked the Russian fleet, based on Chinese territory in Port Arthur.  During the attack, torpedoes were used, few of which reached the target, but the Japanese managed to flood several ships.  These events led to the start of the Russo-Japanese war. </p><p>  The Japanese carried out a similar attack in 1941, when they struck the <span>US naval base</span> Pearl Harbor. </p><h2>  Preventive strike of Germany in the USSR </h2><p>  From the very beginning of World War II in 1941, no one doubted that this was an act of aggression by Nazi Germany against the USSR.  The purpose of these actions was the destruction of Soviet ideology, which was replaced by National Socialism.  Success in this campaign would make it possible to join new territories and gain access to huge reserves of resources that would be useful for further advancement to Asia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But in the mid-80s, a new theory appeared regarding the causes of such actions by Hitler.  It was based on the idea that German troops invaded the territory of the USSR only in order to protect their eastern borders.  Documents were provided according to which the Soviet military command was drawing additional forces to the western borders, ostensibly for a subsequent attack.  But the theory of the preemptive strike was quickly refuted by historians.  This was because the Germans had been preparing this attack for a long time, and the so-called ‚ÄúBarbarossa‚Äù plan, where everything was described in detail, serves as confirmation of this.  In addition, they violated the nonaggression pact, which both parties signed back in August 1939. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="German preventive strike on the ussr" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32303/809809.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Threats of Preventive Strikes Today </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the situation in the world is relatively stable now, there are still a number of threats that can shake this fragile world.  In the XXI century.  The issue of international terrorism has become particularly urgent.  Probably no one has forgotten the events of September 11 or the armed seizure of a school in Beslan.  In addition, military conflicts in the Middle East, Africa and Ukraine are forcing world leaders to prepare for the most extreme measures.  Statements were repeatedly made from representatives of the USA, the EU and even Russia about the possibility of a preemptive strike.  This may be the only chance to guarantee the security of their country, the politicians say.  Despite the fact that such actions are considered a gross violation of international law, the likelihood of this outcome exists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="preemptive strike on Russia" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32303/809791.jpg" width="600"></div>

Its main task is to frighten and force the alleged enemy to refrain from armed aggression. </p><p>  Despite the enormous destructive power, nevertheless, some countries admit the probability of using nuclear charges in the event that other methods of influencing the enemy are unsuccessful.  In connection with the aggravation of relations between Russia and the EU and the USA, alarming news began to appear more and more often.  It was even assumed that the United States was preparing to deliver a preventive nuclear strike against Russia.  Fortunately, there is no official confirmation of this, and such information is only fiction of the media. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="preventive nuclear strike on Russia" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32303/809792.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bush Doctrine </h2><p>  This declaration was created with the assistance of 43 US Presidents and expressed the principles of the country's foreign policy.  Its main goal was the destruction of all international terrorist groups.  In addition, all economic and political agreements were torn with the countries that provided assistance to the militants. </p><p>  The next paragraph of this document was the so-called doctrine of preemptive strike.  She said that the United States reserves the right to carry out armed attacks on military facilities and to displace the current power of states around the world if their actions can directly or indirectly threaten the country's security.  America‚Äôs new foreign policy was perceived negatively by many.  Some politicians said the president wants to justify some of his erroneous decisions by such actions, one of which was the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doctrine of preemptive strike" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32303/809811.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation </h2><p>  Recently, the situation regarding cooperation between Russia and the EU and the USA has remained very tense.  The main reason for everything remains the conflict in the east of Ukraine.  In addition to economic sanctions, many European and American politicians are making statements that it is necessary to strengthen the presence of NATO forces in the Eastern European region.  In turn, the military command of the Russian Federation sees such actions as a threat to their country.  Therefore, statements were repeatedly made about amendments to the main document of the state, which is responsible for its defense capability.  A new version of the doctrine was approved in December 2014. </p><p>  Some experts argued that it would include a clause according to which Russia has the right to deliver a preemptive strike against the United States or <span>NATO countries</span> in the event of a threat to the security of the Russian state.  The doctrine does not contain this provision, but it states that the main threat to the Russian Federation today is the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty. </p><h2>  Events in Ukraine </h2><p>  The whole world community is closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine.  Despite the agreements reached, the situation in the region remains tense.  Recall that many Western states accuse Russia of direct involvement in the conflict and the presence of federation troops in the territory of another country.  Even a version was put forward that a preventive strike on Ukraine with the use of <span>nuclear weapons</span> might be carried out <span>.</span> </p><p>  The Russian side denies any involvement in the outbreak of armed conflict in the territory of a neighboring state.  The absence of the armed forces of the Russian Federation in Ukraine was confirmed by both the president and senior military leadership.  Despite this, the option of using force is allowed if a preventive strike is launched against Russia or another threat arises that threatens the country's security. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="preemptive strike in Ukraine" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32303/809793.jpg" width="555"></div>

    <h2>  The legality of the use of preventive strikes </h2><p>  According to international law, each country has the opportunity to take appropriate countermeasures in response to aggression or violation of peace.  In turn, the UN Charter states that a preemptive strike is an illegal method of countering a threat.  Such measures are allowed only in case of obvious danger and after agreement with the UN committee.  Otherwise, it will not be considered self-defense, but an act of aggression against another state. </p><p>  For preventive actions to be legal, first you need to collect evidence against another state, confirming that it is a clear threat to peace.  And only after consideration of all documents <span>by the UN Security Council</span> , a decision is made regarding further actions against the aggressor. </p>
