    <h2>  Where is this hotel located? </h2><p>  Hotel Merve Sun <span>Hotel Spa 4 *</span> is located very close to the beach of the Anatolian Riviera.

Merve Sun Hotel Spa 4 * (S. Demirel Boulevard) is located in its area called Kumkoy.  The center of this resort is just a stone's throw away.  And to the old part of the famous Side - a little further, four kilometers at least.  If you walk tiring, you will need to use transport.  To Manavgat - seven kilometers.  Approximately the same distance from the hotel to Antalya and its international airport is 65-70 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Merve sun hotel spa 4" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/571411.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment and staff </h2><p>  We turn to the question about the staff of the Merve Sun Hotel Spa 4 *.  Feedback from tourists suggests that some of the staff speak Russian fairly well.  Such people can be found in the administration, in the bar and in the spa.  The staff is very honest.  Tourists often did not want to leave money and valuables in a paid safe, but nothing was ever lost.  During the day and evening, various games, shows and competitions are held by the pool - however, mainly in German.  No one annoys vacationers, and emerging issues are resolved very quickly and efficiently.  The staff is friendly, cheerful, trying to help than they can.  Since the hotel has only recently started working with tourists from Russia, many do not understand the language, but learn quickly.  There are no preferences or discrimination of guests in the country of origin, as well as rudeness and rudeness. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Merve Sun Hotel Spa 4 * (Side) operates on an all inclusive system.  You can eat in the main restaurant, dine in the beach cafe, and grab a bite in the bar.  The food is very tasty and varied, alcohol is not diluted.  Meat every day, several times a week - grill by the pool.  All kinds of salads, sweets.  Breakfast is great.  Orange and pomegranate juices are very tasty, they are paid, but inexpensive.  Fruits constantly - watermelons, melons, pomegranates, apples, grapes, tangerines.  Sometimes you don‚Äôt have to go for wine - the waiters themselves bring it.  In general, restaurant and bar staff work tirelessly.  Tourists claim that the food in this hotel is not much different from the budget Turkish ‚Äúfive‚Äù.  There is an a la carte restaurant, but the cuisine there is almost the same.  When the hotel organizes the so-called Turkish nights, then the dinners are the most delicious.  Alcohol is served without restrictions in the bar, on the beach, and in the main restaurant. </p>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The hotel is not on the first line, but the beach at the Merve Sun Hotel Spa 4 * (Side) is its own, with its sun loungers, umbrellas, sun loungers and other attributes of relaxation at sea.  All of this is a lot, there are plenty of empty seats, no one takes it.  Go to the sea for a short time, mainly along other hotels, in the shade of pomegranate and lemon trees.  The beach is monitored by a special employee who cleans it, cleans and arranges sunbeds.  The neighboring hotel has a volleyball court where you can play ball right by the water.  On the beach there is a pier that divides the territory by the sea into two parts.  The right side is better for children - there is shallow and hollow.  On the left you can swim, it‚Äôs deep and clean.  The bottom is sandy, the water is clear, there are a lot of fish and crabs.  A hotel bus travels to the beach twice a day, but most vacationers prefer to go there on foot.  There are two swimming pools at the hotel, one of them is indoor.  Jacuzzi, water slide, ‚Äúpaddling pool‚Äù for children - all this is present.  At the pool it happens that there are not always enough sunbeds, but the staff quickly solves this problem. </p><h2>  What to see </h2><p>  From the Merve Sun Hotel Spa 4 * hotel to the main attractions of Side - the ancient ruins - within walking distance.  The journey will take you from half an hour to forty minutes, depending on your strength and energy.  If you are reluctant to stomp your feet, take the minibus (dolmush).  In Side, you will be amazed by the vast territory with many ancient ruins.  In almost all places you can walk for free.  It is very beautiful there, especially in the evening, with backlight.  The delightful temple of Apollo, which is located by the sea.  There you can go boating.  From the temple begins a shopping street with souvenir shops, goodies, leather, gold and other goods.  Just remember to bargain!  There are also beautiful sandy beaches in Side.  It takes you about ten minutes by shuttle bus to Managwat, where you can visit the local bazaar and go to the waterfalls.  This is the most famous natural attraction in the area.  Water from a cliff effectively falls directly into the sea.  Get there another twenty minutes.  In addition, in this village there is a good shopping center "Waikiki" and a large supermarket "Migros".  From excursions through a travel agency, rafting, jeep safari and riding a pirate yacht are recommended. </p>

Visit the ancient amphitheater - fifteen <span>Turkish liras, the</span> museum - ten. </p><h2>  Merve Sun Hotel Spa 4 * (Turkey): reviews </h2><p>  The vast majority of tourists vacationing at this hotel claim that it is worth the money spent on it.  The hotel is praised for its crystal clearness.  The hotel chef is called one of the best in Turkey or at least on the coast of Antalya.  There are few tourists from Russia, mainly Germans and Scandinavians like to relax here.  Therefore, the hotel is quiet, calm, clean and tidy.  If you know English or German, it's great.  From the point of view of guests, this is a good budget hotel for relaxation, where you want to return.  Tourists from other hotels often complained about their problems, but vacationers from Merve San did not have to deal with this.  Convenient location, delicious food, clean rooms, great relationship with children - with this vacation formula, guests feel completely one hundred percent comfortable.  It is inexpensive and very worthy here. </p>
