One of these lines was the Renaissance.  What is the Renaissance (these terms are equivalent)? </p><h2>  Key Features of the Renaissance </h2><p>  Renaissance refers to the era that replaced the Middle Ages.  Starting from the XIV century, in certain regions (primarily in Italy) there has been a cultural growth.  It resulted in people's interest in their own history and the era of Antiquity.  This, in turn, led to an increase in scientific knowledge, the spread of humanism and interest in the human person. </p><p>  One of the reasons for the beginning of these processes was the fall of Constantinople.  The Byzantine Empire, which had existed for a thousand years, fell under the attack of Muslim Turks.  Many Greeks did not want to betray the Christian faith and fled to Western Europe.  Scientists took with them ancient books, which were soon translated into Latin and national languages.  All this pushed the Renaissance.  <span>What is the Renaissance</span> in Italy?  This is also the emergence of new classes that were independent of the old feudal relations within the monarchies. </p>

    <p>  A large number of Italian republics gave birth to bankers, scientists and other people of a new type.  Among them, humanism was born - an interest in human nature and personality.  At first, these were small schools of philosophers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, they became the new centers of scientific research and art.  In Italy, the development of typography and new forms of art began.  An important phenomenon was that local tycoons and influential families with large capitals began to give money for education. </p><p>  Renaissance centers became Florence and Rome.  Pope Julius II did much to ensure that the greatest creators of the era work in the "eternal city".  It is difficult to imagine the Renaissance without his enterprise.  What did this mean increased attention of the Church to artists and sculptors?  This indicated that they could create, relying on the support of the most influential people in Italy.  Among them were such masters as Michelangelo and Raphael.  Renaissance artists created great paintings and murals on biblical subjects.  Their works now adorn numerous churches and museums throughout Europe. </p><h2>  Leonardo da Vinci </h2><p>  The world <span>of Renaissance culture</span> would be inferior without Leonardo da Vinci.  His amazingly expressive paintings conquered contemporaries and continue to amaze people of the 21st century.  He is also known as an inventor.  His ideas were many years ahead of the Renaissance.  <span>What is a person?</span>  How is it arranged and where is its place?  The great Italian was asked all these questions. </p><p>  Renaissance artists could not surpass his "Mona Lisa."  This picture has become a universal symbol of the sense of beauty and perfectionism. </p>

    <h2>  Revival in other European countries </h2><p>  Late Renaissance in historiography is called the second half of the XVI century.  At this time, art and culture moved to a new stage not only in Italy, but also in many other European countries.  Renaissance centers became Germany, the Netherlands and England. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The British are proud of their most famous Renaissance compatriot, William Shakespeare.

    <h2>  Reformation </h2><p>  Christian theologian <span>Martin Luther</span> is considered one of the most important figures of the Renaissance.  This German was unhappy with the Catholic Church.  His lectures, denouncing corrupt priests and vices of religion, attracted thousands of audiences. </p><p>  Especially fiercely, Luther criticized the new rules, according to which Christians could buy indulgences for money (absolution).  The ideas of the famous preacher resulted in 95 theses.  On October 31, 1517, Martin hung them on the door of a church in the German city of Wittenberg.  This famous episode later became a symbol of the beginning of the Reformation. </p>

    <p>  So called the process of reformatting the Catholic Church.  German Christians began to criticize Rome for its inertness and conservatism.  This has led to numerous <span>religious conflicts.</span>  The <span>thirty-year war of</span> 1618-1648 became the apotheosis of the confrontation between Catholics and Protestants. </p><p>  The fight against church dependence has led European society to become secular.  For some time the Protestants were in a very difficult situation.  Many of them went to North America in the 17th century, where they managed to create a truly new society. </p>
