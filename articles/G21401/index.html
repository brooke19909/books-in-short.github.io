This product is especially popular in the summer when the sun heats the air.  But in winter, many people like to treat themselves to it.  Soviet ice cream is considered a classic, a photo of which can be found in this article.  It was the best in the world, exported in thousands of tons, and abroad it was served in the most prestigious restaurants.  Some foreign tourists claimed that three things should come to the USSR: to visit a circus with Nikulin, watch a ballet and try a local cold dessert. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what was called Soviet ice cream cylindrical" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/328613.jpg" width="325"></div>

    <h2>  The history of cold treats in the USSR </h2><p>  All this becomes clear if you look at the story.  <span>Ice cream in the Soviet Union</span> was not initially given attention, since they considered it a product for the bourgeoisie.  At the root, the situation changed in the thirties.  Then the People's Commissar of Food of the USSR Anastas Mikoyan visited the United States of America, where he liked the machine guns making cutlets, the latter being fried on the streets and sold in buns.  Together with the frypots for hamburgers, which, by the way, did not take root with us, he ordered equipment for the production of ice cream.  And on November 4, 1937, the People's Commissar issued a decree according to which the country was to bypass the United States in the production and consumption of cold product.  In addition, domestic ice cream was supposed to be affordable for the general population.  About five kilograms of goodies per year - these were the norms of consumption laid down by Mikoyan at the beginning of the victorious march of cold dessert in the Union. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ice cream in the Soviet Union" class="if" height="492" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/328612.jpg" width="600"></div>

But every person who happened to live in that era remembers the unforgettable taste of a cold dessert.  Why was he so tasty?  Why did children and adults all over the world adore him?  How can we explain the fact that our grandfathers and grandmothers unanimously say that the ice cream of their youth was the best? </p><p>  Before answering the question about the name of Soviet cylindrical ice cream, it should be noted that his taste was everywhere and always the same.  In whatever corner of a vast country you would buy it, you could always enjoy a pleasant and familiar dessert.  This was due to the requirements of GOST, which was introduced in 1941 and was rightfully considered the most stringent in the world.  There were no preservatives in the delicacy from the USSR, exclusively natural milk was used.  There was a single technology for all <span>types of ice cream,</span> whether it was cream, popsicle, ice cream, horns or <span>waffle cups, by</span> weight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet ice cream photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/329835.jpg" width="376"></div>

    <h2>  Decline and rebirth </h2><p>  As the Soviet ice-cream of a cylindrical shape was called, every person born in the USSR will easily remember.  Of course, this is a popsicle on a stick, which was covered with <span>chocolate icing</span> on top, inside - white.  Interestingly, each batch of ice cream was evaluated on a stobal scale, and any deviations related to marriage. </p><p>  The decline in the cold industry began with perestroika, when products made with a large share of plant materials poured into the market from abroad.  GOST was abolished, new recipes and technologies changed and appeared.  But the taste of everyone‚Äôs favorite treats also became different.  True, today there are enthusiasts who not only want to remember what Soviet cylindrical ice cream was called, but also make it according to a proven recipe.  Maybe the past greatness of our dessert will revive? </p>
