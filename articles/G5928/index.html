The word "resort" on the signboard of the hotel means that it is a resort where a person can relax from the first to the last day of vacation, without feeling the need to go beyond it.  This is a small town where there is everything your heart desires: restaurants, bars, pools, the sea, entertainment, sports.  And the word spa in the name of the hotel indicates that spa services are being added to this set of services.  The stardom at the hotel we are describing is the highest, 5 *.  In addition, we can say that until 2011 the hotel had another name - Club Marverde.  Then it was acquired by the hotel chain Crystal Hotels.  After renovation, the hotel, built in 1992, has changed beyond recognition.  From the former, he had only the location.  Let's get acquainted with the services at Crystal Green Bay Resort Spa 5 * in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crystal Green Bay Resort Spa photo" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1991272.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  Crystal Green Bay Resort Spa is located in the province of Mugla, in the vicinity of Bodrum, in the resort village of Guverginlik.  It stands on the first line from the sea and has its own beach.  The center of Bodrum is twenty-three kilometers from the hotel, and twelve to the Mughla International Airport.  The hotel stands in a very picturesque area, among the mountains covered with pine forests.  An amazingly clean bay with water of all shades of green approaches the hotel itself.  Because of her, the Crystal network gave the hotel such a name.  Guverdzhinlik village itself is very calm and safe.  But there are places for shopping.  You can go to Bodrum with a guided tour, but you can also do it yourself.  Indeed, from the village to the city shuttle buses run.  Due to the peculiar location surrounded by mountains and on the shore of the bay in Guvercinlik, a unique climate has developed.  The Aegean Sea is famous for being colder compared to the Mediterranean.  But the bay warms up in the summer months to +28 degrees!  However, the fresh breeze makes the ringing heat simply imperceptible.  Therefore, families of wealthy Turks like to come to Guverjinlik.  And the hotel "Crystal Green Bay 5 *" positions itself as a place for families with children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crystal Green Bay Resort Spa" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1991277.jpg" width="600"></div>

Three buildings were completed to the former three-story building, now called the Main Building (main building).  They are called "Annex", and there are rooms of a higher category.  The main building was built in such a way that only 15 percent of the balconies overlook the sea.  The rest overlooks the garden or the patio.  The hotel area is very well-groomed and landscaped, similar to an oasis or rather a paradise garden planted with palm trees.  Between the buildings and the sea there are two open pools, there are two water slides.  The very concept of a resort hotel provides for the availability of all necessary services on site.  You will not need to go beyond the Crystal Green Bay Resort Spa, unless you want to go on a tour. </p><h2>  Where guests are accommodated </h2><p>  There are several categories of rooms.  Reviews also warn that there are several types of ‚Äústandards‚Äù - with ordinary or bunk beds.  In the latter case, the room has 23 square meters more free space, but the second guest will have to get to his bed by a ladder.  All standard rooms have no sea view.  There are bunk beds in the ‚Äúfamily room‚Äù category (maximum occupancy is five people), but not in all.  Family rooms with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã34 square meters consist of two bedrooms and one bathroom.  There are several triple rooms at Crystal Green Bay Resort Spa.  They are called "big standard room."  The Annex building accommodates rooms of a higher category.  This is a double ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù and ‚Äúfamily superior‚Äù with a maximum occupancy of four people.  They overlook the sea with their balconies.  The hotel also has two rooms, fully adapted to the needs of guests with disabilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crystal Green Bay Resort Spa 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1991275.jpg" width="600"></div>

What is the content of a regular room at the Crystal Green Bay Resort Spa 5 *?  An air conditioner with an individual control panel will not surprise anyone now.  He must be not only in the "five", but also in the Turkish "four".  However, in Crystal Green Bay 5 * rooms there are amenities of a higher rank.

    <h2>  Beach, Pools </h2><p>  Crystal Green Bay Resort Spa (Bodrum) is located on the first line and has its own piece of coastline with a length of 250 meters.  A large pier leads into the sea, as well as a sandy beach, lined with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Sunset at sea is comfortable, gentle, without stones.  All beach equipment, including towels, are free for hotel guests.  The hotel is washed not by the open Aegean Sea, but by Kuyuchak Bay.  The water in it warms up in the summer to +28 degrees.  This is a great place for bathing children.  The hotel has two outdoor pools.  One of them is filled with sea water - a great alternative in case of a storm.  On the beach, you can have fun on bananas, water scooters and the like.  But they are paid.  But on two slides of a mini-water park you can ride freely and unlimited times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crystal Green Bay Resort Spa (Bodrum)" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1991274.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  Services at the Crystal Green Bay Resort Spa 5 * hotel (Bodrum) are fully consistent with its five-star status.  The administration greets all guests with a cold drink with traditional Turkish sweets.  The "spa" in the name of the hotel is not for the <span>red word.</span>  Guests can enjoy the sauna and hammam for free.  But there are spa treatments for which you need to lay out a certain amount of lire.  This is soap peeling, a jacuzzi, massage, a variety of wraps, etc. Those who can not imagine a day without playing sports can pump up muscles in the gym, play tennis and table tennis, darts, mini-golf, beach volleyball or water polo.  Tourists leave a lot of positive reviews about the animation at the hotel.  Both adults and children are entertained here.  For the latter, there is a mini club. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crystal Green Bay Resort Spa 5 (Bodrum)" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1991281.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Crystal Green Bay Resort Spa 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  The specificity of this hotel is that few Russians are resting in it.  Tourists report that 80 percent of the guests are wealthy Turks who behave very culturally.  There are still pensioners from Western Europe and families from Poland, Ukraine, the Baltic states.  But such a national composition of vacationers requires at least an initial knowledge of the English language in order to communicate with the reception staff, to understand the names of dishes in restaurants.  The staff at the hotel is very friendly and professional.  If any problem arises, it is resolved very quickly.  Many tourists say they want to return to this hotel again - and this is the best recommendation for a hotel. </p>
