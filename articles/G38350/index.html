He was a symbol of not only a large country, but also honest work, self-sacrifice.  And he gave an impetus to the development of the movement, later named after him.  What is hiding behind a person under the name of Stakhanov?  Feat?  Tragedy?  Or both? </p>

    <h2>  Feat of Stakhanov </h2><p>  The surname of the famous Soviet record-holder miner was known to everyone: to elementary school students and students of higher educational institutions.  He was glorified at party congresses and set as an example, he was proud of in the international arena.  But they quickly forgot about it, although his innovative approach to work is still used today. </p><p>  A simple coal miner earned not only respect, but also contempt and hatred.  Although he was not guilty of this: he worked honestly, and the fact that he was made a symbol of progress is the merit of propaganda and the authorities of that time.  The famous miner woke up on August 31, 1935 after his team mined coal several times more than the norm assumed for one shift.  Andrei (it was later forced to change his name to Aleksey because of a typo in the newspaper Pravda) worked with two fasteners, offering them to fix the mine in order to avoid a collapse, and he focused only on cutting down the coal.  Thus, instead of the laid seven tons, they were able to get one hundred and two. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Background of the Stakhanov movement </h2><p>  It turns out that the name of the famous Soviet record-holder miner became a household name for a reason.  A simple worker was a rationalizer, so he proposed how to increase mine productivity.  Since the authorities at that time promoted labor exploits and encouraged people to work more for the common good, the leadership responded very quickly.  Everything was carefully prepared for that legendary change of Stakhanov: they brought in new equipment, illuminated the extraction site, and prepared the front of work.  But behind the scenes of cameras and the attention of journalists remained the assistants of Alexei-Andrei. </p><p>  It is worth noting that, taking into account the offer of the famous coal miner <span>, labor productivity</span> has increased significantly, first in the native mine of Stakhanov, then in the whole industry.  Well, then the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe division of labor was widely used in other areas of the national economy. </p><h2>  Miner's life </h2>

    <p>  Although the name of the famous Soviet record-holder miner did not leave the pages of the print media, and other workers began to imitate him, his personal life was not entirely successful.  His career took off, he was patronized by Comrade Stalin himself, letters were written to him from all over the Union, but could a simple hard worker be a good leader, as the party demanded?  And did he want that?  From fame and a sense of uselessness (because he just wanted to work) Stakhanov washed down.  They manipulated him like a toy: if they wanted - they transferred him to another mine as boss, they wanted to - by decree they forced them to change their place of residence, leaving the family in the same place, they demanded all new records.  The surname of the USSR miner-record holder began to be forgotten, lost among the names of other leading workers, and his fate no longer interested anyone. </p><h2>  Spent screw of a large mechanism </h2>

    <p>  In the movement for the construction of a new world, the record miner, whose surname is assigned to the city, mines, and numerous streets, played a huge role.  But was he happy?  Most likely, no, otherwise I would not go into binges, get married several times.  And the star of the Hero of Socialist Labor, handed to him in his declining years, could not please him, but only caused stress. </p><p>  Stakhanova was addicted to alcohol the same fame, because after speeches and meetings with the intelligentsia and party leaders they always laid the table.  He died of alcohol, although this was not officially disclosed.  The consequences of chronic alcoholism (deep sclerosis, stroke, <span>delirium tremens)</span> brought yesterday's hero to a psychiatric hospital.  There he went into another world on November 5, 1977, without regaining consciousness.  The last refuge of the legendary slayer was the central cemetery of the city of Toreza. </p>
