Now, to answer the call, it is not necessary to bring the phone to your ear.  Simply purchase a bluetooth headset.  It is attached directly to the auricle using a special handle.  Especially such a device is necessary for those who spend a lot of time talking. </p><p>  Convenience and comfort is what a modern person needs.  Although technical developments bring only joy to life, however, malfunctions in their work can create quite serious problems.  And they arise when the phone does not see the bluetooth headset.  What to do in such a situation?  Not everyone knows the answer to this question, so they start to panic, they flee to the service center.  But if there is no way to turn to professionals, what should I do?  There are simple diagnostic methods available to every user.  You can find them in this article.  Also, the material will describe in detail how to troubleshoot a device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not see the bluetooth headset what to do" class="if uuid-2488756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2488756.jpg"></div><h2>  Why the phone does not see the bluetooth headset: the main reasons </h2><p>  When you purchase a wireless headset, you need to connect it to the device.  Only in this case will it function.  If this does not work, then you have to figure out the reasons.  There may be several: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The first - the simplest - a dead battery. </li><li>  The second is no less commonplace - they forgot to turn on the headset. </li><li>  The third also does not imply complex actions - the wireless device was previously paired with another device.  In this case, the phone sees the bluetooth headset, but does not connect to it. </li><li>  The fourth is the settings - the synchronization option is disabled. </li><li>  And the fifth (the most difficult and costly) is the malfunction of the gadget, and the problem can be both with the phone and with the bluetooth headset. </li></ul><p>  There is another important point to consider when choosing devices.  It's about the compatibility of a wireless headset and smartphone.  As a rule, a specific list of models that are indicated in the documentation is suitable for specific brands.  If the manufacturer did not provide such information, then you can do much easier - just try to connect the headset to the phone right in the store. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.makeuseof.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone stopped seeing the bluetooth headset" class="if uuid-2488764" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2488764.jpg"></div><h2>  Troubleshooting simple bugs </h2><p>  First of all, if the phone has stopped seeing the bluetooth headset, you need to check the battery status.  It is important that both devices are charged!  If a battery runs out on one of the gadgets, communication may be interrupted. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the phone sees the headset, but cannot connect to it, it is important to check whether it is used by another smartphone.  As a rule, this happens if the wireless device was purchased, as they say, from the hands, that is, it is no longer new, but used (used). </p><p>  If both of the methods described above did not help, then it's worth taking a look at the phone settings.  It often happens that the synchronization option is simply deactivated in the menu.  In this case, just slide the slider to ‚ÄúON‚Äù, and then try connecting the headset again. </p><p>  If these methods did not help to fix the error, then you will have to deal with technical problems.  Entrusting such work is better for specialists.  But if you yourself are an advanced user, then you can try to figure out the problem yourself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not see the bluetooth headset" class="if uuid-2488753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2488753.jpg"></div><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  In order for the wireless headset to work correctly, you must correctly connect.  If the device is new, just activate Bluetooth on the phone.  To do this, you need to go either to the settings or find the icon on the curtain.  Also, do not forget to turn on the headset itself.  After on the smartphone, start searching for devices.  A list of available models appears on the screen.  It remains only to choose the right one and connect to it.  In some cases, a code is requested when pairing.  This can be a digital combination of 1234, 0000, or 1111. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tomtop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone sees the bluetooth headset but does not connect" class="if uuid-2488804" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2488804.jpg"></div><h2>  Smartphone or headset: troubleshooting </h2><p>  Why <span>does the phone not see the bluetooth headset?</span>  As has already been clarified, there are several reasons for this.  In addition to those described above, the problem may be with the smartphone.  What actions will help confirm this assumption?  There are two simple ways to do this: </p><ul><li>  Connect the wireless headset to another phone.  If pairing happened without problems, the fault should be sought in the smartphone. </li><li>  Use another bluetooth headset that has already been connected to a third-party device.  If it also does not work, this indicates a malfunction of the phone. </li></ul><h2>  Phone problem </h2><p>  There is no doubt that the bluetooth headset is in demand.  And the problems with her work cause far from pleasant impressions.  Simple malfunctions, of course, can be dealt with on your own (how to do this is described above).  But a serious problem will not be so easy to solve. </p><p>  If you figured out why the phone does not see the bluetooth headset, and found that the reason for this is a malfunction of the latter, then they can only help in the service center.  As a rule, specialists check the status of contacts.  To do this, you will need to completely disassemble the device.  First, it is turned off, then the SIM cards and flash drive are removed.  Special screwdrivers unscrew the bolts that secure the case.  By removing the panels, you can inspect the contacts.  It happens that they oxidize or burn. </p><p>  Sometimes phone malfunctions appear if the RAM is completely full.  You can clean it yourself.  To do this, it is recommended to reset to factory settings.  You will need to go to the menu.  Find the item "Settings".  Then go to the tab "Recovery and reset."  There, find the item "Reset all parameters to default values." </p><p>  It is important to remember that with this option all information from the phone is deleted.  Therefore, to save files, it is better to backup, and save photos and music to an external drive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prohavit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not see the bluetooth headset program" class="if uuid-2488778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2488778.jpg"></div><h2>  Gadget compatibility </h2><p>  Another reason why the phone does not see the bluetooth headset may be their incompatibility.  What does this mean?  The devices have Bluetooth installed in different versions.  In this case, the phone may simply not support a set of specific protocols.  It is better to check these characteristics immediately in the store before purchasing a bluetooth headset. </p><h2>  Programs for working with a bluetooth headset </h2><p>  Those who own smartphones running on Android are offered excellent utilities.  They help to configure the connection, voice search, adjust the sound, and also have many other options. </p><p>  For example, if the phone does not see the bluetooth headset, BTCall Demo 2.8.2 will turn on synchronization automatically.  Also, this utility can: </p><ul><li>  independently activate / deactivate the connection during an incoming or outgoing call; </li><li>  choose which calls to forward to the headset; </li><li>  function or shut down at a specific time selected by the user. </li></ul><p>  Another program for setting up a wireless headset is SmartKey.  It has a wide range of features.  And if the user is faced with the fact that the Bluetooth connection is constantly lost, then you can install the Missed Call 0.8.9 utility.  She will not only report disconnection, but also missed calls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.casebowl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="connect the bluetooth headset to the phone" class="if uuid-2488777" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2488777.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This article examined <span>what to do if the phone does not see the bluetooth headset.</span>  All methods are quite simple, so dealing with them will be easy.  Of course, serious failures can also be the cause of failures.  Then you have to contact the service center for help.  The main thing is to correctly establish what exactly led to such a malfunction.  Possessing accurate information, you can quickly fix the error and connect a bluetooth headset. </p>
