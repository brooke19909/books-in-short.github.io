The problem, in 90% of cases, is temporary and is easily solved by the client himself.  But Sberbank card holders want to be in the know why SMS is not sent to number 900, and what should be done when such a situation arises. </p><h2>  Causes of Problems with the Mobile Bank </h2><p>  To make quick transfers or use the Sberbank Online service, bank customers must have a plastic card with an associated current phone number.  But even the presence of all parameters does not guarantee 100% service operation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.firstresponsetraining.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why sms are not sent to number 900" class="if uuid-3023586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3023586.jpg"></div><p>  There are several options why SMS is not sent to number 900: </p><ul><li>  incorrect binding of a mobile phone; </li><li>  lack of funds in the subscriber's account; </li><li>  lack of free memory on a mobile phone; </li><li>  virus in the smartphone; </li><li>  technical failure in the system; </li><li>  change of mobile operator. </li></ul><p>  Almost every problem is easily solved.  Most of the reasons are temporary.  To eliminate them, it will take no more than 24 hours. </p><h2>  Problems with the binding of "Mobile Bank" </h2><p>  One of the main reasons why SMS is not sent to 900 is the incorrect binding of the mobile to a credit card.  This happens if the client has connected the wrong phone number in the terminal or office of the bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In this case, he will not be able to use the capabilities of "Mobile Bank" until the moment he has tied his phone number.  It is important to quickly disconnect the wrong cell number from the card, as its owner can use the client‚Äôs funds. </p><p>  To bind a new number and untie the old one, the cardholder must contact the bank office or call the hotline.  In both cases, a passport is required for identification. </p><div class="photo" data-original="arileht.delfi.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS is not sent to 900 tele2" class="if uuid-3023606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3023606.jpg"></div><p>  In the Sberbank terminal, the client can only connect a new number to the card, but it will not work to untie the incorrectly specified one.  The deadline for linking a new number and disabling the old one is 24 hours from the date of application. </p><h2>  Lack of funds on the phone balance </h2><p>  Since 2018, some operators have begun to charge for sending messages to 900. Not all customers are aware of this. </p><p>  One of the first to pay fees for notifications to the Sberbank contact number was Tele2.  One of the reasons why SMS is not sent to the number 900 from Tele2 is the lack of funds in the client‚Äôs account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.abbyy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why sms are not sent to number 900" class="if uuid-3023614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3023614.jpg"></div><p>  To resume the service, you need to pay for cellular communications.  The service "Mobile Bank" will be available immediately after replenishing the balance of a cell phone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Lack of memory in the phone </h2><p>  Sometimes the reason why the client cannot use SMS banking is the full memory of the mobile phone. </p><p>  In order for the functionality to become active again, you need to clear the Inbox and Outbox (or Sent) folders, deleting unnecessary files.  The service will work 2-5 minutes after clearing the memory. </p><h2>  Virus in the phone </h2><p>  One of the most dangerous reasons why SMS is not sent to number 900 is the presence of a virus in the subscriber's phone.  It can affect the operation of the entire device, including the ability to send a message to the specified phone number. </p><p>  The virus is dangerous in that it can not only block the system, but also steal client data, including funds from bank cards and accounts.  If it is not possible to clean the smartphone from it yourself, it is recommended to contact a service center. </p><h2>  Change mobile operator </h2><p>  Most mobile operators, in order to attract as many subscribers as possible, provide customers with the opportunity to connect to the new tariff while maintaining the old phone number.  Not always this option guarantees the stable operation of online services at the same level.  This may be one of the reasons why SMS is not sent to number 900. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gazetem.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stopped sending SMS to number 900" class="if uuid-3023610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3023610.jpg"></div><p>  To get rid of the problem, the client can contact the bank office to re-bind the mobile phone number (with reconnection).  If this does not help, you need to visit the office of the new mobile operator with a passport. </p><h2>  Bank technical failure </h2><p>  Sberbank is one of the most stable companies in the Russian market, but even such organizations sometimes have technical problems.  This may be the reason why they stopped sending SMS to 900. </p><p>  The client, as a rule, finds out about problems in the return SMS from the bank.  A message arrives during or immediately after a technical failure.  The Sberbank card holder can only wait until the technical department specialists solve the problem and Mobile Bank will be active again. </p>
