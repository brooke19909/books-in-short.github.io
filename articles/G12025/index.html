    <h2>  Romania.  Holidays at sea.  Prices </h2><p>  This country is the birthplace of the famous Dracula.  But the tourism industry in the image of the legendary megaprofit vampire, alas, did not.  But here you can perfectly relax at sea.  Modernly equipped beaches, good hotels, the opportunity to visit many historical places make Romania very attractive for tourists.  Moreover, the cost of tours is pleasantly pleasing.  For example, in September 2014, tour operators offer relaxation here together for ten days for only 45 thousand rubles, taking into account the flight from Moscow.  It is also encouraging that Romania, whose sea is famous for its flat bottom, pays great attention to children's recreation.  Therefore, thousands of families with kids come here every year. </p><h2>  Climate features </h2><p>  The resorts of Romania are so popular, because this country is as if specially created for a beach pastime.  The state is located in the southwestern part of Central Europe, the <span>marine climate is</span> characterized by a long swimming season and mild winters.  Wide beaches that smoothly descend into the sea, soft golden sand, reasonable prices, decent hotel service, a large number of attractions, many entertainment and cultural programs - all this will give you a rest in Romania on the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in romania" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/478674.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the summer, spring and <span>autumn months</span> , warm weather reigns here, the swimming season lasts from May to October.  But there is no exhausting hell on the beaches - the sea light breeze does not allow overheating even on the hottest day. </p><h2>  Black Sea.  Romania </h2><p>  The coast can be conditionally divided into two parts: the north - with lagoons, deltas and a characteristic relief;  and south - with numerous bays and capes, a high, steep bank.  The 244-kilometer coastal zone is a whole series of diverse resorts with comfortable hotels, amusement parks, swimming pools, water activities, discos.  Romanian resorts on the sea for both children and adults create all conditions for a good rest. </p><p>  The beaches in the country are wide with fine golden sand, a flat bottom and a smooth entry into the water.  At resorts such as Mangalia and Tekirgiole, their width reaches 250 meters, in other places - 50-200 meters.  Most beaches have the EU Blue Flag.  In general, the sea in Romania is calm: without large <span>ebbs and flows.</span>  That is why it is an ideal place to spend a vacation with children.  In addition, for those who, along with swimming in sea waters, are not averse to swimming in fresh water, Romania suggests visiting several lakes close to the sea: Ajigol, Nuntas, Costinesti, and combine spending time on the beach with recreation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Romanian resorts" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/478676.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Constanta </h2><p>  This is the third largest city in the country and the largest Black Sea port, as well as a great place for sea holidays.

The poet Ovidios is considered the patron saint of Constanta, in the city you can see his statue. </p><h2>  Mom, I </h2><p>  Just five kilometers from Constanta is another popular resort - Mamaia.  It lies on a sand spit between the Black Sea and a large freshwater lake called Syutghiol.  Many people always associate sea vacations in Romania with this place, because Mamaia is one of the country's oldest resorts.  The coastline here stretches for eight kilometers, and the beach has a width of one hundred to two hundred meters.  The city has a very extensive network of hotels: more than sixty hotels, several villas, campsites.  There are also several amusement parks, the only water park in Romania with water slides, attractions and a cable car, a dolphinarium, spa centers, many discos and bars, water sports centers.  And the best part is that all these entertainments are just a few steps away from the sea waves.  In the summer, a theater operates and an exciting music festival takes place.  It is worth noting that in comparison with other resorts of the country the prices for many services are higher, but the comfort of accommodation is at a higher level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="black sea romania" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/478679.jpg" width="600"></div>
