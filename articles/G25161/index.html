  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Guangdong, China: location, description, history of the province, photos and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The People's Republic of China is a kaleidoscope of emotions and discoveries, a piece of the Earth in which the past and the present are connected and where every tourist will find something interesting and memorable for himself.  A rich history, exotic cuisine, profitable shopping, modern buildings - this and much more awaits travelers in the Middle Kingdom.  The territory of the PRC includes several units of the provincial level: provinces, autonomous regions, cities of special subordination and special administrative regions.  Every corner of China is unique in its own way: wonderful nature, man-made monuments and, of course, people who preserve centuries-old traditions and culture of the country.  Today we will get acquainted with the province of Guangdong (China), which is called a place of contrasts, ancient and progressive at the same time. </p><h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  Guangdong Province (China) is located on the coast of the South China Sea and is the gateway to the special administrative regions of the PRC - Hong Kong and Macau.  Its area is 178 thousand square meters.  km </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": Joowwww, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Map of China with Guangdong" class="if uuid-2612861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92555/2612861.jpg"></div><p>  The climate of Guangdong is subtropical, monsoon.  The average January temperature does not fall below +8 ¬∞ C, and the average July temperature does not exceed 28 ¬∞ C.  The province is the warmest region of the Middle Kingdom and has a beautiful nature: full-flowing rivers, evergreen forests, a chain of relatively high mountain ranges in the north, west and east, and in the south and in the center - plateaus, hills and plains.  The distribution of precipitation varies from north to south in the direction of increase and ranges from 1300 to 2500 mm per year.  The province includes approximately 750 islands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The first tribes living in the province were Yue, which later became the basis of Chinese society - the Han people.  Yue is an abbreviation for Bayue (one hundred yue), the collective name of the peoples living in the province.  The first emperor of China, Qin Shihuang in 226 BC.  e.  He conquered the territory of the province, and the hieroglyph ‚Äúguan‚Äù, by which the district was designated, meant ‚Äúspace‚Äù or ‚Äúhuge‚Äù.  During the <span>conquest of the Chinese</span> states <span>by the Mongols, the</span> province was subordinate to the conquerors.  Starting from the 16th century, European peoples settled in the territories of China, which also influenced the situation of the province.  Only from the middle of the 20th century, Guangdong completely came under the control of the PRC and until the end of the 70s remained a territory with a low standard of living.  The new political and economic course radically changed the situation: the coastal province, which in the past served as the main trade route, as well as emigration and revolutionary springboards, has become a place of concentration of export-oriented enterprises. </p><h2>  The current state of Guangdong </h2><p>  Currently, Guangdong in China is one of the most economically developed provinces, the locomotive of the Chinese economy.  The main areas of activity are industry, agriculture, the extraction of certain minerals and the service sector.  The province is divided into 19 urban districts and 2 cities of sub-provincial significance - Guangzhou and Shenzhen.  In Guangdong, more than 50 nationalities live, the bulk of which are the Han.  Residents of the central regions of the province speak <span>Cantonese,</span> which differs from Putonghua - the main dialect of China - in lexical, phonetic and partially grammatical terms.  Moreover, this dialect is unofficial in Hong Kong and Macau.  It is used even by politicians and is popularized with the help of modern songs and cinema.  Religions practiced in Chinese Guangdong are Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism.  The main cultural sites of the province are located in cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Foshan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Guangzhou (Guangdong, China) </h2><p>  Guangzhou City is the capital of Chinese Guangdong.  It is the fourth largest city in China after Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.  Guangzhou is the center of southern culture of China, the largest commercial and industrial city.

The TV tower resembles a refined female figure, for which it is unofficially called a ‚Äúsupermodel‚Äù.  Entrance to the TV tower is paid and depends on the level at which it is planned to rise (there are 5 in total: from A to E).  All levels have their own entertainment: attractions, restaurants, 4D theater and other options for a memorable trip around the tower.  At the top (the very last level), there is an observation platform from which a beautiful panorama of the city opens.  At night, the TV tower is highlighted with all the colors of the rainbow and looks very impressive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.arup.com" data-author=": Zhou Ruogu, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Guangzhou Illuminated TV Tower" class="if uuid-2612868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92555/2612868.jpg"></div><h2>  Central City Square (Huacheng Square) </h2><p>  In the city center on the banks of the Pearl River, one of the most beautiful places in Guangzhou is located - Hua Cheng Square, buried in dozens of skyscrapers and greenery of alleys and squares.
