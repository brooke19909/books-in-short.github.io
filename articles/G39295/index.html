    <p>  Since groups of freaks may soon leave Goa, you should definitely visit excursions to their habitats.  The civilized world of tourism has become more popular here, and there is little room for local hippies.  However, many still come to these parts to lead a free and trouble-free life, and some even meet old age as a hippie.  In North Goa, of course, there are places with a more familiar atmosphere of relaxation. </p><p>  In the local flavor, you can also meet the usual nightlife with interesting parties, listen to familiar music and chat with locals or tourists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Relaxing holiday </h2>
