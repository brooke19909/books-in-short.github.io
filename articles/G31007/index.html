    <h2>  At the dawn of history </h2><p>  So, in ancient civilizations, where the <span>political system was</span> formed long ago and the top of society was determined, every ordinary resident should pay tribute.  <span>This is a tax that</span> was supplied to the state directly or through a link, which was most often the owner.  As a rule, he was accrued in accordance with the area of ‚Äã‚Äãland that a person owned, the number of crops that he collected, and also based on how many slaves were subordinate to a particular master.  In the period from the 3rd to the 1st millennium BC, only military personnel who, in fact, were dependent on the government, could not pay tribute to the state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay tribute" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/321406.jpg" width="599"></div>

People gave away what they grew on their lands, and they also took away everything that they made from their raw materials.  In China, the tax was paid with rice, later weaving began to develop, and high-quality silk was used.  Also, silver was mined on these lands, which was confiscated from workers and peasants by representatives of the ruling elite.  Egypt and Mesopotamia are countries where the slave trade was most developed.  It was live labor that was very much appreciated there, so all the representatives of slaves passed from one owner to another tirelessly. </p><h2>  Cash levies in Kievan Rus </h2><p>  Later, all the ancient Slavic tribes appeared under the same flag, among which were glades, Drevlyans, Dregovichi, Duleby, Vyatichi, Northerners and many others who lived both in the north and off the coast of the Black and <span>Caspian Seas.</span>  The country began to be called Kievan Rus, and was headed by its <span>dynasty of Rurikovich.</span>  It was the representatives of this family that all residents of the state had to pay tribute.  It was already money, which was referred to as dimes.  The amount of funds paid depended on the living conditions of the peasant.  The requisition was always accompanied by a love of people.  It was an event when the prince, along with his squad, went to collect these same taxes, going around all the settlements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="collect tribute" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/321405.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tax capture and increase </h2><p>  Later, the Mongol-Tatars began to collect tribute from the Russians, who conquered Russia in the 13th century.  As a rule, nobody gave taxes directly to the khans; princes brought them, each of which was assigned to a separate city.  Since all subsequent rulers of the <span>empire of Genghis Khan</span> were distinguished by anarchist mood, barbarism and the commission of robberies, there were often cases of the sale of people.  In such a situation, it was the man who acted as a tribute. </p><p>  Throughout the entire historical period of mankind, up to the present moment, ordinary people do not stop paying a fee to the state in which they live.  Today, tribute is a tax that is deducted from the salary of any employee of a state institution, as well as the funds that each private entrepreneur gives to the state treasury. </p>
