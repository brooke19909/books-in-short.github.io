  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interesting patterns and simple patterns</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are many shops and ateliers.  The dress can be bought or ordered in any of them.  But not every girl is in a hurry to get ready-made outfits.  Everything is simple - a thing bought in a store can be easily seen on other people, because there are often incidents when two girls come to the same event in identical dresses.  Of course, this is not the most pleasant situation, because any representative of the fair sex wants to stand out, I want everyone to look at her only.  Sewing a dress according to the simplest patterns is easy, especially if there is a sewing machine at hand. </p><p>  At first it may seem that it is very difficult to sew a dress with your own hands.  However, the designers have developed really simple patterns for beginners, thanks to which you can make a beautiful and stylish dress or blouse during the evening.  You can also take samples of models from magazines for women.  In the 90s, this was the only way to find a pattern and sew a stylish thing for yourself.  The most popular among them was, of course, Burda.  In our article, we will consider several simple patterns of dresses for beginners, thanks to which you can make yourself a stylish outfit. </p><h2>  Why is it better to sew the product yourself? </h2><p>  Advantages of a dress made independently: </p><ol><li>  Exclusivity. </li><li>  Individual design. </li><li>  The possibility of creative expression. </li><li>  Earnings on a hobby. </li><li>  Budget Saving. </li></ol><p>  A special time for sewing the dress on your own for the first time is summer.  After all, it is by the summer that I want to update the wardrobe of any fashionista, and making a summer dress is very easy.  How to make simple dress patterns?  What fabric to choose for a product?  How to sew a product?  We will find answers to these questions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What you need to know about sewing dresses with your own hands? </h2><p>  To make simple patterns of dresses for beginners with your own hands, you need to know the following features of this work: </p><ol><li>  The fabric is marked on the wrong side. </li><li>  Material for the pattern - tracing paper, a sheet of paper or whatman paper. </li><li>  It is necessary to pin the base of the pattern to the fabric for proper marking. </li><li>  It is better to lay the fabric on a table or floor (on any flat surface).  This will allow you to avoid errors in the layout and layout. </li><li>  Be sure to process the edges and edges of the products along the slice. </li></ol><p>  The most important and necessary thing of a modern dressmaker is a sewing machine.  If the mood for tailoring a new thing appears only occasionally, then it is not necessary to buy a new one.  A manual sewing machine is also quite suitable.  You can not do without such things as scissors, tape, pins, chalk.  When these necessary items are already there, we proceed to the purchase of fabrics, threads and accessories. </p><h2>  What is better to sew simple dresses? </h2><p>  Fabric selection is a very important process for every dressmaker.  It is easiest to start sewing from plain cotton fabrics.  You can add to the list of fabrics that you should not start work with: silk, velvet, leather, satin, knitwear, fur, fabrics with a complex pattern, since you will need to dock it. </p><p>  To create a simple dress pattern with your own hands, you need to take measurements.  The centimeter tape should not sag or cover the body too tight, otherwise it may turn out a dress in which it will be difficult to move. </p><h2>  Experienced tailors recommendations </h2><p>  Before sewing on simple dress patterns, pay attention to: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Style.  Whether the things of the chosen models are suitable for your type of figure.  Will a thing emphasize its merits. </li><li>  Properties and color.  For what season will the dress be sewn (winter, summer).  Whether the selected color and texture are right for you. </li><li>  Length of the product.  Mini, midi or floor. </li><li>  Product Width  Measure whether the width of the dress is suitable for comfortable movement, is it possible to wear it without any problems. </li><li>  Levels of horizontal lines.  If, for example, a waist belt is provided, you should measure whether the length from the shoulder to the waist area matches the one on the pattern. </li><li>  The size of the neck and armhole.  It is necessary to calculate the size so that the dress you were comfortable to wear and wear. </li><li>  Seam and bottom allowances.  They must be done.  Otherwise, the product will be shorter and narrower than necessary. </li><li>  It is also worth considering that some fabrics are subject to shrinkage after washing, that is, they can become shorter and narrower.  Most of all, velvet, linen and cotton are subject to this property.  Less - chintz, cambric, poplin, satin silk, calico.  Therefore, it is worth washing the fabric before sewing. </li></ol><h2>  How to sew a dress on a simple pattern </h2><p>  The instruction is not too complicated, but requires care and accuracy. </p><ul><li>  Draw a pattern, focusing on the measurements taken. </li><li>  Transfer it to the fabric, not forgetting the seam allowances. </li><li>  Do not make too large a cut or short length, they can be changed later. </li><li>  Try on the base.  If necessary, adjust the details. </li><li>  Connect the parts on a sewing machine (you can also manually). </li><li>  Work on the edges of the product. </li></ul><p>  The basis of any dress is a pattern of a product that perfectly fits the figure, that is, the case.  Of course, this is not so easy for beginning tailors, but tailoring such a model will be a good practice. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The following are options for dresses with simple patterns for beginners. </p><h2>  Simple maxi dress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sweet-verbena.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple maxi dress" class="if uuid-2470951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87255/2470951.jpg"></div><p>  We choose a light fabric for it, since a dense one will not look beautiful.  For knitwear, a zigzag stitch is best.  For the dress you will need: a piece of fabric 150 * 165 cm (with an average height of 170 cm).  If you want to make the dress shorter, then instead of 165 cm, you can take the length to the knees (125-130 cm).  You can simply measure the length of your favorite outfit and add 10 cm to it at the seams.  The model we have presented has the simplest possible pattern ‚Äî a rectangle of 150 * 150 cm. Fold it in half and stitch it. </p><p>  The side parts are stitched, except for sections 20 cm long. These will be slots for the sleeves.  In the front of the canvas, we make a slit 15 cm long. This is the future neck.  It needs to be overcast, but you can not do this if the fabric does not crumble.  If you already have a cut of matter, but its color does not suit you, then there are a large number of dyes for different types of fabric. </p><h2>  Bright maxi dress with a belt </h2><div class="photo" data-original="alidamakes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bright maxi dress with a belt" class="if uuid-2470953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87255/2470953.jpg"></div><p>  You will need: 170 cm of knitted fabric for the base and 2 pieces of contrasting fabric 15 * 60 cm each for the belt.  We make patterns of details: </p><ol><li>  Take your favorite T-shirt.  We apply it to the fabric folded in half.  Attach with pins.  We draw a chalk around the contour, but measure the length only to the waist.  We get the basis of the upper half of the dress (do not forget the seam allowance).  The width of the straps should not be less than 5 cm. </li><li>  We measure a waist.  The bottom edge of the base should be approximately half the value obtained and allowances for the seams. </li><li>  The lower part of the dress (skirt) is made in three tiers.  Each tier should have the appearance of a rectangle, the smaller side of which is the width, and the large side is the length.  Let the width of all three tiers be the same, but you can make them different.  It depends on your imagination or on the cuts of matter at your disposal.  The length of each tier can be arbitrary.  The larger it is, the more magnificent the skirt will turn out. </li><li>  The belt should consist of 2 parts 15 * 60 cm. </li></ol><p>  Due to the stretchability of knitwear, connecting all parts of the dress is not difficult.  If the size of the cut of material allows, you can abandon 3 tiers and sew a skirt from a single piece of fabric (then there will be a simpler pattern).  An important point: when the belt is connected to the parts of the shirt, it is necessary to leave an <span>allowance for the seam</span> to attach the skirt. </p><h2>  Dress with an asymmetric hem </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.merricksart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to sew a dress with an asymmetrical hem" class="if uuid-2470949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87255/2470949.jpg"></div><p>  For work, you need 180 cm of fabric, matching the color of the thread and 70 cm of elastic tape for sewing. </p><p>  Let's make two patterns for the dress quickly and simply.  In this case, for the base we take not a T-shirt, but a T-shirt.  We use it the same way as in the previous example a T-shirt.  Now we cut a rectangle of 100 * 70 cm from the fabric (instead of 70 cm, you can choose another suitable length), sew it and get a skirt with a size of 50 * 70.  We cut diagonally with a difference of 20 cm (we get 50 cm on one edge and 70 cm on the other). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.merricksart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dress with an asymmetric hem. Scheme" class="if uuid-2470948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87255/2470948.jpg"></div><p>  Adjust the depth of cut on the future dress.  Cut a strip of fabric 2.5 cm wide, stretch it as much as possible.  We measure the length necessary for edging the sleeves and subtract 2.5 cm from it. For example: the measured length is 37.5 cm. Subtract 2.5 cm. We get 35 cm. We select the width 2.5 cm. As a result, we get a strip 35 * 2.5 cm. Next, measure the required length of fabric for the edging of the neckline.  Stretch, calculate according to the previous scheme.  Example 61.5-2.5 = 58 cm, cut in half, we get 2 parts 2.5 * 29 cm in size. Sew the fringing strips of fabric.  We process the bottom edge of the skirt.  We sew parts, leaving room for an elastic tape for sewing.  We stick the tape.  Try on a product. </p><h2>  Romantic maxi dress with pockets </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cottonandcurls.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Romantic maxi dress with pockets" class="if uuid-2470946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87255/2470946.jpg"></div><p>  To work, you need 180-270 cm of fabric with a standard width of 150 cm, 90-180 cm of lining fabric, elastic tape for sewing, threads in tone. </p><p>  Take a t-shirt as a basis.  We trace along the contour, leave allowances for the seams.  Sew in the shoulder area and side parts.  Cut 4 parts in the form of a drop from the lining fabric, sew on.  Next, a simple pattern for the bottom of the dress.  We sew a piece of fabric 100 * 150 cm into a rectangle, leaving room for pockets (the width of the skirt should be 2 times the <span>waist circumference).</span>  We get a rectangle of 75 * 100 cm. If the selected fabric is dense and heavy, then the width of the skirt should be reduced, since it will be problematic to collect it with folds at the waist.  Sew pockets into the main part of the skirt, collect it at the top.  Sew on elastic tape and the upper part of the dress.  <span>We process the neck,</span> sleeves, hem. </p><h2>  Tulip dress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="thefeltedfox.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tulip dress" class="if uuid-2470944" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87255/2470944.jpg"></div><p>  To work, you need 150 cm of fabric (in this case, knitted material is used, since it does not need to be processed along the edge).  A feature of knitwear - it must be stitched with a zigzag stitch.  We will also need matching threads and elastic tape. </p><p>  For a tulip skirt, cut a piece of fabric 140 cm wide (waist circumference multiplied by 2) and 80 cm long (or any desired).  We measure 60 cm on both sides of the cut blank.  You should get a shape that looks like a trapezoid with a base of 140 cm, an upper side of 20 cm and convex sides.  Overlap connect two edges of 140 cm at the side seams, stitch and collect with folds.  Sew the elastic tape in a zigzag stitch.  It should be 2.5 cm shorter than the waist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thefeltedfox.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tulip dress assembly" class="if uuid-2470943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87255/2470943.jpg"></div><p>  For the upper part of the dress, cut 2 parts with a width of ¬Ω waist circumference plus 20 cm (for a waist of 70 cm this is 35 + 20 = 55 cm) and a height of 45-60 cm (depending on height).  We get 2 rectangles 55 * 45 cm. On one of them we cut the neck with a depth of 3-5 cm and a width of 20 cm. We sew the shoulder and side parts.  We collect the lower edge with folds to the waist circumference parameters.  We sew both parts of the dress. </p><h2>  Dress transformer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.soyouthinkyourecrafty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dress transformer" class="if uuid-2470955" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87255/2470955.jpg"></div><p>  For the product you will need 450 cm of fabric (perfectly stretching), threads in tone. </p><p>  Sun skirt.  Calculation of the cutout radius for the waist: divide the measured girth by 6.28.  For a waist of 70 cm this is 11 cm, the diameter of the cut circle will then be 22 cm. We will choose the length of the skirt 60 cm (we can choose up to 69 cm, since the standard width of the fabric is usually 150 cm).  We do a simple do-it-yourself pattern for the skirt.  Cut out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.soyouthinkyourecrafty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Skirt pattern" class="if uuid-2476775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2476775.jpg"></div><p>  Next, we make strips for the upper half of the dress.  We calculate the width from the middle of the chest to the armpit through the center of the chest.  For example, let it be equal to 25 cm. The length of the strip should exceed the growth by 1.5 times (for example, 1 m 70 cm we multiply by 1.5 and we get 2 m 55 cm).  The result is two narrow and long strips of 25 * 255 cm. We attach both strips on the top of the skirt with a little overlap (it should be from 7 to 12 cm), sew. </p><p>  We will need another strip of fabric for a belt with a width of 16-20 cm. Fold it in half, we get a belt with a width of 8-10 cm. We also sew it on the skirt, but the seam connecting both edges of the belt should be in front.  Do not worry, this seam will be closed.  Sewed long stripes can be arranged as shown in the photo above.  As a result, you get immediately 3 options in one. </p><h2>  Bilateral dress sundress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sewinlove.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bilateral dress sundress" class="if uuid-2470950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87255/2470950.jpg"></div><p>  This little black universal dress that can be worn as a sundress has two cutout options - round or V-shaped.  To work, you need 180 cm of dense fabric, a fringing border, threads. </p><p>  Below is a drawing of a simple pattern for the 44th Russian size.  For each subsequent size, add 2 cm. Circle the pattern, add 2 cm to the allowances for seams.  We got the base for the round neck part of the dress.  We adjust the pattern so that we get a V-shaped neckline of the required depth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sewinlove.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern of a two-sided dress-sundress." class="if uuid-2475696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87255/2475696.jpg"></div><p>  To get pinches (small folds), you need to fold a piece of fabric 3 cm wide in half.  We get a fold 1.5 cm wide. In the same way we make a pinch on the other side.  The resulting folds should be turned towards the center.  The distance between them should be 5 cm. </p><p>  We sew the parts together, process the edges of the sleeves and the neckline with the edging, hem the bottom of the product.  The dress is ready for all occasions!  Thanks to the universal color and two types of cut, we get a large number of sock options. </p><h2>  Summer Maxi Dress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="cationdesigns.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Summer Maxi Dress" class="if uuid-2470952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87255/2470952.jpg"></div><p>  This is a very simple dress without a pattern that can be sewn in half an hour.  We need a piece of fabric 150 * 150 cm, threads, tape 150 cm. We cut out two parts of 75 * 150 cm in size, we sew them together with the long side.  In this case, from one end you need to leave 16-20 cm for the hands.  We bend these parts and sew the hole for the tape.  We thread it.  We will use the tape as straps.  All.  The dress is ready. </p><p>  The above dresses are easy to sew without a pattern!  Let your wardrobe become brighter and more diverse! </p>
