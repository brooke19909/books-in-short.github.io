Their products are Yotaphone.  Reviews about the model appeared on many Web resources.  Users aptly notice the advantages and disadvantages of the device.  However, some reviews have no basis.  In order for the user to understand what to expect from the device, we will try to make the most detailed review of the phone. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The Yotaphone smartphone has an impressive package.  It primarily includes the phone itself.  Included is a wired headset for talking, as well as listening to music, a charger and a clip.  It helps to remove SIM cards from a smartphone.  It is worth noting that the charger has the ability to parse.  That is, you can pull out the USB cable from it to connect the Yotaphone smartphone directly to a personal computer and synchronize data. </p>

    <p>  The kit also includes an instruction manual for the device, a napkin, with which you can wipe its screen.  In some cases (of course, not all countries have such an opportunity) a discount coupon is provided. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Yotaphone: reviews, photos, history </h2><p>  The smartphone was introduced back in 2012, and more precisely in December.  Then the device, which has two screens at once, made a rather strong impression.  The thing is that the devices of some companies embodied a similar idea before.  They were shown to their designers more than once or twice, but everything ended at this stage and did not reach the implementation.  But Russian manufacturers managed to bring their idea to life. </p><p>  The concept of the smartphone assumed a reduction in power consumption through the use of a second screen.  This was to be achieved by displaying information on an alternative screen.  At the same time, it turns out that the load from the main screen was removed. </p><p>  In general, the concept sounded great, attention was focused on it.  January 2013 was marked by an exhibition held in Las Vegas.  Already on it, the Russian smartphone was recognized as the best novelty in the smartphone industry.  Moreover, absolutely no one was confused by the fact that the sale of devices was supposed to start only in the 3rd quarter of 2013.  For an innovative approach to the development of telephone devices, the company received thunderous applause and prizes in Barcelona.  The buyer can always see the image of these awards on the box from under the Yotaphone. </p><h2>  Development delays </h2><p>  At the same time, Yota Devices believed that the development of a smartphone would take less time than actually happened.  As a result, the technical characteristics made it possible to attribute the device to an acceptable price category.  This became clear already during the announcement of the device.  What caused such a desire of the company to release a smartphone as soon as possible?  The thing is that at this time Apple is trying to break into the market, offering accessories for its products that have a similar concept. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, it would be better if Yota Devices brought the development to mind, since Apple's projects did not appear on store windows.  The reason for this was the problem in the development of technical support.  Apparently, the company did not manage to quickly resolve these issues. </p><h2>  About the second screen patent </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the concept of the second screen appeared long before Yota Devices announced it.  Samsung patents regarding this idea date back to the 2000s.  Around the same time, Nokia was developing a similar technology.  But what is really important, in reality only the Russian manufacturer manages to implement the plan. </p><p>  Two companies failed to implement projects due to the fact that the chance of selling such devices was low.  But the complexity, which was clearly seen from an engineering point of view, the problems with the technical support for the operation of such a phone - all this only repelled the manufacturers.  It turned out that the cost of development and production costs exceeded the return on production. </p><p>  Now on the mobile phone market, the first place in performance is, of course, not Yotaphone.  The Russian manufacturer, however, has achieved exactly one goal in this regard - originality.  More on the shelves of similar devices you will not find. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  Russian smartphone Yotaphone has a monoblock type case.  It is not possible to disassemble it.  The user also cannot get to the device‚Äôs battery.  It‚Äôs not worth being scared.  Now on the market there are many models with a similar housing design.  Moreover, this is not an accident, but a trend. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In all three planes, the Russian Yotaphone smartphone has the following metric data: its length is 133.6 mm, its width is 67 mm, and its thickness is 9.99 mm.  With such dimensions, the smartphone weighs 146 g. </p><p>  You can immediately say that the weight of the phone is quite large.  But the dimensions are relatively small.  A striking combination, right?  This allows you to put your phone in the palm of your hand without any problems.  By production, only plastic was used.  The user will not find any metal elements.  By the way, the plastic is made to the touch and look.  It covers the sides and the frame of the device. </p><p>  Russian smartphone Yotaphone, reviews of which in terms of design are in most cases positive, is available in black, as well as in black and white color schemes.  At the development stage, a third option was also assumed when the entire phone was white.  However, during testing, it was noticed that such a color scheme is not suitable due to rapid aging and wear. </p><p>  The device, made in black, looks very impressive.  Its front panel incorporates <span>a front-facing camera</span> .  If you look closely, on the right you can notice the sensor responsible for approaching the object.  But on the fly it is not so easy to calculate, the company took care of this. </p><p>  The left panel contains keys for adjusting the volume.  On the top face is the input for a wired headset, as well as a button that is responsible for turning on and on the Yotaphone.  Customer reviews indicate that the second microphone is very handy here, but you will have to tinker a bit with SIM cards. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  If you put the smartphone on the table, while the main screen will be located outside, then distinguishing the Yotaphone from an ordinary smartphone running the Android operating system will be quite problematic.  The screen is not so big.  Its diagonal is only 4.3 inches.  At the same time, the display of 16.7 million different colors is provided due to the resolution of 720 X 1280 pixels. </p><p>  Immediately it is worth saying that the pictures are displayed in high quality.  The smartphone has a very nice color reproduction.  In sunlight, he also behaves well in this regard.  Perhaps the only drawback is only the size.  If you have used the iPhone for a long time, then, in principle, nothing bad will happen, and you will not even notice the difference between the screens.  But if you previously used devices running <span>Android or Windows Phone,</span> which had a screen diagonal of 4.7 inches (and also more), then you will surely be unpleasantly surprised.  If we talk about the strength of the display, then <span>Gorilla Glass</span> is used here <span>.</span> </p><p>  With such <span>screen sizes</span> , the user will not have problems writing SMS messages, making calls, listening to music.  However, constantly ‚Äúsurfing‚Äù the Network, sitting on social networks, reading e-books and articles using Yotaphone - all this is clearly not the best thing to do. </p><p>  The second screen (we immediately warn those who do not have experience with this smartphone) is not touch.  Almost all users come across this rake.  The screen is controlled by the touch zone located below.  The size remains the same, equal to 4.3 inches, but the resolution changes.  This time it is only 360 X 640 pixels.  The screen has no backlight.  That is why working with it seems possible only if there is a light source. </p><p>  But if the screen is well lit, then the picture on it will be quite high quality.  Coverage can please those users who constantly carry phones in their bags, pockets, in general, anywhere, but along with other items.  The thing is that the coating is not erased.  It is practically impossible to get any scratches from carrying along with the same keys. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  The battery has a lithium-ion type, its capacity is 1800 mAh, which is quite acceptable.  On the Web, it‚Äôs impossible to find the exact information about the operating time.  However, in practical use, it turns out that you can talk on the phone for an hour and a half, send several dozen messages, listen to music for about an hour, read information from the screen for about an hour, and then the smartphone will last one day without additional charge. </p><p>  If you are an active user, the phone will be discharged closer to noon.  There is no particular mystery in this.  However, with such a small screen, it is quite doubtful that the buyer will use this smartphone to constantly ‚Äúsurf‚Äù the Internet.  Ordinary users working according to the ‚Äúcalls - SMS - calls - SMS‚Äù plan will be able to use the phone all day.  The battery is fully charged in just one and a half hours. </p><p>  To summarize, we can say why Yotaphone was nevertheless developed.  Reviews about him demonstrate that the device is suitable only in terms of an ‚Äúelite dialer‚Äù.  Otherwise, it makes no sense to buy it as such. </p><h2>  Processor performance </h2>

    <p>  Everything is much more interesting here.  In fact, after activating the device, only half of the memory is available to the user.  The size of RAM is 2 GB, while the built-in is 32 GB.  The user can use for his personal needs only about 26 GB of the allocated volume.  In principle, both in terms of long-term memory and ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù, the situation is quite stable.  It is worth noting that in terms of performance, the smartphone can still please.  Yotaphone, reviews of which are generally rated "good", show that, in <span>technical terms, the</span> device is not inferior to similar ones. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The brightness and saturation of photos in this smartphone model is at a high level.  The camera has a resolution of 13 megapixels, while allowing you to shoot video in high quality.  The frame rate can reach 30 pieces per second.  Auto focus fails periodically. </p><p>  With all these advantages, by viewing photos using a personal computer, the user can make sure that the pictures are not so high-quality.  If the illumination is poor, then you can completely forget about the good quality of the photos.  If the developers of the model want, they will certainly improve the quality of the device in this regard.  However, all this is now nothing more than rumors, at least until the official announcement and presentation of the new model. </p><p>  Photo quality is minus the Yotaphone.  Testimonials and examples clearly show that many devices at lower prices make pictures unmatched better. </p><h2>  Yotaphone: reviews of foreigners </h2><p>  Products of the Russian manufacturer are actively sold abroad.  The opinions of foreign smartphone users are not too different from the opinions of our compatriots.  In any case, the company has room to grow, what to develop and what to improve.  Yotaphone, whose user reviews are polar, is now clearly not in the forefront of phone purchases.  However, perhaps with time the situation will change. </p>
