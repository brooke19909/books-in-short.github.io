    <p>  The house caused a lot of controversy and criticism, but in the end the project was approved and built. </p><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  The building, which was previously located on the site of the Dancing House, was destroyed in World War II.  And almost half a century the place was empty until the Dancing House appeared. </p><p>  Prague has acquired a new attraction thanks to the decision of President <span>Vaclav Havel.</span>  It was he who suggested starting construction on an empty place.  According to rumors, the neighboring house belonged to the Havel family before nationalization. </p><p>  Of course, it is difficult to say what was the main circumstance in the construction of the Dancing House, but the president decided to erect the building, which was designed by Vlado Milunich, in a vacant lot. </p><p>  The insurance company, which bought the land in the wasteland, has put forward a demand for the participation of a well-known western architect in the project.  The choice fell on the famous <span>Frank Gehry.</span> </p><h2>  Home construction </h2><p>  The architects of the dancing house were Vlado Milunich and Frank Owen Gehry.  The most modern technologies and materials of that time were used to build the Dancing House. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Prague first acquired a building in the style of deconstructivism.  This is a new direction, which involves visual complexity, unexpected forms and aggressive invasion of the urban environment. </p><p>  Design was carried out using special three-dimensional image programs.  The house required great precision calculations.  The indirect lines of this unusual house suggest that it is about to break.  But professionals worked on it, and there should not be any fears. </p><p>  The construction of the unusual house began in 1994 and was personally supervised by the president. </p><p>  The main architectural idea is an analogy with the famous dance couple - <span>Fred Astaire</span> and Ginger Rogers. </p>

    <p>  At first glance, the architectural concept becomes clear.  The building is as if divided into two parts.  One part is like a man, and the second is like a woman in a skirt who flutters in a dance. </p>

    <p>  Half of the building at first glance is not much different from the houses surrounding it, but if you look closely, you will notice that all the windows and walls are a little curved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second part of the building is more curved and has a large angle of inclination.  It is almost completely covered with glass panels and has a modern look, while all the surrounding houses have retained a <span>Romanesque style.</span> </p><p>  At the very top of one of the buildings is an observation deck and a kind of dome made of iron structures and antennas. </p><p>  In 1996, the Dancing House was built.  Prague received another <span>beautiful building</span> and became famous throughout the world for its unusual architecture. </p><h2>  Criticism </h2><p>  Everything new and incomprehensible always scared people and caused sharp criticism.  Even the Eiffel Tower, which became a <span>symbol of France,</span> did not escape this. </p><p>  The construction of such an original house caused a lot of discontent among the townspeople, because it was built in a completely different architectural style than its neighbors. </p>

    <p>  But this did not last very long.  And soon after construction, the house was recognized as a Prague highlight. </p><h2>  New home owner </h2><p>  The name of the Dancing House in Prague changed on December 17, 2013 to Ginger and Fred.  On this day, the famous building was sold to a collector of unusual structures Vaclav Skale for $ 18 million. </p><p>  Now the house has a more precise name in honor of two dancers who inspired architects to create it - Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.  This star couple shone on the screens in the 30-40s of the last century. </p><p>  Ginger and Fred is not the only building in the style of deconstructivism, but it has rightfully earned its fame.  A spokesman for Jones Lang LaaSalle, which was selling the Dancing House, said such facilities would always be in demand. </p><h2>  Dancing house today </h2><p>  When the building was just built, it was assumed that it would be the cultural center of the capital and museums would be located in the Dancing House.  But everything turned out differently. </p><p>  Today, "Drunk House" is used as a business center, mainly there are offices of international companies.  There is a French restaurant on the roof.  There you can enjoy not only the great taste of the dishes, but also a beautiful view of the Czech capital. </p>

    <p>  True, this pleasure is not cheap.  Very often, newlyweds come to celebrate their wedding at the Dancing House. </p><p>  Prague opens on the other side, if you go up to the observation deck of the tower.  You can enjoy views of Prague Castle and the Vltava River embankment.  Or just watch the course of Czech life. </p><p>  Inside, the interiors of the first three floors are made by the designer Eva Jorge and are suited in style to the architecture of the building. </p><h2>  Where is the dancing house in Prague located </h2><p>  The dancing house is one of the sights of Prague, so it can be found on any map or in a guidebook. </p>

    <p>  The ‚ÄúDrunk House‚Äù stands at the intersection of Rashinova Embankment and Resslova Street.  If you get to it from Charles Bridge, then it will not take much time.  You need to go along the promenade to the side of the National Theater, without turning anywhere.  Ten minutes later, a Dancing House will appear in sight. </p><p>  Building address: Rasinovo nabrezi, 80. Nearby there is the Karlovo Namesti metro station, which belongs to the <span>yellow line.</span> </p>
