At the peak of prosperity (in 1050), under Henry III, it included Germanic, Czech, Italian and Burgundy territories.  She grew up from the East Frankish kingdom, proclaiming herself the heiress of Great Rome, in accordance with the medieval idea of ‚Äã‚Äã"translatio imperii" ("transition of the empire").  The Holy <span>Roman Empire</span> represented a conscious attempt to revive the state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holy Roman Empire" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4583/77939.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <p>  True, by 1600, only a shadow of the former glory remained of her.  Her heart was Germany, which by this period represented many principalities, successfully asserting themselves in their independent position under the rule of the emperor, who never had absolute status.  Therefore, since the end of the fifteenth century, it is better known as the Holy Roman <span>Empire of the German</span> nation. <strong> </strong></p><p>  The most important territories belonged to the seven electors of the emperor (the King of Bavaria, the Margrave of Brandenburg, the Duke of Saxony, the Palatinate of the Rhine and the three archbishops of Mainz, Trier and Cologne), who are referred to as the first estate.  The second consisted of indiscriminate princes, the third - from the leaders of 80 free imperial cities.  Representatives of the estates (princes, princes, lords, kings) were theoretically subject to the emperor, but each possessed sovereignty on their lands and acted as they considered necessary, based on their own considerations.  The Holy Roman Empire was never able to achieve the political unification that existed in France, developing instead into a decentralized, limited electoral monarchy, made up of hundreds of subunits, principalities, districts, free imperial cities and other areas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holy Roman Empire of the German nation" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4583/77940.jpg" width="336"></div>

The most significant area was the Czech Republic (Bohemia).  When Rudolph II became emperor, he defined Prague as its capital.  According to the testimonies of his contemporaries, he was a very interesting, intelligent, judicious person.  However, unfortunately, Rudolph suffered from bouts of insanity that developed from his tendency to depression.  This has greatly affected the government structure.  More and more privileges of power were in the hands of Matthias, his brother, despite the fact that he did not have any authority on it.  The German princes tried to take advantage of this problem, but as a result (by 1600) they not only did not combine their efforts, but, on the contrary, there was a split between them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The formation of the Holy Roman Empire" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4583/80914.jpg" width="401"></div>

    <p>  So, to summarize what has been said.  The main milestones of the political union of territories: the formation of the Holy Roman Empire occurred in 962.  Otton, its founder, was crowned pope in Rome.  Since <span>1600, the</span> power of emperors was only nominal. </p><p>  Although some of them tried to change their position and strengthen their positions of power, their attempts were averted by the papacy and the princes.  The last was Franz II, who, under pressure from Napoleon I, refused the title, thereby putting an end to its existence. </p>
