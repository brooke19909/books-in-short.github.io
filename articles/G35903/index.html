  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Active investor. How you can earn fast and a lot</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, income can be obtained in different ways.  There are, for example, traditional earning options, such as finding a job or starting your own business.  Or you can arrange for passive income.  This alternative earning channel is called investing. </p><p>  Who is an active investor?  I must say that this is primarily a person who is constantly in search of new opportunities for himself to invest money to make subsequent profits.  Moreover, his goal is not ephemeral profit in the very distant future, which his investments will be able to give, but earnings here and now. </p><p>  An investor is a subject of investment activity, investing their own, borrowed or borrowed money for profit.  He can be a natural person, legal entity, including a foreign one, less often - a state authority, an international organization.  Capital is most often invested in objects of entrepreneurial activity - companies, startups, hedge funds, real estate, works of art, securities, precious metals and so on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blogs.cfainstitute.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what can you earn" class="if uuid-3204149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3204149.jpg"></div><h2>  Basic concepts </h2><p>  Terms of investments, as a rule, range from a couple of minutes to several weeks.  Against this background, it is not important whether the company is good or bad, whose shares are acquired.  Active investors predict the movement of value over a certain time interval (it doesn‚Äôt matter which side up or down), and only make a deal based on this forecast.  If successful, they make a profit, sometimes very significant.  It can reach twenty percent a week. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Active investors are also called traders.  In the Russian language there is an excellent word for them, which sounds like a ‚Äúspeculator‚Äù - that is, bought at a low price, and resold, of course, more expensive.  And if earlier they gave a deadline for it, now it is a full-fledged profession, and very profitable. </p><p>  Active investors or traders are constantly in front of the computer, watching quotes, studying statistics and important financial news.  In fact, this is their job.  The more profitable transactions they make, the higher income they have.  Some individuals trade on several platforms at once, and taking into account the time difference, it turns out that they track quotes twelve hours a day.  But this, of course, is an extreme case.  Typically, traders trade eight to nine hours a day. </p><h2>  Active investing </h2><p>  From the point of view of active investors, it is necessary to look for entry points to markets that have significant growth potential in short periods of time.  Of course, it is impossible to catch all the good points.  But even if you take only twenty percent of all possible transactions, for the year comes the profit in the region of four hundred percent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pakitips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to invest to earn" class="if uuid-3204143" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3204143.jpg"></div><h2>  What should be chosen: active or passive type of investment? </h2><p>  In that case, if you pay attention to large business, it is clear that financial corporations with banks and management companies are not actively involved in investing.  Any of their investments are aimed at long terms.  Their business is constantly evolving and expanding regularly.  Next, we find out what are the differences between the process of active and passive investment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Active and passive investor: the difference </h2><p>  First of all, the difference lies in time costs.  And they are not in favor of active investors, who are forced to constantly look for opportunities to make profitable investments.  Their profitability directly depends on this.  There are no deals, which means there is no income.  Passive investors are freed completely from this.  Money works for them, and not vice versa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.miningpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="active investment" class="if uuid-3204146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3204146.jpg"></div><p>  The next difference is the safety of funds.  The factor of maximum portfolio diversification enables passive investors to sleep peacefully.  When investing at long intervals, the risk of getting to minus is almost zero.  For traders, everything is exactly the opposite.  They risk their investments in every transaction.  And in the event that the principles of money management are not used, then the danger of losing the lion's share of active investment is commonplace. </p><p>  The main advantage of passive investors is constant profit.  Let it be small, but stable.  This is what active investors cannot earn, who earn thirty percent of profit in one period, and who subsequently don‚Äôt get a penny or even go minus.  And they can do serious losses for several months in a row. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="arrowglobalcareers.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="who is an active investor" class="if uuid-3204148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3204148.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, on the one hand, the process of active investment provides investors with a lot of different opportunities for successful investment.  Using a short-term trend, you can earn good money.  In this regard, theoretically active traders should receive greater profitability compared to passive counterparts.  Next, let's talk about where to invest in order to earn.  How to make the right choice? </p><h2>  How can I make money?  We consider options </h2><p>  How to earn fast and a lot?  In fact, if desired, this can be done absolutely everywhere and in any field.  You only need to learn how to distinguish assets from liabilities, then activity in almost every area can turn into a gold mine. </p><p>  Here are the most popular ways to earn money. </p><h2>  Stock exchange </h2><p>  This is the most popular option, allowing you to earn a large amount without putting much effort.  Many, wondering how much you can earn on stocks, think that playing the stock market is a common hoax.  But there are people who do not even doubt that if you believe in your luck, you can get a decent profit without any problems.  If a person decides to make a game on the stock exchange, it should be remembered that this is associated with risks.  Therefore, before investing your money, you need to learn how to make bets by selling stocks on time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="technians.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to earn fast and a lot" class="if uuid-3204144" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3204144.jpg"></div><h2>  Foreign services </h2><p>  In the event that a person knows how to sell goods with services, you can try to become an intermediary, getting your commission.  This is the easiest way to earn one thousand rubles per hour without any investment.  You can sell other people's services along with information products for affiliate programs.  You can do this kind of business on the Internet or offline.  For online activities, it is advisable to have a group on social networks.  If this is not possible, then you should post links on the forums and get paid for it. </p><h2>  Resale sites </h2><p>  Recently, many people often ask how you can earn a lot of money in a short time.  The easiest way is making money on the Internet.  A person can create his own website, due to which he will receive a good income from advertising. </p><p>  Another quite promising option is the resale of underrated ready-made sites.  Such a business will bring good profits.  For starters, it‚Äôs worth trying to make money on your own blogs or online resources to gain experience.  After a person understands the specifics of the sites, you can proceed to resell them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.resolveindia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="active and passive investor" class="if uuid-3204147" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3204147.jpg"></div><h2>  Fulfillment of various assignments </h2><p>  Modern people, as a rule, are very busy at work, in this regard, they simply don‚Äôt have enough time to do everyday homework, for example, to take out the garbage or go shopping for necessary things.  This is another answer to the question of what you can earn.  Performing such small orders, you can also receive a certain income.  This is a great option for where and how to earn money for students while studying.  You can find several regular customers, and then get to work.  Usually they pay for the execution of a small assignment not bad, therefore, over time, a person can make a small capital, and then open his own business. </p><h2>  Supply sector </h2><p>  Any activity related to the sale or storage of various goods carries a high income.  If a person is looking for what kind of job he is better off making a lot of money, you should pay attention to the available vacancies of storekeepers and sellers.  Shop staff usually have some privileges.  For example, they buy without margin any goods that arrive at the warehouse, which can significantly save the budget. </p><p>  There are other professions in which you can earn a lot.  Nowadays, good salaries are offered to managers, lawyers and economists.  To get a similar profession, you need to study at a university, and then master it in practice.  In addition, you can try your hand at the role of sales representative or sales manager. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wealth-creation-academy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much can you earn on stocks" class="if uuid-3204145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3204145.jpg"></div><h2>  Medical services </h2><p>  Future students, as part of their choice of educational institution, are often interested in what profession they can earn a lot in the future.  Recently, a rather large number of private clinics have opened in the country, which constantly require good doctors with nurses and other medical personnel.  Such specialists are widely demanded in the labor market in absolutely any economic conditions.  In order to get a decent salary, you can find a job in a medical non-governmental institution.  You can also find a good job in a laboratory, clinic or scientific institute. </p>
