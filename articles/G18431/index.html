    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  A small number of negative opinions are received by the Iberostar Safira Palms 4 * hotel.  Reviews in 2016 note that the service of guests here has noticeably worsened.  Tourists noted the following disadvantages of the complex: </p><ul><li>  The hotel flies a huge number of flies, but most of them in the restaurant.  Guests recommend buying an insect repellent in advance. </li><li>  The restaurant serves food on poorly washed dishes.  Teaspoons give out and at all plastic.  The room smells unpleasant. </li><li>  Guides constantly impose visits to excursions, but do not help with the solution of problems. </li><li>  The rooms smell damp.  The cleaners do not wash the floors, so there is a lot of sand left on them. </li><li>  The hotel does not have elevators, so tourists with sore feet are best to choose the rooms on the ground floor. </li><li>  There is no infrastructure near the complex.  Behind its territory, a wasteland begins, where a lot of garbage is lying. </li><li>  There are jellyfish in the sea.  Sometimes floating algae or other debris can be found in the water. </li></ul><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Iberostar Safira Palms 4 * hotel can be recommended to tourists who are looking for a place for a relaxing holiday.  Most often, elderly people or families with children stay here.  There are no nightclubs and bars nearby, so youth companies should look for another complex that is closer to the central part of the resort.  Tourists note that the cost of living here is consistent with local service.  The hotel itself deserves its four-star status. </p>
