  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Winter bream fishing</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the afternoon, fishing for bream on the lake in the winter begins with a choice of location.  As usual, all good places have been tested by <span>winter fishing enthusiasts,</span> and there is a high degree of probability that a large company of forest breeds has gathered in the place of a good bream bream, and winter bream is in full swing.  But you should not rely heavily on this landmark, because two or three people can have a normal bite, and the rest can work with mormyshka without any result. </p><p>  During winter, the favorite habitat of the bream is deep places, so when you arrive at the reservoir you must try to determine the topography of the bottom.  To do this, you should drill a certain number of holes, starting from the shore and moving towards the center of the reservoir through a distance of about ten to fifteen meters.  By sequentially measuring the depth, we find its difference in some of the sections, and in this area we drill a few more holes to find the ‚Äúdump‚Äù - i.e.  a sharp change in the depth of the bottom.  It is such a site and is a favorite place for bream in search of food.  If in the middle of such a dump there is a horizontal step (a bream dining table) of small sizes, you can rejoice - today there will be a catch. </p><p>  After choosing a place and drilling the required number of holes, winter <span>fishing of the bream</span> goes into the phase of bait.  You do not need to immediately build your calculations on the great activity of the bream, sometimes you can wait a couple of hours for the first bite.  But in this case, do not give in to panic, because the winter fishing of the bream is designed for the whole <span>daylight,</span> and you will definitely take your catch.  And at present, it is especially important not to show even a drop of pity for the bait, and to deliver three or four handfuls of ‚Äúdirty bloodworms‚Äù to the bottom.  This is the name of a bloodworm with soil - bait, which is easy to handle, quite versatile, and has good efficiency.  Naturally, in retail outlets, you can find many different impurities and bait, which are not so bad, but they are not always distinguished by their effectiveness. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Why mix bloodworms with soil?  Firstly, the consumption of bloodworms is less, one handful of it is divided into three or four servings with soil.  Secondly, the soil begins to be washed out of the feeder delivered to the bottom, and the bream is such a fish that loves the turbidity that has appeared.  The bait must be dosed - first you need three servings, and then gradually, after twenty to thirty minutes, add one more. </p><p>  In anticipation of the first bite, which may not happen soon, we begin to set up all <span>winter gear for catching</span> bream.  Each winter bream hunter sets up one fishing rod together with tackle for active fishing, and two or three fishing rods for a passive state.  This means that with one fishing rod equipped with a mormyshka, the fisherman plays an active game, and the rest are above the holes in a calm state, and they are simply being monitored.  For a fishing rod that is active, it is preferable to use an ant with two or three bloodworms on its hook.  For fishing rods that are in a passive state, the ‚Äúlittle devil‚Äù is best suited, which is suspended from the fishing line at a certain angle, in this position it is very attractive for the bream. </p><p>  When the winter tackle for bream fishing is set up, you need to pick up a fishing rod for active action and start a smooth game with a jigsaw.  If biting is not observed, do not worry, and wait a bit when the bait will begin to act for real.  Now, winter bream fishing is moving into its main phase.  First, on one, and then on the other fishing rod, the nods begin to tremble finely.  Now we need a not-so-sharp, but rather sweeping cut at the time of lowering, or vice versa, lifting the fishing rod.  Two minutes of uncompromising struggle - and the first scavenger is already trembling on the ice. </p>
