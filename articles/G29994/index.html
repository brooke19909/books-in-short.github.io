    <p>  The opening took place in 1999.  During the construction, materials and equipment of a safe and modern nature were used, raw materials and technical developments were better used.  Because of this, and now the administration is awarded a large number of awards for the safety and quality of the services provided.  In 2007, the institution was called the best in the European space; in 2012, a prestigious certificate was received for excellent service. </p><p>  The institution operates, as a rule, from May to October, since it depends on climatic conditions.  In late spring and autumn, opening hours are from 10:00 to 17:00, in the summer from 10:00 to 18:00. </p><p>  A wonderful experience brings water park in Limassol.  Entrance prices are as follows: 29 euros for an adult, 16 - for a child older than 3 years.  Toddlers under 3 years old are admitted free of charge. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is a drive, adrenaline spills out when you move down one of the 22 local slides.  For each age, there is a solution. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Location - An area called Fassouri.  To reach it, you need to drive 15 minutes from the city center or 10 minutes from the highway called Limassol - Paphos. </p><p>  Shuttle buses operate in the right direction throughout the day.  You can catch transport at one of the bus stations, the first of which is located near La Meridien - a hotel in which many tourists live. </p><p>  In the morning there are 4 flights.
