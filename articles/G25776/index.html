This guide lists the factors to consider when buying a model that best meets the needs of the car owner. </p><p>  A DVR is an essential gadget for a car.  The device allows you to document long trips and use the video to protect against unfounded claims in case of emergency.  If the early models were used by the police, now their popularity has grown so much that the market is replete with many options with different functionalities. </p><h2>  How is the DVR different from a regular camcorder? </h2><p>  It performs unusual functions: </p><ul><li>  automatically turns on and off, that is, the camera starts and stops working independently without outside interference; </li><li>  records video in a continuous cycle, while deleting the oldest file when the memory card is full so that you can continue shooting. </li></ul><p>  These are the two most important functions that each DVR has. </p><p>  With the popularity of these devices, models with advanced features have appeared.  So why do you need a DVR and what is the use of it? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Which DVR to choose" class="if uuid-2262439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2262439.jpg"></div><h2>  Objective witness </h2><p>  The DVR can be very useful in case of an accident.  In case of an incident, the saved record is useful for determining the cause of the incident.  The video is evidence that allows you to be sure that the other side will not distort the facts in their favor.  Sometimes an accident occurs instantly, and its culprit can blame the victim.  In such cases, recording will be of substantial help. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Remedy for scammers </h2><p>  The DVR record can be used to refute fraudulent allegations of accidents during the accident. </p><p>  There is a category of intruders who extort money from victims, claiming injuries and damage to the car resulting from the accident.  Thanks to the video, you can identify the true culprit and thereby save the victim from unjust persecution. </p><h2>  Protection </h2><p>  Many DVRs continue to work even when the car is turned off.  Their cameras give the owner a video of the cabin and the surrounding area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe parking lot.  Thus, if someone damages the car during parking or if the parking lot does it, then there will be evidence that will allow to pursue the attacker. </p><p>  Using the DVR, you can also check whether auto mechanics abuse the client‚Äôs car they have trusted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="car dvr" class="if uuid-2262430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2262430.jpg"></div><h2>  Long-distance travel documentation </h2><p>  If you plan a long trip along a scenic road, the DVR can be used to document the trip.  The footage is useful for creating a movie about the trip or just as a memory of your adventures. </p><h2>  Insurance claims </h2><p>  Recording a DVR can serve as the basis for the presentation and acceptance of insurance claims.  And some insurance companies offer those who have installed this device in their car significant discounts, since such motorists are cautious and attentive drivers who feel safer with solid proof that they are right.  This is true, but only in the case of a clear and high-quality record, on which all the elements of the road are visible and the registration number of the vehicle of the culprit can be distinguished. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ten features of good quality </h2><p>  As mentioned above, there are many different types of DVRs on the market, from models with basic functions to multifunction devices.  Depending on the budget and the needs of the motorist, you can select those of them, the presence of which is necessary in the first place. </p><p>  Below are some tips on how to choose the right DVR for your car. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Which DVR is better to choose" class="if uuid-2262443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2262443.jpg"></div><h2>  Video quality </h2><p>  Video quality is the most important feature of the DVR.  The best models are distinguished by good resolution and clear video output.  A grainy image and a quiet sound will not help, and such frames will be useless in insurance and accident cases.  The driver should look for devices with an excellent camera and good video resolution - 720p or 1080p.  Models with lower image quality are cheaper, but blurry video does not meet the requirements for it.  Before choosing a DVR, you need to view the video made with it.  An example of an excellent model in this regard is, according to user reviews, the Aspiring GT9, which provides shooting in 1080p format with a viewing angle of 148 ¬∞. </p><p>  Videos should be shot in different scenarios - in low light conditions, day and night.  The best way to make a decision is to look at the frames of real users, and not made by the manufacturer.  Manufacturers strive to record under ideal conditions, so the material they shot looks better than usual. </p><p>  Video quality depends on the image sensor, processor and lens.  Before choosing a DVR for a car, you should make sure that the camera has a large field of view and captures the image at a wide angle.  Of great importance is optics.  Glass lenses are considered better than plastic. </p><h2>  Storage capacity </h2><p>  Since the DVR is constantly shooting, it is important to purchase a device with sufficient memory.  Cyclic registration involves saving the video on top of the very first recording.  If the amount of data storage is small, then the device begins to delete earlier video files of the same trip.  As a result, a small amount of video will remain, which is unacceptable. </p><p>  If the DVR is in HD format, then it will generate a huge amount of data, which will require a lot of storage space.  Memory cards used in such devices are classified according to the write speed of classes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose a dvr" class="if uuid-2262432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2262432.jpg"></div><h2>  Choosing the Right Memory Card Class </h2><p>  Most manufacturers of DVRs recommend using a class of 6 or higher, but the best memory card is one with a class of 10. Using lower-class memory cards is not recommended because they are unreliable and have poor video output. </p><p>  The size of the data warehouse is also an important parameter.  On average, a high-definition video recorder can record video on an 8 GB memory card for 2‚Äì3 hours before it starts to rewrite already captured material.  A 16 GB card will provide recording for 4‚Äì6 hours, 32 GB for 6‚Äì12 hours, and 128 GB for 20‚Äì40 hours. All this is important for deciding which DVR to choose.  Owner reviews are ideal for supporting class 10 memory cards with a capacity of 32 GB or more. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  An important factor that you need to decide before choosing a DVR for a car is its size.  This feature may affect the number of supported functions.  A small and neat device does not take up much space and is suitable for small cars.  The camera should not attract too much attention. </p><p>  Most consumers prefer small DVRs.  But the small size limits their capabilities and the amount of data storage.  Such devices do not allow viewing the captured material on the built-in screen and do not support advanced functionality such as GPS, motion sensors, etc. </p><p>  It is better, according to reviews, to choose DVRs with inconspicuous or hidden multifunction cameras.  They are small in size, painted black and almost invisible, at the same time they have sufficient internal memory.  According to user reviews, one of the best models of this type is the Black Box Mobius Pro. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.motorverso.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DVR Maisi M20" class="if uuid-2262546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2262546.jpg"></div><h2>  Reliability </h2><p>  How to choose a good dvr?  It is important to purchase a model that is distinguished by its reliability.  Since the device supports the function of automatic start and automatic shutdown, the user does not know whether it works or not.  The driver may not watch the video at all until the day when he needs to check something. </p><p>  If the device is unreliable, then it is likely that the required record in its memory will not be.  Therefore, before choosing a DVR, you need to check the reviews about its work. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Many manufacturers advertise which central processing unit is installed in their DVR model.  Of course, the CPU is of great importance, but the resolution of the image sensor and the characteristics of the lens are also key parameters.  Therefore, different DVRs with the same central processor demonstrate video that is radically different in quality. </p><h2>  Mounting options and ease of installation </h2><p>  DVRs come in different sizes and with different options for their installation.  Some of them are installed on the windshield (user reviews note the model of the Chinese manufacturer Stealth DVR ST220), and others - behind the rearview mirror.  In a small car with limited space, it is best to look for an option that will not interfere with the driver's view and does not take up much space.  Typically, these devices are mounted using suction cups on the windshield or using a semi-permanent adhesive mount. </p><p>  Before choosing a car DVR, you need to determine which installation method is best suited and purchase an easy-to-install model that will look good.  The device, which is attached using suction cups, can be easily removed and moved if necessary.  The vacuum mount seems larger, but provides the user with the flexibility they need.  Glue mounting looks better and more invisible, but it cannot be dismantled or moved. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mobius-actioncam.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DVR with radar" class="if uuid-2262434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2262434.jpg"></div><h2>  Number of channels </h2><p>  The decision about which DVR is better to choose - 1- or 2-channel, is one of the most important. </p><p>  The single-channel model has a single camera and can record only what happens in front of the car.  The two-channel version allows you to document what is in front, behind and inside the vehicle.  How to choose a DVR in this case? </p><p>  The device with a single lens is an excellent option for recording what is happening in front of the vehicle.  He will do a great job of recording trips on a memory card and provide evidence for protection in the event of an accident or fraudulent claims. </p><p>  The dual-channel DVR has 2 lenses or channels and simultaneously records what is happening in the front and back.  The second camera can be located anywhere inside the car.  It can also be placed to monitor any valuable items in the cabin. </p><p>  There are also models with two cameras integrated in one housing.  In such DVRs, one lens is directed forward and the other towards the rear of the car. </p><h2>  G-sensor </h2><p>  The gravity sensor is one of the most advanced features of the DVR.  It is activated when the car is involved in a collision, and the video is immediately protected from being dubbed or deleted.  This is a great opportunity to protect a parked vehicle from vandals and theft.  According to user reviews, a good example of a model of this type is the Falcon Zero F170HD +.  At the same time, the DVR is covered by a 5-year warranty, which usually does not exceed one year. </p><h2>  GPS </h2><p>  Those who are wondering how to choose a good car dvr will need to know that modern models often support such advanced features as GPS and speeding alerts.  The location system supplements the frames with information about the speed and location of the vehicle, as well as the current date and time.  These notes may be used as evidence. </p><p>  Some DVRs provide step-by-step instructions on how to get to your destination.  They work like navigation devices and allow you to refuse to install a separate navigator, saving space on the dashboard. </p><p>  Some models may also be equipped with lane departure warning, driving control, and stop sign detection, which provide significant assistance to the driver. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Video recorder and radar detector VGR-B" class="if uuid-2262446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2262446.jpg"></div><h2>  Radar detector </h2><p>  How to choose a car dvr with a radar?  The best models guarantee early warning of the operation of active and passive speed control systems, without responding to signals that are not related to the police and road services.  Thus, when deciding which DVR with a radar detector to choose, you should pay attention to its long-range action, the ability to work without updating the radar location map and noise immunity.  According to user reviews, one of the best models of this type are the Korean Sho-Me Combo No. 1 and the Chinese Stealth MFU-630. </p><h2>  Heat resistance </h2><p>  The DVR is mounted on the windshield and is constantly exposed to sunlight.  Continuous exposure to high temperatures can lead to deterioration of the housing and damage to the electronics. </p><p>  To avoid this, you should choose a model that can withstand high temperatures.  The cheapest devices are made of low-grade materials that are not heat-resistant.  Therefore, before choosing a DVR, you need to read the reviews and ask questions about the ability of the device to withstand heat load.  According to user reviews, the best model of this type is the KDLINKS X1, capable of stable operation at a temperature of 77 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  Motion Detection </h2><p>  Many DVRs support motion detection, which is very useful when the car is parked.  In parking mode, the camera is activated upon impact.  If the DVR supports wireless Wi-Fi, then it will send a warning, and the owner will be able to see his car and everything that happens in real time.  According to user reviews, one of the best models of this type is the Blackcam BCH-1000 Hybrid. </p><h2>  The night vision </h2><p>  Another thing that you should not forget about before choosing a DVR for a car, reviews call the operation of the device in low light conditions.  Before buying a device, you should check whether it has such an opportunity and whether the camera is equipped with low-light sensors. </p><p>  Do I need night vision?  Most accidents and traffic accidents occur at night, and in order for the DVR to be useful, it must record excellent quality in low light.  For those who travel often after dark, this feature is a must. </p><p>  How to choose a DVR in this case?  You should look for models with a wide dynamic range of WDR, also called high dynamic range of HDR.  A camera that supports this functionality is able to record and process frames in low light and improve them programmatically. </p><h2>  Other things to consider </h2><p>  When buying a DVR, you should also pay attention to the following. </p><p>  The power adapter cord must be 3.5 m or more.  This will allow you to mount the wire around the perimeter of the windshield, not allowing it to hang down, closing the driver's view.  If the seller does not indicate the length of the cable, it should be clarified before purchase. </p><p>  There should not be time gaps between video files.  Most modern DVRs have no such problem. </p><p>  Some models come with LEDs.  According to information from manufacturers, light sources improve the quality of night video.  Unfortunately, such LED video lamps do not improve because they do not have enough power.  In addition, because of them, an additional shine of the windshield may appear on the recording.  Therefore, if the DVR is equipped with such light sources, it is better not to turn them on.  An example of such a device, according to user reviews, is the Gazer H521. </p><h2>  Camera types </h2><p>  Several types of DVRs are available on the market, which can be classified according to their functionality as basic and advanced. </p><p>        ,        .  ,    ,     .      ,   .    ,         .      ,    ,    .   ,        Black Box G1W Original. </p><p>           ,   GPS,  , G-, Wi-Fi,  ,    HD  . .         ,    . ,     <span>Blackvue DR650GW-2CH</span>  Blackcam BCH-1000 Hybrid. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>    ,    ,   ,      ,      .        ,             . </p>
