Italy on the map. sights</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Italy is a country of passion, wine, pasta, fashion and men.  It is divided into two dozen regions.  Having been in one of them, you cannot say that you have learned everything about the country.  Italy is constantly opening up new facets to travelers.  Each region is interesting for its traditions, cuisine, lifestyle, ideals and culture.  We will present the most interesting facts about Italy, which will help you learn more about this fascinating country. </p><h2>  Eternal feast of the abdomen </h2><p>  In Italy, a real <span>cult of food</span> has long been established <span>.</span>  They talk about food for hours in restaurants, on the streets, and over the phone.  The question of what a person ate today can be heard as often as the traditional ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù  It is noteworthy that usually the answers to them coincide, that is, if you managed to eat well, then everything else is also in perfect order. </p><p>  Most tourists like Italian cuisine, but sometimes you want to relax a bit from it.  And here you have to face a problem: there are few restaurants with cuisines of other peoples in the country.  But this difficulty will not be the only one for those who want to "just eat something."  Interesting facts about Italy: dinner in all restaurants of the country, without exception, lasts exactly 60 minutes - from 12.30 to 13.30.  Dinner time - from 19.30.  If you get hungry after two, you have to be content with sandwiches.  The only exception is the few "despicable" restaurants especially for tourists.  In them you can dine even after half past one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting facts about italy" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/453886.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Great combinators </h2><p>  Italians are very sensitive to the compatibility of certain products.  Naturally, travelers often violate unspoken rules.  As a result of unsuccessful, according to local residents, food combination, one can even see a scornful mockery at one's address.  Here are some examples: </p><p>  - Cappuccino is drunk only in the morning.  The desire to have a cup at dinner is considered inappropriate and even shameful. </p><p>  - Salad is a dish that is served after hot.  It is not used as a snack. </p><p>  - An unacceptable combination is fish and cheese. </p><p>  - An act equivalent to a crime - adding ketchup to pasta or pizza. </p><h2>  Attitude towards visitors </h2><p>  Tourists often have to deal with a passive and dismissive attitude towards themselves.  If a person has a foreign accent and not an Italian appearance, he will probably get the worst cheese in the shop, in addition, he is held with an unkind look full of suspicion.  As some travelers note, if you order coffee in English, an invigorating drink often costs twice as much. </p><p>  Often the first question that strangers ask each other is the following: "Where are you from?"  This is not only a way to start a conversation, but also an opportunity to decide on a further communication strategy. </p><h2>  Features of the division of the country </h2><p>  Italy on the map appears before us in the form of the well-known boot with the capital in Rome.  However, residents of the state represent their homeland in a completely different way.  For them, there is an industrial North and a provincial South.  Interesting facts about Italy: even in a town with five hundred inhabitants there will be its own architecture, cuisine, history and, of course, a dialect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy interesting facts for children" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/453892.jpg" width="350"></div>

Examples of the most common stereotypes: ‚ÄúShe did not call you back?  And what did you expect, she‚Äôs from Venice !? ‚Äù,‚Äú He‚Äôs not sad, he‚Äôs just from Piedmont, everyone behaves there like that ‚Äù,‚Äú This is a vulgar consumer magazine, it is published in Milan. ‚Äù </p><p>  Those born in different cities are secretly assigned certain names.  So, Gennaro or Pasquale probably came into being in Naples, Lavinia and Prisca - in Rome.  Of course, there are general Italian neutral options, for example, Mario or Francesco, but most parents prefer names that are traditional in their area. </p><p>  The Italians become one nation in two cases - when watching football matches and as part of a tourist group abroad. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy interesting facts about the country" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/453887.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Adult children </h2><p>  We noted above that the country in question does not differ in cohesion.  But still there are features that are characteristic, if not for everyone, then for most Italians for sure.  So, foreign travelers primarily notice the amazing infantility of the inhabitants of this sunny country.  Some blame the education system, others - the economy, but the exact cause of this phenomenon, of course, is now difficult to establish.
