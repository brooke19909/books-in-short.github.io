This is people going to Arkhipo-Osipovka for the sake of the sea.  Or there in Gelendzhik.  And to Turkey - for the sake of the sea, the beach, comfortable rooms, delicious food according to the All-Inclusive concept, animation and incendiary entertainment.  And almost all of this depends entirely on the hotel.  You can live in a modest "troika" and come to the room "just spend the night", satisfying hunger in cafes on the promenade.  But if you want to relax without worries, choose a hotel with only five stars.  In this article we will characterize one of them - Voyage Belek Golf &amp; Spa 5 *. </p><p>  We built our description in many respects on the reviews of tourists.  In Turkey, many hotels have a distinct focus.  There are so-called party hotels where the main emphasis is on animation and youth entertainment.  There are hotels for lovers of sports and spa treatments.  As you might guess by the name, our hotel just belongs to this category.  But she also has one more specificity.  This is the maximum of services for children, including for infants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Voyage belek" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1985738.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located? </h2><p>  Where else could there be a hotel called Voyage Belek if not in Belek?  This resort is young and dynamic.  It is famous as a youth vacation spot.  But for the guests of the Voyage Belek Hotel, all conditions are created for silence, tranquility, and stay in languid bliss.  The hotel is not in the town itself, but on its outskirts.  More precisely, two kilometers from Belek.  This distance is called the best reviews.  You can slowly walk barefoot along the edge of the sea or along the promenade.  In half an hour you will already be in the historical center of Belek.  Voyage Belek is a first-line hotel.  It has its own beach, which we will devote more information below.  Many tourists want to know how long it will take to get to the place of rest from the airport.  It is less than an hour from Antalya, where the air gates of the entire Mediterranean coast of Turkey are located.  After all, both cities are separated by only forty kilometers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Voyage Belek belongs to the Voyage hotel chain.  The hotel was built in 2007 according to the concept of "luxury".  The best landscape designers and architects of Turkey were involved in the development of a vast territory with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãninety three and a half thousand square meters.  The result was a garden of paradise, which fit pools, cafes, golf courses, as well as the actual hotel buildings.  There are several types of these latter. </p><p>  Firstly, three buildings in five, six and seven floors - for those who like to live in high-rise hotel-type buildings.  Tourists who want the maximum rest from their own kind can stay in a bungalow.  These are six small two-story houses.  Those who have money, but have no desire to endure at least some neighbors, can rent a two-level villa.  There are several such islands of luxurious relaxation called ‚ÄúLaguna Duplex‚Äù in the hotel.  Their guests can use the entire infrastructure of the hotel.  The hotel was last renovated in 2014. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Voyage Belek room description" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1985746.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  At the same time, 1,175 people can relax at the Voyage Belek.  Description of numbers traditionally begins with their classification.  So, the simplest category of rooms at the Voyage Belek Hotel is the ‚Äústandard‚Äù.  These rooms are located both in the buildings and in the bungalow.  The difference between them is only in area.  In the bungalow it is larger - 37 square meters versus 32. And the content is the same.  The category above is the "standard room view".  These rooms are located in the main building and, as the name implies, from their balconies you can admire the sea.  For families of four there is a "family room".  These rooms consist of two bedrooms separated by a connecting door.  They are located in the main building and in the bungalow.  Their area is the same - 40 square meters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Recommendations on choosing a room here are inclined in favor of the main building.  You can see the sea from these rooms, and only the garden from the bungalows.  The higher category is ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù (60 sq. M.).  And the most luxurious - "King Suite".  The guests of the last two categories have the privileges of VIP guests, which we will talk about later.  A company of 4-6 adults and two children can rent a two-story villa.  The Laguna Duplex is the real pride of the hotel.  And now we will talk about filling numbers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Voyage Belek Golf &amp; Spa 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1985742.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What's in the guest rooms? </h2><p>  The horizons of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat a five-star hotel should look like, you will undoubtedly expand, should you get into the "standard" of the Voyage Belek hotel.  A flat-screen TV broadcasts many channels, including three Russian.  The temperature in the bedroom is monitored by a split climate control system.  A minibar with daily replenishment, an electronic safe, a set for self-preparation of hot drinks and a balcony complete the decoration.  In the bathroom there is not only a hairdryer with toiletries, but also bathrobes and slippers. </p><p>  A standard room can accommodate a third guest, as it has a rollaway bed.  In "deluxe" atmosphere is even more luxurious.  Instead of a balcony, there is a spacious terrace with a jacuzzi and two sun loungers under a beach umbrella.  In the bedroom, in addition to the TV, there is also a player (CD and DVD) with a home theater function.  The bathroom has a shower and another jacuzzi.  There is also a deluxe connection room with two terraces and two bedrooms.  It has a living room with upholstered furniture.  In the "royal suite" to all this splendor is added a fully equipped kitchen and dining room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Villa </h2><p>  On the ground floor of the Duplex Lagoon, Voyage Belek has a living room, one of the bedrooms, a toilet and a Roman shower with rain effect.  On the second level there is another room for sleeping, a dressing room, a jacuzzi and a toilet.  The villa adjoins a terrace with sun loungers and a beach umbrella.  The inhabitants of this island of luxury have direct access to the pool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Voyage Belek Food" class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1986167.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What are VIP services? </h2><p>  What are the benefits of occupants of superior rooms over other vacationers at Voyage Belek?  The service for VIP guests is thought out to the smallest detail and begins literally from the moment of arrival.  Such vacationers are greeted with flowers, they are accommodated in a room without a queue, and the employee of the department of geography is escorting them to the door of the apartment.  Upon arrival, a bottle of wine is delivered to the room.  And every day they bring guests: fresh fruit, newspapers, beach towels, and from 17 to 18 hours - sweet pastries for tea. </p><p>  An additional service is supposed - preparation of the room for bed.  The minibar in these apartments is replenished better than in ordinary ones.  Guests can not only refresh themselves with soft drinks, but also enjoy chocolate milk, try crayfish, whiskey, gin, etc. A special attitude to such guests is manifested even in cosmetic accessories.  They are branded - from Bulgari.  Upon request, breakfast is delivered directly to your room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Voyage belek reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1985744.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Voyage Belek: food </h2><p>  Many people know how to feed in Turkey on the program "All inclusive."  But the Voyage Belek five-star hotel has the concept of Ultra All Inclusive.  And this means that the food there is on the highest level.  First of all, reviews report a competent division of the hotel infrastructure into two zones - adult and family.  There are two main restaurants in the hotel (buffet service).  But in one of them the entrance to persons under 16 years of age is ordered.  But in the second there is a whole compartment for younger guests.  Children can choose their own meals - just like adults.  Five-star hotels must have a la carte restaurants.  And in Voyage Belek there are as many as eight of them!  Five of them are free for guests.  These are restaurants of Mexican ("Grazias"), fish ("Deep"), Turkish ("Kebaba"), Greek ("El Ala") and Thai ("Tai Tea") cuisines.  You will have to pay for visiting three more a la carte restaurants.  In them you can taste dishes of Japanese ("Yaki-Yaki") and Italian ("Manyamo") cuisines, as well as enjoy well-fried or with blood (if you wish) steak in Steak House. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Restaurants are not the only catering establishments available to guests of Voyage Belek.  Turkey is famous for its g√∂zleme cakes, and you can enjoy them in a special tent.  Reviews also report that there are refrigerator trays with refreshing drinks and ice cream everywhere in the territory.  For lovers of a healthy snack, welcome to the Fruit House.  And for those who like to drink something stronger, as many as 14 bars work. </p><p>  Would you like to leave the pool or the beach for lunch?  You can have a bite to eat in one of the three bistro restaurants.  For lovers of coffee and delicious Turkish pastries and sweets, there is a ‚Äúpatisserie‚Äù (confectionery).  The snack bar is open 24 hours a day, which is convenient for those who arrive very late or leave the hotel too early.  In general, the guests had the most positive opinion about food.  The food is very tasty, varied, with sophistication.  There is diet food. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Voyage Belek Beach" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1985739.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach, Pools </h2><p>  People come to Turkey, of course, and for the sake of the sea.  What is Voyage Belek beach?  Of course, it is fully consistent with the five-star level of the hotel.  Each year, a 300-meter-long beach is awarded the Blue Flag for the cleanliness of sand and water.  The local animals also appreciated the environmental friendliness: the Caretta turtle eggs lay here to lay.  We already mentioned that the hotel territory is wisely divided into ‚Äúfamily‚Äù and ‚Äúfor those who are 16+‚Äù.  There are two piers on the beach.  Children are not allowed on one of them.  The beach and piers are lined with sunbeds with mattresses and umbrellas.  They are free for guests.  For the use of "Bali-bad" (beach tents) will need to pay.  The hotel has one main swimming pool.  Its area is 1800 square meters.  In addition to it there are: the pool "16+", "Garden pool" (with heating), indoor children and adults.  Beach towels are provided to all guests free of charge.  The inhabitants of the villas "Laguna" have access to their pools. </p><h2>  Golf, spa, water park </h2><p>  Now let's see if the full name of the Voyage Belek Golf &amp; Spa 5 * hotel is justified.  The hotel has a small 9-hole golf course.  This service is free.  But if you want a real game, the hotel staff will take you free of charge to the Montgomery Max Royal Club located at a kilometer.  It is one of the best 18-hole golf courses in the region with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã104 hectares.  For three years now, competitions have been held on it for this sport for possession of the European Cup. </p><p>  The hotel's spa has a relaxing atmosphere.  In addition to the traditional saunas, hammams and steam rooms, there is an ice fountain and a shower with a surprise.  Of course, massage and other spa services are provided for a fee.  This is not reflected in the name of the hotel, but the hotel has a small water park.  It consists of six slides.  One of them - the ‚ÄúRoyal Cobra‚Äù - is allowed only to those who are already 12 years old. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Voyage Belek playground for children" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1985751.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  Despite the fact that young guests are not allowed everywhere, the hotel enjoys the fame of a hotel for families.  You can even go here with babies!  The main restaurant has a department where parents can prepare full infant food for their crumbs: there are broths, boiled vegetables, a blender, a sterilizer and a bottle warmer, etc. A crib, a pot, and a hammock for bathing will be delivered to your room.  The restaurant has high chairs and poolside diapers provide waterproof diapers.  But for older children, all the conditions for relaxation at the Voyage Belek are created.  Playground for children, indoor pool, amusement park, trampoline and, most importantly, animation.  Children are divided into three age groups (4-6, 7-9 and 10-12 years old) and experienced teachers are involved with them. </p><h2>  Free and paid services </h2><p>  When you arrive at the hotel with Ultra All Inclusive, you want to enjoy everything to the fullest.  And it is very annoying when you are presented with an invoice upon eviction.  What services are completely free in the hotel?  Visiting the five a la carte restaurants listed above (no more than once each), all cafes and bars, parking, sauna, hammam, steam, water park slides, swimming pools, Wi-Fi, animation, shooting at a shooting range, non-motorized types of water sports, fitness equipment in the fitness room, darts, boccia, tennis courts - all this can be freely used in the Voyage Belek hotel.  Paid services include: court lighting, tennis lessons, internet cafes, billiards, bowling, massage, slot machines, water sports, babysitting services and visits to three a la carte restaurants. </p><h2>  Entertainment for adults </h2><p>  Tourists were simply shocked by the animation at the Voyage Belek hotel.  Reviews assure that the hotel invites real stars or famous DJs for evening shows.  The summer program is on the Internet, and you can figure out when to check into a hotel to watch a performance of your favorite artist.  In addition to evening shows, guests are entertained by a close-knit team of animators.  They conduct water aerobics classes, encourage vacationers to play sports games, etc. Reviews assure that the slides in the hotel are exciting, but quite safe. </p>
