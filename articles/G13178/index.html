Hellish pictures and frightening inscriptions on packs of cigarettes, a ban on <span>smoking in public places, and the</span> rise in price of tobacco made smoking a very troublesome habit.  But tobacco lovers are not so easy to make to give up.  Protecting their right to choose, they figured out how to continue to enjoy the smoking process without incurring penalties.  An electronic cigarette has appeared on the market quite recently, but is already gradually crowding out its historical predecessor.  It is time to get to know her better. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thin electronic cigarette" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41415/1184975.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Electronic cigarette - what is it? </h2><p>  All electronic cigarettes consist of a battery, a liquid tank, an atomizer and a mouthpiece.  Most often, all of these components are interchangeable.  The principle of operation of the device is as follows: when tightened, an electronic heater is activated, which converts the liquid into steam.  It contains nicotine.  Some models turn on automatically when air is drawn in, others are equipped with a button that allows you to fully control the process of soaring.  Most electronic cigarettes have a vapor intensity control, in case you need to make the smoking process less noticeable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If packs of cigarettes are in about the same price category, the cost of vaporizers differs in the same way as phones or other devices.  You can purchase both inexpensive electronic cigarettes within 1000 rubles, and vapor units with complex electronic filling, the cost of which can reach up to 10,000 hard earned.  Of course, it is better to start from the first - they are compact in size and easy to use.  In addition, an electronic mini cigarette fits easily in your pocket. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap electronic cigarettes" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41415/1182985.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Pros and Cons of an Electronic Cigarette </h2><p>  One of the main advantages of an electronic cigarette is the absence of a smell of smoke, which is unpleasant not only for others, but also for the smoker himself, as he impregnates his hair, clothes and spoils his breath.  When switching to alternative smoking, overall health improves, <span>taste buds</span> become aggravated, shortness of breath decreases.  The vapor inhaled by the steam cleaner does not contain combustion products and tar, it does not affect the color of tooth enamel and does not have such a destructive effect on the skin. </p><p>  However, do not think that switching to an electronic cigarette, you have ceased to be a smoker.  The main active ingredient in the liquid is still nicotine.  In addition, a new type of dependence is being formed, and a person can begin to smoke even more than before due to the awareness of apparent harmlessness. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Due to the fact that this invention is relatively recent, all the pros and cons of an electronic cigarette are still not well understood.  There are no clear rules for the production of liquids, unscrupulous manufacturers can use low-quality and even dangerous ingredients.  Therefore, it is recommended that the smokers purchase them from trusted companies and do not seek to save. </p><h2>  Types of Electronic Cigarettes </h2><p>  Many beginner vapers, unable to betray the image of their favorite cigarettes, acquire electronic devices that look like ordinary cigarettes.  However, even the thinnest electronic cigarette can hardly hold between the fingers.  Therefore, experienced parity shifted to more advanced designs, such as box mods, for example.  Outwardly, they are as far from a cigarette as natural tobacco leaves from liquid for electronic vaporizers.  However, they are equipped with many additional options to turn the smoking process into a complex ritual.  The integrated circuit boards protect against short circuits, awkward pressing or overdischarge.  With their help, you can change the power, voltage and even the temperature of the steam.  Well, of course, such gadgets are paired with a phone and a computer - a modern person will have nowhere without it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap electronic cigarettes" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41415/1184978.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Components and types of liquids for evaporators </h2><p>  The basis for electronic cigarettes consists of four components: water, <span>glycerin, propylene glycol and</span> nicotine (unless it is non-nicotine).  Glycerin is responsible for the production of steam, propylene glycol is a conductor of taste, but for what you need nicotine, you yourself know.  Some sources talk about the toxicity of propylene glycol, citing evidence that it can cause breathing problems and throat diseases.  In fact, no information is available on the dangers of this substance.  It is used in pharmaceutical, food, chemical and other industries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pros and Cons of an Electronic Cigarette" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41415/1184979.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to tastes, the basis for electronic cigarettes is divided into two main categories - fruit and tobacco.  Some manufacturers produce liquids that mimic popular cigarettes - Marlboro, Parliament, Davidoff, and others.  Recently, another segment has appeared - liquids with the taste of cola, whiskey, coffee and other drinks.  So there is plenty to choose from. </p><h2>  Thin electronic cigarette for a beginner vaper </h2><p>  Instead of reading a lot of articles on the Internet for a long time offering an overview of different evaporators, it is better to start using this device and understand what exactly you need.  For a beginner vaper, an electronic mini-cigarette is perfect.  Firstly, it will be closest in appearance to tobacco products, and secondly, the necessary minimum of functions will make it easy and quick to master its use.  One of the most popular brands, Joyetech, offers the 510-SS and 510-T electronic cigarettes that are best suited for this purpose. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Electronic cigarette mini" class="if" height="446" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41415/1182960.jpg" width="312"></div></h2><p>  The 510-SS model produces a small amount of steam and is equipped with a replaceable vaporizer system.  When the liquid cartridge comes to an end, it will just be necessary to replace it with a new one.  The original mount of the charger with a magnet allows you to use a cigarette even while recharging. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The basis for electronic cigarettes" class="if" height="438" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41415/1184976.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Joyetech 510-T was one of the first devices to implement direct fluid supply to the atomizer, which significantly reduces maintenance costs.  The small size also determines the capacity of the battery, which requires frequent recharging.  But there are pluses - the thin 510-T electronic cigarette will look especially elegant in female pens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Electronic cigarette mini" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41415/1184977.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews of Sailers </h2><p>  Users who buy inexpensive electronic cigarettes complain about a weak battery and a small tank of liquid.  You have to carry a charge and a bottle with a base.  Also, many are not satisfied with the small amount of steam produced by the device.  On the other hand, a thin electronic cigarette looks elegant in hands, it is convenient to carry with it and indeed can be passed off as an original pen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The basis for electronic cigarettes" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41415/1183013.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Operation tips </h2><p>  A thin electronic cigarette will require some care from you.  After a certain period of use, you can feel a burning sensation when puffing.  This means that the atomizer must be changed, it burned out.  To prevent this from happening as long as possible, it is enough to periodically clean it.  Wash the atomizer under a stream of warm water and remove carbon deposits that have settled on the walls.  Then blow dry.  After this procedure, it is recommended to soak the atomizer with liquid and only then turn it on.  Performing these manipulations approximately once a week, you will improve its work and prevent the formation of plaque on the spiral. </p><h2>  To smoke or to steam? </h2><p>  According to a well-known saying, how to spoil your health, everyone decides for himself.  Of course, steam devices can not be called completely harmless.  However, it is obvious that this is the best alternative if you cannot quit smoking. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="To smoke or to steam?" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41415/1182971.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  A thin electronic cigarette will help to endure a long trip, no need to tremble on the street, having run out of a restaurant for a smoke break, pets will no longer wrinkle their nose after your sorties to the <span>stairwell</span> or balcony.  Oddly enough, but the appearance of the smoker does not cause a squeamish and condemning expression on the faces of others. </p>
