We invite you to make an equally exciting trip full of many amazing discoveries to Altai.  Here you will find landscapes of unprecedented beauty, air, heady with the aromas of herbs and cedars, and most importantly, a special energy that pacifies, restores strength, gives peace of mind.  We offer to <span>stay</span> here at <span>the</span> Altay Resort, according to the reviews of tourists, which is the best in these parts.  This complex has a category of five stars, and quite deservedly.  Everything here, including the territory, rooms, restaurant, service, corresponds to the declared star rating.  But first things first. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In a surprisingly beautiful corner of the Altai Mountains is the tourist complex Altay Resort.  Urlu-Aspak is the closest village to it.  We can say that the camp site was built on its outskirts.  Places here are pleasing to the eye by the vast expanses of areas untouched by civilization.  On the one hand, this is reflected in the development of infrastructure, and on the other, it makes it possible to get a good rest in nature.  The village of Urlu-Aspak lies in the valley of the Main river.  In terms of population, it is very small, at the moment a little more than 400 people live here.  The complex is separated from the village by a high monolithic wall, which is connected with the conflicts that took place between the hotel owners and the local population.  However, this does not affect the vacation of tourists.  The nature here is unusually beautiful.  From the west and from the east, the valley is surrounded by coniferous and deciduous forests, which are mainly dominated by cedars, birch and aspen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, "urlu aspak" in translation from the local dialect means "aspen camp".  The northern part of the valley is protected from the cool air currents by the ridges of Izhozh.  And although these mountain formations are relatively low (800-1000 meters), the climate they create here is quite mild.  What else is remarkable for the area where Altay Resort was built (‚ÄúAltai Resort‚Äù, if you pronounce its name in Russian)?  An abundance of water arteries, and this is not only the Main river.  A narrow but picturesque river of the same name flows through the village of Urlu-Aspak, which is a tributary of the Maina.  Nearby, a little to the north there is another tributary - the Taitash River.  So, for nature and fishing lovers there is where to amuse your soul.  It is also worth mentioning that Urlu-Aspak is the starting point for tourist routes to the Karakol lakes and the unique Tut-Kush cave.  This location of the tourist base creates its guests-lovers of outdoor activities some advantages over other travelers. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  It is quite easy for residents of Altai and surrounding regions to come to Altay Resort.  Russia, especially its hinterland, unfortunately, cannot yet boast of good automobile routes, but the region in question is a pleasant exception.  The fact is that the Urlu-Aspak direction has been recognized as promising in terms of tourism development in the region, therefore, a major reconstruction of the Kyzyl-Ozek-Urlu-Aspak highway was recently carried out here, and in the future it is planned to continue it to the Karakol lakes.  At the moment, on this highway it is quite comfortable to get to the resort from Gorno-Altaysk, which is only 44 km away. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Residents of more distant regions get to the Altay Resort tourist complex is not very convenient.  For example, from Moscow you can fly to Gorno-Altaysk by plane, and then transfer to the bus that goes to Urlu-Aspak.  Airfare starts at 22,000 rubles one way.  Cheaper to travel by train, where a ticket costs from 4000 rubles (in a reserved seat car).  But the nearest railway station is located in Biysk, from which you have to travel by intercity bus to Gorno-Altaysk.  The distance is 100 km, travel time about 2 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort altay" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2032323.jpg" width="594"></div>

    <h2>  Description of Altay Resort base </h2><p>  This complex consists of 19 stylish wooden cottages, beautifully placed on the edge of the forest at the foot of the hill.  They have 78 rooms to accommodate guests of the base.  Cottages are made of whole logs (cedar, pine), without the use of chemical materials harmful to health.  The rooms have wooden walls and ceilings, parquet floors.  Views from all rooms open onto picturesque forests and mountains.  According to tourists, the territory of the complex is so huge that it would be possible to move around it by car.  But this does not happen, because the entry of vehicles here is prohibited.  Despite its impressive size, the entire territory is perfectly groomed, alleys are laid between buildings and infrastructure, flowers are planted all around, lawns are neatly decorated.  In addition to gorgeous greenery, there are three ponds where fishing is allowed.  A nice bridge is thrown across one of them, a pier and a beach are built on the other.  Here in the summer you can have fun on water rides (catamarans, "banana", rent a boat).  Children in the resort Altay base are at ease (there is where to run, play catch-up and hide and seek).  At the same time, their parents can be absolutely calm, because nothing bad can happen to their kids, for example, broken noses and knees, because everywhere under the children's legs there will be soft grass.  There is a special corner for the young guests of the base, where a bright and interesting playground has been built.  And for those who arrived at the base by car, a guarded free parking lot is equipped in front of the central gate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  On the vast area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Resort Altay base, it would be said that it would be a sin not to build many infrastructure facilities.  There are really a lot of them, and for every taste.  For those who seek to keep fit even on vacation, a modern multifunctional fitness center equipped with sports equipment has been built.  Nearby, a large gym is equipped, where you can play volleyball, basketball and even soccer if the weather is inappropriate.  There is also an artificial climbing wall in the gym, and there are two departments in it - for adults and for kids.  Sports grounds are also available on site.  A tennis court, a sports club were built here (you can play paintball, shoot from a crossbow, a bow, hunting weapons in a specially designated and equipped place), a spa center, a hairdresser, a souvenir and related products shop, an ATM are working. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Altay Resort holiday reviews" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2032322.jpg" width="600"></div>  For all tourists who want to spend their holidays without breaking away from important matters, Altay Resort provides a modern and multifunctional congress hall.  It is located in a separate building, so there is nothing for customers and no one bothers to work fruitfully.  In the congress hall there are 3 halls for business events.
