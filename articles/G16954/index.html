    <h2>  Bathing Conditions: Pros and Cons </h2><p>  Camp "Green Light" in Tuapse has a beautiful pebble beach.  The sea is clean and clear.  Convenient entry into the water.  However, there is one difficulty.  A staircase of 256 steps leads to the sea.  They need to be overcome by young children going down to the beach from the upper level.  The guys go to the sea twice a day.  Children will have to overcome 1000 steps: 500 up and the same down.  If your child does not like heavy physical activity, rest will not seem to him cheerful.  Especially should beware of parents whose children suffer from cardiovascular diseases. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, Green Light is a camp, reviews of which are not always positive.  Almost everything suits the children.  But not their parents.  Adults complain that children in the camp are often sick.  In the comments, poisonings are noted, from which the guys suffer from the entire squad.  <span>Children cough,</span> their temperature rises.  A heavy impression leaves the stairs.  Children return from the beach during the hottest time of the day.  This is very tiring, especially for kids. </p><h2>  Domestic problems and staff qualifications </h2><p>  Photos of the camp "Green Light" pleasing to the eye.  Everything is surrounded by greenery.  Living conditions in the camp are not very favorable.  Advertising sites report that water is supplied around the clock.  However, it is not.  Children and camp staff write in the comments that the water runs by the clock.  Counselors say there are no toilets in the buildings.  The big problem is washing, especially for young children. </p><p>  Many parents say that the camp staff is not qualified.  Interestingly, the counselors themselves agree with this.  They are taught mainly to entertain children, organize games and competitions.  But not all teachers are able to help children in everyday life.  Kids need special care.  After all, they need to be reassured, encouraged, and sometimes even braid pigtails or cut nails. </p><h2>  I want to relax on the river! </h2><p>  The camp with the name "Green Light" is not only in Tuapse, but also in Voronezh.  It is located in a pine forest, 22 kilometers from the city.  Many children write on social networks that their favorite place in their native land is Green Light (camp).  Voronezh is a regional center.  Thousands of school-age children live in it.  Every year, some of them visit the Green Light.  In the camp are located: </p><ul><li>  pool; </li><li>  sports complex; </li><li>  football field; </li><li>  arbors; </li><li>  playground. </li></ul><p>  The guys live in two-story brick buildings.  They eat five times a day.  A complete diet includes vegetables and fruits, meat, fish, dairy products.  The camp has a medical office and an isolation ward.  The territory is guarded.  Guys conduct excursions.  A kilometer from the camp is a river on which children go swimming.  The institution has its own <span>field kitchen.</span> </p><p>  Many adults believe that the best place for schoolchildren to relax is the Green Light (camp).  Voronezh is a large city, and many children have a rest in this health-improving institution.  Therefore, parents often share information.  The guys are delighted with the camp.  Parents are more strict in their assessments.  Many note poor sanitary conditions and a lack of pedagogical knowledge among staff. </p>
