Nha Trang is a resort town, or rather, the country's beach capital.  The hotel is very conveniently located and is located near the center, a ten minute walk.  It is also very convenient that the beach is very close. </p><p>  The town itself is very cheerful and noisy.  Thousands of tourists come here every year to relax.  Some appreciate the resort for its white beaches and the azure sea, for the beauty of green hills and tropical islands in the bay.  And others like the nightlife of the town.  More relaxed holidaymakers are delighted with the spa treatments and mud baths.  Ancient <span>Cham towers</span> located in the city center are no less interesting to tourists. </p><p>  Nha Trang (Nha Trang) - is located 1300 kilometers from Hanoi <span>(the capital of Vietnam).</span>  The population of the city is small, only 200 thousand people.  Locals are engaged in fishing, fish processing, and, of course, serving tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="michelia nha trang hotel 4 vietnam" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1474275.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The name of the city, translated from the language of one of the peoples of Vietnam, means ‚Äúreed river‚Äù or ‚Äúmangrove tree‚Äù.  Once Nha Trang was just a fishing village.  As a resort, the city began to develop back in the days when the country was a French colony.  At the beginning of 2000, Nha Trang was full of small buildings, and in recent years, thanks to rapid construction, high-rise and beautiful houses have appeared in the city.  Beauty contests are regularly held here, and in 2008 even the very prestigious Miss Universe contest was held. </p><h2>  Holiday Benefits </h2><p>  Why do vacationers come to Michelia NhaTrang Hotel 4 * (Vietnam)?  Nha Trang is famous not only for its sea coast, but also for very healing mud and springs.  Therefore, while relaxing in a hotel, you can not only soak up the beaches, but also experience the beneficial effects of local mud.  Good comprehensive treatment, air with the aroma of eucalyptus - all this has a positive effect on people with weak immunity and with respiratory diseases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="michelia nhatrang hotel 4 nha trang" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1474287.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An interesting fact is that the sea in the city is very warm, its temperature is always at least +26 degrees.  And only in February and January the thermometer drops to +24.  In summer, there is heat (+ 33-34 degrees), in winter, very rarely, the temperature can drop to +15 degrees.  There is no big difference between the summer and winter months, on average it is 22-28 degrees. </p><h2>  Attractions and entertainment </h2><p>  What is good Michelia NhaTrang Hotel 4 *?  Reviews of tourists indicate a good location of the complex.  The center is nearby, which means you can walk to local attractions.  In addition, the proximity of the sea pleases.  In general, diving is very developed in the city.  The best time for this sport is from the beginning of March to August.  The famous seven-kilometer <span>beach of Nha Trang</span> is considered the best and most beautiful in the south of Vietnam.  Large coconut palms protect from the strong sun not only walking tourists, but also bathers in the sea.  The city's bay is protected from the sea by islands and mountains, which protects the population from storms and winds.  The sea water here is incredibly clear and clean, and the water inlet is quite sharp, after two or three meters the depth becomes more than human growth.  Therefore, with the children you need to be especially careful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="michelia nhatrang hotel 4 vietnam nha trang" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1474285.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Among the main attractions that are worth seeing are the Dien Khan Citadel, built by the Chin Dynasty in the seventeenth century, Longshon Pagoda (a monastir inhabited by monks), French Gothic style Nha Trang Cathedral, Bao Dao villas (the highest ranks of the country inhabited them), Tyama Towers built between the seventh and twelfth century. </p><h2>  Michelia Nha Trang Hotel 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to discuss the reviews of tourists who managed to relax in this complex.  Is Michelia Nha Trang Hotel 4 * really worthy of attention?  Reviews from the resort about the hotel are very positive.  Let's take a closer look at them.  The advantage of the hotel is its location.  On the one hand, it is located almost in the center, and on the other, near the beach.  Nha Trang is a small town that allows you to take walks to local attractions, which are all located within the center.  But at the same time, transport is excellent here, so you can get to the necessary place.  Seasoned tourists are advised to be careful with the money and keep it with you.  The country is not so rich, and therefore theft is developed, for example, tearing bags. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="michelia hotel nha trang 4 vietnam nha trang" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1474283.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has nice spacious rooms.  All are equipped with good furniture, very comfortable and large beds.  The bedding is new, beautiful.  The apartment has everything you need: from toothbrushes, soap, gels and shampoos to towels and slippers.  Some rooms have a balcony, and some do not.  This must be noted when booking.  If you certainly need it, then specify this moment with rhinestone. </p><p>  The food at the hotel is pretty good.  Grilled seafood in the evenings (octopuses, shrimps, fish) is especially delightful for holidaymakers.  On the tables there is always a large selection of salads, vegetables, fruits, meat.  Local chefs cook deliciously. </p><p>  What other benefits does Michelia Hotel Nha Trang 4 * have?  Hotel description would be incomplete if not to mention the cleaning.  For some reason, this is the question that often excites tourists.  The rooms are cleaned daily and fairly high quality, and, very importantly, towels are changed every day.  Beach towels are also provided.  It is very comfortable.  They are issued every time you go ashore. </p><p>  To the beach to go very close.  It is not very large, it has sunbeds with mattresses and umbrellas, but they are not always enough.  You must either take a seat at seven o‚Äôclock, or you can just sit on the sand.  Located on the beach after eleven hours is problematic, because it is very hot.  By lunchtime, as a rule, the wind rises, and at sea - a wave. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="michelia hotel nha trang 4 pics" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1474280.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Travel agencies offer tourists a trip to Zoklet Beach ($ 45-50), but vacationers do not advise taking it.  It is much easier to get to this place by bus, even if you rent a sunbed, the trip will cost you three times cheaper.  Relaxing at the hotel, you can visit the mud resort "Ay Resort".  Upon arrival at the hotel, representatives of tour operators immediately agitate to purchase excursions from them and pay for them.  At the same time, tourists are completely not allowed to orient and think.  And there are reasons for that.  At any other tour desk near the hotel, trips are much cheaper.  It is worth knowing about such nuances in order to act reasonably.  The city has a large number of places that you will want to see.  Still an exotic country ... </p><p>  As for the hotel staff, it is quite friendly and attentive.  There are no problems with the settlement.  The hotel administration presents a birthday cake and honeymooners.  In general, holidaymakers have the most pleasant impressions of their holidays at the Michelia Hotel Nha Trang 4 *.  Reviews of tourists - this is the main indicator of the quality of service and living conditions, which you should definitely pay attention to. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Based on the foregoing, we can conclude that Michelia Hotel HhaTrang 4 * can be recommended to vacationers, as tourists note that the hotel fully meets its four-star category.  And the quality of service, food and accommodation is at its best.  Resting in such a place is very comfortable. </p>
