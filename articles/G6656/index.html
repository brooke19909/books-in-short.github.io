It is shrouded in many ancient legends and myths.  This island is also famous for the grandeur of natural monuments, a variety of landscapes.  Olkhon is located in the territory of one of the parks, Pribaikalsky, and is considered to be one of the most beautiful places in Lake Baikal.  Olkhon is an island that is especially beautiful in the fall, when the coast becomes almost deserted.  Covered with a golden carpet of herbs, forests that are touched by bright colors, he freezes under the blows of the Baikal waves, waiting for the approach of a harsh Siberian winter. </p><h2>  Location of Olkhon </h2><p>  <span>Olkhon, the</span> largest <span>island in Lake Baikal,</span> is located in the middle of this lake, not far from its western coast.  It is stretched along its shore.  73 km is the length of Olkhon (between capes Umysh-Tame and Khoboy), and the width reaches 15 kilometers.  About 700 square meters.  km is the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island.  About 210 km - the length of its coastline.  A photo of the island of Olkhon is presented below. </p>

    <p>  The part of Baikal concluded between the island and the western coast of the lake is a unique body of water with a special microclimate.  It even bears a special name - the Small Sea, which speaks of a certain independence and exclusivity and is classified as a strait.  From the coast of Baikal, the southwestern part of the island is separated by the Olkhonsky Gates Strait, which has a reputation as the most treacherous place on Lake Baikal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The origin of the name Olkhon </h2><p>  There are at least two main versions of the origin of the name Olkhon.  This island was named in the language of local residents - Buryats.  According to the first, Olkhon comes from the word "oikhon", which means "wooded".  According to another version - from the "olhan", that is, "dry."  Both of these options correspond to the appearance of the island, since it is both wooded and dry.  Therefore, it is difficult to give preference to one of them. </p><h2>  Archeology </h2><p>  The history of Olkhon goes back to antiquity.  This is confirmed by various archaeological finds and historical monuments.  They are collected over more than two hundred years of study of Olkhon.  As of 1993, there were 143 different <span>archaeological sites</span> on the island <span>.</span>  Of these, many are protected by the state.  Unfortunately, many monuments, including ancient stone walls, were destroyed.  The purpose of their construction is still unknown.  They were destroyed in 1963, using the quarried stone to strengthen the pier located in the village called Khuzhir. </p><h2>  Island relief </h2>

    <p>  The western coast of this island, washed by the waters of the Small Sea, is gently sloping for the most part, with bays extending deep into the coast, as well as rocky capes.  On the contrary, eastern, rocky, mountainous, abruptly terminates in Baikal.  There are no deep bays.  The highest point of Olkhon is located on its southern coast.  This is Mount Jima, whose height is 1274 meters.  It rises 818 meters above Lake Baikal.  The deepest place of the lake is located only 11 kilometers from Jima.  This is a mark of 1637 meters.  The steepness of the underwater slope in these places reaches 30-40 degrees near the island. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The steppe is the southern part of the island of Olkhon and partly the northern tip.  In the rest of the space, birch, larch and pine forests grow.  On the western coast, in its middle part, from Cape Sasa to Cape Khuzhirsky, sandy shores.  Overgrown with larch and pine, cut by capes, they will leave an unforgettable impression on travelers. </p>

    <h2>  Lakes and rivers </h2><p>  Great enough to have its own lakes, Olkhon.  This island has several ponds.  Of these, the most famous and largest are the following lakes: Nurskoye, which from time to time merges with Zagli Gulf;  Hanhoy with many archaeological sites;  Shara-Nur - the only <span>salt lake</span> on the island of Olkhon;  Nuku-Nur is a reservoir in which many living organisms live. </p><p>  There are no rivers on the island, only a couple of streams that reach Lake Baikal.  Small sources are found in the forest part of Olkhon.  They feed a few swamps.  In some places, despite the lack of water, new streams appear right before our eyes. </p><h2>  Live nature </h2><p>  The wildlife on this island has been largely affected by <span>human impact.</span>  Due to human fault, over the past few decades, the great cormorant, falcon, roe deer, red deer, wolf, and bustard have disappeared from Olkhon.  On the island back in the 18th century, sable was completely worn out.  Nerpa became a rarity, and earlier she loved to bask on the coastal stones under the sun.  This unique animal can now be found only on the eastern shore of the island of Olkhon.  In recent years, the solar eagle, which previously nested on the island, has completely disappeared from here.  This is the sacred Bald Eagle, which is dedicated to many ancient legends of Lake Baikal, the son of the Master of Olkhon, as well as the progenitor of local shamans.  Sacrifices are still being offered to this bird. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Currently, there are 135 species of birds on Olkhon (wagtail, horned lark, heater, white-belt swift, Daurian jackdaw, capercaillie, black grouse, duck, sandpiper and others).  There are 20 species of mammals (weasel, polecat, squirrel, hare, fox, lynx, etc.), including an endemic animal called the Olkhon vole.  It is found exclusively in the Baikal steppes.  You can find here 1 species of amphibians and 3 species of reptiles.  In winter, from large predators, single wolves are found on Olkhon, penetrating the island on ice.  Wolf packs very rarely enter the same way.  And do not be afraid: there are no bears. </p><h2>  Island tourism </h2><p>  Holidays on the island of Olkhon will be remembered for a long time.  Baikal, surrounded by many secrets and legends, attracts many tourists.  Among vacationers, it is Olkhon Island (Lake Baikal) that is especially popular.  This is the heart of the lake, as well as the only island on Lake Baikal that is inhabited. </p><p>  Olkhon is also the largest of the islands.  It is a cultural center of tourism.  In July, on the island of interest to us, the Siberian Ramp is held annually - an international theater festival.  In August, an amateur theater festival is also held here.  However, the main thing that distinguishes this place is its extraordinary fauna, flora and people who are far from city life, who inhabit the island of Olkhon. </p><p>  How to get here?  To the island from the city of Irkutsk - 5-6 hours drive.  You can get here by car, as well as by minibus.  From the mainland to the island a crossing is carried out. </p><p>  The feeling of mystery and fabulousness arises immediately upon arrival at Olkhon.  Sand-strewn roads are adjacent to forests where trees have grown in the sand.  The reason for this is Sarma (hurricane wind blowing from the Sarma Gorge). </p>

    <p>  Several settlements are located along the shores of the lake.  The largest of them is Khuzhir.  Every summer, this village collects tourists.  It has some signs of a city: an Internet cafe, a club, a museum, a library.  However, Khuzhir seems far from civilization.  After all, real islanders live here. </p><h2>  Island population </h2><p>  A very long time ago, people settled on Olkhon.  The site of <span>an ancient man</span> dating back to the Paleolithic era was found in the Sarai district.  Her age is estimated at more than 13 thousand years.  Today, about 1,500 people live in several villages.  Mostly it is Buryats, the indigenous population.  Their <span>occupation</span> is cattle breeding and fishing. </p>

    <p>  In Khuzhir, about 1200 people live in the local population.  The only industrial enterprise on the island is located here.  This is the Malomorsky fish factory, the largest on Lake Baikal. </p><p>  There is a village among the sand dunes, which consists of only a few houses.  This is the remainder of the former village of Kharantsy.  Baba Katya, her only inhabitant, sits on a blockage, listens to gulls flying over the island.  And how many folk traditions this old woman knows ... </p><h2>  Island climate </h2><p>  The warmest months on Olkhon are August and July.  The winters are rather snowless and mild, but longer than on the mainland.  Summer and spring come a little later than on the mainland.  Very little rain falls on Olkhon, about 200 mm per year.  This is the norm for semi-deserts.  The southwestern and southern parts are the driest not only on this island, but also on the whole of Baikal.  The seaside ridge is to blame for this.  Through it, air masses cross on the way to the island.  Overcoming it, they heat up, sliding into the Baikal basin.  This leads to a drop in humidity.  Therefore, rains intended for Olkhon usually fall on the eastern coast of Lake Baikal.  Olkhon rain is about 10 drops per hour.  However, heavy rains occur here, as well as prolonged inclement weather. </p><p>  Often a long wind blows on Olkhon.  At the same time, its northwestern direction prevails.  148 days - the average amount when the wind speed is more than 15 m / s. </p>

    <h2>  Legends of Olkhon Island </h2><p>  Like Baikal itself, Olkhon was overgrown with legends to such an extent that local residents feel themselves to be part of fairy tales.  Even the geographical names here speak for themselves.  In Khuzhir, for example, there is Cape Shamansky, which was ranked among the nine shrines of Asia.  Shamans used to stay on the island once.  Sacrifices to the spirits were made on this rock. </p><h2>  Cape of Love </h2><p>  The island is rich in cliffs and capes, which, like a talented artist, were created by nature.  Some resemble the shape of animals or people.  Cape of Love attracts tourists.  This is almost the main <span>attraction of Olkhon.</span>  They say that a rock with a certain fantasy resembles a woman's legs, bent at the knees. </p><p>  According to legend, if the Buryats could not conceive a child, they came here and asked the spirits to help.  And today, people use magical rock.  To ask a boy, according to legend, you need to go left, a girl - to the right.  If you want twins, go straight. </p><p>  On Olkhon, there are many places where it is customary to ask for something spirits or make wishes.  Shaman columns are scattered around the island.  On them should be tied colored ribbons, while making wishes.  There are places where people put candies, coins and other objects as a gift to the gods, asking them for something. </p>

    <h2>  Wish mirror </h2><p>  The Mirror of Desires is a place endowed with special magic.  To get here, you must overcome the dangerous and long path along Lake Baikal along the cliff of Olkhon Island.  But those who manage to do this will receive a unique view of the lake flooded with sunlight as a gift.  The majestic marble cliffs speak inaudibly here with the wind.  The mirror of desires, according to legend, is a window in the rock, which, if you enter it, can fulfill your innermost hopes and ideas. </p><h2>  Cape Chaek </h2><p>  Olkhon Island becomes a beach on hot summer days.  Many sandy beaches are available here.  Another definition that can be given to this island is the shelter of gulls.  There is even Cape Chaek.  It is a rock on the island of Olkhon, on which these birds gather in large flocks.  Boat trips are organized here for tourists.  Everyone has the opportunity to feed birds with bread.  They say that in the water you can inadvertently see a mermaid.  Of course, this is from the kind of beliefs and legends, but anything can happen. </p>
