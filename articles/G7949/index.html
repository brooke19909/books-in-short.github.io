This is a real diamond of the Mediterranean Sea, which sparkles in the rays of Helios - the god of the sun.  According to legend, the Aegean Sea hid Rhodes from prying eyes, and even the gods did not know about its existence.  But once the waters parted, and before all appeared a magnificent piece of land, which was worthy of the gods for its beauty.  This is the feeling that arises for everyone who first arrives on the island. </p><p>  Tourists who come to Rhodes to relax in one of the many hotels, for example, in the Esperos Palace Hotel 4 * <span>(Rhodes, Faliraki),</span> flying to the island by plane, experience an aesthetic shock from the breathtaking picture: transparent turquoise sea surface, sometimes covered with snow-white foam;  picturesque, beautifully indented shores forming bays;  luxurious vegetation, fragrant flowers.  The island is also a real open-air museum: ancient artifacts are scattered throughout Rhodes, which delight lovers of antiquity. </p>

    <h2>  Resorts </h2><p>  There are magnificent recreation areas with developed tourist infrastructure along the coastline of Rhodes.  Here, amidst lush greenery, chic hotels and hotel complexes, restaurants and taverns, discos and bars whiten.  The best resorts of Rhodes are Ialysos, Ischia, Kallithea and Faliraki.  The latter is home to the wonderful Esperos Palace Rhodes hotel, which annually hosts thousands of tourists from around the world, including Russia. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  The island can be reached by air and water.  However, most tourists who travel to Rhodes from Russian cities, of course, use air transport.  The airport is located on the west coast, 16 kilometers from the capital.  Most flights connecting the island with many countries and cities of the world are charter.  There is also internal communication with the Greek capital and many other cities and islands, for example Thessaloniki, Lesbos, Sandorini, Crete, Paros, etc. As for water transport, you can get to Rhodes either by ferry or ferry boat (in Russia we call them ‚Äúrockets‚Äù). </p><p>  Most of the tourists who come to the island do not stop in the capital, but go to some of the resorts, for example, Faliraki, where the aforementioned four-star comfortable hotel Esperos Palace Hotel 4 * (Rhodes) is located.  Tours most often include transfers from the airport to the hotel.  But if you arrived on the island on your own, you can take a taxi, however it will cost a lot, or buy a bus ticket, but you will not have a guarantee that it will take you to the door of your hotel. </p><p>  There is a very good option - car rental.  It will cost you from 25 euros per day to 50 (the price depends on the brand of car).  In fact, if you came to Rhodes not only to enjoy a wonderful beach holiday, but also to visit the many attractions, the presence of a rented car is what you need.  You do not have to buy expensive sightseeing tours, but you can just drive and go wherever you want. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Resort Faliraki </h2><p>  So, you bought a tour to the Esperos Palace <span>Hotel 4 *</span> (Kastoria is a city in which there is another hotel of this chain with the same name, but this article is not about it).  So where is he located?  As you already understood, it is located in the village of Faliraki.  This is a small resort with a population of about 700 people, but in season, and it lasts quite a long time (from late April to late October), the population of the village increases significantly.  Faliraki is located on the shores of Kefara Bay. </p><p>  Holidays at this resort will appeal to tourists of all ages, those who travel alone, young couples craving romance, and even numerous families who come to the island with a large crowd of children.  Everyone here will find what he likes best.  So, for example, for young people thirsting for noisy nightly entertainment, there are many clubs, discos, bars, etc. For kids - a water park, slides, attractions, a zoo.  Fans of shopping can go to large shopping centers or look into small boutiques of branded clothing.  You probably know that many Russian tourists come to Greece in order to buy a chic coat of local production at an affordable price.  However, acquiring a mantle in Faliraki is not practical. </p><h2>  Beaches of Faliraki </h2><p>  What attracts tourists to this resort?  Well, firstly, here, without exaggeration, the most organized beaches on the island, and throughout Greece.  Thanks to this, the 3-4 km long Faliraki coastline, divided into several segments, was awarded the EU‚Äôs Blue Flag.  The infrastructure of all beaches without exception is perfect.  All of them have restaurants, taverns, full beach equipment, clean bathrooms, first-aid posts, kiosks, playgrounds for various sports, children's playgrounds, etc. The vast majority of these beaches are municipal, and only rare are private property.  There is also a separate area for nudists. </p><h2>  Esperos <span>Palace Hotel 4 *:</span> general </h2><p>  This magnificent hotel was built in 1985.  However, in 2009, it was reconstructed.  After that, the hotel received 4 * category and became one of the best among many resort hotels.  Today, tourists who come to rest on the shores of the Aegean Sea, can receive service at the highest level.  By the way, this is not a single hotel, but one of the members of the Esperos Palace chain.  Rhodes, in particular the village of Faliraki, was chosen by the leadership of this hotel chain as one of the most convenient, environmentally friendly places in all of Greece. </p>

As already noted, hotel guests enjoy some benefits on the beach.  For example, beach towels, sun loungers and parasols are provided free of charge.  But water entertainment will have to pay. </p><h2>  Esperos Palace <span>Hotel 4 * (Rhodes):</span> guest reviews </h2><p>  The ratings of those who have already managed to stay at this hotel are different.  Some people like food, but some people think it is monotonous.  There are people who are grateful to the staff for providing comfort, while others consider some team members to be unscrupulous.  Nevertheless, almost everyone is satisfied with the excellent location, as well as the cleanliness of the hotel.  There are no complaints about rarely cleaned rooms or infrequently changed towels and bedding.  Guests also share their vivid impressions of traditional Greek evenings.  By the way, some guests complain about the lack of a menu in Russian.  The administration explains this by the fact that guests from Russia are not so frequent here. </p>
