    <p>  Now we will talk about the main milestones of the development of MGFOMS.  Moscow established this body by a separate Government Decree.  His work is regulated by the relevant Law of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  In 1994, a medical insurance system was implemented in Moscow.  The ‚ÄúTemporary MHI Rules" began to operate.  A funding arrangement has been adopted.  For the first time, penalties have been introduced for hospitals and clinics. </p><p>  In 1995, the Moscow <span>Fund for Compulsory Health Insurance</span> developed a model agreement through which the procedure for managing an account was determined.  This approach facilitated the organization‚Äôs activities and cash control.  In all QMS of the capital, centers for protecting the rights of insured persons were created. </p><p>  And since 1996, the Moscow City Register of Medical Services relating to the compulsory medical insurance system began to operate.  Soon, uniform tariffs were approved, which extended to various services.  Agreements have been adopted defining the principles of joint activity between MGFOMS and departmental organizations.  From this moment, the obligation of insurers to protect patients through compulsory medical insurance was determined.  In addition, an arbitration expert commission was established.  Its task is to resolve disputes arising between the subjects of mandatory medical insurance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since 1996, the principle of financing QS based on the average per capita standard has been in force.  The Regulation was approved, which regulates the procedure for maintaining and organizing the Unified Register of persons included in the system of mandatory medical insurance - policyholders. </p><h2>  Check </h2>

    <p>  If we talk about the principles of the MGFOMS, checking the policy is an incredibly important issue.  It should be said separately.  Three variants of the mandatory medical insurance policy are valid at the same time - electronic format, blue sheet, green card.  To check the document, you must go to the official website of the fund.  Next, select a picture that matches the format of your policy and enter the necessary data.  This document certifies the right to receive assistance throughout Russia.  And the scope of services is determined by the basic program, which operates on the basis of the relevant federal law. </p><h2>  Getting </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Compulsory Health Insurance Fund" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1995663.jpg" width="480"></div></h2><p>  The Moscow City Fund for Compulsory Medical Insurance issues a policy that is a guarantor of medical care.  You must always have it with you.  According to the Federal Law, the insured must present the policy at the time of applying for medical care.  In emergency cases, an exception may be made. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Moscow City Mandatory Health Insurance Fund provides services to all residents of the capital, regardless of location, age and gender.  Those who wish can issue a special electronic policy.  If necessary, the old version of this document can be exchanged for a new one. </p><p>  To obtain a compulsory medical insurance policy, an appropriate application should be submitted to a medical organization.  If you change your name or other personal data, you must notify the insurer within one month. </p><h2>  Electronic policy </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mgfoms policy check" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1995671.jpg" width="350"></div></h2><p>  The Moscow City Fund for Compulsory Medical Insurance offers a similar solution starting in 2015. On the organization‚Äôs official website, you can get a form by filling in which you can draw up an appropriate policy. </p><p>  In certain cases, the client may not be satisfied with the insurance company that provides MHI services.  In such a situation, you can choose another one from the list provided by the Fund. </p><p>  You can replace a medical organization once a year.  This must be done before November 1.  In special cases, the procedure can be carried out more often.  For example, upon termination of the contract. </p><p>  An electronic policy is a document that can only be used by its owner.  A chip is built into it.  It stores the signature and photo of the owner.  This approach makes it impossible for outsiders to use the document.  It is convenient to carry an electronic policy everywhere with you.  And you can sign up to the doctor through the portal of public services or an electronic terminal. </p>
