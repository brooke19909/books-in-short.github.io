Its most interesting feature is that each district has its own history and significant places, because in ancient times these were separate settlements.  Today, they form one of the most beautiful cities on the planet.  Let's get to know him as closely as possible. </p><h2>  What state is Los Angeles in? </h2><p>  The city of Angels is located in California, which, in turn, is one of the states of America.  It is worth noting such an important moment: this settlement is part of Greater Los Angeles, or Southland, an urban agglomeration with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã88,000 km¬≤, where 16.5 million people live (according to data for 2000).  It also includes 88 municipalities and covers the territory of five southern California counties. </p>

    <h2>  Foundation History </h2><p>  Los Angeles (California) in the 16th century was inhabited by the Chumash and Tongwa Indians.  In 1542, La Victoria and San Salvador, the ships on which the first Europeans sailed, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo and his deputy Bartolome Ferrelo, approached the shores of the modern City of Angels, and then the villages of Yang-Na.  In the bay of San Diego, they left only on September 28, after 2 months from the date of departure from the Mexican village of La Navidad.  In early January of next year, the discoverer is dying.  He was buried on the island of San Miguel, which was later renamed in honor of Cabrillo, and the journal with the data that he recorded during the expedition, transferred to the homeland of Ferrelo.  To this day, this book is kept in the archive of Spanish Seville. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  More than two centuries passed before the next group of missionaries landed on this site.  This time the leader was Gaspar Portol.  The group also included Juan Crespi - it was he who noted in the documents that this territory is suitable for life. </p><p>  In 1771, modern Los Angeles (California) receives another missionary who named his ‚Äúcase‚Äù after the archangel Gabriel.  It was Junipero Serra.  At that time, nearly 3,000 Indians inhabited this region of the globe, who formed 30 settlements.  And 10 years later, next to a group of missionaries led by Serra, consisting of 46 people, the governor Felipe de Neveu orders to establish a village.  They named the village in honor of Mary (Village of the Virgin Mary - Queen of the Angels).  The village gradually grew, but turned into a large secular town only by the year 20 of the 19th century.  At that time, 650 people already lived here. </p><p>  Los Angeles belonged to Mexico for some time after the state gained independence.  But after the defeat from America, the city became part of the United States.  The peace treaty was signed in 1848.  After a couple of years, the settlement received the status of a city, and after another 26 years, in 1876, the construction of the Los Angeles railway was completed. </p><p>  The main industry here was the cultivation of oranges and some other citrus fruits.  Thanks to this, the number of local residents has grown sharply: there were 2,200, and there were 100,000 people!  In 1892, oil deposits were discovered, and after just over 30 years, Los Angeles (California, photo below) ‚Äúabsorbed‚Äù ¬º of the world's gasoline production. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1913, an aqueduct was built, providing the future metropolis with water.  In short, since then, life in Los Angeles has begun to boil: the aviation industry has developed, numerous film studios have opened, and in 1932 even held the tenth Olympic Games. </p><p>  When the Second World War began, the city seemed to breathe new life into itself, although, it would seem, it should be the other way around.  In Los Angeles began to gather German figures of art, culture and science, who fled from Nazism.  Among these people are such famous personalities as Thomas Mann (writer, Nobel Prize winner in 1929), <span>Lyon Feuchtwanger</span> (German writer of Jewish origin) and Fritz Lang (film director).  In 1942, when World War II "walked" around the earth, according to Roosevelt‚Äôs decree, local residents of Japanese descent (which is thousands of people) are taken out of the city and settled in closed camps. </p><p>  After the end of hostilities, the city again began to grow rapidly in breadth.  Skyscrapers and new highways appeared.  Then came the "dashing 90s" when mass riots took place on the streets of the metropolis, during which a large number of people were wounded and killed.  The reason is Nazi hostility.  The fact is that in 1992, 4 white-skinned policemen beat a guy of the <span>Negroid race.</span>  But the last straw for blacks was the acquittal of human rights defenders in court.  The riots lasted for almost a week.  Then a special army was introduced into the city, and the instigators were arrested. </p><p>  In the mid-1990s, they planned to separate Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley from Los Angeles.  The reason was an earthquake, due to which many municipal buildings, infrastructure and residential buildings turned into piles of stones.  However, after holding a general vote in 2002, it became clear that the section was not destined to materialize. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  The official and unofficial symbols of Los Angeles </h2><p>  Now we know what state Los Angeles is in and how it appeared on Earth.  It's time to get acquainted with the symbols and emblem of the city.  First of all, tourists want to visit Hollywood and walk along the Avenue of Stars.  Therefore, the unofficial symbol is worth mentioning first.  The HOLLYWOOD sign is located on Mount Lee, towering 490 meters above sea level.  However, this territory is well guarded, so there is no way to get there.  But do not be upset - a beautiful landscape opens from the observation deck of Griffith Park.  From here you can also take a memory photo against the background of a popular sign. </p><p>  Now about the official symbol - the coat of arms.  It is colorful, but not motley, since only 7 colors are used, which are in perfect harmony with each other.  First of all, heraldry recalls the year of foundation of the City of Angels - the 1781st.  It is a circle with inscriptions and plants, in the middle of which is a shield.  It is divided into 4 parts, and each has a specific meaning.  Knowing the history, it is not difficult to understand it, since these parts symbolize countries that are somehow connected with Los Angeles.  In the upper right corner is a scarlet bear and a star - this is the <span>flag of California in</span> 1846.  Nearby, that is, on the left, you can see <span>the US flag.</span>  In the lower right part there is a tower and a lion, reminiscent of the kingdoms of Leon and Castile (recall that the discoverers came from this particular country).  And the last corner is reserved for the eagle tormenting the snake - once the <span>coat of arms of Mexico.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Los Angeles (California, USA), whose photo is present in this article, is characterized by a Mediterranean climate.  It has mild, wet winters and dry, hot summers.  But the temperature in the desert and on the coast is significantly different.  Precipitation occurs mainly in mountainous areas.  In mid-summer, the temperature can vary between 17-24 degrees Celsius, and in winter - +9 ... + 19 ¬∞ . </p><h2>  City of Los Angeles (California): Development Plan </h2><p>  Given that the City of Angels was built up at lightning speed, it does not have a clear layout.  The peculiarity lies in the fact that over time, the surrounding villages joined the "main" part of the settlement.  Today Los Angeles consists of Central, Hollywood, San Pedro, Silmar, Watts, Westwood, Bel Air and Boyle Heights.  The suburb forms the San Fernando Valley.  So, it turns out that Los Angeles surrounds Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Carvel City.  And it is divided into 2 parts by the mountains of Santa Monica, which is why it has five main zones: </p><ul><li>  Westside. </li><li>  Downtown. </li><li>  Southern Los Angeles. </li><li>  East Los Angeles. </li><li>  Port area. </li></ul>
