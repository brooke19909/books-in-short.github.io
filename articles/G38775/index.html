    <h2>  Philips FC7088 for hard surfaces </h2><p>  The largest range of upright cleaning vacuum cleaners is Philips.  Consider a model that is used only for hard surfaces.  Do not clean carpets with the appliance.  The vacuum cleaner is equipped with a special brush.  During operation, it is capable of performing 6,700 rpm.  On the housing there is a reservoir for pouring detergents.  In most cases, on the network you can find laudatory reviews about this model.  They talk about high suction power, the presence of a separate container for water, excellent Hungarian quality.  But you can also find comments.  Although they are much smaller, but still this is not one review.  The Philips Vacuum Cleaner FC7088 has one significant drawback.  We are talking about the lack of mechanism for winding the power cable. </p>
