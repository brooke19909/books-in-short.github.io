    <p>  The <span>residential complex</span> can be reached both by public transport and by private car.  In the first case, it is enough for a resident to walk to the Belorussky railway station or to the Dynamo metro station in Moscow.  Next to the house lies Leningradsky Prospekt, from where you can go to the center through Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street or through the Third Transport Ring, as well as into the suburbs via Volokolamsk Highway.  In addition to these directions, the presented roads allow you to get to anywhere in the city and suburbs. </p><h2>  Infrastructure LCD "Tsarskaya Square" </h2><p>  The internal arrangement of the complex is thought out to the smallest detail - it's a pastry shop, grocery store, fitness center, restaurant.  In walking distance from the LCD there are numerous schools and lyceums, a large shopping center "Aviapark", clinics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The peculiarity of the Tsarskaya Ploshchad residential complex is the projected green zone, which will be equipped for pedestrians with cozy boulevards, large lawns, intricate architectural complexes, fountains, and in the winter, residents will be able to use the ice rink.  The ecology of the district where the residential complex is located is also at a high level in comparison with other microdistricts of the city, even despite the proximity to major highways and the constant traffic of cars.  The proximity to the Petrovsky Park complex makes housing in the residential complex even more comfortable and useful. </p>

    <h2>  Architecture and apartment options </h2><p>  The historical location of the complex prompted the developer to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa bright concept, with the names of the buildings tied to the history of Russia - Catherine, Alexandrovsky, Romanovsky and Petrovsky. </p><p>  Speech has developed an interesting architectural solution.  The basis of the new LCD will be the <span>Tsar's Pavilion,</span> which was built in the 80s of the 19th century in honor of the All-Russian Exhibition of Industry and Art, where the greatest achievements of the Russian Empire of that time were exhibited.  In honor of the arrival of the imperial family, a special pavilion was built, which has survived to this day.  It will be he who will become an inspiration for architects in the design of both the pompous interior and the elegant appearance of the LCD. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The construction of four buildings of the Tsarskaya Square residential complex in Moscow takes place in two stages of commissioning: one in 2017 and the other in 2018. The approximate date for the full commissioning of the residential complex is 2019.  Therefore, you can purchase new housing at any time.  You can buy an apartment now in the Alexander and Catherine buildings for every taste: there are apartments and apartments, from studios to 4-room living spaces.

    <h2>  Reviews about LCD "Tsarskaya Square" and the results </h2><p>  There is no point in doubting that the funds spent on the purchase will be in danger - the company is verified.  LCD "Tsarskaya Ploshchad" is not the first MR Group facility; it is a rather large construction company in Moscow. </p><p>  Reviews about the LCD are mostly positive - close Moscow and Grushevskaya alleys where you can walk;  lack of delays in the construction of the complex;  comfortable territorial location and developed infrastructure;  the presence of underground parking, which will provide round-the-clock availability of space for a personal car;  the absence of any legal problems with the developer and paperwork. </p><p>  Nevertheless, there are also negative reviews about the Tsarskaya Ploshchad residential complex - the constant noise that comes from the TTC and Leningradsky Prospekt;  proximity to the restaurant, where birthdays and other holidays are held;  the nearby Botkin Hospital with a constant siren sound;  the presence of roads between buildings that turn the complex into one big traffic jam;  more than a kilometer to Petrovsky Park through a busy highway and cars. </p><p>  However, in general, all these problems can be solved by other options for walking places, tightly closing windows.  If you are interested in housing that is located as close as possible to the Central District of Moscow, the lack of transport infrastructure and imperfect ecology are fading into the background, Tsarskaya Ploshchad is the best option for living. </p>
