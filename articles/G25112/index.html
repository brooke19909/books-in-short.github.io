    <p>  Our compatriots really liked the food - everything was delicious and varied.  Always on the trays fresh vegetables and fruits, many types of dessert. </p><p>  The sea, more precisely, the lagoon, is beyond praise.  Despite some limited bathing area, even vacationers from neighboring five-star hotels came here.  Sand cover, the only negative is the risk of injuring yourself on large stones in the water in some areas. </p><p>  Some also did not like the animation, which, in their opinion, was too sluggish, as well as the fact that the staff practically did not speak Russian. </p>
