    <h2>  About arrival and booking </h2><p>  So, the description of Mitsis Grand Hotel 5 * (Rhodes) is quite impressive.  As well as photos, looking at which you can be inspired by the idea to spend your vacation in this wonderful place.  Therefore, it is worth briefly telling about the nuances of booking and arrival. </p><p>  Firstly, booking a room should be long before the intended trip.  Mitsis Grand Hotel 5 * (Rhodes) is very popular - hotel information makes this clear.  Therefore, if you want to have time to book a room for your vacation, you should do it in a few months.  Especially when the vacation is planned for the summer.  In winter and autumn, usually there are rooms available. </p><p>  If guests come with a child under two years old, they will be offered a cot.  And she, and the baby's stay is free.  It will not be necessary to pay extra for a child whose age does not exceed 12 years.  But only if he sleeps on the beds in the room.  For an additional charge of 25% of the cost of the reservation.  And if a person over 12 years old came with guests (their child, or someone else close, who just suddenly wanted to relax), you will have to pay 35%.  An extra bed will also be provided.  It is only advisable to make a request to her in advance so that the administration has time to prepare everything. </p><h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  Each guest should be aware of certain provisions that must be observed while staying on vacation at this hotel.  So, there is a dress code that applies to restaurants.  People who are presentably dressed are allowed to go there.  That is, not in shorts, slates, T-shirts and, especially, swimming suits.  Pants are for guys, light dresses are for girls.  It should be remembered that the hotel corresponds to a certain status.  Therefore, it is important to follow the dress code. </p><p>  Upon check-in, guests will be required to present a valid ID and credit card.  As the first, foreign or civil passports are usually used.  By the way, during a preliminary reservation, you may need to block a certain amount on your credit card account.  This acts as a specific guarantee.  The fact is that many people, not sure whether they can even go on vacation, reserve rooms - just in case.  And as a result, the reservation is canceled shortly before the busy dates.  And rarely, who reserves the vacated apartments, since usually there are several days before arrival - as practice shows.  Therefore, you need to block funds on a credit card. </p><p>  And yet, it is better to contact the property in advance and inform the arrival time, at least approximately.  In case of uncertainty, it is advisable to indicate the early hours - so that later, upon arrival, do not wait until the staff prepares the room. </p>

    <h2>  What else do guests say? </h2><p>  As it was already possible to understand, extremely positive leave reviews about Mitsis Grand Hotel 5 * (Rhodes).  Although some guests say that the number of rooms is old.  However, this is not a minus - modern and high-quality furniture is installed inside.  And the apartments themselves are decorated in a good, pleasant and cozy style. </p><p>  If possible, it is best to ask for a room on the top floor.  It is quieter than in other apartments, since they are taken inland from the facade.  And there is also the opportunity to walk on the roof and meet the sunset there. </p><p>  In addition to cleaning, the staff is happy to change towels, bedding and toiletries every day.  And in the refrigerator put clean fresh water in sealed bottles.  Also, if guests leave somewhere for the whole day (for an excursion, for example), then you can order lunch with you.  By the way, the all-inclusive service is very useful here, since Rhodes is an expensive city, like any other capital.  And, as the practice of guests has shown, eating and drinking is better at the hotel, since the level here is more than decent.  People who managed to go to local restaurants say that in the hotel establishments the food is much more delicious.  And alcohol with drinks serves quality. </p><p>  In general, Mitsis Grand is a hotel that will be an ideal option for people who want to get everything from vacation and more.  No wonder many people come back here again. </p>
