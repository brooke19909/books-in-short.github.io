It must be admitted that this is an industrial giant that offers many jobs in various industries, a city of regional significance, where people come not only from towns and villages, but also from neighboring regions in the hope of a better life.  That is why at a certain point in time the existing residential areas and houses became sorely lacking, the need for real estate increased at times.  Modern construction companies to replace the cramped and small-sized Khrushchevs have offered spacious and most comfortable apartments in areas with their own infrastructure.  Thus, people ceased to be afraid of remote areas of the city, began to move to suburban new buildings, even with children.  Modern technologies and innovations have made apartments in such complexes accessible to all categories of citizens.  One of these projects was the Zenit residential complex in Nizhny Novgorod, located on Krasnozvezdnaya Street near Gagarin Avenue. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.289023109334174" data-lng="43.9841649465576" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/7/9/3/16793.png"></div><p>  As part of this material, we will conduct the most detailed and objective review of the complex, we will tell not only about the advantages, but also about the shortcomings that the interest holders managed to identify. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  Real estate in Nizhny Novgorod today is represented by a variety of options from economy to business class, each of which should be considered separately.  The Zenit complex is a large-scale residential development project, presented by more than a dozen homes and infrastructure.  Construction under the guidance of the Dynasty Group of Companies is being carried out in several stages; today more than 20 houses have been commissioned.  This makes it possible for the first residents to really appreciate the complex, namely, the level of comfort that it provides. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.domostroynn.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Zenit Nizhny Novgorod" class="if uuid-3197204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3197204.jpg"></div><p>  To date, the Zenit residential complex in Nizhny Novgorod is the most discussed project, since it is the largest in the city.  Proximity to the center, the availability of all necessary infrastructure, excellent transport accessibility, spacious apartments with rough finishes - all that is guaranteed by the developer.  But how is it really? </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Many are interested in the location of the Zenit residential complex (Nizhny Novgorod), how to get to it.  A huge territory of the former anti-aircraft missile school was chosen for the construction of the new microdistrict, which is the name of the project.  The Soviet district has always been one of the most attractive, because it boasts a developed infrastructure, is quite close to the center and all its attractions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Within walking distance from the complex is already under construction a water park - a favorite place for recreation and entertainment, especially for children.  And across the road from it is the famous Swiss park with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã380 hectares.  Just imagine what kind of view opens from the windows of apartments, and such a neighborhood is extremely favorable for the ecological situation of the region.  There are no large industrial enterprises in the Sovetsky District, respectively, such real estate is an ideal place to live. </p><div class="photo" data-original="7sten.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="real estate in nizhny novgorod" class="if uuid-3197205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3197205.jpg"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  If your family has a personal car, you can get to anywhere in the city and any part of it quite quickly, literally in 30-40 minutes.  But even if you do not have a personal car, you are unlikely to experience the hardships of life without it if you choose an apartment in Nizhny Novgorod in the Zenith residential complex.  There are enough public transport stops near the new buildings, and various bus and municipal taxi routes run in its direction. </p><h2>  Landscaping </h2><p>  The developer opted for the concept of enclosed courtyards, isolated from through traffic.  It was this approach that made it possible to equip areas for recreation, walks, and sports.  There are already not only modern playgrounds for children, but also sports areas for adults. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The builder also worked with the landscape, breaking flower beds, flower beds, sowing free areas of lawn grass.  No garbage and dirt, abandoned sites - everything is ennobled and landscaped. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The complex‚Äôs own infrastructure is the main advantage of the Zenit residential complex in Nizhny Novgorod.  The reviews of the first residents are the main evidence that living here is really comfortable, and for all categories of citizens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nn.mk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD infrastructure" class="if uuid-3197206" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3197206.jpg"></div><p>  Just imagine: within walking distance of 8 kindergartens, 5 schools, a gymnasium with in-depth study of foreign languages, several universities, a music school, the Palace of Sports, a swimming pool, more than 15 grocery stores, a clinic and many service organizations.  In order to make purchases, take children to educational activities and just take a walk, you do not have to leave the area.  The developed infrastructure of the Zenit residential complex is a real gift for residents. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  Many of us are tired of cramped and completely inappropriate for family life apartments.  That is why the residents of the city had great hopes for the Zenit residential complex in Nizhny Novgorod.  Thoughtful ergonomic layouts presented in a variety of species - this is what they got. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stnmedia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Zenit Nizhny Novgorod how to get there" class="if uuid-3197221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3197221.jpg"></div><p>  The complex offers one-, two- and three-room options from 38 to 92 square meters.  A one-room apartment is a great option for a young family, because in the concept of the project it is much more than the usual standard "odnushka".  Her footage allowed to break the space into a spacious kitchen-dining room, which can be used for lunch, dinner, as well as reception, and a full isolated bedroom.  At the same time, there was a place for a spacious wardrobe and a separate bathroom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realty-52.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gk dynasty" class="if uuid-3197209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3197209.jpg"></div><p>  When designing two-room apartments, they adhered to the principle of rational use of the area: a spacious kitchen-living room, an additional bathroom, a wardrobe, rooms facing opposite sides.  All this provides maximum comfort for residents.  And finally, two-bedroom apartments are a great option for a large family.  Their layout is classic, but functional.  Large kitchen, spacious rooms, facing different directions, and in the hallway there is a place for additional storage. </p><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  All apartments in the LCD are for rent with rough finish, which provides for the preparation of surfaces for future decor, screed on the floor, electrical wiring, plumbing.  Each apartment has high-quality entrance doors and double-glazed windows of European production. </p><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  Apartments LCD "Zenith" in Nizhny Novgorod - affordable luxury.  And proof of this are real estate prices.  So, you will be able to purchase a one-room apartment with rough finish for only 2.4 million rubles, a spacious three-ruble will cost you 5.5. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nn.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd zenith nizhny novgorod reviews" class="if uuid-3197215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3197215.jpg"></div><p>  At the moment, the apartment can be purchased not only with full payment, but also in installments until the final completion of construction.  The largest partner banks offer excellent conditions for mortgage lending. </p><h2>  Opinion of residents </h2><p>  Many buildings have already been commissioned and settled, their residents do not cease to leave feedback.  Most of them are positive.  People are delighted with the scale of the project, the impressive territory that they managed to organize and equip correctly.  All the necessary infrastructure is really at hand, they can be reached on foot in 5-7 minutes.  The apartments turned out to be spacious, bright and quite warm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kudago.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Zenit Nizhny Novgorod" class="if uuid-3197228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3197228.jpg"></div><p>  Residents focus on the good work of the management company: the yards are clean and well-groomed, garbage is removed in a timely manner, the elevators are monitored.  By the way, all the entrances are equipped with noiseless elevators, so nothing violates the peace of the inhabitants.  Perhaps the only drawback is the lack of free parking spaces.  Now there are so many cars that some residents are forced to park them right in the yard, hampering the movement of pedestrians and closing the passage for special equipment.  The developer really did not calculate the possible number of cars.  Residents can only hope that by the time the construction is completed, a multi-level parking will be erected, which will definitely solve the problem. </p><p>  LCD "Zenith" definitely deserves attention, being still the most ambitious representative of residential real estate in Nizhny Novgorod.
