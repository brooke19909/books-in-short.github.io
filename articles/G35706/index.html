    <h2>  Caves beach resort </h2><p>  It is located ten kilometers from Hurghada and built in the style of Stone-Rock-Mountain.  On its landscaped territory there are pools and waterfalls with built-in lights, a huge number of plants.  The uniqueness of <span>Caves Beach Resort 5 *, the</span> photo of which surprises even an experienced tourist, is that its rooms are decorated in the style of caves and decorated with wood and high-quality stone. </p><p>  The hotel was built relatively recently - in 2014.  Its area is forty thousand square meters.  Everything is thought out to the smallest detail on the territory: everywhere there are tracks, signs, night lighting, in all public places there is Internet.  The nearest airport is fifteen miles away, and El Gouna is eight kilometers away. </p><p>  In addition to the external and internal design, the hotel has another feature: only those who are already sixteen years old can be accommodated in it. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  In addition to swimming pools, restaurants and cafes, residents of the Caves Beach Resort can use the conference room, which has all the necessary equipment, a car rental, a TV room, a laundry, a hairdresser, a beauty salon, a medical office, and a currency exchange office.

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  On the ground floor of the administrative building there is a restaurant, where, according to the "buffet" system, residents are offered meals.  Here about six hundred people can take food at the same time.  Another reservation-based restaurant is made in the form of a cave, the walls of which are a huge aquarium.  There are several types of meat and fish on the menu; seafood is served twice a week.  The abundance of salads, snacks, sweets and fresh fruits will satisfy even a gourmet.  According to our compatriots, they were quite satisfied with the choice of alcoholic beverages. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to restaurants, the Caves Beach Resort also has several bars, including a poolside, as well as the opportunity to order a vegetarian menu. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The sea is only eighty meters from the main building.  You need to go to the beach through the hotel.  Umbrellas, towels, mattresses and trestle beds for residents are issued free of charge.  Since Caves Beach Resort is considered a relatively new hotel, much of its infrastructure is not yet complete.  For example, the pier has not yet been completed, so tourists, judging by the reviews, had to use a pontoon located on a nearby beach. </p>

    <p>  The entrance to the sea is smooth, but because of the coral, it is necessary to use special shoes.  There is a bar on the beach. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Caves Beach Resort has two freshwater pools.  One of them is heated in winter, and you can swim in it even in December, which is very rare for Egyptian hotels.  Moreover, one of the pools is equipped with hydromassage.  The hotel has a team of animators.  During the day they spend aerobics, gymnastics, team games with the guests, and in the evenings they organize competitions, discos, and offer to sing karaoke. </p><p>  Since January 2016, the hotel has opened a gym.  You can also play table tennis or billiards. </p><p>  On the beach, vacationers have plenty of water activities, including diving.  You need to pay extra for them.  In turn, <span>beach volleyball</span> and indoor soccer are free.  The pavilion offers a massage course.  A visit to the SPA center is a paid service. </p><p>  In general, the hotel administration does everything to make tourists comfortable and fun at Caves Beach Resort (Hurghada). </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Along with the recommendations and official information provided by tour operators, our compatriots almost always study the comments and impressions of those who have already visited the hotel that interests them.  I must say that almost all tourists were satisfied with their choice.  Judging by their reviews, this one-of-a-kind hotel is fully consistent with its five-star category.  Many chose it precisely because of the original design, because not every day is given the opportunity to live in a real cave. </p><p>  There is no such hotel in any other country.  The rooms are spacious and very stylishly decorated.  They are furnished with original furniture.  However, for some tourists it seems that the rooms are a bit dark, so having a bright lamp would not hurt. </p><p>  The staff works in good faith, and if there are any misunderstandings, then they will be immediately corrected at the registry. </p><p>  Entertainment at the hotel enough.  Many in their reviews mention the pool and the excellent <span>work of the animators.</span> </p><p>  The hotel area is quite large.  As for nutrition, opinions here agree: it is of high quality and diverse.  The dishes are not only tasty, but always new.  And although some did not like the fact that there are a lot of dead corals on the beach, it is impossible to swim without rubber shoes, nevertheless, the sea is wonderful. </p><p>  In a word, many recommend spending their holidays in Caves Beach Resort. </p>
