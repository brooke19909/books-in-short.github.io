  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Magic Rowan Bead</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  From time immemorial, mountain ash has been called the "magic tree" or "witch tree" that can protect against any kind of witchcraft.  It was always believed that this particular tree is capable of developing the gift of foresight and endowing man with supernatural powers.  Once upon a time, whole groves of mountain ash could be found in places of worship of the ancient gods, they were considered sacred and untouchable and surrounded these areas with a halo of magical protection.  Now these magic properties of mountain ash have been forgotten, but it is she who is able to protect a person from other people's charms and bestow his ability to see the future.  So why not create such a beautiful talisman as a rowan from beads that protects against negative magical influences. </p><p>  Incredibly beautiful mountain ash in the snow from beads.  She will become not only the keeper of the hearth, but also the decoration of the home interior.  The work on its creation does not take so much time and does not need too much variety in materials.  A rowan tree under snow from beads will require large red beads for assembly, smaller white and transparent ones to create snow, a thin wire to create branches and a thicker one for the central trunk.  Also at the end of the work, to create the base (stand) you will need a form, alabaster, <span>PVA glue</span> and brushes.  It is very convenient to cut the wire with wire cutters, and wrap the barrel, if desired and available, with floristic paper, nylon thread or mouline thread.  For starters, you should cut the wire.  I measure the current forty-five centimeters.  It will take fifty segments.  And it is also necessary to cut the wire into lengths of twenty-five centimeters.  Such segments will need twenty-five pieces.  For the barrel, measure out an arbitrary length. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Rowan from beads begins with the creation of berries.  To do this, one red bead-berry is strung on a thin wire and a twist of at least 6-7 millimeters is performed, then the next berry bead and twist are followed, and so on, until the end of the wire is two or three centimeters long.  The finished bunch should have at least 13-14 berries.  It turns out fifty blanks, but if desired, you can do more and make them more magnificent by connecting the blanks two at a time together.  Then the rowan from the beads will turn out brighter and more luxurious. </p><p>  Even easier is the work of making snow.  For her, on shorter pieces of thin wire, it is necessary to string mixed white and transparent beads and twist along the entire length into small loops.  The result should be 7-8 finished snow loops.  An equal number of lush bunches with berries and loops with snow are ready.  Now you need to connect them, distributing the snow over the berries and secure by twisting the ends of the wire. </p><p>  The main work is completed and now it‚Äôs worth starting to fasten the twigs to the trunk.  All connections of the trunk and branches must be fixed as best as possible and wrapped with <span>floral tape</span> or <span>nylon thread.</span>  Rowan in the snow from the beads is almost ready, it remains only to plant it in a form previously lubricated with vegetable oil for easy removal, and pour it with a mixture of alabaster and water.  When the base hardens, we take out the tree from the form and proceed to its decoration.  Rowan from beads is painted with watercolors and covered with a mixture of alabaster, water and PVA glue.  Then you can dream up a little and decorate the base, branches and trunk with <span>artificial snow</span> (fine salt mixed with loose sparkles), but you need to do this while the tree has not dried up yet. </p><p>  Rowan under the snow from beads is completely ready.  Such a work of art should take the most honorable place in the house.  Now you can evaluate your creation and listen to the admiring cheers of the guests.  Showered with flickering sparkles, cold and beckoning with bright ripe berries, it simply bewitches and bewitches with its splendor. </p>
