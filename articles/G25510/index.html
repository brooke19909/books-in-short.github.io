    <p>  The focus of this article is the ‚ÄúDSLR‚Äù Nikon D5100 Kit, which holds a leading position in the digital technology markets of all countries of the world.  Characteristics, reviews of professionals and amateurs, as well as a small overview of the sought-after functionality will allow a potential buyer to get to know the legend better. </p><h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  For the first time having seen a digital device and picking it up, the buyer will be very surprised at its light weight and small size.  The thing is that the manufacturer worried about user convenience and tried to make the Nikon D5100 Kit SLR camera as compact as possible.  The case of the gadget is made of durable plastic, and not of <span>magnesium alloy,</span> as in professional devices.  As for amenities, there‚Äôs nothing to complain about, the shape of the camera, its bends and mounts completely repeat the contour of expensive devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having given 30,000 rubles for the ‚ÄúDSLR‚Äù, not a single buyer will be disappointed with their choice, because, in addition to the functionality of the digital device and the convenience of use, the manufacturer has taken care of even the smallest details.  If we talk about product packaging, then the factory tried to equip the gadget with all the necessary accessories.  Need an extension of functionality?  Please choose any components on the market, full compatibility (lenses, flashes, filters, remotes). </p><h2>  Link to the Sea Monster </h2><p>  The abbreviation Kit, which is present in the name of any SLR camera, indicates that there is a lens in the box with the digital device.  The <span>Nikon D5100</span> Kit can be shipped from the factory in several trim levels that differ only in lens models.  The most popular modification is a device with Nikon 18-55 VR optics.  Such a camera is able to satisfy a home user who wants to shoot households indoors and outdoors. </p>

    <p>  But for creativity and semi-professional activity, it is better to give preference to a device with a rangefinder lens 18-140 VR or 18-105 VR.  Their main feature is an increased <span>focal length,</span> which allows you to shoot distant objects.  But for shooting portraits, none of the above lenses are suitable.  Professionals recommend that beginners in such cases purchase a camera in the Body configuration (without a lens) and buy separately aperture optics with minimal focus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Multimedia Screen Amenities </h2><p>  Naturally, the rotary display is the main factor for many buyers whose choice fell on the Nikon D5100 Kit.  Reviews of professionals assure that this is the only element that any photographer would like to see on his mirror device.  The liquid crystal screen is connected to the gadget body with a special hinge that allows the display to rotate and tilt at any angle. </p>

    <p>  The three-inch display has a high resolution, which allows the user not only to make manual settings in the camera, but also to choose the correct exposure when shooting.  It is also convenient to view the captured material on a high-quality screen and select decent photos without connecting to a computer. </p><h2>  High quality home video </h2><p>  On video in FullHD format ‚Äúmirror‚Äù Nikon D5100 Kit 18-55 VR reviews is only positive.  After all, there are not many similar digital devices on the market that have tracking autofocus directly during video recording.  Also, the advantages include the ability to record stereo sound.  True, the organization of the manufacturer leaves much to be desired, because for the implementation of the functionality you need an external stereo microphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  We must not forget about the convenience of recording video.  The user no longer needs to keep the camera in front of him, the rotary screen allows you to greatly simplify the shooting process, however, a beginner still has to spend several hours getting used to the controls. </p><h2>  The most delicious gingerbread </h2><p>  Although the Nikon D5100 Kit AF-S does not have a full-sized matrix, its dimensions nevertheless exceed several times the performance of conventional compact devices.  Thanks to this matrix, the user receives high-quality images.  It is fashionable to discuss megapixels and their number in smartphones and portable gadgets, however, only with the help of a SLR camera can you see significant differences.  A 16-megapixel sensor is enough to take a high-quality photo and place it in full size on any wall of the room. </p>

    <p>  In the media, many professionals speak negatively about the noise reduction system in the camera.  Yes, the matrix still does not reach the professional level and in low light demonstrates low-quality photographs.  The situation can only be corrected with an external flash and the installation of a <span>fast lens.</span> </p><h2>  Work speed </h2><p>  High productivity and photo processing speed have forced many fans to switch from compact devices to the Nikon D5100 Kit.  Customer reviews on the performance of the mirror device reveal in detail all the amenities of the EXPEED2 processor built into the gadget.  Pressed the button - the frame was saved, and the camera is ready to continue shooting in a split second.  We need a series of frames - please, no delays, everything works quickly and without any problems. </p>

    <p>  Some lovers claim that they got a defective camera when buying, because it freezes during serial shooting or video recording.  However, professionals counteract such claims with recommendations for installing high-speed SD memory cards (Grade 10 or Ultra).  The problem is fixed immediately. </p><h2>  The machine solves all problems </h2><p>  The purchase of a Nikon D5100 Kit SLR camera by beginners and amateurs is due to the fact that the manufacturer provided the owner with easy shooting control, creating many ready-made setup scenes that work in automatic mode.  It is this functionality that is constantly discussed in the media.  The advantages include ordinary users, and the disadvantages are professional photographers.  The dispute is resolved quite simply: you just need to compare the car with a manual gearbox and an automatic machine. </p><p>  Choosing ready-made settings, it will be easier for a newcomer to get acquainted with the work of an SLR camera.  By learning how to determine the correct exposure, the user can make their own changes to the settings.  With manual control, everything is complicated, but, on the other hand, you can achieve better picture quality, because the manufacturer could not provide all the options for lighting and color saturation. </p><h2>  Oh, these buttons! </h2><p>  A large number of switches and buttons complements the huge wheel with many divisions located on the top panel of the Nikon D5100 Kit.  Naturally, such an abundance indicates the wide functionality of the mirror device, but the first days of operation the gadget introduces into a stupor any beginner.  In fact, there is nothing complicated in this, on the contrary, the manufacturer simply brought out additional buttons to the device‚Äôs case and provided the user with the opportunity to assign frequently used functionality to them. </p>

    <p>  It is clear that without instructions it will be difficult to figure it out, but that's exactly what all professionals advise to do in their reviews.  A theory without practice can hardly help anyone, so you need to open the camera menu and try all the settings.  You don‚Äôt need to be afraid to break the gadget, because you can return it to the factory settings with just one action in the global system settings. </p><h2>  Chips and features of the "SLR" </h2><p>  The advantages that are present in the camera Nikon D5100 Kit, without a doubt, you can add the ability to remotely control.  It is carried out both from a wired and infrared remote control.  A very convenient feature when you need to take a picture of a family in full force.  The SLR camera is also able to work with devices from other manufacturers (we are talking about flashes and lenses), however, in most cases, the implementation of the functionality is possible only in manual mode. </p>

    <p>  Significant shortcomings in their reviews by professionals and amateurs include the impossibility of a quick ISO change when shooting in non-automatic mode.  Getting to the basic parameter, which is often requested through a function key, is very inconvenient. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  In general, the Nikon D5100 Kit SLR camera turned out to be very impressive.  It is lightweight, convenient, functional and very high quality shooting.  There is nothing to complain about even the most demanding user who wants to buy a camera for creativity and home use. </p>
