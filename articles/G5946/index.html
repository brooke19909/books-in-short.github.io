Under the financial market understand the scope of the manifestations of relations in the field of economy that arise between sellers and potential buyers of monetary and financial resources, investment values ‚Äã‚Äã(as a tool for the formation of financial resources), as well as about their real and use value. </p><p>  <strong><span>The structure of the financial</span> market</strong> is determined by the following components included in it.  This is foreign exchange, capital, securities (stock), cash (cash, cash <span>securities</span> and cash in other forms).  In addition, there is a market for gold and deposits (deposits) in commercial banks. </p><p>  The financial market is an informal or organized system of trading a variety of financial instruments.

    <p>  <strong>The capital market</strong> is a sphere of commodity relations in which long-term investment instruments are traded.  The demand for capital and its supply are interwoven into these relations.  Financial market infrastructure considers this element as one of the key. </p><p>  Securities with no maturity or with a maturity of more than a year are traded on the capital market.  This market is necessary to meet the needs of business entities in financing on a long-term basis. </p><p>  The form of movement of loan capital is a loan.  The sources of such capital are funds that are released in the production process (depreciation fund of enterprises, part of the working capital in the form of money, profit, population savings, state accumulation, etc.). </p><p>  The market for loan capital has two links: the credit system (medium and long-term bank loans) and the securities market. </p>
