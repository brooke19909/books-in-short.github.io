As night approached, they began to think about an overnight stay.  And on the top of the hill, travelers saw the temple.  In order not to sleep in the open air, they asked for shelter.  However, the ministers refused.  Merchants had to continue the journey.  But at night, dashing people attacked them to profit.  They were not going to spare anyone.  Only one traveler managed to survive.  And at that moment, he wished in the hearts of the temple, where he and his companions were not allowed to go, to fall underground under the fire with all who are inside.  The curse was heard, the temple went into the bowels of the earth, and the Skhodnensky bucket was formed in its place. </p>

    <h2>  And how did this natural monument actually appear? </h2><p>  This is just one version of the appearance of a unique natural monument.  Someone argues that such an ideal round shape could have happened only because of an unearthly origin.  Others are convinced that the Skhodnensky bucket is a place where a meteorite or crater of a volcanic volcano fell asleep.  Scientists explain everything differently.  Once the Skhodnya river was quite full-flowing and flowed exactly where the upper border of the bucket is located.  But time passed, the riverbed became deeper and deeper, retreating to the south.  But in the end Skhodnya was at the bottom of the pit.  That is, in fact, this natural monument, Skhodnensky bucket, was washed by the river, which gave it its name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So what is this place like?  It would seem that the capital of Russia is a huge metropolis, fully built up with skyscrapers, shrouded in exhaust gases and long forgotten about the wild.  It turns out, and there is a place where you can see the world, not spoiled by man.  You can, being within the city, get into the countryside or even into the forest. </p>

    <h2>  Description of the park </h2><p>  This natural-historical park is located in the South Tushino area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe North-Western Administrative District of Moscow.  We can say that this is a huge pit 40 m deep. But there are disagreements about its area.  Some say that it is 75 hectares, while others say that 107 hectares.  Despite the fact that the Skhodnensky bucket is located within the city, the nature here is magnificent, and it seems that civilization is very, very far away.  Here grow birch, ash, poplar, oak, mountain ash, elm, maple, aspen. </p><p>  Preserved in the exclusively wild nature sedge-cattail swamps, where you can find horsetail, <span>three</span> -leafed shift <span>,</span> multi-spike cannon.  The animal world is represented by such species as bluethroat, nightingale, moorhen, common oatmeal, reed badger.  For a long time, representatives of the Moscow Red Book also met here: a <span>viviparous lizard, a</span> brown hare, an ordinary newt, a weasel, an ordinary one, a sharp-faced frog, a snipe, a meadow horse, moorhen.  However, unfortunately, at present some of the species are destroyed.  One of the reasons environmental scientists consider the wide distribution of stray dogs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Historical heritage </h2><p>  Skhodnensky bucket is not only a unique natural object, but also of great importance for historians.  It is not for nothing that merchants are mentioned in the legend about its origin.  The thing is that a trade route that once led from Moscow to the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality once passed through this place.  During <span>archaeological excavations</span> , the remains of an ancient settlement from the beginning of the Iron Age - the Dyakovo settlement were found.  And next to it was discovered a burial mound, although later, the 11th ‚Äì 13th centuries.  Bones of fossil animals were also mined.  But perhaps the most important find in this place is the skull of a primitive man, or rather, its upper part.  The thing is that until then, scientists could not come to a common opinion about the time of the appearance of people in the territory of modern Moscow region.  And the remains of a person of a transitional type (from Neanderthal to modern) proved that the resettlement took place about 15 thousand years ago.  But that is not all.  Traces of incomprehensible origin remained on the skull, most reminiscent of the interweaving of threads in tissue.  And this is evidence that even in those distant times weaving could exist, although earlier evidence of this fact was not found. </p><p>  By the way, the find itself was completely random.  The oldest remains were discovered by workers during the construction of a derivatization channel. </p><h2>  "Bad place" </h2><p>  Now this place is a specially protected area.  And in 2004, it changed its official name.  Now this is Skhodnenskaya bowl.  Residents of Tushino love to walk in the park.  You can often see young mothers with strollers courageously making their way through the undergrowth.  However, many still try to avoid this place, they believe that the Skhodnensky bucket is an anomalous zone.  And we are ready to give evidence.  The main argument is the very existence of wildlife in the center of a long built-up and inhabited area, while construction organizations are ‚Äúfighting‚Äù for a piece of land.  But in the Soviet years, even before the recognition of the "bowl" as a protected natural monument, they allocated land for development, tried to create a reservoir, cultivated gardens and even conducted hang gliding trainings.  However, as we see, the Skhodnensky bowl remained unchanged.  Therefore, rumors are about the "bad" of this place. </p>

    <p>  Partly therefore, and partly because the nature here is really beautiful, adventure lovers are happy to sink to the bottom.  And the shores of Skhodnya were chosen by fishermen. </p><h2>  How to get into the "bowl"? </h2><p>  Going down is pretty easy.  Near the intersection of Okruzhnaya Street, Svetlogorsk and Factory Passages there is a very comfortable, well-trodden path that leads directly to the Skhodne River.  However, for those who are not designed for easy ways, there is another option.  You can choose any slope and try to get on it, overcoming obstacles.  Sometimes even barely noticeable paths come across, laid by the same adventurers. </p>

    <h2>  What about the future? </h2><p>  Not so long ago there was talk that the Skhodnensky bucket, whose photos are actually amazing in beauty, is planned to be ennobled.  There should appear benches, convenient paths, barbecue areas.  Whether this will be done or not is unknown.  However, residents of the Tushino microdistrict prefer to see the park as it is now.  After all, otherwise he will lose his charm and mystery of the wild, untouched nature against the background of the housing estate. </p>
