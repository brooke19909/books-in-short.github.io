However, for a long time this brand has nothing to do with this country.  The article will describe in detail the history of the company, as well as the model range, which includes high-quality and inexpensive copies. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The company appeared in the year of the end of World War II - in 1945. It was then that Max Gruding, who worked for a long time in a company selling radio receivers, resigned and decided to open his own production.  Development began with the creation of small devices, analogues of which were already on the market.  His radios enjoyed unprecedented success.  By 1950, the small company Max began to build up its potential.  The production of televisions has begun.  The range has expanded significantly.  In 1960, equipment was already assembled outside of Germany, in Belfast.  Then there was a feeling that this company will always be a market leader, however, due to strong competition, all management plans have changed. </p><p>  For a long time, Philips bought up the shares of Grundika, and in 1993 the brand completely passed into the ownership of a larger competitor.  But the <span>economic crisis</span> did its job - the company was resold again. </p><p>  Already in the early 2000s, the brand became "independent."  Unfortunately, by this period the company had accumulated huge debts, and it had to officially declare bankruptcy.  Now TVs "Grundik", customer reviews about which are at a high level, are produced by a Turkish company.  It is almost impossible to determine where the assembly takes place.  Representatives of Beko do not say the exact addresses, but confine themselves to the phrase that the devices are made at one of their plants.  However, it is impossible to find out where they are produced: in Germany, Portugal, Turkey or China.  Most often, ‚ÄúMade in Europe‚Äù is written on the technique. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grundik tv" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1488626.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  TV Series </h2><p>  Speaking about the lineup, it must be said that the ‚ÄúGrundik‚Äù is a TV known for its quality.  Instances, as a rule, have liquid crystal screens.  Among the series it should be noted the presence of plasma TVs.  But they are not particularly popular in the domestic market and you can buy them either on order at a home appliance store or on Internet resources. </p><p>  In Russia, the most famous are the following Grundik series: </p><ul><li>  TV Vision.  It is an LCD technology.  LED backlit models are also included in this series.  In stores under this name you can find copies with DVD-players.  The cost depends on the size of the screen, the availability of additional accessories.  On average, it ranges from 10 thousand to 63 thousand rubles.  The optimum ratio of price and quality is present in all Grundik models. </li><li>  TV Fine Arts.  This series includes models that can connect to the Internet and broadcast video.  Price - from 35 thousand to 65 thousand rubles. </li><li>  GLX TV.  Series models have a small number of functions.  As a rule, they are most often installed in the kitchen.  The buyer will have to pay no more than 13 thousand rubles for such a TV. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grundik tv instruction" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1488641.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The Grundik TV (reviews confirm this) has a traditional appearance.  Looking at it, it should be noted flat panels made of plastic.  Their width varies from 5 to 7 cm. The case is made in either black or silver.  Some models have a special stand.  It is made of durable glass.  Other devices are easily mounted on the wall.  The stand can be either rounded or regular rectangular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="TV grundik instructions for use" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1488644.jpg" width="600"></div>

The TV (the instruction contains useful information) differs from other brands in some nuances.  All specifications, functions and problems (with a solution) are described in the special manual that comes with the kit.  A separate paragraph takes up information about the screen and image quality. </p><p>  It should be noted that each TV display resolution is completely different.  Models that are inexpensive are equipped with a 1366x768 pixel screen.  Models with a display larger than 32 inches have a resolution of 1920 x 1080. An indicator at this level allows you to view video in HDTV and Full HDTV formats. </p><p>  Be sure to pay attention to the size of the models: the minimum screen size is 26 ", the maximum is 55".  Only TVs without tuners have a higher rate. </p><p>  The picture quality is very good.  All shades are bright and saturated, users do not observe an imbalance.  This can be understood by reading consumer reviews.  Due to the small response rate (only 5 ms) and some special technologies, image reproduction is at a good level. </p><p>  Buyers note that there is a problem with the GLX series.  Loops for moving objects stretch on the screen.  There are other problems in the same series.  For example, viewing angles are poor.  In fact, to get maximum pleasure from watching TV, you need to sit directly in front of it.  Otherwise, the image will sharply become worse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tv grundik reviews" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1488649.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Power consumption </h2><p>  TV "Grundik", the instruction for use of which is attached, will never spend a lot of electricity.  This is confirmed by the reviews that consumers leave about it.  The company makes sure that most models comply with class A. All economical devices have a special green sticker. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grundik tvs customer reviews" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1488657.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  3D models </h2><p>  Absolutely all the models included in the Fine Arts series support viewing video in 3D format.  Moreover, they have the function of transcoding a two-dimensional picture into three-dimensional.  If there is a need to record the program in this format, then an expanded list of options will allow you to do this. </p><p>  In order to watch video in 3D format on TVs, you need to wear glasses with an active shutter.  You can use a USB cable to charge them.  The built-in battery is enough to watch one or two films.  The set of models that have a screen size from 40 to 55 inches, includes several pairs of glasses.  The image in them is high-quality and rich. </p>
