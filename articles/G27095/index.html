But even if you do not have such a financial opportunity, with a competent approach, you can buy a plane ticket for miles.  By purchasing goods and services with a bank card, you get bonuses that can be spent on tickets in the future.  In this article you can read about the Tinkoff All Airlines map and traveler reviews about it. </p><h2>  Miles for Flights </h2><p>  Currently, almost every airline and many banks have bonus miles programs.  What are miles and what do they affect?  A mile is a conditional unit by which companies evaluate customer loyalty.  By themselves, they resemble similar programs in supermarkets: you buy goods, and points are awarded to your bonus card.  The same applies to miles.  Many people think that free mileage programs are a good way to save money on tickets, but that‚Äôs not entirely true.  In fact, it is most beneficial for those people who make working trips to other cities or countries, as well as professional travelers.  For the rest of the people who make flights a couple of times a year, miles will not bring any benefit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.justlogbookloan.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff all airlines review terms" class="if uuid-2859922" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2859922.jpg"></div><p>  Miles have a limited validity period: they are usually reset to zero on December 31.  What privileges can bonuses give? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Buying airline tickets at a discount. </li><li>  Free hotel reservation and travel car rental. </li><li>  Check-in for flights out of turn. </li><li>  Upgrading tickets (from economy you can be transferred to business). </li><li>  Visiting VIP lounge areas. </li></ul><p>  Miles are divided into award and status.  The former provide an opportunity to buy a ticket or upgrade their class.  And status ones allow you to purchase pleasant bonuses for servicing on board an airplane or at the airport. </p><h2>  Tinkoff All Airlines debit card </h2><p>  Tinkoff Bank has a bonus program that gives you the opportunity to earn miles and purchase tickets for them.  It is enough to just make purchases from the card, and then buy tickets at any airline.  Until 2016, Tinkoff issued only credit cards, but after this period debit cards were also added.  Reviews on the Tinkoff All Airlines debit card indicate that miles are credited to the card as follows: </p><ul><li>  30% is transferred to the bonus account if you buy from partners of the bank. </li><li>  If you buy monthly goods worth at least 20 thousand, then you are charged 6% per annum on the balance on the card. </li><li>  1% miles are credited for the purchase of any goods. </li><li>  You will receive 1.5% if your card contains a permanent balance of at least one hundred thousand rubles. </li><li>  When paying for tickets through the Tinkoff.Travel service, you will be credited with 3%. </li><li>  8% is accrued on condition of booking on this service. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the card is quite profitable if you actively use it.  But will not all bonuses eat a monthly payment?  In the company it is 299 rubles per month or 3588 per year.  But reviews of the debit Tinkoff All Airlines indicate that the service becomes free for those customers who have at least 100 thousand rubles in their accounts every month.  This way you can save a pretty decent amount. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="turoperatorov.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff credit card all airlines reviews" class="if uuid-2859942" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2859942.jpg"></div><h2>  Credit card </h2><p>  A Tinkoff All Airlines credit card works on a slightly different basis.  It allows you to spend money with a grace period of 55 days.  According to the reviews of the Tinkoff All Airlines credit card, if you manage to pay off the funds during this time, then no interest will be credited to you, and miles will be credited.  Therefore, this is a fairly profitable acquisition for those who know how to meet deadlines and competently manage their funds.  What are the conditions for using an All Airlines credit card? </p><ul><li>  If you spend more than 300 thousand rubles in the first three months, then 5000 miles will be credited to the bonus account. </li><li>  30% of the amount spent can be refunded to you if you take part in special promotions that you can track in the ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù. </li><li>  1% when paying utility bills and the Internet through the "My Account". </li><li>  5% for the purchase of air and train tickets. </li><li>  2% for any card payments. </li><li>  10% for hotel or car bookings. </li></ul><p>  There are more bonuses accrued for using a credit card than for a debit one.  The cost of annual maintenance is only 1890 rubles per year.  When applying for a credit card, you will be given free travel insurance of a traveler with a coverage of 50 thousand dollars, which will accompany you on all trips.  There is another version of the card from Tinkoff - All Airlines Black Edition.  Reviews position it as a premium segment card that allows you to use funds of up to 2 million.  The maximum reward is limited to 30 thousand miles per month, which allows you to buy much more tickets.  The price includes the Alfred service: a special person will pick up and drive your car for repair, and then deliver it back.  The cost of service is 1490 rubles per month or free of charge if certain conditions are met. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneycrashers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="all airlines tinkoff card reviews" class="if uuid-2859931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2859931.jpg"></div><h2>  S7 Airlines </h2><p>  S7-Tinkoff is another bonus card, but it only works with respect to S7 flights.  The conditions are quite simple: </p><ul><li>  When you purchase on the airline‚Äôs website, you get 3 miles for every 60 rubles. </li><li>  If you pay by card, you will be awarded 1.5 bonus miles for 60 rubles. </li><li>  If you took part in special offers, then you can be awarded up to 18 miles for 60 rubles. </li></ul><p>  The reviews of Tinkoff S7 Airlines show that if you spend about 80 thousand a month on a card and buy S7 tickets in the amount of 60 thousand rubles, the bonus amount will be 27,000 miles.  This gives you the opportunity to buy a round-trip ticket to Yekaterinburg, Sochi or Crimea.  The reviews on the Tinkoff S7 Airlines card also suggest that this card is the most profitable to use for buying tickets in Russia. </p><h2>  How to get the? </h2><p>  If you have already decided on the type of All Airlines bank card, you just have to draw it up and get approval from the bank.  How to apply for Tinkoff All Airlines?  To do this, it is enough to fill out a special form on the Tinkoff company website, in which you need to indicate your full name, email, mobile phone number and desired credit limit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vipgeo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff all airlines black edition reviews" class="if uuid-2859935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2859935.jpg"></div><p>  The feedback on the Tinkoff All Airlines debit card suggests that the bank makes the decision fairly quickly, so you should soon wait for a notification by e-mail or operator‚Äôs call.  You can get All Airlines in several ways: </p><ul><li>  Courier delivery. </li><li>  Russian Post. </li></ul><p>  Both delivery options are free.  After receiving the card, you must activate it on the bank's website and come up with a PIN code.  Do not forget to sign the card on the reverse side, otherwise it will not be considered valid. </p><h2>  What are bonuses awarded for? </h2><p>  People often look for reviews and reviews on the Tinkoff All Airlines card before issuing them.  This allows you to get a real idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe product and its benefits.  What are miles accrued for and what are the most profitable purchases on this card, according to experienced travelers? </p><ul><li>  Flights </li><li>  Shopping in any categories. </li></ul><p>  But the conditions for bonuses are slightly different for debit and credit cards.  If you can pay off the debt on the card during the grace period, it is better to get a Tinkoff All Airlines credit card, as it provides more advantages. </p><h2>  How to earn miles? </h2><p>  How to accumulate miles in order to allow yourself an extra trip in the future?  It's simple: the more you spend, the better.  Indeed, for every 100 rubles spent, 1 to 3 miles is returned to your card.  At the same time, they can be spent without any restrictions at all: for buying tickets of any airlines, as well as for booking hotels and cars.  There are several conditions for earning miles faster: </p><ul><li>  For debit cards, the <span>minimum balance</span> in the account must be at least 100 thousand rubles. </li><li>  For credit cards, the monthly turnover should be above 20 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  The terms of use of the Tinkoff card require the holder to receive additional miles, which are credited with a bonus.  For credit cards, the so-called ‚Äúwelcome miles‚Äù are provided, which give for a turnover of more than 500 thousand on All Airlines credit cards in the first three months of 10 thousand miles.  Of course, just for the sake of receiving this bonus, spending such an amount is not entirely profitable.  But if you already make purchases in large amounts, the Tinkoff card can be a beneficial bonus for your spending.  If you own a debit card, then you will need to spend at least 300 thousand rubles in order to get 5000 bonus miles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff map all airlines review and review" class="if uuid-2859946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2859946.jpg"></div><h2>  Why do not accrue bonuses? </h2><p>  There are a few exceptions to earning bonus miles.  For example, according to the terms of the bank, the following operations are not taken into account: </p><ul><li>  card replenishment; </li><li>  cash withdrawal at an ATM; </li><li>  operations of transfer to an electronic wallet; </li><li>  transfers to the account of brokerage services; </li><li>  payment for housing services; </li><li>  payment for mobile communications. </li></ul><h2>  How to spend them? </h2><p>  Spending bonus miles is much easier than saving up.  But still there are certain nuances that need to be considered when planning a trip: </p><ol><li>  Bonus miles cannot be used to pay partial ticket prices. </li><li>  The minimum amount to be debited is 6000 miles. </li><li>  The write-off is in increments of 3000 miles.  For example, if a ticket costs 16,000, then 18,000 will be deducted from you. Therefore, it is advantageous to purchase tickets worth a multiple of 3: 6 thousand, 18 thousand, 21 thousand, etc. </li><li>  When buying tickets on the Tinkoff.  Traveling ‚Äù, as well as when booking hotels on Booking.com, some of the bonuses are credited to you immediately, and some after 60-80 days. </li><li>  Miles are used only as compensation for the cost of buying airline tickets.  That is, first you will need to spend your own money, which then will be reimbursed by bonuses. </li></ol><h2>  Pros and Cons of a Card </h2><p>  Like any credit card, All Airlines has its pros and cons.  Among the advantages of a credit card, the owners note the following factors: </p><ul><li>  It can be used as a deposit for hotel or car reservation. </li><li>  Free insurance. </li><li>  The ability to combine on one card several accounts for different currencies and, if necessary, switch between them. </li><li>  With timely repayment of the debt, you get the opportunity to spend the bank‚Äôs money absolutely free. </li><li>  If you use a debit card, then you are charged interest on the balance of the card. </li><li>  The reviews of Tinkoff All Airlines also show that it is profitable to pay <span>abroad</span> with this card with a ruble account <span>.</span>  Currency conversion is carried out at the Central Bank rate plus 2% commission. </li><li>  At registration, they will deliver the card directly to your home for free. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="hranidengi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff all airlines review terms" class="if uuid-2859958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2859958.jpg"></div><p>  What negative reviews about Tinkoff All Airlines can be found? </p><ul><li>  Complicated terms of compensation.  The intricate system of accruing miles for many is misleading, so it is better to read all the conditions in advance so as not to be disappointed later. </li><li>  The notification of operations is paid: for it you will have to pay about 60 rubles every month. </li><li>  The annual card service costs 1890 rubles.  For this money you are provided with free insurance, but for many this price still pushes. </li></ul><h2>  Advanced Travel Tips </h2><p>  There are certain rules that allow you to use the Tinkoff All Airlines credit card without harming your wallet.  For this, it is not necessary to have a financial education, just read the advice of experienced travelers: </p><ul><li>  Try to book only ‚Äúprofitable‚Äù tickets, the cost of which will be a multiple of 3. Then the compensation will be maximum.  If you are planning to buy tickets for 13 thousand rubles, then 2 thousand miles you simply "disappear". </li><li>  Never cash out money at ATMs, especially from other banks.  The Tinkoff All Airlines bank card is designed for non-cash transactions, therefore, by withdrawing cash from it, you automatically receive a large commission and exit the grace period.  In fact, it turns out that you take out a loan at huge interest. </li><li>  Timely debt repayment will allow you to use the bank‚Äôs funds for free.  If you nevertheless have a debt that you cannot repay on time, then do not forget to make a minimum payment, otherwise, again, you will be charged high interest. </li><li>  When applying for a credit card, you are automatically assigned insurance.  It can be disabled in the mobile application, and this will save you money.  The cost of the service is 0.89% of the amount of debt per month. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="gateleyplc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff allairlines how to issue" class="if uuid-2859927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2859927.jpg"></div><h2>  How much do you need to save miles to afford a ticket? </h2><p>  Inveterate travelers and just people who like to save money like to search for the best deals for themselves.  A card from Tinkoff All Airlines saves up to 20-30 thousand a year.  Calculating future benefits can be quite easy.  For example, if you spend 100 thousand rubles a month with a debit or credit card, then about 24 thousand miles will be returned to you in a year, which is equivalent to 24 thousand rubles.  If you use this card to purchase airline tickets, you will save even more.  For an average-income family, using All Airlines makes it possible to purchase vacation tickets for free. </p><h2>  The main catch of the bank </h2><p>  Most of the negative reviews about Tinkoff Bank and All Airlines are left by those owners who have a misconception about the mechanism of operation of such cards.  Credit cards were created so that a person could spend small amounts (10-30 thousand rubles) during the grace period, while his own money is in interest-bearing deposits.  In the event that you are unable to pay off the debt on time, such a scheme is unlikely to be beneficial.  According to the terms of the agreement concluded when issuing a Tinkoff All Airlines credit card, if the debt is not repaid within 55 days, the interest rate on it will be 30%.  A regular bank loan goes at 11-16% per annum.  If you overdue the minimum payment, your debt will increase by another 590 rubles, if this is the first delay, and by 1-2% per annum for the subsequent ones.  Together with credit insurance, the interest rate in total can reach 43% per annum.  For this amount, if the minimum payment is not paid, a penalty of the debt amount of 19% per annum is added.  Thus, it turns out that you need to pay not 30, but all 70%!  These are extremely unfavorable conditions that can make you big debtors.  If the cardholder made a purchase in the amount of 20-30 thousand rubles at a time, and then during the year makes 2-3 thousand rubles a month, then after 12 months his debt does not disappear.  That is why, not calculating their strength, people with surprise in a year discover that they owe the bank a round sum. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of Tinkoff All Airlines and the terms of use of the card show that this is a fairly profitable purchase if certain requirements are met.  Some owners say that with its help they were able to purchase tickets for free.  Others are unhappy with the large commission and interest on a credit card.  Who is right?  The Tinkoff All Airlines card should be purchased if your monthly expenses on it amount to at least 50 thousand rubles, you often travel or go on business trips.  As an ordinary credit card, it is much better to get a card from another bank.  Having carefully read the terms of the contract and having weighed all the pros and cons, you will definitely not regret your decision. </p>
