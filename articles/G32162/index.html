    <h2>  Odd </h2><p>  The one who subsequently went down in history under the name of <span>Oleg the Prophet</span> was born presumably in the first half of the 9th century on the territory of modern Denmark.  He was given the name Odd, and later became known as Orvar, which translates as "arrow".  Nothing more is known about his young years.  As for the relationship with Rurik, the researchers agree that they were not tied by blood ties.  However, according to one version, the prince's wife was his sister Efanda, and according to another, Oleg himself was his son-in-law.  Thanks to this, as well as his personal qualities, Odd became a commander and enjoyed the trust and respect of Rurik.  Together with him, he arrived in Ladoga and Priilmenye between 858 and 862. </p><h2>  Board in Novgorod </h2><p>  After the death of Rurik in 879, he left his young son Igor.  The question of guardianship arose.  Oleg became the co-ruler of the young prince until he came of age (he was probably elected), who, according to most researchers, was the boy's uncle.  The new prince was ambitious, and he had far-reaching plans.  In particular, he intended to take control of the land part of the most important trade route from the "Vikings to the Greeks." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Camping trip </h2><p>  Prince Oleg needed a lot of time and effort to bring his grandiose military-political plan to fruition.  In 882, he managed to assemble a large army, consisting not only of a team of Varangians and Novgorod warriors, but also of Krivichi, miracles from Izborsk, Vesy from Beloozero and Meri from Rostov.  Oleg became the head of the army.  In order to give his actions a legitimate character, he took with him Igor, who at that time was barely 5 years old.  The army moved to Kiev on the boats representing Slavic odnoderevki.  They were easy to disassemble and assemble, so such ships could, if necessary, be dragged by drag from one river to another. </p><h2>  Way from the Varangians to the Greeks </h2><p>  The route that Prince Oleg was supposed to take to Kiev was well known to him.  It was part of the trade route "from the Varangians to the Greeks", which the Scandinavian merchants used to get to Constantinople.  Traditionally, their path passed from the Varyazhsk (Baltic) Sea through the Gulf of Finland up the Neva.  Then he walked along Lake Ladoga, from there upward along Volkhov and along <span>Lake Ilmen.</span>  Further, the rooks followed up the Lovati river, and they had to be dragged to the Dnieper.  At the end of the journey, travelers sailed along the Pont Sea and reached Constantinople.  Some Varangian merchants continued on their way, reaching cities on the Mediterranean coast. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Campaign of Prince Oleg to Kiev </h2><p>  The first success of the troops, who marched from Novgorod, was the possession of Smolensk, which at that time was the capital of the Slavic-Krivichi.  The city surrendered without a fight, as there were many of their fellow tribesmen among Oleg's warriors.  Leaving the ‚Äúhusband‚Äù among the people loyal to him to rule in Smolensk, Oleg went further and captured the city of Lubech, which belonged to the northerners tribe.  With this step, the entire Dnieper path was taken under control, that is, one of the main goals was achieved, for which Prince Oleg went on a campaign in Kiev (in which year this happened, you already know). </p><h2>  Askold and Deere </h2><p>  Prince Oleg‚Äôs campaign in Kiev could be delayed if he had not lured the then rulers of the city into a trap.  Askold and Deer were also Vikings from the Rurik squad, but did not belong to the princely family.  Being skilled commanders, they repeatedly made campaigns against neighbors and even "went to Constantinople."  According to the Greek chronicles, both were baptized after returning from the Byzantine campaign. </p>

    <h2>  Trap </h2><p>  In order to avoid a long siege of Kiev, Oleg sent a messenger to the rulers of the city, whom he ordered to say that they were to be met by Varangian merchants, who, together with the young prince of Novgorod, were sailing to Greece.  <span>Askold and Deere,</span> who in every possible way encouraged international trade without suspecting deception, came to the Dnieper without protection.  Meanwhile, Oleg hid almost all of his warriors in an ambush.  As soon as the Kiev rulers approached the rooks, they were surrounded by armed warriors.  Oleg appeared before them, holding Prince Igor in his arms.  Pointing at the child, he said that Askold and Deer own Kiev, not being a princely family, while Igor is the son of Rurik.  Both Varangians were immediately stabbed by Oleg's combatants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Reasons for the murder of Askold and Dir </h2><p>  It is difficult for a modern person to understand Oleg‚Äôs cruelty towards his fellow tribesmen, who were not enemies to him or Rurik.  However, the prince had good reasons to get rid of these rulers.  The fact is that, according to the annals, having arrived with Rurik in their new homeland, these soldiers asked him for permission to go ‚Äúrob‚Äù Constantinople.  However, along the way, their plans changed, and they settled in Kiev.  With the help of their squad, Askold and Dir released the inhabitants of the city from the need to pay tribute to the Khazars and subjugated some Slavic tribes.  All this led to an increase in their authority among the nobility and the common people.  Thus, Askold and Deer became rivals of the Rurik clan and an obstacle to the implementation of Oleg‚Äôs plan to control the main trade route of the time, which promised considerable economic benefits.  In addition, the Kiev rulers shortly before these events adopted Christianity, i.e., in the eyes of the Vikings from the squad of the Novgorod prince, they were people who rejected their gods. </p>

    <h2>  The conquest of Kiev </h2><p>  The warriors of Askold and Dir, as well as the inhabitants of the city, left without leaders and seeing the direct descendant of Rurik, did not show any resistance to the Novgorodians.  They recognized the power of Igor and Oleg, and the latter, upon entering there, proclaimed Kiev the Mother of Russian cities. </p><p>  The bodies of the murdered rulers were buried on a mountain in the vicinity of the capital of the new united state.  Many decades later, on the <span>grave of Askold, which has</span> survived to this day, the church of St.  St. Nicholas, and near the burial site of Dir - the Church of St.  Irina. </p><p>  So ended the campaign of Prince Oleg to Kiev (year 882).  The victory went to the Novgorodians with little blood, and its results had an impact on the history of Eastern Europe for many centuries. </p><h2>  Further reign </h2><p>  The location of Kiev was extremely successful.  The city was not only located on the most important trade route of that time, but also allowed establishing relations with Crimea, Bulgaria and Khazaria.  Oleg transferred the princely ‚Äútable‚Äù there, leaving his posadnik in Novgorod.  Having strengthened the city, he began the construction of fortresses on the lands of Slavic tribes subject to him.  Prince Oleg, whose campaign in Kiev was extremely successful, was collecting tribute with the help of his posadniks.  A significant part of the funds raised went to the maintenance of a squad consisting of Varangians. </p><p>  The new state did not have clear boundaries and was constantly subjected to attacks by warlike peoples, roaming the Wild Field.  In addition, even those Slavic tribes that paid Oleg tribute often attacked each other, and the prince had to act as a judge. </p>

    <h2>  The first successes of the new state </h2><p>  Almost immediately after entering <span>Kiev, Prince</span> Oleg ‚Äúwent to war‚Äù against a tribe of Drevlyans who lived in dense forests on the banks of the Pripyat.  They met the Varangian squad with weapons in their hands.  However, in the battle, the Kievans came out victorious, and their opponents were forced to pay tribute to the black martens and other fur-bearing animals. </p><p>  Oleg took another two years to conquer the lands of the Radimichi and Dnieper northerners living east of the Kiev region.  These tribes paid tribute to the Khazars, against which they could not fight alone.  Oleg proved to be a skilled diplomat.  He invited the Radomites and Northerners to pay him less in return for protection from the Khazars.  So Prince Oleg‚Äôs campaign in Kiev (882) subsequently led to the destruction of the power of a foreign khan over Slavic tribes. </p><p>  In addition, it is known that he managed to let warlike Ugrians through their possessions, forced to leave their homes near the Urals due to constant clashes with the Pechenegs. </p><p>  In subsequent years (up to 906) Oleg was engaged in the defense of the borders of his state.  The grown-up Igor was in no hurry to demand the transfer of power to him, since the authority of the guardian among the nobles and warriors was much higher than that of the young prince. </p><p>  In 906, Oleg went to war in Constantinople and secured his shield on its walls, having concluded several treaties conducive to the development of trade and received a huge one-time tribute.  Oleg died in 912.  According to legend, the cause of his death was the bite of a poisonous snake. </p>

    <h2>  The consequences of the campaign of Prince Oleg to Kiev </h2><p>  The news of the success of the Novgorodians quickly spread around the Slavic tribes and reached Byzantium. </p><p>  The reign of Prince Oleg in Kiev lasted about 24 years.  It was he who laid the core of the Old Russian power, since soon his power was recognized by the tribes of northerners, glades, drevlyans, Krivichi, Ilmen Slovens, Vyatichi, streets, radimichi and Tivertsi.  In the capitals of the principalities subordinate to them, Oleg began to appoint his people, through whom he organized the centralized management of the power he created.  In addition, annual detours of lands that became part of the Old Russian State began to be made, which made it possible to lay the foundation for the judicial and tax systems. </p><p>  Thus, Prince Oleg‚Äôs campaign in Kiev (the date of the troops‚Äôs appearance from Novgorod is unknown) became one of the most important events in the history of our country.  In particular, he secured the primacy for the Rurik clan, which ruled Russia until the beginning of the 17th century (the last representative on the throne - Vasily Shuisky). </p><p>  Now you know when historical events such as Prince Oleg‚Äôs campaign in Kiev and the formation of the Old Russian State took place.  Unfortunately, too little information about this semi-legendary personality has been preserved to this day.  However, most researchers agree that Prophetic Oleg played a crucial role in the history of Russia. </p>
