The lake is one of the main <span>attractions of the Ramensky</span> district of the Moscow region.  Fishermen and outdoor enthusiasts come here.  Many tourists are interested in the question of how to get to Lake Kratowski. </p><h2>  History of the area </h2><p>  The suburban village of Kratovo was founded in 1898.  In those years there were deaf mixed forests that belonged to the Prozorovsky-Golitsyn family.  This area was called Prozorovka by the name of the owners. </p><p>  The Moscow-Kazan Railway Society bought these lands to build cottages for its employees.  It was planned to create a wonderful vacation spot called "Garden City".  Famous architects of that time worked on the project of the holiday village.  In a short period, country houses, a hospital were erected, and the construction of the church began.  Glades were laid in the dense forest. </p><p>  In 1899, the Kratovo platform was opened.  Kratovskoe lake was formed during the construction of the railway.  Sand was mined from the river to form an embankment.  Then the channel was blocked by a dam, and water filled a large area.  So a pond was created, which became an ornament of a country area. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, unfortunately, they failed to fully implement the project of architects to create the Garden City.  The First World War and the 1917 Revolution prevented.  But Kratovo and today remains one of the best suburban towns near Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1937, a children's railway was opened near the lake.  Here, students have the opportunity to try their hand at professions related to transport.  Parents with children come here from the capital and towns near Moscow to get acquainted with this attraction, and then relax on the picturesque shores of the reservoir. </p><h2>  Description of the lake </h2><p>  Strictly speaking, Kratovskoe Lake is a pond.  It formed like a dam on the Khripani River.  It is called a lake because of its large size.  The water surface is 800 meters long and 100 meters wide. </p><p>  In the middle of the lake you can see two islands that arose during the creation of the dam.  On the shores of the pond, a comfortable recreation area with beaches, children's and sports fields, a boat station has been created.  The area around the lake has the status of an <span>ecological park.</span>  Around the pond there is a path made of gravel with lighting.  A photo of Lake Kratov can be seen below. </p>

    <p>  Many beach lovers are interested in whether it is possible to swim here.  This lake is extremely clean.  Water samples are taken every year at the beginning of the summer season.  In 2017, Rospotrebnadzor officially recognized that swimming is allowed in Kratovsky Lake. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Marble Bridge </h2><p>  This snow-white structure adorns the dam on the river.  The bridge was built in 1912-1914 according to the project of the architect Alexander Ivanovich Tamanyan, who participated in the creation of the Garden City. </p><p>  Initially, the bridge was made of reinforced concrete.  Over time, this building wore out.  In 1999, it had to be completely dismantled.  A new marble bridge was created, exactly repeating the original. </p>

    <h2>  Fishing on the lake </h2><p>  The fauna of the reservoir is extremely diverse.  Many species of fish are found here: roach, crucian carp, ruff, tench, perch, carp, bream, pike.  Judging by the reviews, a large catch can be collected on the lake.  This is a great place for amateur fishing. </p><p>  In the Khripan River, near the lake, caddies are found - larvae of the meadow butterfly.  This is a good bait for fish.  You can not stock up on bait in advance, but catch it in the river directly at the place of fishing. </p><h2>  How to get to the lake by car? </h2><p>  How to get to Lake Kratovsky from the capital by car?  From the Moscow ring road you need to turn onto Novoryazanskoye Shosse and go to the left turn onto Zhukovsky.  Next - get to the turn onto the A102 highway and drive another 18 km.  The road from MKAD without traffic jams takes about 30 minutes. </p><h2>  How to get to the lake by rail? </h2><p>  How to get to Lake Kratovsky by public transport?  Buses from Moscow do not go there directly, so it is better to use the railway.  You need to take the electric train at the Kazan station and get to the Kratovo platform.  Then go along Central Street for about 250 meters to the lake.  The journey from Kazan Station takes less than 1 hour. </p>

    <h2>  What else can you see in Kratovo? </h2><p>  If you come to Kratovo with children in the summer, you should definitely visit the children's railway.  Here you can ride on a branded train.  All railway workers are children who study transport professions. </p><p>  It is also worth visiting the church of St. Sergius of Radonezh.  It was opened in 1998 at the initiative of the residents of this summer cottage village.  Before that, there was not a single church in Kratovo, and I had to go to worship in other churches, which were located quite far away.  You can admire the interesting interior painting and interior decoration.  The church is open from 9:00 to 18:00, it is located at: Mira street, building 17. </p><p>  You should also familiarize yourself with the temple of the Sovereign Icon of the Mother of God, which is located at 17 Nizhegorodskaya Street. This is a relatively new church, it was opened in 2002.  The interior of the temple looks harmonious and spacious thanks to arched systems.  The building was created in a simple and concise style.  Next to it, you can see a one-story red brick building.  This is an old church, which began to be erected at the beginning of the 20th century during the creation of a holiday village.  Its construction was not completed due to the outbreak of the First World War.  Now in this building is a church shop. </p><p>  Arriving in Kratovo, you can take a short walk around the village.  There are many historical buildings that have been preserved since the existence of the Garden City project.  On Faustovskaya street is a wooden one-story house.  This is an ancient building of an elementary school, which operated here at the beginning of the 20th century.  On Simbirskaya street there is a house where the construction of the Garden City was previously located.  In Kratovo you can not only relax in nature, but also learn a lot from the history of the Moscow region. </p>
