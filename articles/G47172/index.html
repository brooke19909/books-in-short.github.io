The history of the era dates back to the dawn of the <span>14th century</span> in Italy.  Several centuries can be described as the time of the formation of a new, human and earthly picture of the world, which is essentially secular in nature.

    <p>  It is quite difficult to set a specific time frame for this phenomenon in the history of world culture.  This is explained by the fact that in the Renaissance, all European countries entered at different times.  Some earlier, others later, due to a lag in socio-economic development.  Examples of dates include the beginning of the 14th and the end of the 16th century.  The years of the Renaissance are characterized by the manifestation of the secular nature of culture, its humanization, the flowering of interest in antiquity.  By the way, the name of this period is connected with the latter.  The revival of <span>ancient culture,</span> its introduction into the European world. </p><h2>  General characteristics of the Renaissance </h2><p>  This round in the development of human culture has occurred as a result of changes in European society and relations in it.  An important role is played by the fall of Byzantium, when its citizens massively fled to Europe, bringing with them libraries, <span>works of art,</span> various ancient sources, previously unknown.  The increase in the number of cities led to an increase in the influence of simple classes of artisans, merchants, and bankers.  Various centers of art and science began to appear actively, the activities of which the church no longer controlled. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first years of the Renaissance are usually counted from its offensive in Italy, it was in this country that this movement began.  Its initial signs became noticeable in the 13-14 centuries, but it took a firm position in the 15 century (20 years), reaching its maximum prosperity by the end of it.  In the Renaissance (or Renaissance), four periods are distinguished.  Let us dwell on them in more detail. </p><h2>  Proto-renaissance </h2><p>  This period dates from approximately the second half of the 13-14th century.  It is worth noting that all dates relate to Italy.  In fact, this period represents the preparatory stage of the Renaissance.  It is conventionally divided into two stages: before and after death (1137) Giotto di Bondone (sculpture in the photo), a key figure in the history of Western art, architect and artist. </p>

    <p>  The last years of the Renaissance of this period are associated with the plague epidemic, which hit Italy and Europe as a whole.  Proto-Renaissance is closely connected with the Middle Ages, Gothic, Romanesque, Byzantine traditions.  The central figure is considered to be Giotto, who outlined the main trends of painting, indicated the path along which its development later went. </p><h2>  Early Renaissance </h2><p>  By the time he took eighty years.  The early <span>period of the Renaissance, the</span> years of which are characterized in two ways, fell on 1420-1500.  Art has not yet completely abandoned medieval traditions, but it is actively adding elements borrowed from classical antiquity.  As if growing, year after year under the influence of changing conditions of the social environment, artists are completely abandoning the old and moving to ancient art as the main concept. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The ancestor of the <span>early Renaissance</span> is considered to be the painter Masaccio, who was originally from Florence.  Grabbing the ideas of his predecessors, he brought into his work the almost tangible sculpturality of figures on canvas. </p><h2>  High Renaissance </h2>

    <p>  This is the peak, the peak of the Renaissance.  At this stage, the Renaissance (years 1500-1527) reached its zenith, and the center of influence of all Italian art moved to Rome from Florence.  This happened in connection with the accession to the papal throne, Julius II, who had very progressive, bold views, was an enterprising and ambitious person.  He attracted the best artists and sculptors from all over Italy to the eternal city.  It was at this time that the true Renaissance titans create their masterpieces, which the whole world admires to this day. </p><h2>  Late revival </h2><p>  Covers the time period from 1530 to 1590-1620.  The development of culture and art in this period is so heterogeneous and diverse that even historians do not reduce it to one denominator.  According to British scholars, the Renaissance finally died out at the time when the fall of Rome, namely in 1527, occurred.  <span>Southern Europe</span> plunged into the Counter-Reformation, which put an ‚Äúend‚Äù to all free thought, including the resurrection of ancient traditions. </p><p>  The crisis of ideas and contradictions in worldview as a result in Florence resulted in mannerism.  A style that is characterized by disharmony and far-fetchedness, the loss of balance between the spiritual and bodily component, characteristic of the Renaissance.  For example, Venice had its own development road, with masters such as Titian and Palladio working there until the end of the 1570s.  Their work remained aloof from the crisis phenomena characteristic of the art of Rome and Florence.  Pictured is the painting of Titian "Isabella of Portugal". </p>

    <h2>  Great masters of the Renaissance </h2><p>  Three great Italians are Renaissance titans, its worthy crown: </p><ol><li>  Leonardo da Vinci.  The personality in the history of mankind is truly brilliant and unique.  He was not only a great artist and sculptor, but also a scientist, naturalist, inventor, writer and architect.  Contemporaries, to a greater extent, he is known for his few paintings, including the legendary Mona Lisa Gioconda (in the second photo), over the mystery of which scientists have been struggling for more than a century. </li><li>  Michelangelo Buonarroti.  Years of life and work - 1475-1564.  First of all, he is known as a sculptor and artist.  Moreover, its first facet is expressed much more and is reflected even in the paintings.  His main work was carried out in Rome and Florence.  The genius of Michelangelo was fully manifested in the painting of the Sistine Chapel, which became a reflection of the biblical story, and it depicts 300 figures, none of which are similar to the other. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Renaissance or rebirth: history of an era." class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/723143.jpg" width="600"></div>  As well as the fresco ‚ÄúThe Last Judgment‚Äù, the ensemble of the Capitol Square, the dome of the Vatican Cathedral, the statue of David, the composition ‚ÄúPieta‚Äù (photo above) and much more. </li><li>  Rafael Santi.  Another phenomenal personality of the Renaissance.  His teacher was the father of P. Perugino, an outstanding master.  It was his style that can be clearly seen in the works of the early period.  The most perfect of his work is considered to be the <span>Sistine Madonna</span> (pictured). </li></ol>
