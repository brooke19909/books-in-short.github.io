This is the season of matinees and carnivals, fun and exciting preparation.  And the choice of costumes for children's Christmas masquerade is one of the most interesting activities.  And if earlier the kids dreamed of becoming cartoon characters, and bear cubs, squirrels, hares, foxes and wolves danced under the Christmas tree on the matinee, today the characters have changed.  The costume of Maleficent, Batman, Spider-Man or Captain Hook was replaced by the beasts.  But, as you know, modernity is the main coordinator of fashion, even in relation to New Year's outfits.  Naturally, it is much more difficult to complete such a suit than a bunny or a snowflake.  But if you apply maximum zeal, then an original outfit will come out, from which children's eyes will shine with delight.  And for the sake of it it is worth trying! </p>

    <p>  Below we will talk about how to sew a costume of Maleficent with your own hands.  The methods of making a headdress, the construction of a dress pattern, the stages of dress decoration and tips for choosing a material will be considered.  And let them not be afraid of complexity, the costume of Maleficent will surely turn out to be stunning, the main thing is to believe in your own strength and listen to the advice. </p><h2>  Image in detail </h2><p>  To make it easier to create an outfit, the whole image should be divided into parts: a hat, a cloak, a dress and small accessories.  It is not necessary to detail the costume of Maleficent too much, enough of the basic elements to create the desired image. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, the headdress should be with two horns, the cloak must be with a stand-up collar, low on the neck and with beautiful angles at the face, and the dress can be either short or long - this is how the child wants.  The heroine of this fairy tale has a beautiful leather necklace (if you can call it that) on her neck, a staff in her hand with a magic blue ball on the end.  But here it is necessary to decide whether it is worth doing it at all, because at the matinee the child will dance, dance and participate in contests, and the extra element in his hand will only interfere.  Unless to make it exclusively for more effective photos.  But such a detail of the image as wings will make the costume chic, but it‚Äôs easier to buy than to make it yourself. </p><h2>  The choice of materials for a hat </h2><p>  What kind of costume is Maleficent without the charming horns on her head inherent in this image?  But what to make this accessory from?  The two easiest options: make a hat with horns or stick these wonderful elements on the hair band.  In both cases, the following materials will be needed: </p><ul><li>  main fabric; </li><li>  stabilizer for the form (it can be hard tulle, padding polyester or collar adhesive fabric); </li><li>  bezel or <span>pattern of a hat</span> ; </li><li>  hot glue gun and silicone to it. </li></ul><p>  Making a Maleficent‚Äôs costume with your own hands is not so difficult as it might seem, the main thing is to turn on your imagination and apply a little zeal! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY costume maleficent" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1053795.jpg" width="500"></div>

It will be enough 15 cm in height, 25-30 cm can be taken from the base. So, to make a template, draw a rectangle with the corresponding sides on a sheet of paper.  After this, you should simulate a little and deduce on the drawing the shape of a horn bent to the center of the head, wide at the base and narrow at the end. </p><p>  After this pattern is transferred to a fabric glued with a sealant or with a sweeping hard tulle.  There is no need to rush to cut the part.  It is best to fold the material in half on the inside, outline the borders of the template with chalk or pencil, pin along the perimeter with needles and lay the machine line along the contour. </p><p>  After this, the part can be cut out, departing from the seam 0.5-0.7 cm. In places of bends, notches should be made in several places so that the allowances do not pull the product after turning. </p><p>  Next, the horns should be stuffed with synthetic winterizer, although this is not necessary, because the stabilized fabric will keep its shape well. </p>

    <p>  At the next stage, it is necessary to close the bottom of the finished horn, turned upside down.  To do this, from a previously duplicated main fabric or felt, a circle should be cut out and glued to the open bottom of the product.  After that, the details will remain fixed on the rim. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Horns on a hat </h2><p>  Maleficent costume for girls is best done with a rim, because a child will definitely want a beautiful hairstyle with curls.  However, horns look no less interesting on a hat.  To make it, you will need two measurements: the girth of the head and the measurement from the neck under the chin to the back of the head through the crown. </p><p>  The drawing should be a rectangle with sides ¬Ω of the first measure and ¬Ω of the second measure.  In the upper left corner on the vertical side, which will subsequently be a hole for the face, you need to go down 1.5 cm and from this point make a smooth rounding so that the cap fits well on the child's forehead.  Also, such manipulations should be performed in the occipital region, starting from the top of the head and ending with the base at the neck. </p><p>  After the pattern is ready, two parts from the <span>main fabric</span> are cut out on it <span>,</span> sewn along the middle seam and the open cut of the cap is processed.  After an <span>oblique inlay</span> cut from the same material or purchased, the lower cut is processed, leaving a sufficient length for the ties of the ribbons.  The final stage is the attachment of the horns.  They can be planted on hot glue or sewn by hand. </p>

    <h2>  The choice of material for basic clothing </h2><p>  How to make a costume of Maleficent with your own hands so that it is not so gloomy as the image of the heroine of this fairy tale?  Of course, beating more and more rainbow colors.  No, we are not talking about a colorful and bright solution, such as pink or yellow!  But deep blue, turquoise, emerald, rich burgundy - this is what you need!  Velvet or velor with its tints and elegance will look especially chic.  In addition, it is a knitted soft fabric, pleasant to the body, in which the child will be comfortable. </p><h2>  How to sew a dress </h2><p>  Sewing Maleficent's costume with your own hands, broken into elements, is very simple.  For example, making a dress does not take much time. </p><p>  To build a dress template, it will be enough to take the child‚Äôs t-shirt, put it directly on the fabric, circle it along the contour, after measure the length of the dress and expand the drawing to the desired width along the side sections.  Sleeves are cut out by the same principle.  They can also be extended downward or made tails. </p><p>  It is possible to assemble all the parts into a single unit on a typewriter without using an overlock or zigzag, as the knitwear does not crumble.  First, the shoulder sutures are sutured and the throat is treated with an oblique inlay, then the sleeves are stitched and taken for the side seams.  The final stage is the processing of open sections, which can be twisted, stitched or processed with an oblique inlay. </p><h2>  How to sew a skirt </h2><p>  Maleficent's costume for children will look great with a fluffy tutu skirt or tutu skirt.  To make such products, you need tulle.  And here you need to consider your own skills, as tailoring a skirt with many frills requires at least minimal experience.  But a tutu skirt can be made completely without the use of <span>sewing accessories.</span>  Here you will need elastic, a couple of meters of tulle and scissors. </p><p>  The fabric should be cut into parts equal to the double length of the product + 2 cm, and after cutting the workpieces across the strips 10 cm wide. The elastic should be taken along the waist of the child, preferably at least 1.5 cm wide. It should be tight and maintain their properties even after strong stretching.  After you need to impose strips of tulle on it, fixing it with a loop. </p><p>  Such a skirt will look good with any t-shirt worn under a cloak of a suit. </p><h2>  The choice of fabric for the cloak </h2><p>  A raincoat is an integral element of the image and deserves special attention.  How to make Maleficent's costume more spectacular?  Of course, choose a chic fabric for a cloak! </p><p>  Black brocade would be an ideal option, but if the budget is limited, then you can stay on a regular <span>lining fabric,</span> which also shines and shimmers well.  You can also consider options with raincoat fabric that fits well in a suit. </p><p>  Maleficent, whose photo will become a fulcrum in creating the image, has a rather voluminous wardrobe, the bulk of which are clothing from leather.  Her cloak is also sewn of heavy fabric with inserts made of genuine leather.  But for the carnival, you can deviate slightly from the image and use finer materials, such as mesh or silk, to make this element. </p>

    <h2>  Cloak with a collar </h2><p>  The manufacture of this product does not require any special patterns.  It will take only one measure: the girth of the child‚Äôs neck.  5 cm should be added to it, and you can begin to work.  First, a rectangle equal to the length and width of the cloak along the bottom should be cut from the fabric.  After you can start cutting the collar. </p><p>  Here it will be necessary to dream up a bit, depicting the original style of the gate inherent in the image in protruding long corners.  To do this, on a piece of paper you need to put aside half of the taken measurement, draw a slightly understated back of the collar (about 3-4 cm high), rising to the corners by 8-10 cm.You can draw one such protrusion or two, one after the other, on the corner. </p><p>  Then again, you will need to use hard tulle (for the durability of the product).  The fabric is laid with tulle and folded in half so that the template with a spread fits.  The pattern is circled so that it is in full size, after a line is laid along the contour, leaving the bottom cut open.  Next, the details are cut with an allowance of 0.5-0.7 cm, notches are made in the corners, they are turned out and steamed with an iron. </p><p>  After that, it remains only to connect the cloak with the collar, having previously processed the edges of the canvas.  So that the threads do not crumble, they can be scorched over a candle, tucked and stitched or overlaid with an overlock.  It all depends on the selected material. </p><h2>  Jewelry </h2><p>  Maleficent's Halloween costume or New Year's holiday is the best solution for a spectacular appearance in public.  Decorating it with rain or making a pendant with a pumpkin out of foil, you can stylize an outfit for a specific event.  The image will be complemented by bracelets and a black ribbon on the neck.  For more chic, a dress or t-shirt can be embroidered with stones and sequins. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a costume maleficent do-it-yourself" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26186/1055165.jpg" width="368"></div></h2><h2>  How to make a staff </h2><p>  The magic staff can also be attributed to an important detail of the image.  You can do it using a regular stick or a plastic pipe of small diameter.  To make it you will need a wide satin ribbon, a hot glue gun, a beautiful fabric for the ball and a synthetic winterizer for filling it. </p><p>  First, make the top of the staff.  To do this, cut a circle from the material, collect it around the perimeter on a thread, fill it with a synthetic winterizer and tighten the thread.  After gluing this element to a pipe or stick. </p><p>  Next up is the winding.  It starts at the top, hiding the junction of the base and the ball.  The tape should be fixed with hot glue every 5 cm so that there are no gaps.  At the very bottom, having melted the edge, it is thoroughly fixed. </p>
