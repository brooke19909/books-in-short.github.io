  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Applied Sociology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Applied sociology, along with theoretical, refers to a single sociological knowledge.  However, there is a significant difference between the first and second concepts.  So, in contrast to the part of science that studies and theoretically reflects the fundamental characteristics and laws of social development, applied sociology, with its system of categories and research tools, is focused on solving and developing practical problems in public management ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù. </p><p>  If it is impossible to solve one or another issue, based on existing knowledge, there is a need for a scientific search for additional information, conducting empirical (experimental, practical) research. </p><p>  Applied sociology is a kind of ‚Äúsocial engineering‚Äù.  It helps to correct and make sense of everyday social life.  This leads to the presence of both theoretical and empirical instrumental technologies for studying mass human behavior in various <span>spheres of public life.</span>  In addition, applied sociology includes both methods and methods of practical influence on the behavior of public institutions and groups. </p><p>  <span>An empirical study is</span> usually diagnostic in nature and attached to a specific object.  In other words, applied sociology involves the implementation of practical studies "on order."  Subsequently, his results and conclusions are applied to the practical solution of a social issue. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The results obtained in the process of experimental public research are applied in technologies included in the structure of applied science (sociology).  It should be noted that in the traditional sociological study, the tools and the program are created again each time.  <span>Social technologies</span> make it possible to repeatedly apply algorithms in proven standards in resolving issues related to public administration in various fields. </p><p>  The analysis of different views on the essence of the above technology allows us to define it as a system of methods for identifying and applying hidden potentials in a social system, corresponding to the goals of its development and, as a set of procedures and operations, impact on the way to achieve the optimal result. </p><p>  The fundamentals of applied sociology in the applied technology in its actual functioning are represented by three components: </p><p>  - a specially organized area of ‚Äã‚Äãapplied public knowledge about procedures and methods for optimizing human life, taking into account the growing dynamics and interdependence of social processes; </p><p>  - the effective implementation of activities on the basis of its rational division into operations and procedures with their subsequent synchronization and coordination, as well as the selection of optimal methods and means of their implementation; </p><p>  - management of public processes, providing a system for their reproduction and increasing efficiency in specific parameters (quality, integrity, volume, productivity, etc.), allowing to achieve the goal. </p><p>  Thus, the applied character is acquired by sociology, represented by the unity of industry and special methods and theories, procedures and techniques of empirical study, the results of which are used in technology.  In this case, the integrity of the theoretical and practical component of the structure of the above described part of science is embodied. </p><p>  Applied sociology allows you to determine the features and scope of an experimental study, to develop its technique, methodology, program, as well as formulate hypotheses during the study. </p>
