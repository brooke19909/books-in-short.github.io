    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bridge resort sochi nutrition reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23426/966742.jpg" width="600"></div>  Comfortable accommodation at any time of the year is provided by the Bridge Resort hotel complex (Sochi).  The reviews about the rooms speak for themselves.  Vacationers claim that it is difficult to find dirt and dust in the apartments.  The rooms are cleaned very carefully.  The only minus is the price.  The cost of the cheapest room is about 4000 rubles per day.  For comfortable apartments with all amenities you will have to pay more than 9,000 rubles.
