The name of this <span>great commander</span> has long been a household name, not only because of his talent and intelligence, but also thanks to the incredible ambitions, as well as the dizzying career that he managed to make. </p><p>  The biography of Napoleon Bonaparte is marked by the rapid rise of his military career.  Having entered the service at the age of 16, he became a general at the age of 24.  And at the age of 34 Napoleon Bonaparte became emperor.  Interesting facts from the biography of the French commander are numerous.  Among his skills and characteristics were also very unusual.  They say that he read with incredible speed - about 2 thousand words per minute.  In addition, the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte could sleep for a long time 2-3 hours a day.  Interesting facts from the biography of this man, we hope, aroused your interest in his personality. </p><h2>  Events in Corsica, preceding the birth of Napoleon </h2><p>  Napoleon Bonaparte, the French emperor, was born on August 15, 1769. He was born on the island of Corsica, in the city of Ajaccio.  The biography of Napoleon Bonaparte would probably have been different if the political situation of that time was different.  His native island was for a long time in the possession of the Republic of Genoa, but Corsica in 1755 overthrew the rule of Genoa.  After this, for several years she was an independent state ruled by Pasquale Paole, a local landowner.  Carlo Buonaparte (his portrait is presented below), Napoleon's father, served as his secretary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  <span>The Republic of Genoa</span> in 1768 sold the rights to Corsica to France.  And a year later, after the local rebels were defeated by French troops, Pasquale Paole moved to England.  Napoleon himself was not a direct participant in these events and even their witness, since he was born only after 3 months.  Nevertheless, the identity of Paole played a big role in shaping his character.  For a long 20 years this man became the idol of such a French commander as Napoleon Bonaparte.  Bonaparte's biography for children and adults, presented in this article, continues with a story about his origin. </p><h2>  Origin of Napoleon </h2>

    <p>  Laetitia Ramalino and Carlo Buonaparte, the parents of the future emperor, were small nobles.  The family had 13 children, of which Napoleon was the second oldest.  True, even in childhood, five of his sisters and brothers died. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The father of the family was one of the most ardent supporters of the independence of Corsica.  He participated in the drafting of the Corsican Constitution.  But so that his children could get an education, he began to show loyalty to the French.  After some time, Carlo Buonaparte even became a representative of the Corsica nobility in the French parliament. </p><h2>  Training in Ajaccio </h2><p>  It is known that Napoleon, as well as his sisters and brothers, received primary education in the city school of Ajaccio.  After this, the future emperor began to study mathematics and writing at the local abbot.  Carlo Buonaparte as a result of interaction with the French managed to get royal scholarships for Napoleon and Joseph, his older brother.  Joseph had to make a career as a priest, and Napoleon - to become a soldier. </p><h2>  Cadet School </h2>

    <p>  The biography of Napoleon Bonaparte continues already in Autun.  It was here that the brothers left in 1778 to study the French language.  Napoleon entered the cadet school in Brienne a year later.  He studied excellently, showed a special talent in mathematics.  In addition, Napoleon liked to read books on various topics - philosophy, history, geography.  Favorite historical characters of the future emperor were Julius Caesar and Alexander of Macedon.  However, at this time Napoleon had few friends.  Both Corsican origin and emphasis played a role in this (Napoleon never managed to get rid of him), as well as a penchant for loneliness and a complex character. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Father's death </h2><p>  He later continued his studies at the Royal Cadet School.  Napoleon finished it ahead of schedule in 1785. Then his father died, and he had to take his place as head of the family.  The elder brother did not fit this role, since he did not differ in leadership inclinations, like Napoleon. </p><h2>  Military career </h2>

The biography, a brief summary of which is the topic of this article, continues in this city, located in the center of the Rhone Lowland.  Here Napoleon served as a lieutenant.

    <p>  The French Directory was unable to preserve the achievements that the revolution brought.  This became apparent in 1799.  Napoleon with his army was at that time in Egypt.  After returning, he dispersed the Directory thanks to the support of the people.  On November 19, 1799, Bonaparte proclaimed the regime of consulate, and after 5 years, in 1804, declared himself emperor. </p><h2>  Napoleon's domestic policy </h2><p>  Napoleon Bonaparte, whose biography by this time has already been marked by many achievements, in his <span>domestic policy</span> decided to focus on strengthening his own power, which was to serve as a guarantee of the civil rights of the French population.  In 1804, the Code of Napoleon, a code of civil rights, was adopted for this purpose.  In addition, a tax reform was carried out and a state-owned French bank was established.  The French education system was created precisely under Napoleon.  Catholicism was recognized as the religion of the majority of the population, but freedom of religion was not abolished. </p><h2>  The economic blockade of England </h2><p>  England was the main opponent of France's industry and capital in the European market.  This country funded military operations against it on the continent.  England attracted major European powers such as Austria and Russia.  Thanks to a series of French military operations against Russia, Austria and Prussia, Napoleon was able to annex to his country the lands previously owned by Holland, Belgium, Italy and Northern Germany.  The defeated countries had no choice but to make peace with France.  Napoleon declared an economic blockade of England.  He has banned trade relations with this country.  However, this measure also hit the French economy.  France could not replace English products on the European market.  It was not able to foresee Napoleon Bonaparte.  A short biography in abbreviation should not dwell on this in detail, so we continue our story. </p><h2>  Decline in authority, birth of an heir </h2><p>  The economic crisis and protracted wars led to a decline in the prestige of Napoleon Bonaparte among the French, who had previously supported him.  In addition, it turned out that no one was threatening France, and Bonaparte's ambitions were due only to concern for the state of his dynasty.  In order to leave the heir, he divorced Josephine, because she could not give him a child.  In 1810, Napoleon married Maria Louise, daughter of the emperor of Austria.  In 1811, the long-awaited heir was born.  However, the public did not approve of marriage to a woman from the Austrian royal family. </p><h2>  The war with Russia and the link to the Elbe </h2>

    <p>  In 1812, Napoleon Bonaparte decided to start a war with Russia, a short biography of which, in many respects, is of interest to many of our compatriots.  Like other states, Russia at one time supported the blockade of England, but did not seek to abide by it.  This step was fatal for Napoleon.  Having suffered defeat, he abdicated.  The former French emperor was sent to the island of Elba, located in the Mediterranean Sea. </p><h2>  The revenge of Napoleon and the final defeat </h2><p>  After Bonaparte's abdication, representatives of the Bourbon dynasty returned, as well as their heirs, who sought to regain their position and fortune.  This caused discontent among the population.  Napoleon February 25, 1815 fled from the Elbe.  He triumphantly returned to France.  In one article, only a very brief biography of Napoleon Bonaparte can be presented.  Therefore, we only say that he resumed the war, but France could no longer bear this burden.  Napoleon was finally defeated at Waterloo, after 100 days of revenge.  This time he was exiled to St. Helena, which is much further than before, so it was more difficult to escape from it.  Here, the former emperor spent the last 6 years of his life.  He had never seen his wife and son again. </p><h2>  The death of the former emperor </h2><p>  Bonaparte's health condition began to deteriorate rapidly.  He died on May 5, 1821, presumably from cancer.  According to another version, Napoleon was poisoned.  It is very popular opinion that the former emperor was given arsenic.  However, have they been poisoned?  The fact is that Napoleon was afraid of this and voluntarily took small doses of arsenic, thus trying to develop immunity to it.  Of course, such a procedure would certainly end tragically.  Be that as it may, today it is impossible to say with complete certainty why Napoleon Bonaparte died.  A brief biography of him, presented in this article, ends here. </p>

    <p>  It must be added that he was first buried on the island of St. Helena, but in 1840 his remains were reburied in Paris, in the House of the Disabled.  The monument on the grave of the former emperor is made of Karelian porphyry, which was presented to the French government by Nicholas I, the Russian emperor. </p>
