    <p>  Most scholars are convinced that Charles Darwin was right in his conclusion about the <span>origin of man.</span>  This is confirmed by the results of many years of archaeological research, excavations and finds, which prove that the primitive <span>cave man</span> really existed and gradually evolved. </p><p>  This can be seen with the naked eye, looking at the fruits of "cave art", the earliest "works" of which are very primitive and somewhere even sketchy.  This indicates that even primitive people were not alien to the sense of beauty, even if they depicted images of animals, whether it was cave paintings or figures carved from bone.  This should not be surprising, because primitive people attached great importance to animals, since it was they who provided him with food, skins for clothes and the same bones that were used not only as material for cutting figures, but also as a tool. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the animals were depicted in completely different ways: it could be actually contour drawings, and quite bright, colorful and detailed, which very reliably demonstrated the appearance of the beast in all its details, and its nuances in habits and behavior.  According to scientists, this <span>art of primitive</span> man is associated not so much with his artistic talents as with the special purpose of each drawing.  For example, sketchy images could well have been created for some magical purpose, such as a ritual that ensures a successful hunt, or forcing a conceived animal to come closer to the place where people live.  More colorful and detailed drawings were supposedly created in order to emphasize a certain mystical connection between the animal and <span>man: it</span> was a kind of tribute to the portrayed creature. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, not only the animals the primitive man paid his attention.  It is proved that women were also honored to be depicted on a rock or carved from bone and stone.  To be more precise, these were not so much women as their images, which had a cult character.  The most ancient figurines of this kind are 40-45 thousand years old.  There are more ancient finds that are more than 70 thousand years old, but in this case, experts are not sure that these are really the fruits of the creativity of <span>ancient people.</span>  It is possible that these are just bizarre formations of natural origin.  But be that as it may, the figures found, called by scientists "Paleolithic Venus", have very distinct female forms.  Most likely, the reason for their creation was the first nascent concept of the Mother Goddess, fertile and giving life. </p><p>  However, in ancient art such a genre as landscape is practically absent.  But this does not mean at all that the primitive man had no idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reality surrounding him.  It had, but in the images it was symbolic and even abstract.  This is evidenced by all kinds of <span>geometric shapes,</span> combinations of dots, wavy lines, spirals, zigzags and other symbols.  Probably some of them carried a certain meaning or possessed a magical meaning, which increased with the advent of ceramics.  As for the latter, it can be attributed to a completely separate <span>type of art,</span> for primitive people liked to cover ceramic products with various ornaments.  According to experts, they quite clearly created the image of the world, divided into three parts: the first - the lower underground;  the second is medium, earthly;  the third is the upper, heavenly, airy, supernatural.  In addition, all these symbols and ornaments pointed to the phenomena occurring in the world: the movement of the moon and the sun, the course of rivers, stars, plants and much more. </p>
