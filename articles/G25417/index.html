  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY crafts for beginners: ideas, photos, workshop</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many interesting and original plastic crafts are made by craftsmen for decorating the interior of rooms and garden plots.  The material is easy to operate and inexpensive.  You can create crafts from both junk material and new, depending on what the work is done for. </p><p>  Plastic cups and used bottles, spoons and forks of different colors are used, and which functional items are made of pipes made of PVC plastic.  Crafts are simple, which children can make, and quite complex, which only experienced craftsmen can do. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider several finished products from different plastic, how to work with it, what wonderful and useful things you can create.  We will give detailed instructions for the manufacture of each element, submit photographs of the finished product.  So, how to make plastic crafts? </p><h2>  Designer christmas tree </h2><p>  In order to create such an apartment decoration for a holiday, you need to purchase several PVC pipes of different diameters.  They must be cut into thin cylinders of equal length.  For cutting plastic use a specially designed tool - scissors for cutting pipes, cordless pipe cutter, there is still a roller type pipe cutter.  If you are doing such plastic crafts for the first time and do not have these devices in the cabinet, then do not be discouraged, because you can always use a hacksaw for metal. </p><p>  The only drawback of such an instrument is that it leaves burrs on the plastic.  But this does not matter, it is enough to process the edges with emery paper or to clean with a knife.  For the trunk of a Christmas tree, you need to leave a piece of 30-40 cm from the pipe of the largest diameter, depending on the size of the plastic crafts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="inhabitat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="PVC pipe Christmas tree" class="if uuid-2290131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2290131.jpg"></div><p>  Then you need to prepare the base for the wall panel.  It can be a shield made of plywood or fiberboard, you can buy color.  Further on the floor are all the pipe sections - from the smallest to the largest - so that a triangular shape is obtained.  It is more convenient to first lay out large elements, and already between them fill the voids with small details. </p><p>  To attach the elements to the base, the durable moment "Plastic Momentum" is used.  It is transparent, so visually the decor item will not spoil. </p><h2>  How to decorate an original Christmas tree? </h2><p>  After completing the main part of the work on the manufacture of New Year's crafts made of plastic, begin to fill each cylinder.  As for an ordinary Christmas tree for the New Year, Christmas decorations are also used for the designer.  A star of any color is attached to the top.  Further decorative elements are distributed depending on the size of the cylinder. </p><p>  You can make many homemade toys with your child and place them nicely in round voids.  Angels and balls look beautiful.  If the child wants to put toys there, then do not scold him, because this is his holiday.  To decide how to decorate plastic crafts with your own hands, you need together, the whole family.  This brings the family members together, and the creative process of doing such work captivates both young and old alike. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Convenient stand for needlework </h2><p>  If you are seriously interested in making crafts from ribbons, for example, working on making bows, gift wraps or, for example, decorating glasses and bottles for a wedding, then this convenient stand will help you to avoid chaos on your desktop.  All bays with ribbons are placed on a PVC plastic pipe, access to them is free, the ribbon is pulled out without any effort, you can immediately see where what color is placed. </p><p>  Pieces of tapes are cut without removing the roll from the stand.  If you need to add tapes of other colors for work, then the replacement is done simply by pulling a piece of pipe from the corner.  When a new roll is put on, the plastic tube is simply inserted back into place. </p><p>  This stand looks very neat, it can always be washed with detergent.  If one of the elements is damaged, you don‚Äôt have to throw out the plastic crafts with your own hands, it will be enough to replace one element by cutting the pipe to the desired size. </p><div class="photo" data-original="br.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Needlework stand" class="if uuid-2290133" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2290133.jpg"></div><p>  To make a frame from plastic pipes, you need to buy the material itself and an additional 8 corners with three inlets located at an angle of 90 ¬∞.  4 identical pieces, 50-60 cm in size, are cut using a hacksaw or a pipe cutter. They will be located in the length of the craft above and below.  Then a pipe is cut for the sides.  The length of each is also the same and is approximately 25-30 cm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It remains only to insert the pipes into the holes of the corners and assemble the craft from plastic.  The photo clearly shows what such a stand is.  The finished product is light, clean, not ashamed to place it on the desktop.  If you want to add additional details to the stand, for example, a cup for scissors or a pillow for needles, then they can be hung on an elastic band or on a plastic hook.  It is mounted on double-sided tape. </p><h2>  Tabletop Christmas tree made of plastic forks </h2><p>  Since we touched on New Year's topics in the article and considered how to make a wall panel in the form of a Christmas tree from PVC plastic pipes, now let's make a do-it-yourself plastic craft for beginners.  After all, this is a tree made of disposable forks.  It is small in size and can be installed on a New Year's table or on a shelf in a room.  Also, such a Christmas tree can be made for the school New Year's exhibition. </p><p>  As a basis, you can use a foam cone or a dense piece of foam, cutting out a similar shape from it.  To design the top, prepare a package of ear buds, which are placed in the form of rays of the sun, in a circle.  In order to keep them firmly in this position, you must first cut the cotton from one end.  Plastic sticks are placed on a piece of plastic, cut out in the shape of an asterisk, and attached with Moment Plastic glue, or use a glue gun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas tree made of forks" class="if uuid-2290197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2290197.jpg"></div><p>  A longer stick is glued from the bottom of the top, which will hold the entire structure.  Then at the junction of all the details (in the center), another star is attached.  The top is ready, work begins on the do-it-yourself plastic craft with your own hands (photo is available above). </p><p>  To create such a prickly beauty you will need 30-40 forks, depending on the height and width of the cone.  Each fork is trimmed at the base.  Leave a small, even segment 1-1.5 cm long. Glue will be applied to it.  Begin gluing the cone from below, moving around the circle.  Each next row is shifted by half a disposable fork, so that the "branches" of the Christmas tree did not look like rows, but were "fluffy" from all sides. </p><p>  The top is inserted into the top of the cone with a simple indentation, you can put a little more glue on the stick so that the top of the tree does not fall off when carrying the crafts, for example, to school.  You can search for sale green forks during the preparation of materials for plastic crafts (photo above).  After creating a bright and original masterpiece from plastic forks, you can cover them with a layer of glue and sprinkle with sparkles or tinsel cut into small pieces. </p><h2>  Snowman made of plastic glasses </h2><p>  Thin plastic for crafts allows you to create work without glue.  For example, from a plastic disposable cups you can collect such a wonderful snowman for the New Year holidays.  This product is able to decorate not only the home environment, but also applicable in child care facilities, offices and other organizations. </p><p>  The inside of the snowman made of plastic glasses is empty, so often there are bulbs or multi-colored garland lights.  After turning on such lighting, the room will instantly transform, and during a dance party such a snowman will play the role of a lighting effect. </p><p>  Do-it-yourself plastic craft (photo below in the article) consists of two main elements.  This is the body of the character and his head.  They are performed in the form of a torus, that is, they are not completely spherical, but with flat parts from below and above.  This is done so that there is a good adhesion of the elements to each other.  Yes, and the bottom of the figure is flat and can confidently stand on the floor or table, not rolling on its side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Snowman from glasses" class="if uuid-2290174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2290174.jpg"></div><p>  Glasses of white color are taken for work, laid out with the open part outward and fastened together by a stapler.  Due to the fact that the cup is not even, but has the shape of a truncated cone, after bonding it will form a ‚Äúdonut‚Äù or geometric shape torus. </p><p>  In order for the next row to be wider than the previous one, an additional cup is added.  When you reach the diameter you want, you can subtract one element in each next row.  This is done until the initial number of glasses is reached.  For example, if we took 8 tbsp on the first layer, then the work on the layer with eight glasses ends.  All layers are bonded to each other according to the same principle, that is, a stapler. </p><p>  In the manufacture of the head, the figure is smaller, but the principle of action is similar.  It remains to attach the head and body with paper clips.  Then the work continues, because you need to decorate the figure.  This can be done in many ways, at the request of the wizard.  A scarf is usually tied around the neck, you can put a hat on your head, make a bucket from paper or sew a cap from fabric. </p><p>  Carrot nose is simply inserted into the emptiness of the cup at the right level.  This can be done with other details. </p><h2>  Children's dishes </h2><p>  The second life of plastic - crafts made from it.  Therefore, do not rush to throw away empty bottles or cans of detergent.  After all, you can create wonderful objects from them.  We will consider further how to make such a beautiful set from plastic bottles - a cup and a teapot.  You will need material of different sizes.  For example, it is better to create a cup from a small half-liter bottle; for the bottom of the teapot, purchase a two-liter container, a smaller one - 1.5-liter - is useful for making the lid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.recycled-things.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Children's dishes" class="if uuid-2290153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2290153.jpg"></div><p>  Do not discard bottle clippings.  Thin strips for pens are cut from them.  They are pasted onto a transparent Crystal or Moment Plastic glue.  For the teapot spout, look for a small tube made of thin plastic and, having cut a hole with a knife, insert it tightly into the teapot. </p><p>  Now let's decorate the dishes.  For painting, you can use acrylic paints.  They are odorless and hold well on plastic.  You can think of a different picture.  The only caveat!  Each cut is better to melt a little with a hot iron, then the child will not be able to cut himself on the sharp edge of the bottle.  DIY do-it-yourself plastic is easy to make, and you can come up with an infinite number of products, especially for children‚Äôs play activities and for the interior of the garden. </p><h2>  Original vase </h2><p>  On the frame-by-frame image of the manufacturing process of a vase from a plastic bottle, all stages of work are clearly visible.  First, the height and color of the vase is thought out, because the bottles come in various colors.  If the product is thought wide, then you need to take a two-liter bottle.  The narrowed neck is cut off and thin strips are cut to one level, try to keep their width the same. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.icreativeideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bottle vase" class="if uuid-2290147" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2290147.jpg"></div><p>  After that, you need to bend all the strips in the opposite direction at an angle of 90 ¬∞.  Then the most difficult and painstaking part of the work begins - the interweaving of the strips among themselves.  As you can see in the photo above, the elements are bent in turn.  We pass the adjacent strip and weave the first element into the next two. </p><p>  So the work continues until all the stripes are beautifully bent and intertwined.  Such work needs to be done clearly, smoothing out the fold lines well.  If the craft is done correctly, the vase will have a beautiful and even edge.  If at least one element is not executed exactly, or the fold is poorly smooth, then the whole harmonic structure of the vase decor will be violated. </p><h2>  Flowers from spoons and forks </h2><p>  From plastic devices, namely, spoons or forks, you can make such beautiful candlesticks, as in the photo below.  Making them easy.  In one work, you can combine one and the other utensils.  In one flower, utensils are placed face up, in the other - down. </p><p>  A cardboard circle is taken as the basis of the flower.  If you do not have white, you can take any, even corrugated, and glue it on both sides with plain white paper.  Then spoons and forks are cut.  In this case, the leg is trimmed completely.  They begin gluing the cardboard with spoons or forks in the outer circle, the second row is shifted slightly to the side so that each layer is clearly visible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fallhomedecor.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lamps from spoons" class="if uuid-2290146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2290146.jpg"></div><p>  Plastic parts are smeared with superglue.  After a candle is inserted in the middle, around it a circle is framed by foam balls.  You can make a craft "Flowers" of plastic in different colors.  For example, to make the first row of green forks is the green water lilies.  Then there is a row of white, center the yellow. </p><p>  If such flowers are glued to the foam, then you can run the resulting crafts into a pond or pool, they adhere perfectly to the surface of the water and do not drown. </p><h2>  Beautiful flower from the bottom of the bottle </h2><p>  To make such an original craft, you will need to prepare 2 or 3 plastic green bottles.  The size of the container should vary.  Outside, a large part will be located, inside the other two are inserted, for example, take a 1.5-liter, liter and half-liter plastic bottles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tom-tom1969.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flower of bottles" class="if uuid-2290143" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2290143.jpg"></div><p>  You will also need: a candle or a lighter, superglue, a decorative insert in the middle of the flower.  It does not have to be the same color as the flower itself.  You can use the contrast effect.  Also, the bottles will look beautiful in different colors.  All containers are cut to the bottom level. </p><p>  Then petals are cut from its parts.  Immediately after manufacturing, they have smooth and unattractive edges.  This can be fixed with fire.  You need to act carefully, keep the bottom over the edge, so as not to burn yourself.  Spend over the fire the edge of the petal several times until it turns curved and wavy.  In this way, all the petals are processed. </p><p>  In the end, it remains only to attach all the parts to each other, applying superglue to its central part.  The second bottom is located with a shift to the side, so the flower will look lush and more voluminous. </p><h2>  Plastic crafts for the garden </h2><p>  Other simpler flowers can be made from plastic bottles, which are located mainly in the garden, in the garden or in the front garden.  For their manufacture, you can collect several bottles of the same volume.  The color does not matter much, because all the same, the craft will have to be painted.  Acrylic paints are considered the best way to give colors a vibrant hue. </p><p>  First you need to trim the top of the bottle with a neck.  Do not discard the cover, as it will still be useful to us in work.  The stems of future flowers must be made of wire.  To do this, take a thin metal rod and bend one side down.  Another, even part of the rod, is buried in the ground by indentation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.recycled-things.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flowers for the front garden" class="if uuid-2290158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2290158.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to have a whole bush of plastic flowers, then prepare more twigs.  After the stem is buried in the ground, a green bottle is put on top.  Its neck is directed downward, and the upper part is cut into thin leaves.  By pressure, lower the neck below ground level. </p><p>  Further work is already underway on the attachment of prepared flowers.  They are already trimmed as in the photo, painted, the edges are rounded.  You can make them rounded; details with corners or sliced ‚Äã‚Äãnoodles will also look beautiful. </p><p>  A hole is made in the lids of plastic bottles, you can use a drill or a sharp awl.  After the lid is mounted on the rod, it bends a little and holds the flower in one place.  For reliability, you can fix it with plasticine.  Everything, DIY plastic crafts for the garden is ready! </p><p>  The article presents several interesting crafts using plastic.  As you can see from the detailed instructions and photographs offered to the reader‚Äôs attention, it‚Äôs easy to make such products, you don‚Äôt have to spend too much on materials, and you can easily create beautiful and original crafts. </p>
