But local authorities decided to separate it into a separate recreational area and name it in honor of the poor village that used to be on its territory.  According to vacationers, there is a little quieter than in the old part of the beach. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  children </td><td>  for young people </td><td>  sea </td><td>  infrastructure </td><td>  transport accessibility </td></tr><tr><td>  Barceloneta </td><td>  ++ </td><td>  +++ </td><td>  + </td><td>  ++ </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Rich </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  +++ </td><td>  +++ </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Mar Bella </td><td>  - </td><td>  ++ </td><td>  ++ </td><td>  ++ </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Nova Mar Bella </td><td>  ++ </td><td>  ++ </td><td>  +++ </td><td>  ++ </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Nova Ikaria </td><td>  +++ </td><td>  - </td><td>  +++ </td><td>  ++ </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Sant Sebastia </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  +++ </td><td>  ++ </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Sant Miguel </td><td>  ++ </td><td>  + </td><td>  ++ </td><td>  ++ </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Somorrostro </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  ++ </td><td>  ++ </td><td>  + </td></tr></tbody></table>
