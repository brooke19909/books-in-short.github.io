    <h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  Check-in at the hotel starts at 14:00.  But it happens that guests arrive earlier due to the lack of tickets for a later flight.  They will be settled without problems, not waiting for 14:00, but only if there are free and prepared apartments for living.  But the departure lasts until noon. </p><p>  This hotel can accommodate with children.  If guests come with a baby who is not even four, then you do not need to pay for it.  A baby (up to 2 years old) will be provided with a cot.  In the event that an additional older guest arrives with tourists, it will be necessary to pay extra for it at 1350 TNV per night (about 2400 r).  But another full-size bed will be installed in the apartment.  However, if necessary, you should contact the administration prior to departure and explain your wishes.  You can do this even at the time of booking. </p><p>  It is also worth knowing that the hotel organizes gala dinners on Christmas Eve, the Chinese New Year and the traditional (December 31), and also on the occasion of Valentine's Day.

For example, a ride on elephants.  To find out more, you should contact the reception - administrators will be happy to help.

    <h2>  About the hotel of the same name </h2><p>  Finally - a couple of words about the complex, which has a name almost identical to the eco-hotel, which was described above.  And this is Sugar Palm Kata Resort 4 *.  It is located in approximately the same place as the eco-hotel.  The sea can be reached in a few minutes.  In terms of cost, it is a bit cheaper.  Because it is a boutique hotel, and its distinguishing feature is luxurious rooms, not entertainment.  However, there is a swimming pool and a fitness center - the minimum that an inexperienced tourist needs in order to brighten up his vacation. </p><p>  But the numbers here are really presentable.  Even the standards.  Decorated in a classic style, in bright colors, in the interior everything is harmoniously combined with each other.  There is plenty of living space (minimum 38 sq. M), there is a balcony, a minibar, a plasma, a DVD and a CD player, a dressing room, a bathroom with a large bathtub and bathrobes.  On average, a week in such apartments costs 35-45 tons.  (with breakfast).  So this is also a great hotel to stay. </p><p>  However, no matter which option of these two people he chooses, he will in any case be satisfied.  After all, this is Phuket, and the rest will definitely turn out to be memorable and bright. </p>
