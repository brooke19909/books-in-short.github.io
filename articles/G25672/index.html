    <p>  There is no noisy and bright extravaganza of the holiday, as, for example, in Naama Bay.  Instead, tourists can enjoy relative peace and quiet, clear waters of the sea, huge beaches.  Since the resort began to be mastered recently, the hotels here are quite new, modern and comfortable.  One of the inexpensive, but pleasant among the 4 * category is the Aqua <span>Hotel Resort Spa.</span>  This hotel often participates in the "Fortune" and "Roulette" draws held by Russian travel agencies.  Reviews about him are different.  Those who consciously choose a budget vacation, everyone is satisfied.  Those who get here thanks to Fortune and, as they say, ‚Äúbuys a pig in a poke,‚Äù find a lot of flaws.  We offer you to get acquainted with all the nuances of relaxation in this hotel. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Although the bay, like the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNabq Bay itself, administratively belongs to Sharm el-Sheikh, it is located about 30 km from the city center.  But from the international airport, where all planes arrive from Russia, only 8 km, which is noted by many tourists as an indisputable advantage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aqua hotel resort spa 4 on the map" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1110078.jpg" width="480"></div>  Almost in the center of this resort, the Aqua Hotel Resort Spa 4 * opened in 2010.  The map shows that next to it is the central road El-Salam.  Buses and minibuses ply along it, so getting to Sharm El Sheikh is not a problem.  The famous and most popular bay of the Naama Bay region is only 15 km away, and Old Sharm El Sheikh is about 25 km away.  A bus ride there costs ¬£ 30.  The map also clearly shows that the hotel is not located near the sea, but on the second line.  Relaxing in the Nabq bay, tourists have a good opportunity to visit the reserve of the same name, which can be reached by bus.

Tourists note that the hotel building was built in such a way as to protect the garden with walking paths and pools from the wind, therefore it is warm and comfortable in winter, and in summer many trees give the desired shadow.  The hotel grounds are well-groomed, all green spaces are neatly trimmed, along the alleys and around the pool there are many lawns and flower beds.  There is a spacious parking zone in front of the hotel, which is convenient for those who decide to rent a vehicle.  Here is also the stop of the shuttle carrying guests to the beach. </p>

The guys spend aerobics on the grass and on the water, having morning exercises, lots of fun games and quizzes, and in the evening they organize exciting shows.  For children there is its own animation, including classes at the kids club, outdoor games, evening mini-disco. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Not all 4 * hotels have their own wonderful beaches in Nabq.  Aqua Hotel Resort Spa - among them.  The disadvantage is that the distance to the sea from the hotel is about 1 km, or 20 minutes on foot.  Guests can use the two beaches to which shuttles deliver them free of charge.  The first (closest) is coral.  Many walk to it.  Special shoes are required here.  There are pontoons on the beach, but entrance fees have to be paid.  The bar is also paid.  The second beach (far), to which the shuttle is about 7 minutes, is sandy.  Here, entry into the water is absolutely safe and very convenient for children, the depth starts 200 meters from the coast.  Many tourists prefer to go to a beach called Terazina for money.  Entrance and use of sunbeds, sofas, awnings here is free, entry into the water is excellent, the depth allows you to observe many beautiful animals.  The second popular beach for tourists is the wild, where everything except travel is free, there is a lot of free space and you can find quiet secluded corners. </p>

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  A fairly comfortable vacation for unpretentious tourists is provided by the Aqua Hotel Resort Spa <span>4 *.</span>  <span>The rating of the hotel</span> differs among different tour operators, but basically it keeps within 3.6-4 of 5 possible rating points.  The contingent of vacationers here are residents of the countries of the former CIS and Arabs.  The presence of the latter is not to everyone's liking. </p><p>  Check in the rooms, if available, can be carried out earlier than the rules 14:00, eviction until 12:00, but for an additional fee, you can extend the stay in the room. </p><p>  People traveling to Nabq must take into account the weather in this bay.  So, there are ebbs and flows, and in winter strong enough winds, which prevents swimming in the sea.  In this situation, a great hotel pool helps out. </p><p>  Vacations at the Aqua Hotel Resort Spa are pleasantly diversified by the numerous excursions offered by travel agencies guides and tour desks on the beach and on the streets of the resort. </p>
