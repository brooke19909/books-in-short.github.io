    <h2>  Why banks refuse you: the first reason </h2><p>  For starters, you should find out about the possible reasons why financial organizations refuse you.  So, one of the most common is a disproportionate amount to your income level.  In this case, it is worthwhile to understand that before the lender agrees to give you the required loan, he analyzes the amount of your income.  As a rule, it includes the personal income of not only the borrower, but also all family members living with him on the same living space. </p>

    <p>  At the same time, utility costs, taxes and other expenses are deducted from this amount.  The result is an amount that a potential borrower can afford.  So, if this one is lower than the one that the credited person wants to receive, then the bank‚Äôs refusal is also understandable.  As a result, the borrower turns to the second, third financial organization on the same issue and again receives a negative answer.  And of course, not understanding what the reason is, he begins to worry where to get a loan, if they refuse everywhere. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The second reason: the lack of a stable source of income </h2><p>  The second reason may lie in an unstable source of customer income.  This refers to potential borrowers who do not work anywhere officially.  That is, it can be builders and contractors performing design work, freelancers, artists who have irregular fees, etc. </p><p>  Most often, such people are denied a loan or agree to give an amount less than required.  Also, the term for such a loan can be reduced, and as guarantees, the bank will advise you to attract more reliable guarantors, provide collateral or purchase insurance.  Therefore, in order not to puzzle over where to get a loan, if they refuse everywhere, you must first find out the reason for the refusal.  And of course, it is worth considering alternative options proposed by a representative of a credit institution. </p>

    <h2>  Reason Three: Insolvent Age </h2><p>  Another reason why a borrower leaves the bank with nothing is an insolvent age.  So, you can get a loan in most banks starting from 21-23 years (less often - from 18).  If you are less than the established minimum, then you will be refused in 100% of cases. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The same applies to retired people.  At the time of signing the loan agreement, they should be no more than the maximum specified in the bank rules.  For example, in Sberbank of Russia individuals can apply for a loan from 21 to 65 years old.  "Bank of Moscow" provides loans to borrowers in the age range from 21 to 70 years.  This also includes non-compliance with any requirements of a credit institution, for example, your work experience is less than six months, and at the last place you worked for less than a year, etc. If all of the above is about you, you should think about where to get it loan, if they refuse everywhere.  But more on that later. </p>

    <h2>  Reason Four: The Tainted Story </h2><p>  Perhaps the most important point that lenders pay attention to is their impeccable credit reputation.  That is, the borrower is obliged to comply with all the rules prescribed in the loan agreement, not to violate the terms of the monthly payment, to deposit money exclusively in a strictly specified sequence and amount. </p><p>  And, accordingly, if the borrower has violated the rules established by the bank, then his credit history will be damaged.  And this means that it is rare for any lender to agree to deal with an unscrupulous client. </p><h2>  Where to get an alternative loan in Murmansk? </h2><p>  So where to get a loan if they refuse everywhere?  In Murmansk, suppose it makes sense to get a loan not only in a bank, but also in a non-bank organization.  For example, it may be an MFI (microfinance institution).  What are the advantages of such treatment? </p><p>  First, MFI representatives are more loyal to their clients, unlike banks.  Secondly, the procedure for obtaining and obtaining a loan in such non-profit institutions, as a rule, is simplified.  Here you can get credit money only with your passport, and you do not need to make pledges and first installments, or attract guarantors.  Thirdly, almost every MFI has a unique loyalty system.  It provides for an increase in the loan amount for a client if he has managed to prove himself on the positive side after the first loan. </p>

    <p>  For example, in Murmansk there is such a company as ‚ÄúCentrofinance‚Äù.  She gives microloans in the amount of from 1,000 to 50,000 rubles for a period of one to 90 days.  The size of the overpayment for such a loan will be 0.5-1% per day.  The age of borrowers at the time of registration should be from 21 to 75 years. </p><h2>  Where to get a loan if they refuse everywhere: Novokuznetsk </h2><p>  Non-bank organizations are also working in Novokuznetsk, ready to issue short-term cash loans to their potential borrowers.  For example, a microloan for a period of up to 21 days and in the amount of 1,000 and up to 15,000 rubles can be obtained from SMSfinance. </p><p>  Borrowers with a minimum age of 18 and a maximum of 70 years can submit an online application on the organization‚Äôs website.  The size of the overpayment for the day on such a microloan is 0.90-1.74% per day. </p><h2>  Where can I get a microloan in Izhevsk? </h2><p>  If you do not know where to get a loan, if Izhevsk is refused everywhere, pay attention to the following MFIs: </p><ul><li>  "Centrofinance". </li><li>  ‚ÄúBorrow money.‚Äù </li><li>  "SMSfinance". </li><li>  "Web Banker." </li><li>  "Money Man." </li><li>  Kredito24 and others. </li></ul><p>  For example, if you are already 21 years old, then you can apply for a loan in the amount of 5,000 and up to 100,000 rubles for a term of 2 to 24 weeks at the MFI ‚ÄúMoney Borrowing‚Äù.  The size of the overpayment will be 1% per day. </p><h2>  Where to get money in Chelyabinsk? </h2><p>  They have not yet figured out where to get a loan, if they refuse everywhere, in Chelyabinsk?  Pay attention to the MFI ‚ÄúMoney will be!‚Äù, Which makes a decision on the loan within half an hour and, if so, gives microloans in the amount of 5,000 to 70,000 rubles for a period of 14 and 365 days.  The size of the overpayment will be equal to 0.3-1.8% per day.  Borrowers of this organization, according to the rules of the company, can become citizens in the age range from 21 to 70 years. </p><p>  In addition, in Chelyabinsk there are other organizations that can give you a loan.  Among them are the smart company ‚ÄúYour Money‚Äù, the organization ‚ÄúPlatiza.ru‚Äù, MFI ‚ÄúLime-Zaim‚Äù, ‚ÄúFerratum Russia‚Äù and others. </p><p>  In a word, there is an alternative to bank loans.  It remains only to make the right choice in favor of a particular company. </p>
