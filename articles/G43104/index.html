    <p>  The territory of the beach of the hotel is restricted for outside tourists.  That is, you can safely enjoy your vacation by the sea.  The beach itself is sandy and pebble, wide, clean and well-maintained.  The road from the hotel to the beach runs through a beautiful green square, where you can spend time on cozy benches in the shade of tree branches.  Children will also like it here, since mini-rides are specially set for them in the park. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The easiest way will be to use your own car, especially if you do not get too far.  For nonresident tourists, several convenient delivery options to the hotel are offered.  From the airport you can take minibus 51 to the Rynok stop.  If you travel by rail, shuttle taxis 51, 56, 58, 61, 187, 123 are suitable for you. The hotel provides its guests with a shuttle service, so you can book a car in advance at a time that suits you.  Ordering a transfer from the airport or railway station will cost a tourist 500 rubles.  This service guarantees meeting, loading suitcases and delivery to the place. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Instead of a conclusion, I would like to note how tourists themselves see this hotel, primarily those who have been here more than once.  Reviews emphasize that very friendly staff work here.  When you arrive, you don‚Äôt have to wait - the number is always ready, and you will go to unpack things without having to wait below. </p>

    <p>  The hotel theme is numbers.  Judging by the reviews, they are all clean and comfortable, each has air conditioning and personal hygiene products.  Cleaning is done every day, and when guests are not in the room.  It is very convenient and completely safe, as you can put away all valuables in a safe.  Towels are changed every day.  It is also very convenient, as you will constantly go to the sauna or the beach. </p><p>  Nutrition is another rich topic.  All tourists note that the food here is very tasty.  A huge selection of dishes in the buffet system will not leave a chance for your diet.  Moreover, there are never many people in a restaurant, so you always have a chance to sit quietly in the company of your loved ones.  Summing up, I want to say that this hotel is a great representative of its class, and if you want to have a good vacation, you definitely need to visit it. </p>
