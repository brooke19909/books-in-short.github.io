A graceful model with a wide tight-fitting hip belt with a fastener, a turn-down collar - a shawl and a loose wide-open top</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Knitting by many women is perceived not as hard work, but rather, on the contrary, as an opportunity for self-expression, the embodiment of one‚Äôs creativity and even as a process of healing from nervous diseases.  In a special place here is the manufacture of large things, for example, knitting cardigans with knitting needles. </p><p>  Cardigans are a certain kind of warm outerwear, a big jacket.  They are very fashionable today.  But it is worth noting that the model of this wonderful clothing came to us from the distant past.  True, then cardigans were sewn, beautifully decorated with elaborate embroidery, and wore them mainly as formal, weekend clothes. </p><p>  Today, cardigans are worn both as an everyday outfit, using them for warmth, and as an elegant model of clothes for going out.  It all depends on the chosen style and material for the manufacture of the product. </p><p>  In ancient times, cardigans were sewn from dense fabric.  <span>Knitting cardigans with</span> knitting needles appeared much later, but very soon became one of the needlewomen's favorite pastimes.  This can be either <span>knitting cardigans</span> for men or knitting <span>female cardigans.</span>  With certain skills, it is easy to learn knitting cardigan patterns for every taste: both elongated, freely hanging from the shoulders, with one fastener on top, and loose on top, but tightly fastened with a wide belt from the bottom. </p><p>  By the way, a wide fastening belt at the bottom, very reminiscent of a short narrow skirt, is well suited for women with not very <span>wide hips,</span> but already having a small tummy, for young mothers with not quite formed waist after childbirth and for pregnant women.  After all, <span>knitting cardigans</span> with <span>knitting</span> needles with a wide belt at the bottom suggests a fairly loose sagging on top of the model, which, together with a tight-fitting wide belt, creates the impression of slimness. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To start knitting cardigans with knitting needles, from the preparation of pattern patterns.  The back is cut a little longer than a regular jacket, the sleeves are extended downwards.  In front of the model should be provided smelly.  That is, the shelves should overlap at the very bottom by 20 centimeters.  Patterns are laid out on an old blanket on a large table or on the floor. </p><p>  The main details of the cardigan are supposed to be knitted into one thread with thin knitting needles of ordinary viscous facial loops.  After the back, shelves and sleeves are connected, the parts are washed and laid out over the patterns, and they are pierced with sewing pins at the edges.  In this position, the parts should dry and take the desired shape. </p><p>  While the main parts dry, you need to perform the finishing: cuffs and belt.  It is best to knit these parts in two threads with thicker knitting needles of a viscous ‚Äúelastic 2X2‚Äù so that the cuffs and belt are sewn to the product across the main pattern. </p><p>  For the belt, loops are collected in such an amount as the width of the belt is required for the conceived model.  In length, this part should correspond to the bottom of the stitched shelves and back.  After the belt is tied, it must be sewn with the side to the bottom of the product.  On the belt there are either large buttons (2 or 3 pieces) or straps with shoe clasps - this depends on the taste and direction in the clothes of the person to whom this thing is intended. </p><p>  To knit a collar - a schalke, you should take an already sewn model (without a belt) and type on the edges of the shelves and the neck of the back of the loop on circular knitting needles.  The number of loops should be such that the last on the front side of the collar from both ends was 2 front loops.  Thus, the collar pattern (except for the back) is also located across the main pattern.  Having knitted 5 rows with a 2X2 elastic band, we begin to reduce the collar, making it bevel along the bottom symmetrically on both sides. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To do this, on the collar at the waist, we reduce each row with one loop, but not the last, but the fourth, leaving 1 edge and 2 front (edging).  This will make the edge of the collar neat, smooth roundness, as if edged with an edge strip in two front loops.  When the collar cloth reaches a width (measured along the length of the elastic) of 20 cm, you must completely close the collar. </p><p>  This is done as follows: two edging facial knit, and the second knit together with two from the collar panel, turn the product and knit 2 wrong and hem in the opposite direction.  Then the product is unfolded again and the report is repeated: the edge is removed, 1 front, 3 together front and a turn.  So you need to knit to the middle of the neck of the back, then close the remaining two front ones. </p><p>  The second half of the collar remained on the spoke.  It is also closed, as well as the first half of the collar, until also 2 front loops remain on the spoke.  An accurate seam is to connect the previously closed two loops and the remaining two loops. </p><p>  Under a cardigan, you need to wear a blouse, as the top of it opens up.  But if the style provides for an additional fastener that holds the shelves, then you can wear a model without a blouse.  For mature women, it is worth thinking about trousers or a narrow skirt, combined with a cardigan.  Well, young and creative girls can be flaunted with bare legs, especially if the cardigan is quite long.  And let all men and youths turn their necks around, looking after the beauty, proudly walking in chic, fashionable, elegant clothes made by her own skillful hands! </p>
