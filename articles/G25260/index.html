    <p>  However, researchers have no doubt that the history of this place began long before the founding of the city.  Even in the seventh-sixth centuries BC, there was a Greek settlement, traces of which were destroyed by the sea.  Information about it can be obtained only by preserved fragments of ceramics, which are still found on the shores of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  Scientists suggest that the settlement ceased to exist due to attacks by nomadic Scythians. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Popular sights of Taganrog (Russia): stone staircase </h2><p>  Acquaintance with the city should start with a visit to the most beloved by the local population of the architectural monument.  We are talking about a stone staircase erected in 1823, which is invariably mentioned when the most striking city attractions are listed.  Taganrog is a city that is associated with this staircase.

    <p>  The building was created from Sarmatian stone, its length is 113 meters.  The bulky structure includes 13 sites.  An interesting fact related to the history of the state is connected with the staircase.  Many years ago, the Crimean conquerors tried to get into the heart of the city, climbing its steps, but the Russian troops managed to repulse the attack. </p><p>  Why is the stone staircase worth visiting earlier than other attractions?  Taganrog is a city of surprises, one of them is waiting for those tourists who will climb to the top of the stairs.  Here is an octagonal curbstone equipped with a sundial.  Those who want to know the time with their help will have to solve the riddles that can be seen on the marble slab, acting as a dial. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Chekhov's house </h2><p>  Chekhov's house - a building that you can not forget about, listing the popular attractions of Taganrog (Russia).

    <p>  Visitors who find themselves in the building of the Alferaki Palace will be amazed at the abundance of antique statues and magnificent paintings, and will be able to admire the walls decorated with Italian paintings.  Many works by Chekhov tell about the life of the palace in the old days: ‚ÄúMy Life‚Äù, ‚ÄúMask‚Äù, ‚ÄúIonych‚Äù. </p><h2>  Pushkinskaya embankment </h2><p>  Of course, not all of the interesting places Taganrog is famous for are listed above.  Sights of the city have their own history, Pushkinskaya embankment is no exception.  This site received its name in honor of the famous poet, who visited Taganrog in 1820.

    <p>  Having visited the embankment, the length of which is more than a kilometer, you should definitely admire the sculpture "Roman with double bass", glorifying the work of the same name by Chekhov.  Of course, here you can see the monument to Pushkin, in whose honor this place is named. </p><h2>  Monument to Peter the Great </h2><p>  Of course, the inhabitants of the city could not help but repay their deserts to the one who founded it.  <span>The monument to Peter the Great</span> back in 1903 became a unique visiting card of Taganrog.  It is known that this building owed much to Anton Chekhov, who organized a fundraiser, calling for help from wealthy Taganrozh residents. </p><p>  The Russian emperor is depicted in the form of an officer of the Preobrazhensky regiment.  In his right hand is the cane on which he rests.  In the left, Peter the Great holds a spyglass.  Of course, the monument is facing the sea. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  What else can you do when visiting Taganrog, the sights and entertainments of which are famous throughout the country?  There are many cafes and restaurants in the city, where tourists who are tired of visiting monuments and museums can drop in.  For example, deserves a visit to the cafe "Freken Bok", which locals call a monument to Faina Ranevskaya.  This institution is located next to the house where the famous actress spent her first years of life.  The interior of the cafe recreates Toddler‚Äôs house from the famous cartoon ‚ÄúToddler and Carlson‚Äù.  It is not surprising that this particular cartoon was chosen, because Freken Bock was voiced by Ranevskaya. </p><p>  These are the most interesting places that Taganrog meets tourists, the sights and entertainments of which are discussed in this article. </p>
