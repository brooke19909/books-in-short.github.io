    <p>  Let us consider in more detail which articles are not included in the document: </p><ul><li>  amounts for exchange transactions; </li><li>  cash equivalents invested; </li><li>  currency operations; </li><li>  receiving money from the bank, transfers of funds between accounts that do not change the total amount of assets. </li></ul><p>  When filling out the report, all flows are distributed by current, financial and investment activities.  In the first case, the financial result from ordinary activities is reflected, in the second - associated with the acquisition of non-current assets.  Payments that change the structure of capital and borrowings relate to <span>financial activities.</span>  Next, instructions will be presented on filling out the cash flow statement, which describes in detail what amounts to enter on each line. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Collapsed Key Figures </h2><p>  The standard form does not provide line numbering.  If the document is handed over to statistics, then the codes must be entered independently, based on the Order of the Ministry of Finance No. 66.  In other cases, you do not need to number the articles. </p><p>  Some cash flows are shown minimized.  For example, if they characterize the activities of counterparties more than the firm itself.  Such operations include: </p><ul><li>  agent cash flows related to payment of commission services; </li><li>  VAT and excise taxes; </li><li>  revenue from the counterparty related to the reimbursement of utility bills on lease. </li></ul><p>  When reflecting the folded VAT, it is necessary to indicate the difference between the amounts received from counterparties and those transferred as part of payments.  These numbers may appear line by line: </p><ul><li>  4119 if the VAT transferred to suppliers and to the budget is less than received from buyers and from the budget; </li><li>  4129, if the VAT transferred to suppliers and to the budget is greater than that received from buyers and from the budget. </li></ul><h2>  Features </h2><ul><li>  The report does not reflect the entire list of cash flows.  One and the same operation can be assigned to several categories.  In this case, the single payment must be divided into separate transactions. </li><li>  The report is filled in thousand or million rubles. </li><li>  If funds are received in foreign currency, then the amount transferred in Russian rubles at the exchange rate on the date of receipt of payment is entered in the report.  If the number of homogeneous operations, the price of which is expressed in the currency of another state, is large, then you can use the average rate. </li><li>  Be sure to reflect the cash equivalents of assets that change the price and can be sold at any time. </li></ul>

    <h2>  How to allocate VAT? </h2><p>  All income and expenses of funds must be “cleared” of tax before filling out the report.  This process is difficult for accountants.  Not all VAT accounts are reflected separately.  In order not to make errors in the calculations, you need: </p><ul><li>  allocate annual amounts of revolutions according to DT62 (60) KT51; </li><li>  multiply the resulting figure by 18/118, thus highlighting the VAT; </li><li>  the remaining amount will be "cleared" of tax. </li></ul><p>  This method of calculation is suitable only for counterparties who sell goods subject to an 18% rate.  What about products for which a 10% rate is provided, and one that is not subject to VAT at all?  In such cases, you need to separate the flows for operations with different rates: </p><p>  <em>VAT balance = VAT received + Amounts received from the budget - VAT transferred - VAT paid.</em> </p><p>  The calculated difference will be the “pure” cash flow from a specific type of activity: </p><ul><li>  A positive amount is recorded on page 4119; </li><li>  A negative amount is shown in parentheses on page 4129. </li></ul><p>  Not all accountants adhere to this algorithm.  If VAT flows are not separated in the report, this should be indicated in the explanatory note. </p><h2>  How to reflect salary? </h2><p>  In page 4122 all payments related to labor remuneration are indicated.  The question is whether it is necessary to include in this line, besides salaries, vacation pay and bonuses, also personal income tax and insurance premiums?  Some experts believe that in this article it is necessary to specify only the turnover for DT70 KT50 (51), and the amounts of the transferred personal income tax, fees and other taxes should be reflected on page 4129. With this separation, you can understand who the funds are sent to: employees or the budget.  Others believe that on page 4122 you need to show all payments related to payroll.  Then it will be possible to determine how much the organization costs the “maintenance” of employees.  Both options have a right to exist.  It is only necessary to indicate in the explanatory note the selected method of reflecting information. </p>

    <h2>  NPP </h2><p>  In order to correctly fill out the form, you need to determine for which transactions the profit was received, which is the source of income tax in the reporting year, and enter the data depending on the results obtained.  The most common source of revenue was income from ordinary activities.  Therefore, the tax amount is reflected on page 4124. </p><h2>  Cash equivalents </h2><p>  How to fill out a cash flow statement regarding highly liquid financial investments?  To begin with, we will figure out which assets belong to this category.  Cash equivalents are bank bills, demand deposits and other assets that can easily be converted into cash, but are subject to the risk of price changes.  Such values ​​are reflected in the balance sheet on page 1250. The same amount should be transferred to the report. </p><p>  An organization may have assets on its balance sheet whose price is expressed in the currency of another state.  In this case, how to fill out a cash flow statement?  An example of entering data on transactions in foreign currency. </p><p>  The principle of reporting is similar to filling in the balance sheet.  Currency values ​​are reflected in the form No. 1 at the exchange rate of rubles at the date of transaction.  When depositing the balances of dollars and euros in the accounts at the beginning of the year (p. 4450) and at the end (p. 4500) of the year, the rate for December 31 must be indicated.  The difference that happened after the recounts should be summarized in page 4490. If the organization does not have cash equivalents and letters of credit in foreign currency, then the calculations are carried out using the following formula: </p><p>  <em>Page</em>  <em>4490 = Annual revolutions according to DT50 (52) KT91-1 - Annual revolutions KT50 (52) DT91-2.</em> </p><p>  You can verify the correctness of the calculations by the following formula: </p><p>  <em>Page</em> <em>4500 = . 4450 – . 4400 – . 4490.</em> </p>
