Every day, hundreds or even thousands of newcomers appear trying to learn the successful strategy of the game and grab their mouth-watering bite from millions that are constantly playing out. </p><h2>  Bankroll Basics - Rescue for Beginners </h2><p>  Whatever the person - a talented mathematician, professional psychologist or an experienced card player - in any case, he will experience certain difficulties at the first stage of knowing poker.  The first thing you need to know (and as quickly as possible) for an inexperienced poker player is what a bankroll is and how to manage it.  After all, the duration of his ‚Äúcareer‚Äù depends on it.  Too many step on the same rake, and then, in desperation, drop everything without even knowing all the delights of this card game. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is bankroll" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1295764.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Of course, it‚Äôs worth considering what a bankroll is, if you play poker for money.  After all, only with the loss of something valuable does a person begin to make more balanced and adequate actions, evaluate every moment of the game, analyze.  But there is a flip side to this: the burden of responsibility sometimes leads to rash risky actions that can lead to bankruptcy.  It is from this that the rules of bankroll are called to save. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dispersion is inevitable </h2><p>  First you need to understand a poker player for money that sooner or later a black line will come.  It is impossible to win all the time, even if you do everything absolutely right, soberly weighing every step.  In this game, the share of luck is also important.  In fact, any card can become nuts, and, according to the laws of probability theory, it will not always be with you.  In order not to prematurely go bankrupt in these dark days, it is necessary to strictly adhere to the rules that bankroll management regulates. </p>

    <p>  So, a little specificity.  What is a bankroll?  This is, in fact, your bank.  Buy-in - the amount that will be withdrawn from you for participating in the tournament.  If you play cash, the blinds are an alternative, which you will definitely have to put at the table.  The rules of bankroll management just regulate the ratio of buy-innovation and blinds to the player's bank in order to feel confident at the chosen limit. </p><h2>  Bankroll Theory for Cash </h2><p>  If from the first steps of conquering poker you decide to try your hand at cash, you should adhere to an unshakable rule: play the limits so that your pot is equal to or exceeds 300 big blinds.  For example, you have chosen a table at which they play 1/2 blinds.  It turns out that your bankroll should be at least 2 x 300 = 600. This is done so that you can feel relaxed at the table and not be afraid to play border distributions, hoping for luck. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

For example, we will make a small calculation: you sat at a table with a stack of 200 with blinds 1/2.  If your buy-in is reduced to 170 due to a series of losses and unsuccessful distributions, you do not have the right to continue playing at this limit - you cannot afford it anymore, think about switching to a lower one.

    <h2>  MTT Bankroll Theory </h2><p>  Tournaments are different.  The specifics of a multi-table game is significantly different from cache.  There is no time to wait, the blinds automatically grow and sooner or later begin to bite your stack.  You will have to play many hours before the prize zone, and all this time you are hanging in the balance, risking being without prize money.  Despite the duration and complexity, MTTs are very popular, and this is due to the fact that here the most ‚Äúdelicious‚Äù prize ones.  Hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of dollars can be played in one tournament. </p><p>  Such fabulous cash prizes in one evening cannot be earned at micro limits.  But you should also not rush into expensive tournaments in the hope of earning more.  There is a bankroll rule for MTT: you must have an amount equal to 40 buy-ins per tournament.  Here is an example: your bank is 100 conventional units, in which case you can afford to play tournaments no more than 2.50. </p><h2>  Adequate capacity assessment </h2><p>  With the search for answers to the question of what a bankroll is, beginners encounter those who decide to play for money in online rooms.  It is here that you can immerse yourself in poker completely.  You can play several tables at once for many hours, and these tables will be of completely different plan: tournaments, cash, limited hold'em, Omaha, SnG. </p>

Knowing in advance what a bankroll is, you will ensure a longer existence in the poker arena, albeit not in the role of a world star, but at least as an adequate and promising player.  If you learn to strictly manage your bank, psychological problems will automatically disappear from you.  The next <span>black streak</span> in the game simply will not be able to knock you down, because poker wins the one who knows how to withstand the distance, and not in one hand.
