Such a position plus brand quality could not but interest a certain circle of people.  Such a phone is not suitable for lovers of all-in-one combines, but for trips to the country or a gift for elderly relatives, it turned out to be just right. </p>

    <p>  The phone has a loud bell, a long life on a single battery, all the functions of a regular phone and a flashlight and radio.  The display is black and white, there is no polyphony and MP3, as there are no expansion cards and Internet access.  There is a calendar, alarm clock, stopwatch. </p><h2>  Layout and equipment </h2><p>  The Nokia 1280 phone was originally developed as a business solution for calls, so the phone‚Äôs equipment is minimal.  The box contains a phone, charging, battery and instructions.  For the radio you need headphones, which the user can purchase separately. </p><p>  As with most models with radio support, the headphone cable has two functions - audio transmission and antenna.  The headphone jack is on the top side, a flashlight is located nearby.  Charging is connected on the left - a traditional solution for the brand in the form of a hole.  The lace mount is located on the bottom, next to the microphone.  The layout is thought out, practical, and the build quality is at a high level.  Details fit tightly, there are no backlashes, no squeaks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance and menu </h2><p>  Nokia 1280 has a monochrome display that holds three lines of text.  Above and below there are also two service fields.  In standby mode, you can display the clock.  The numbers are large, ‚Äújuicy‚Äù, visible even without backlight.  The backlight is made in a pale blue hue, but on the keys it is white.  There are practically no dark corners, the entire front panel is evenly lit.  Rubberized keys, on the one hand, are easy to press, but on the other hand, you can not be afraid of accidental pressing in your pocket - the keyboard is slightly recessed. </p>

    <p>  You can‚Äôt name a large font; older users may need glasses.  Like many phones sold in Russia, the buttons are marked with two alphabets. </p><p>  The menu of the Nokia 1280 phone does not have any frills - either a list or original icons for Nokia.  The large button between the call and cancel keys is made a ‚Äúswing‚Äù and is responsible for additional functions.  In the menu, you can configure the language (Russian is present), call tones, go to the TF book, tune the radio.  Other functions are collected in the Organizer block.  The flashlight on the top panel can be turned on directly from the keyboard - by pressing the rocker up.  Two modes are supported - while a key is pressed or continuously.  Constant light is switched on by double pressing up. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The result of minimalism was that the phone does not understand all the functions associated with USSD.  Radio does not have auto search.  Both searching and saving the wave you like must be done manually.  You can save up to 10 radio stations. </p><h2>  So different 1280 </h2><p>  In the specifications submitted by the developers, polyphonic ringtones and a call editor for Nokia 1280 are indicated. The instruction, like the press releases, confirms this.  But in the first versions that appeared on sale, not everything was.  A funny thing happened to the melody editor.  The instructions stated that there is a place to save your tunes, but ... the editor itself is NOT!  Then the firmware was changed, and in subsequent sales there really was a good polyphony and a melody editor.  Except for this error, the phone is a workhorse.  In the early years, the phone was presented only in 4 colors - black, gray with black, blue with black and pink with black.  Then the unexpected interest of the beautiful half forced the company to expand the line, and the latest models could be white-black or yellow-black. </p><h2>  Connection quality </h2><p>  For a phone planned by a simple dialer, and even from such a brand, it seems indecent to talk about the quality of communication.  The design of the phone has a second speaker on the back of the case, quite impressive size.  As a result, an alarm clock, a call can be heard well, but speaking on it is not very convenient.  In the reviews about the phone, there were sayings that everyone around you will hear your interlocutor, with the exception of yourself.  Others found an original way out - to turn the phone when talking to the other side.  By the standards of Nokia (and not only her), the microphone is displayed on the bottom panel, and if you expand the phone, they will still hear you. </p><h2>  A bit about other options </h2><p>  Let's touch on other parameters of the Nokia 1280 phone. Specifications are shown in the following screenshot. </p>

    <p>  These are not technical specifications, but all the basic functions of the phone are listed here.  Only the mention of the melody editor is missing. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Despite the ascetic minimalism of features, Nokia 1280 has found its fans.  And the fact that this version is the only one that had a <span>talking clock,</span> with the press of a button telling the time without looking at the screen, won its popularity no less than it had previously released models with support for the Internet, MP3, memory cards and other functions inherent in modern mobile phones . </p>
