In addition, it is better to disagree with a room whose windows do not look outside the hotel, as animations from neighboring hotels do not create comfortable sleeping conditions.  As many guests note, the balcony facing the courtyard greatly adds to the calm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hrizantema 4 bulgaria sunny beach" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54721/1992368.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The least flattering reviews were received by employees of the facilities on the territory of the Hrizantema 4 * hotel in Sunny Beach.  Since the pool is open from 9:00 a.m., come at 8:50 a.m., you may be asked to leave the sunbed, using local idiomatic expressions.  Since Bulgarian is not so different from Russian, then, unfortunately, you will understand everything.  Those who like to ‚Äúscore‚Äù a deck chair early should also be careful, because the things left on it at 8:30 are in the general heap in an arbitrary place. </p><h2>  No, then I'm on the beach </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">And there, besides soft sand and wide shallows, there are other ‚Äúpleasures‚Äù.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The coastline does not belong to the hotel, so there are their own rules.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The whole beach is divided into paid and free zones, almost free and completely clogged with people, respectively.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">In a paid zone everything is paid, as some vacationers say, ‚Äúeven breathe‚Äù.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">You just cannot sit on the sand, and renting a sunbed costs about 5 euros, an umbrella - another 5 euros.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">And all this, regardless of whether you take them for an hour or a day.</span></span></span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hrizantema chrysanthemum 4 sunny beach" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54721/1992364.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel operates the largest in Sunny Beach and Bulgaria Hrizantema Hotel Casino 4 *, whose area is more than 1000 m¬≤. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Most of the guests were satisfied with the rest in the hotel of Bulgaria in Sunny Beach Hrizantema 4 *.  In their opinion, for its price category the hotel fully lives up to its expectations.  All the features of the service at the level of four stars are justified by a relatively low price.  As some clients rightly believe, for something better you do not need to go to another Bulgarian hotel, you just need to try a vacation in another European country. </p>
