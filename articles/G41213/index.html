    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The history of this organization begins in 1994, when the founder of the business, Oleg Tinkov, bought the JSCB Himmashbank.  In 2006, the organization was renamed Tinkoff Credit Systems.  Today, the bank is called even simpler. </p><p>  Its main feature is full remote maintenance.  Tinkoff Bank, whose rating is high enough, does not have ATMs or retail outlets.  But this does not prevent him from being popular. </p><p>  This is the only online bank in all of Russia.  Its main products offered to customers are debit and credit cards, as well as deposits.  But this is not the whole list of services.  The organization is also engaged in the issuance of combination cards, the issuance of targeted loans (for the purchase of goods in online stores), and advertising targeting.  Tinkoff Bank also has a mortgage platform. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  He takes 45th place in the ranking.  Equity - a little more than 29.2 billion. The amount of its assets is 182.208 billion rubles.  And the fact that so many people have entrusted their funds to this organization is the best proof of its reliability. </p>

    <h2>  About Reliability </h2><p>  Tinkoff Bank also has a good rating because it is the owner of some prestigious awards and "ranks."  This fact inspires confidence.  So, for example, in October of this year, he received the status of the largest and independent online bank in the world in terms of the number of customers.  This was found out as a result of research by the analytical company Frost &amp; Sullivan. </p><p>  In 2015, the organization was recognized as the <span>best online bank</span> in Russia.  And in 2016 it became known that the organization‚Äôs website is the best banking service in the Russian Federation.  These conclusions were made by the international banking magazine, known as Global Finance.  And Euromoney recognized the organization as the best digital bank in all of Eastern and Central Europe.  And this is not the whole list of ranks.  However, it is already clear that Tinkoff Bank is a very serious organization. </p><p>  Reliability rating is also reinforced by another fact.  Namely, the fact that this bank participates in the <span>Deposit Insurance System.</span>  Therefore, many trust him with their money.  The system guarantees - each person who invested their money will receive a refund in the amount of 1,400,000 rubles in accounts and current deposits and interest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Active development </h2><p>  Talking about what Tinkoff Bank has a reliability rating, one cannot but pay attention to the implementation of the so-called development program. </p><p>  Messages regularly appear that the system has one or another innovation.  So, for example, on November 1 of this year, Tinkoff launched Apple Pay, an easy and secure payment tool that allows you to pay for purchases with just a touch of Touch ID. </p><p>  And on October 3, the organization launched a service called Tinkoff Investments (jointly with BCS Broker).  Thanks to him, customers can now choose securities directly in their personal account, and pay for the purchase with a card. </p><p>  And on September 22, news appeared that Tinkoff now serves its customers in Telegram, a messenger that is gaining more and more popularity.  People got the opportunity to contact support by phone, email, chat and social.  networks, and now Telegram has been added to the list.  And you can do it simply.  It is enough to enter the following query in the search line: TinkoffServiceBot. </p><h2>  Credit services </h2><p>  So, at what place Tinkoff Bank is in the ranking - it‚Äôs clear.  Largely his success was facilitated by customers who use cards and other online services, but after all, many also take loans.  And now they are even more popular. </p><p>  Tinkoff offers customers a credit card with a limit of up to 300,000 rubles for home delivery.  At the same time, people are provided with an interest-free period of 55 days.  And the monthly payment is only 8%.  But this is the maximum bid.  Usually install it individually, and on average it is 6%. </p><p>  Many people like Tinkoff credit cards, since for any purchases for which they have been paid, 1% of the amount is credited to the account.  And up to 30% - for acquisitions on special offers.  1 point, by the way, is equal to the ruble.  Then they can be spent on the purchase of air and train tickets, lunch at a restaurant and many other purchases.  So a person, issuing a credit card, can also benefit for themselves.  At the same time, there are no "pitfalls" - you can find out everything in your personal account or by contacting the operator.  This is the main convenience that Tinkoff Bank has.  For this reason, the rating among banks is so high.  Because people, first of all, value convenience and an individual approach. </p>

    <h2>  Last news </h2><p>  Interesting information has recently appeared.  And this is what it says: Binbank added the option of replenishing Tinkoff cards to its ATMs.  There are limits.  For one operation, you can put 85,000 rubles in an account.  And a month - up to 559,000 rubles.  Moreover, no commission is charged, which is especially pleasing. </p><p>  This is further evidence that Tinkoff organizations can be trusted.  After all, Binbank is in 12th place in the <span>rating of Russian banks.</span>  Binbank is a large metropolitan private organization.  And the fact that now it is possible to conduct operations related to Tinkoff through his ATMs only strengthens the trust of customers. </p><h2>  Cooperation </h2><p>  Talking about what place Tinkoff Bank occupies in the rating, it is worthwhile to dwell on the topic of its cooperation with other organizations.  Active partnership with other financial enterprises once again proves its seriousness and reliability. </p><p>  For example, on August 15, Tinkoff launched a loyalty program with RosEuroDevelopment Group of Companies (a company that is a leader in the commercial real estate market).  This is a bonus program AURACARD.  <span>A bank client,</span> making purchases at absolutely any point on our planet, will then be able to spend the accumulated points in the Aura shopping and entertainment center.  The goal of the joint project is to create an interesting proposal for a new segment of customers. </p>

    <h2>  Best </h2><p>  From all that was said earlier, only one conclusion can be drawn - Tinkoff is a reliable bank.  And finally, I would like to note that in the spring of this year it was recognized as the best bank for servicing credit cards and obtaining them.  Tinkoff received 62.3 and 70 evaluation points out of 100 possible.  This is the highest rating among all study participants.  And the fact that it was announced by the well-known analytical agency Markswebb Rank &amp; Report, inspires confidence. </p>
