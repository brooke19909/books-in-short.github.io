Two more bays - Blue and Blue (with the famous Royal Beach) - are washed by a village in the south-west.  They are separated by a winding, like a huge prehistoric lizard, Cape Kapchik, through which the Through Grotto stretches.  Its length is more than 77 meters.  The village is famous for its magnificent sand and pebble beaches. </p><p>  Many tourists who visited here for the first time were struck by the New World (Crimea 2015).  Guest reviews indicate that the nature of these places is fascinating.  The resort is surrounded by picturesque mountain peaks that reliably protect it from the winds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels new world crimea" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1226265.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the west of the village stands Koba-Kaya - a pointed mountain.  Its name translates as "Cave Rock".  A little to the west is Mount Syndyk and the quaint cape Karaul-Oba.  In the northwest you can see the majestic mountain Sykhtlar.  In the northeast, the Sokol rock mass hangs over the village. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The village is protected by mountains from piercing winds.  The climate here is smooth and mild.

The average air temperature in July is +26 ¬∞ C, in January it reaches +2 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The main attraction of the village is its unique nature.

    <p>  At this point, <span>the Golitsyn trail.</span>  It begins at Green Bay and leads to a huge grotto.  The length of this trail is about five and a half kilometers.  It passes near the most beautiful corners of Crimea: a botanical reserve, Chaliapin's grotto, Green, Blue and Blue bays, the Tsar's beach, juniper grove. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Wine Museum </h2><p>  A winery in the village was founded by <span>Prince Golitsyn</span> in 1878.  On the eve of the centenary of the enterprise, the Museum of the Plant History was opened here.  It is located in the house of L. Golitsyn. </p><p>  In addition to several rooms that have preserved the interior items that belonged to the prince, tourists can visit the basement of this house.  Here were stored bottles with the best drinks that Nicholas II himself had tried in his time.  In the tasting room you will be offered to try wine by candlelight. </p><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  This small village is attractive, first of all, with a measured and unhurried rhythm of life.  This is especially important for people who are tired of the hustle and bustle of a modern city.  A small village in Crimea, which has been known since antiquity, fully lives up to its old name - Paradise.  It translates as "paradise." </p>

    <p>  History buffs can visit the monument to the creator of this resort - Lev Golitsyn, as well as Emperor Nicholas II.  In addition, you can see the ruins of an ancient monastery and the ruins of the Bosporus Fortress.  Tourists who prefer outdoor activities can go diving. </p><p>  In memory of a trip to this paradise, vacationers can bring home handmade souvenirs - they are sold on the promenade and in souvenir shops. </p><h2>  Sea and beaches </h2><p>  According to legend, which the inhabitants of the village like to tell, Emperor Nicholas II rested in these places, but today the Royal Beach is closed to visitors.  However, do not despair - in the New World there are many stunningly beautiful beaches. </p><p>  The main beach of the village is located in Green Bay.  Everyone can visit it, since admission is free.  There is always perfectly clear water, there are no waves and wind, since it is protected by mountains on both sides.  The beach is landscaped, there are several cafes and small shops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New World Crimea" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1226263.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the Blue Bay is a pirate beach.  In the XII-XIII centuries, pirates and smugglers lived here.  The beach is rather narrow, covered with medium-sized boulders, and at the bottom there are stones covered with algae.  Popular films such as Three + Two, Amphibian Man were shot here. </p><p>  There are <span>wild beaches</span> in the village <span>.</span>  One of them is Monastic.  Camping lovers gather here.  You can get here by boat. </p><h2>  Are there any sanatoriums in the village? </h2><p>  It is difficult to call the New World a health resort.  Nevertheless, vacationers can count on some health benefits.  This primarily concerns the problems of the respiratory tract, which are beneficially influenced by clean air with an admixture of essential oils of juniper and pine trees. </p><h2>  New World (Crimea): private sector </h2><p>  This type of accommodation is preferred by many Russians.  This is explained quite simply.  In the small village of New World (Crimea), the private sector is represented quite widely - from small apartments and rooms to spacious cottages equipped with everything necessary.  Prices in this case are significantly lower than in hotels. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Despite the small size of the resort, there are hotels in the village.  Novyi Svet (Crimea) can offer you quite a variety of accommodation.  These are the hotels Juniper Grove and Veselaya Scorpena, the Prince Golitsyn Hotel, the Elena boarding house.  You can stay in a mini-hotel "Champagne" or in the hotel "New World".  These are not very large hotels.  The New World (Crimea) is good because there are no crowds of tourists.  Judging by the reviews of people vacationing here last season, the most popular hotel is the New World. </p>

    <p>  Here can rest up to seventy people.  For accommodation, forty rooms of various categories are offered.  They offer breathtaking views of the mountains or the sea.  Hotel "New World" is perfect for a romantic honeymoon.  In addition, here you can organize corporate events that participants will remember for a long time. </p><h2>  New World, Crimea (2015): reviews </h2><p>  Many vacationers in their reviews note that they used to be in Crimea before, but they discovered this wonderful village only last year.  Most tourists are happy with the rest.  Loved the nature, mild climate, friendly locals.  Fans of noisy discos are not very happy with the trip.  They really are not in the village.  In any case, it was not in 2015. </p>
