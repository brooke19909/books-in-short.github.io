    <h2>  Fashion has two standards. </h2><p>  Today, everything is mixed up and people are divided into several opinions.  Someone is for a slim and miniature body, and some, on the contrary, for mouth-watering forms.  And this is the business of absolutely everyone, the main thing is that everything should be in moderation.  Naturally, a visible skeleton from under the skin or a girl of 200 kilograms, which has many folds, is not very attractive and should not go to extremes. </p><h2>  A little bit about fashion </h2><p>  <span>Modern fashion,</span> in addition to <span>standard models</span> with high growth and a slender body, also shows the appearance of full girls.

They show clothes on the catwalk for ordinary women who don‚Äôt diet themselves, or they simply cannot physiologically have miniature sizes and shapes.  Plus size models also participate in the Curves photo project, and not only here.  Many fashion photographers prefer to shoot models in a magnificent body and see in them more beautiful than in thin ladies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="models plus size photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3226/1574759.jpg"></div>
