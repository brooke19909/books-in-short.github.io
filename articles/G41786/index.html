Based on the obtained data, he explores various fishing methods, determines which of them are the most rational.  In addition, an ichthyologist is a scientist who studies fish farming and is engaged in fish conservation activities. </p>

Only an ichthyologist, whose profession is rather complicated but interesting, can indicate how to breed fish properly, keep them and grow them.

    <p>  I must say that work in this direction has certain features.  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><h2>  The specifics of the professional activity of ichthyologists </h2><p>  These specialists conduct research related to the construction of dams, hydroelectric power plants or any enterprises whose activities are associated with the use and discharge of water into lakes, rivers and seas (natural bodies of water). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What do ichthyologist professions do?  They can work in research institutes, at industrial and floating fish canneries, apply their knowledge while working in enterprises that specialize in fishing, and also engage in scientific work. </p><p>  In addition, an ichthyologist is an employee who can occupy certain positions in zoos or oceanariums, conduct monitoring in reserves and at sites that belong to nature protection zones. </p><p>  It should be noted that for successful professional activities such people need to be well-versed not only in ichthyology, but also have a sufficient level of knowledge in the field of geography, hydrology and botany, as well as paleozoology and climatology. </p><h2>  Personal qualities required by an ichthyologist </h2>

For effective work, you need to have excellent health and good athletic training.  What does an ichthyologist do?  He studies <span>fish that are</span> found not only in local reservoirs, but also in the inhabitants of the seas and oceans, which can be found not only in another region, but even in another country or continent.  Therefore, such work involves lengthy business trips and stay in the open air, living in a rather unsightly place.  Not every woman is able to withstand such conditions.

For catching fish, a trawl net is predominantly taken.  The researcher gets on board the vessel and sent to the studied areas of the reservoir, after which the catch of aquatic inhabitants begins.  Due to the specific shape of the trawl net, which looks like a net, the fish has no chance to get out of it. </p><p>  After there is enough catch, the net is taken aboard.  The fish that is caught is laid out on a tarp and studied.  Those species that are of particular interest to an ichthyologist fall into containers with fixing liquid, the rest are mainly sent to the ship‚Äôs kitchen or back to the reservoir.  For a more detailed study, the caught fish species are sent to a research institute. </p>

Here, the training of ichthyologists is carried out, which in the future can independently conduct various scientific studies. </p><p>  If you graduate from Moscow University of Technology and Management, you can get the education of an ichthyologist, who later has the right to work in zoos, zoos and other institutions where fish are kept.  You can also graduate from Dmitrov Fishery College. </p><p>  It should be noted that ichthyologists should be well versed in other related sciences and be able to use the latest achievements of chemistry and physics, as well as special equipment for underwater research and surveys. </p><h2>  Ichthyologist in fish farming </h2><p>  This specialist monitors the hydrobiological condition of the reservoir, develops the necessary tasks to optimize the operation of the site, which specializes in fish farming, and also develops a work plan and schedules in accordance with the stages of development of aquatic inhabitants. </p>

The ichthyologist carries out organizational and managerial activities - organizes the work of the team and takes managerial decisions in controversial situations, finds a compromise between various requirements (the deadline for completing the relevant work, ensuring their quality and safety, setting optimal prices).  It also resolves conflicts arising from the operation of fisheries, organizes the management of aquatic biological resources. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what does an entomologist ichthyologist do" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8939/368407.jpg?1396880955262" width="406"></div>
