    <p>  Revenues of Russian device distributors, of course, are not so large, but given the sales volumes, they are also rather big.  Moreover, the latest model is still quite fresh and expensive for most buyers.  Therefore, they acquire a 5 iPhone, whose price is lower, and the appearance and characteristics are not very different.  But compared to the iPhone 4s, the enlarged display is more convenient and comfortable for exploring sites, watching videos, reading books or games.  It has better color rendering. </p><h2>  Is the price of the 5th iPhone overpriced </h2><p>  Answering the question "how much is iphone 5", you often hear comments about its overpriced.  Many say that in the US it can be bought for only $ 200, but they forget that this is the cost along with a contract for 2 years, the minimum monthly payment of which is $ 80.  Well, count how much it turns out - 2120 dollars!  Therefore, it is profitable to buy unlocked devices.  And here the prices are already comparable.  Domestic retailers must also earn something! </p><p>  And although there are already many competitive models of phones from other manufacturers with similar technologies and larger screens on the market, the 5th iPhone remains the favorite device for many.  He occupied his niche in time and holds the primacy.  The main thing is to release a new model every year, even more perfect and advanced.  Which, at least so far, has been a success for Apple. </p>
