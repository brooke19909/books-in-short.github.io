  <section class="page js-page"><h1>War communism</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  War communism in Russia is a special structure of socio-economic relations, which was based on the elimination of the commodity-money system and the concentration of available resources in the power of the Bolsheviks.  In the context of an increasing <span>civil war</span> , a food dictatorship was introduced in the country, a direct exchange of products between the village and the city.  War communism implied the introduction of a <span>"card system"</span> , general labor service, the principle of "equalization" in the issue of wages. </p><p>  A rather complicated situation was developing in the country.  The reasons for war communism, mainly, were the Bolsheviks' acute desire to retain power.  For this, different methods were used. </p><p>  First of all, the new government needed armed protection.  Given the difficult situation at the beginning of 1918, the Bolsheviks create an army as soon as possible.  It included units formed from selected commanders and volunteer soldiers.  By mid-year, the government introduces compulsory military service.  This decision was mainly associated with the beginning of the intervention and the development of the opposition movement.  Trotsky (chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of that time) introduces strict discipline in the armed forces and a hostage system (when his family was responsible for the deserter's escape). </p><p>  War communism destroyed the country's economy.  Since the beginning of the revolution, the Bolsheviks lost control of the richest regions of the country: <span>Western Siberia, the</span> Volga region, the Baltic states, and Ukraine.  Between town and country, <span>economic relations</span> were interrupted during the war years.  The economic collapse was completed by numerous strikes and discontent of entrepreneurs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Under these conditions, the Bolsheviks are taking a number of measures.  The nationalization of production and trade began.  <span>The state monopoly</span> was established on January 23 in the merchant fleet, then on April 22 in foreign trade.  Since mid-1918 (June 22), the government launched a program to nationalize enterprises with capital of more than 500 thousand rubles.  In November, the government announced a state monopoly on all organizations in which the number of workers is from five to ten and a mechanical engine is used.  By the end of November, a decree was adopted on the nationalization of the domestic market. </p><p>  War communism solved the problem of the food supply of the city by intensifying the class struggle in the countryside.  As a result, in 1918, on June 11, ‚Äúcomedians‚Äù (committees of the poor) began to be created, vested with the power to seize surplus products from wealthy peasants.  This system of measures has failed.  However, the appraisal program continued until 1921. </p><p>  Due to lack of food, the card system was not able to satisfy the needs of citizens.  Besides the fact that this system was unfair, it was also confusing.  The authorities unsuccessfully tried to fight the "black market". </p><p>  In enterprises, discipline has greatly weakened.  To strengthen it, the Bolsheviks introduce labor books, subbotniks, and general labor duties. </p><p>  The country began to establish a political dictatorship.  The Bolshevik parties began to gradually be destroyed.  Thus, the Cadets were declared "enemies of the people", the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries were removed from the organs in which they represented the majority, the anarchists were arrested and shot. </p><p>  Lenin on the eve of October declared that the Bolsheviks, having taken power, would not lose it.  War communism and the New <span>Economic</span> Policy in 1921 led the country to an <span>economic crisis.</span>  The Bolsheviks tried to hold onto power by violence, the destruction of independent trade unions, and the subordination of government bodies.  Of course, in the political sphere they have achieved monopoly.  However, the country's economy was undermined.  About 2 million citizens emigrated from Russia (mainly citizens), a terrible famine began in the Volga region in the spring of 1919 (there was no grain left after confiscation).  As a result, on the eve of the Tenth Congress (in 1919, March 8) the workers and sailors of Kronstadt revolted, providing military support for the October Revolution. </p>
