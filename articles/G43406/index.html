Everyone wants to think that fate will be more favorable if you make gifts from time to time.  And since giving thanks to something invisible and asking for help from something intangible is difficult, you can create a totem for yourself.  How to make a money tree with your own hands?  This will be discussed below. </p><h2>  Sequin tree </h2><div class="photo" data-original="madeheart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sequin tree" class="if uuid-2449560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2449560.jpg"></div><p>  Have you decided to make yourself a totem?  Then you should decide on the material.  Do-it-yourself money tree can be made from sequins.  It is not necessary to take small shiny circles.  Your choice can fall on large decorative circles that will visually resemble coins.  Take a thin wire and create branches.  String one sequin onto the wire, and then twist the two metal ends.  Similarly, you need to make at least thirty branches.  The barrel can be made of any material.  But it‚Äôs better to go to the park and find a suitable branch.  Cut it and dry it.  After that, you will need to make the base of the tree.  As it is possible to use a cover from a can.  Fill the base with plasticine and strengthen the future tree trunk in it.  Now on the branches you need to string a wire with sequins.  You can additionally decorate the stand with beads. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Picture </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lelong.com.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tree drawing" class="if uuid-2449564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2449564.jpg"></div><p>  Do-it-yourself money tree is not necessary to do volume.  You can well draw a picture for yourself.  It will become a kind of icon to which you will turn for help and thank you for your wealth.  But (like any innermost thing) your picture should not be the subject of general discussion and hang in the most prominent place.  The picture needs to be hung in your room and not tell anyone about what role the drawing plays for you.  How to make a symbolic image?  All money trees look different.  Some people paint them in oil, while others prefer to draw with pencil.  But nevertheless, a person is so arranged that his eyes are always caught in bright colors.  If you want to inculcate the habit of turning to a tree for help, then depict it with bright colors.  The drawing can be both realistic and fantastic.  On the tree you can depict coins or their symbolic images - golden round circles. </p><h2>  Tree of coins </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cambanos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tree of coins" class="if uuid-2449567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2449567.jpg"></div><p>  You have a lot of little things in your wallet and you don‚Äôt know where to put it?  Make a <span>money tree from coins.</span>  Do it yourself with your own hands in just a few hours.  To create a tree, you will need wire, coins, a small piece of wood for the stand and a hand drill.  Take coins in denominations of 10 or 50 cents, make holes in their upper parts.  You can use rubles too, but they will have to be pre-painted with gold paint.  Yes, and rubles are much heavier than a penny, so you have to make branches several times thicker.  Let's start making the money tree with our own hands.  Put each coin on a piece of wire and twist the metal ends.  Then collect branches from scattered coins.  The tree will look magnificent if there are at least five branches.  Twist the branches together so as to make a trunk.  Using glue, we fix the tree on a pre-painted stand.  You can decorate the stand with coins. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Banknote tree </h2><div class="photo" data-original="4viral.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="money tree step by step part 2" class="if uuid-2449650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2449650.jpg"></div><p>  What are the most valuable gifts?  Cash and those made by yourself.  Money tree from notes combines both.  It will be pleasant to receive such an artwork to any your friend or relative.

You will also need a thick stick - this will be the trunk.  Get a plastic pot and fill it with pebbles for stability.  And now let's start making the money tree with our own hands.  The master class will look like this.  Strengthen the tree trunk in the pot, and then place the <span>foam ball</span> on the stick <span>.</span>  Take bills and fan them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="4viral.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="money tree in stages" class="if uuid-2449648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2449648.jpg"></div><p>  Now (as shown in the picture) attach the money to the crown.  If you did not have enough bills to completely fill the ball, you can attach artificial leaves between paper money.  You can decorate the craft with ribbons, beads and even flowers. </p><h2>  Tree of nuts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tree of nuts" class="if uuid-2449574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2449574.jpg"></div><p>  If you like fairy tales, you can partially bring one of them to life.  Make yourself a money tree from nuts.  Of course, of gold.  In order to have prosperity in the house, you have to work hard.  Take the nuts and color them from the can in golden color.  Now take a small foam ball - it will become the basis of the crown.  Use a hot gun to fix the nuts on the ball.  In between small golden balls you can arrange the leaves.  You can make them yourself or use purchased blanks.  Insert a stick into the crown, and the other end of the trunk will need to be strengthened in a pot or in a cup.  The ideal option is to pour concrete into the container.  On concrete, you need to put artificial grass or cut threads.  You can place several nuts under the tree.  Decorate the pot in which you placed the tree, you need in gold color.  To make the container look more interesting, create a bas-relief on it. </p><h2>  Bead tree </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bead tree" class="if uuid-2449583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2449583.jpg"></div><p>  Want to make a beautiful decorative element for your apartment?  Create a money tree from beads with your own hands.  How to do it?  Buy several packs of beads in different shades, but the same color.  How to make leaflets?  Collect 5-7 beads on the wire, and then twist the metal ends so that they fix the resulting sheet.  If you do not want to bother with beads, you can make leaves from large beads or from colorful pebbles.  A beautiful craft will come out too.  When enough leaves are ready, twist them together to form a branch.  And then connect the branches into a bundle.  You can make a trunk from a dry branch.  In this case, the leaves will need to be attached to it.  Money tree made of beads with their own hands made.  It remains to fix it on a stand.  For this purpose, a lid from a jar, as well as any piece of wood, is suitable. </p><h2>  Topiary </h2><p>  Do you like the aroma of coffee?  Then make a money tree-topiary with your own hands from fragrant grains.  To create such a craft, you will need: coffee beans, coins, a foam ball, a stick and any container that can be used as a stand.  One sector of the ball must be sealed with coins.  Now glue the zipper at the two edges of this sector.  All elements can be attached to the glue gun.  It remains to fill the entire space of the ball with coffee beans.  If such a tree seems boring to you, you can use pearl or gold beads as a decor.  Fix the stick (future tree trunk) in the container, and then stick the crown in place.  The tree is ready.  You can decorate it with ribbons and fabric.  Be sure to close the junction of the barrel and the cup.  You can hide this plane with artificial grass or organza. </p><h2>  Paper tree </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper tree" class="if uuid-2449641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2449641.jpg"></div><p>  New Years is soon?  Present a paper money tree to your friends or relatives.  With your own hands, you can make a craft from both real notes and decorative ones.  Both options are quite acceptable.  To make the craft, you will need to find a container that is suitable in size - it can be a plastic pot, a stick - it will play the role of the barrel, and money.  Fasten the stick in the pot.  The easiest way to do this is to fill the container with plasticine.  Now start creating a Christmas tree.  Take the bill and fold it in half.  Wrap the barrel with paper once and secure the layer with thread.  Work must be carried out from top to bottom.  Now we make the second layer of branches.  Fold the bill in half and this time wrap it around the trunk twice.  Each subsequent row should be shorter than the previous one.  You can use money of one denomination or different.  Decorate the Christmas tree with a star, and in the upper part of the container lay a scarf and tie a ribbon. </p><h2>  Applique </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="money tree applique" class="if uuid-2449663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2449663.jpg"></div><p>  Money tree of coins with your own hands can be made in the form of a picture.  You can choose any basis for such work.  For example, take a thick cardboard or use pieces of wood knocked together.  Paint the base black.  Take out the trifle from the wallet and look at its appearance.  If it satisfies you, then you can immediately get to work, if the coins look dirty and gray, you can paint them with a spray can.  Draw based on the silhouette of a tree crown.  Use a glue gun to attach coins to a plane.  The outline needs to draw a silhouette image of the trunk and the ground.  When the main part of the work is ready, you can proceed to the decor.  Fix metal leaves and birds on the tree, and arrange flowers and mushrooms at the roots of the tree. </p>
