It is especially important for grandparents that the gift should be, albeit not expensive, but from the heart, because they love the attention of their grandchildren and grandchildren!  But how to make a grandfather birthday card with your own hands? </p><h2>  Greeting card with hearts. </h2><p>  To close people, we always want to show how we love them.  And grandfather will be very happy about the card with bright hearts, symbolizing our tender feelings.  It will be especially cool if such a postcard is presented by a loving granddaughter, because it‚Äôs quite possible for girls in our society to show their love in public. </p><div class="photo" data-original="edchat.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hearts in the Bank" class="if uuid-2806459" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2806459.jpg"></div><p>  In order to create a beautiful card with original content, we need: </p><ul><li>  double-sided multicolored paper or stickers of different colors (at least 7); </li><li>  paper glue; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  a simple pencil and an eraser; </li><li>  color paper for strips (double-sided); </li><li>  double-sided color cardboard or a thick sheet of double-sided color paper in A4 size. </li></ul><p>  In order to cut hearts, you need to make a pattern.  It can be drawn or downloaded from the Internet and printed.  The width of the hearts should be approximately 6 cm. Next, according to the pattern, 7 hearts must be cut out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now, hearts can be put aside and set about creating a design that will "revive" the internal content of the card "Happy Birthday!"  grandfather do it yourself.  To do this, cut out 2 rectangles from double-sided colored paper.  One - with sides 6X30 cm, the second - 15X5 cm. From that strip, which is more authentic, measure out about half the length and draw a line somewhere in the middle with a simple pencil.  And above - another 6 lines.  In total, you get 7 lines, between which the distance is 1 cm. For these lines, you need to bend the rectangle and glue the hearts to it.  Hearts are attached with rounded edges right up to each line.  We turn the strip with the hearts so that we can see the wrong side, and the hearts are below. </p><p>  Now you need to glue the short one to the top of the long strip so that the letter "T" is obtained.  Thanks to the resulting design, our Greeting Card "Happy Birthday" to grandfather, as it were, comes to life. </p><p>  Now it's time to put the card together.  To do this, you need to bend cardboard or thick colored A4-size paper in half.  We glue our design of stripes and hearts into the inside of the card.  We put the ‚ÄúT‚Äù on the resulting letter ‚ÄúT‚Äù with the hearts inward so that the longer strip itself is bent.  This will allow you to ‚Äúturn‚Äù the hearts from the inside.  You can beautifully trim the edge of the strip, which is longer, and write ‚Äúpull for me‚Äù on it or something like that.  On hearts, you can also write compliments to your beloved grandfather or congratulations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The outer part of the postcard can be decorated with hearts of different sizes and colors and beautifully write ‚ÄúHappy Birthday, Grandfather!‚Äù.  In addition, you can use wrapping, velvet, corrugated or any other beautiful paper to decorate the postcard from the outside, and also dream up about creating a cover. </p><h2>  Postcard with buttons </h2><p>  Grandfather‚Äôs birthday greeting card may not be so difficult to execute, but it‚Äôs also original - one that grandfather wants to keep forever.  To do this, you can use ordinary buttons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Button music" class="if uuid-2806456" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2806456.jpg"></div><p>  Kids, for example, can take buttons of 7 colors of the rainbow and lay out this simple mosaic on the cover.  Older children and even very adult grandchildren can create a beautiful tree from buttons of different shades of brown and green.  From large multi-colored buttons, you can make a bunch of balloons.  For decoration, you can use threads, and ribbons, and colored paper, and drawing elements.  It all depends on the availability of improvised means and imagination of the author of the postcard.  All elements can be glued with ordinary glue, which is suitable for paper. </p><p>  Inside and outside you need to make a beautiful congratulatory inscription. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to make a birthday card for grandfather with figures carved on it? </h2><p>  For a postcard with figures carved on the front, you will need, first of all, thick double-sided A4 paper, a sharp stationery knife and a gel pen or a thin felt-tip pen.  To be sure that everything will turn out as it should, it is better to draw the figures from the beginning with a simple pencil. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Happy Birthday cutted letters" class="if uuid-2806473" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2806473.jpg"></div><p>  Drawn figures (this may be the contour of an animal, flower, etc.) must be drawn very evenly along the contour with a clerical knife and squeeze out the parts that remained inside.  The contours of the figures need to be evenly circled with a pen or felt-tip pen, to draw in the missing elements, and the card is almost ready.  It will be interesting to look at a postcard made of paper, the sides of which are of different colors.  Inside, you must remember to write a congratulation, but not to spoil the cover of the card for your beloved grandfather. </p><h2>  Greeting card with balloons. </h2><p>  Congratulation on paper with balls looks festive and bright.  This is a pretty easy <span>birthday</span> card <span>for grandfather,</span> and even a baby can create it.  To do this, you will need: </p><ul><li>  colored paper; </li><li>  a sheet of colored or white thick paper (if colored, then painted on both sides); </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  glue. </li></ul><p>  A 4-sheet is folded in half.  Inside we write a congratulatory inscription, and on the outside we paste carved multi-colored ovals.  These will be our balloons.  Balls can be only 3 large, and there can be a huge number of small balls.  We also glue the threads where they are supposed to be near the balloons.  They can also be tied with a small ribbon or a bunch of other threads at the ends, gluing this tip also to the surface of the card.  And you can leave them unsecured, and the balls will soar in the air. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmade4cards.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Happy birthday balloons" class="if uuid-2806438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2806438.jpg"></div><p>  You can add volume to such a card by gluing balls not directly onto the surface of the card, but by laying a small piece of foam between the paper and the ball, or by purchasing special stickers for this purpose in the stationery store or in the creative store.  In this case, the volume will probably be uniform.  In addition, balls can be made of fabric, but then they should not be put on foam. </p><h2>  Postcards with pieces of fabric. </h2><p>  You can also decorate any card with pieces of fabric.  For example, you can cut strips from lace for decoration of a frame or light colorful butterflies, or you can stick mushrooms and berries cut from felt on a postcard.  The atlas will make beautiful sails for a boat drawn or assembled from colored paper.  And even a piece of cotton wool can be used as a small cloud, because of which a bright sun peeks out.  In general, there is no strict instruction here.  Love for grandfather and the presence of certain materials themselves will tell you what to portray on a postcard using fabric pieces. </p><h2>  Greeting card with flowers. </h2><p>  There are many options for paper flowers that can be glued to the card.  It can be corny flat, cut out of paper and glued to the cover flowers, and some voluminous options.  How to make a birthday card for grandfather to the youngest grandchildren, and even voluminous? </p><p>  To do this, you need to cut many strips of paper about 15 cm long and 1-1.5 cm wide. You need to connect the strips with the ends together to make them look like droplets.  And glue them in a circle in the form of chamomile petals.  In the center you need to paste a circle of a different color, and make the stems thinner from green paper.  To the ends of the stems you can cut and glue a vase or a pot, or just as if to tie them with a bow from a ribbon. </p><p>  Volume can also be given to other colors by cutting the distance between the petals and slightly bending them.  Thus, you can make roses, and tulips, and other flowers. </p><h2>  Greeting card with tie </h2><p>  Beautiful cards, and most importantly - such men‚Äôs cards are cards with a tie (or bow tie).  For such a congratulation you will need: </p><ul><li>  a sheet of colored paper A 4; </li><li>  tape. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="folksy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Greeting card with tie" class="if uuid-2806457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2806457.jpg"></div><p>  To assemble a shirt from a sheet of paper, you need to put it vertically down face down and bend the side edges to the middle.  Now they need to be bent back and rolled up the upper corners to the fold lines.  They are then folded in half on the wrong side.  It turns out to be bent already and the upper part of the sheet.  Now we turn it to the front side and bend the edges so that small triangles form on top of the sides.  These are the sleeves of a future paper shirt.  We bend a small part of the lower edge, and then - pull the lower edge up so that the lower edge bent slightly earlier is visible.  We form a collar from this edge.  We tie a ribbon under the collar and tie it like a tie or bow tie - as you like.  On the back you can write beautiful words of congratulation.  This is really a very original postcard "Happy Birthday" to grandfather with his own hands. </p><h2>  Postcards in the style of "minimalism" </h2><p>  Men, as a rule, are laconic people, and many grandfathers will like a restrained card in the style of "minimalism". </p><div class="photo" data-original="engagingtoddleractivities.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Minimalism card for grandfather." class="if uuid-2806454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2806454.jpg"></div><p>  To create such a card, it‚Äôs enough to take a beautiful A4-sized sheet printed with a restrained print, bend it in half and stick on the bottom and from the opening edge along a thin colored ribbon or strip of colored paper, and at the intersection of the stripes you can stick a small bow.  Inside, you should write congratulations in even handwriting.  If you take a plain sheet, then on the front side of the card you can write "Happy Birthday!"  or draw discreet patterns if you have artistic talent.  Elementary - a card in a minimalist style can be drawn using simple lines or geometric shapes with the addition of only some small bright accents in the form of a ribbon or button.  Or even just draw a couple of intersecting uneven lines, draw on them something like light bulbs or flags to make garlands and write modestly but stylishly in the corner ‚ÄúCongratulations!‚Äù  Of course, the texture and the color of the paper selected for the background will do their job. </p><h2>  Drawn postcard </h2><p>  In the end, you can simply draw a postcard.  This option, of course, is suitable for the youngest children who want to congratulate their grandfather on a holiday.  How to draw a birthday card for grandfather?  Very simple!  To do this, you can use gouache in different colors and children's hands.  We put paint on the palm of our hand, and the child can so several times in different colors in a random order to leave an imprint of his hand.  You can make a simple pattern.  For example, the sun.  And with merry palms you can cover the card both inside and out. </p><p>  You can draw a card with a more plot pattern with any paints, pencils or felt-tip pens.  Each granddaughter or grandson knows that it will be nice to see their grandfather on a postcard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="narrativasvisibles.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grandpa is the best postcard" class="if uuid-2806443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2806443.jpg"></div><p>  Summing up, I want to say that the most probably simple ways of how to make a card for grandfather on his birthday were considered.  They are available to all, at least adults.  Children, too, but often with the help of adults.  The most important thing in the card is to make the birthday girl like her, to take into account his tastes and features of his character and lifestyle. </p>
