It is divided into many resort areas, one of which is Fethiye.  Here are hundreds of hotels of various categories (from 2 to 5 stars).  The most popular among tourists are four-star hotels, for example, Aes Club Hotel 4 *.  Prices in these hotels are relatively low, and the level of service is impeccable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aes Club Hotel 4 *" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/675726.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fethiye Resort </h2><p>  Fethiye is divided into 2 parts: Oludeniz Bay and the elite area.  In the first you can find hotels at affordable prices, for example, Aes Club Hotel, and in the second part are the most expensive and prestigious hotel complexes in Turkey.  In addition to being a great beach holiday destination, Fethiye is also rich in historical sites.  In antiquity, back in the 5-4 centuries BC, the port of Telmes was located on the site of this city.  He received the name Fethiye in honor of one of the brave sons of the Turkish people - the pilot Fethi Bey. </p><h2>  Oludeniz Bay </h2><p>  As we have already noted, Aes Club Hotel 4 * is located in the Fethiye area, namely in a picturesque bay, the name of which is translated from <span>Turkish</span> as ‚Äúdead sea‚Äù.  The distance from Fethiye to Oludeniz is 15 kilometers.  This lagoon, despite its gloomy name, is simply magnificent.  Here the sea is always calm, there is practically no wind. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get to this town, you must first fly to Antalya or Dalaman, where the nearest international airports are located, and from there go by road to the resort.  If you choose a bus as a vehicle, the journey will cost 10 EUR.  The road runs along the coast, and guests can admire the natural beauties of the local lands.  If you chose Aes Club <span>Hotel 4 *</span> for your stay <span>,</span> which is located in Oludeniz Bay, then when you pay for a transfer from the airport to the hotel, you no longer have to think about how to get from Antalya or Dalaman to the hotel.  Immediately upon arrival, representatives of the hotel will meet you and comfortably deliver you to your place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aes Club Hotel 4 * (Fethiye):" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/675725.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Aes Club Hotel 4 * (Fethiye): general description </h2><p>  This is a club hotel.  It was built in 2011 and covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã6.5 thousand square meters.  This hotel is chosen by tourists with children, as well as people who prefer a quiet and relaxing holiday.  It has everything you need for a comfortable stay for both adults and children.  The hotel-club consists of 5 four-story snow-white buildings, made in the style typical of the Mediterranean countries. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Aes <span>Club Hotel 4 *</span> is located in the village of Ovadzhik near Oludeniz.  It is only 6 km from Fethiye, and 55 km from Dalaman Airport.  Many Russian tourists, however, first fly to Antalya, which is located at a fairly large distance from Fethiye - about 300 km.  By the way, from the hotel to the beach it is also not far - 4.5 km, so for the convenience of tourists there are special buses for delivering vacationers to the beach area, operating on a schedule. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aes Club Hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/675728.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel operates according to the all-inclusive system adopted in many hotels in Turkey.  Several times a day, the restaurant serves a buffet with a large selection of dishes, snacks and drinks.  In the evenings, you can enjoy various Italian dishes on the terrace, as well as many delicious drinks. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  As already noted, the hotel is not located directly on the beach and you need to go there for about 7 minutes.  The Blue Lagoon shore is one of the most well-groomed on the entire coast.  Due to the convenient entrance to the sea, it is popular among families with babies.  All beach equipment - umbrellas, deck chairs, mattresses is provided to hotel guests absolutely free. </p><h2>  Aes Club Hotel 4 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  We should be pleased to note that among the comments of our compatriots about this hotel, most are positive.  Tourists in their reviews praise the level of service, internal routine, living conditions, an interesting excursion program, animation, a varied menu, as well as the friendliness, friendliness and helpfulness of the staff, which is important.  As for the minuses, they include primarily the remote location of the hotel from the seashore, however, tourists who choose this hotel are initially aware of this feature, so this, as a rule, does not scare them.  In addition, thanks to this, the hotel can offer very reasonable prices for high-class service. </p>
