    <h2>  Spa and balneological characteristics </h2><p>  Water is rich in many minerals, especially a lot of bromine.  It is characterized as magnesium chloride-sodium.  Mineralization at the coast is 100 g / l, at the bottom - 280 g / l.  Among trace elements, boron, potassium, cesium, lithium, fluorine and iodine are noted.  The salt at the bottom is precipitated in places (halite, tenardite and mirabilite). </p><p>  In addition to the healing water in the lake, there is also therapeutic mud, which has a unique property - it is very warm.  It heats in places up to 41 degrees, and the deeper, the warmer.  Heat is generated due to the formation of salts at the bottom of the lake. </p><p>  With increasing depth, the temperature of the brine (heliothermy) also increases, which is associated with the concentration of heat in the most dense layers.  A similar phenomenon takes place on the neighboring lakes Khadyn and Kak-Khol, however, it is especially intense on Lake Svatikovo: from the coast - from 23 ° , in the bottom layer (from 1.5-meter depth) - 41 ° . </p><p>  Mud deposits are more developed in the central part of the lake and off the coast of the southeast.  It has a dark gray color, plastic, heavily clogged with sand in some places.  Hydrogen sulfide does not smell very strong.  The thickness of the mud is from 10 cm off the coast and reaches up to 60 cm in the center of the lake. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Lake Swatikovo is a hydrogeological monument of nature on a federal scale.  Water has amazing properties in Lake Swatikovo.  Reviews of travelers who have ever visited it are the most positive both in terms of recreation and in terms of recovery. </p><p>  The Research Institute of Medical and Social Problems of the Republic of Tuva, together with the Research Institute of Physiotherapy and Balneology in 2013-2014, conducted medical and biological research - analyzed spontaneous folk treatments.  As a result, it was proved that treatment on the lake gives a healing effect in diseases of the musculoskeletal system and skin diseases. </p>
