Not everyone knows that it is located in the Volga-Vyatka region.  And more specifically, in the Kirov region.  What is remarkable about this city? </p><h2>  Museum and Exhibition Center </h2><p>  The city has a magnificent museum and exhibition center.  But he appeared relatively recently.  Previously, the museum of local lore was located in this building, which opened its doors to visitors on August 25, 1960. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the city of Kirovo-Chepetsk" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/408411.jpg" width="320"></div>  It was opened thanks to the efforts of the head of the chemical enterprise, Y. F. Tereshchenko.  New exhibits appeared in the museum of local lore and time, but the state did not take part in this.  For this it was necessary to thank the locals.  Also, the museum staff did everything to ensure that it developed.  <span>The enthusiasm of these</span> people is truly amazing.  It is so good that such selfless individuals inhabit Kirovo-Chepetsk!  You see a photo of this city in front of you.

    <h2>  Museum directors moving to a new room </h2><p>  But back to the museum.  What happened to him later?  January 2, 1990, this cultural institution became part of the literary and historical-architectural museum belonging to the city of Kirov, after which it was considered a state.  S.I.Demakov became its leader. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kirovo-Chepetsk photo" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/408416.jpg" width="320"></div>  In the same year, in late autumn, the museum moved to a new large building and reopened its doors to guests.  In 1992, Demakov was replaced by a new director - V.N. Prokashev.  This museum was a truly amazing place where you could get new knowledge and have fun.  But many did not even imagine where the city of Kirovo-Chepetsk is located ...

    <h2>  All Saints Church </h2><p>  Believers in Kirovo-Chepetsk for a long time did not have their own cathedral, until 1988.  People did not have a place where they could gather and pray.  In addition, numerous believers should be registered, and this is what they asked the city executive committee about in the early spring of 1988.  But everything turned out to be not so simple.  In order to register, believers needed to have their own premises, which simply did not exist in the village, therefore, the city executive committee only spread its hands. </p><h2>  Future cathedral building </h2><p>  All that the Orthodox community had at that time was a dilapidated residential building, very similar to a hut.  Believers together began to remodel and decorate this house.  The city of Kirovo-Chepetsk sooner or later had to acquire its own temple. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The foundation of the cathedral and its consecration </h2><p>  In the middle of autumn 1988, a three-tier bell tower made of wood was completely ready.  The altar part was also completed.  The cross, which was planned to be installed on the bell tower, was consecrated.  In addition, the first prayer service was held.  At the beginning of the winter of 1988, Archbishop Chrysanthus consecrated the prayer room in honor of All Saints, and then a liturgy was held.  So the orthodox cathedral was founded in this small town.  By the way, the date of its founding coincided with a significant and memorable event, namely the Baptism of Russia.  Tourists came here to enjoy this temple.  They specifically learned where the city of Kirovo-Chepetsk is located. </p><h2>  New All Saints Cathedral </h2><p>  On the feast of All Saints, July 2, 1989, on the site where the rivers <span>Vyatka</span> and Cheptsa merge, a stone structure began to be erected, in which the new All Saints Cathedral was to be located.  Archbishop Chrysanthus arrived in the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ​​of Kirovo-Chepetsk" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/408419.jpg" width="500"></div>  He consecrated the territory allotted for construction and the foundation stone.  About four years after this event, in the early autumn of 1993, the first dome crowned with a cross began to show off at the cathedral.  Currently, the All Saints Church has become even more beautiful than it was before.  Now he has 11 domes crowned with crosses.  Of course, you can see photos of the cathedral.  But it is better to find out where the city of Kirovo-Chepetsk is located, and come here to see everything with your own eyes.

    <h2>  Sunday School </h2><p>  In 1991, a Sunday school began to function in the All Saints Cathedral.  It is located in a separate building, erected in 1904.  Previously, it was a parish school.  This building has a really rich history.  Currently, children coming to Sunday school get acquainted with many events from the Bible there, and they are also told how to behave in the church.  Some children study icon painting and are engaged in choral singing.  Since 1998, special classes for adults began to take place at Sunday School.  Among other things, there is a library where you can always read religious books. </p><h2>  Index of the city of Kirovo-Chepetsk </h2><p>  Many people want to know the city index to send a letter or parcel there.  It must be understood that he is not alone - there are several of them.  Each district of the city has its own index. </p>
