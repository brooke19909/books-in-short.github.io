Despite the constellation of wonderful actors who played in it, he did not deserve special spectator love, which did not prevent him from becoming popular.  This was facilitated by a romance about junkers to the words of Bulat Okudzhava, which was performed in the film by the main character (actress Tatyana Doronina).  If the generation of the 70s still remembered who a junker was, then this word is unfamiliar to many modern people.  So, who in the Russian Empire was called junkers? </p><h2>  Who is a junker </h2><p>  Junkers in the Russian army before the revolution of 1917 called the military, applying for the first chief officer rank.  Beginning in 1859, the rank of cadets in the army was abolished. </p>

    <h2>  Origin of the word </h2><p>  Like many <span>military ranks</span> in pre-revolutionary Russia, the term "junker" was of German origin.  Meaning, interpretation of the word has an interesting history.  In most European countries, many offspring of impoverished noble families, in order to earn a living, were forced to choose a military career.  In Germany, these soldiers were called young gentlemen (a hint of origin) - Junger Herr.  Over time, the name of the rank, later adopted by the Russians, came from this phrase. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Junkers in different branches of the armed forces </h2><p>  The rank of cadet was used not only in the infantry, but also in other types of troops. </p>

    <p>  In the artillery troops there was the rank of bayonet-junker.  He corresponded to the level of the sergeant's guard and was not an officer rank.  Interestingly, the word ‚Äúbayonet‚Äù so uncharacteristic for artillery at the beginning of the rank was inherited from the name of the Swedish military rank Styckjunkar (gun junker). </p><p>  In the light cavalry until the middle of the XIX century the rank of fan-cadet was spread. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="junker definition" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/1335406.jpg" width="367"></div>  It was an intermediate rank between the non-commissioned officer and the chief officer.  Initially, this title was assigned to applicants for the rank of officer who graduated from a real school or gymnasium, but did not have a special military education.  However, later the fan-cadet became the cadet of military schools or schools and corresponded to the ensign.

This title was specially introduced for the military of noble origin, in order to increase their status over ordinary warriors.  This rank was of a temporary nature, as a rule, a nobleman wore it while he was looking for an officer vacancy corresponding to his origin and education.  Servicemen of non-noble origin could also earn this rank, however, for this they needed to have 10-12 years of service, the rank of non-commissioned officer and pass the required exams.  With the abolition of the cadet rank in the army, the rank of standard-cadet could be received by students of cavalry schools in the rank of non-commissioned officer.  And since 1880, all graduates of such educational institutions remained in the rank of standard-cadet until they received the officer rank. </p><p>  In the Navy, the rank of cadet appeared only in the middle of the nineteenth century.  Only volunteers with higher education who had the right to receive the rank of chief officer could wear it.  By the way, the rank of midshipman, known thanks to the popular television series, was considered higher than the naval cunker. </p><h2>  What is a junker in the German army </h2><p>  In Prussia at the beginning of the 19th century, one of the names of the nobility was the word "junker".  The definition of this word as a military rank arose later. </p><p>  After losing the First World War in the German army, some changes occurred.  In particular, the rank of fan-cadet began to relate to the rank and file, which is why it was quite common.  Everyone could receive it, having served six months and passing the corresponding exams. </p><p>  But in the days of the Wehrmacht, the rank of fan-junker again became the prerogative of the professional military. </p>

    <p>  By the way, the rank of junker was widespread in the SS.  As in the Russian army, he was given to applicants for the first officer rank. </p><p>  After the Second World War, the title of fan-junker became the equivalent of a non-commissioned officer, however, it had a number of advantages over him.  The rank of fan-cadet was assigned to senior military students of German military schools and corresponded to a junior sergeant among cadets of Russian military educational institutions. </p><h2>  Junker title today </h2><p>  Having figured out who the cadet is in the Russian and German armies, it is worthwhile to find out where this title has been preserved today.  The Swedish Armed Forces are still in the ranks of the fan cadet.  Until the seventies of the XX century, this title preceded the Fervalter, after which for ten years it was the highest in its category, exceeding the sergeant. </p><p>  Starting from the 80s and up to 2009, this rank was abolished in all land <span>forces of Sweden</span> , but continued to exist in the navy and in aviation.  And since 2009, this title reappeared in the army of the Swedes. </p><p>  Having figured out who the junker is and what kinds of this title are, you can fully understand the meaning of the romance of Bulat Okudzhava, in particular the words: ‚ÄúSir Junker, who were you yesterday, and today you are all officers.‚Äù  They mean that until recently, cadets were carefree cadet boys at a military school, and now they are urgently promoted to officers and sent to war. </p>
