    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The prices for accommodation in Red Castle Hotel Sharjah 4 * please, first of all, with their stability.  Since summer always reigns here, the tourist season does not stop.  People come here both in July and December, so the administrations of local hotels have no reason to reduce prices to attract them. </p><p>  So, a week of living in the notorious standard room for two people will cost about 45,000 rubles.  But this amount does not include city tax and VAT, each of which is 10%.  Total will have to pay another 9,000 rubles.  Accordingly, the cost of living will be 54,000 rubles. </p><p>  You will also have to pay extra if the guests took the child with them on a trip.  100 AED per day - if he is 2 to 6 years old.  This is at the current rate of about 1,585 rubles.  For accommodation of the ‚Äúextra‚Äù guest over 6 years old (be he at least 7, at least 35) you will have to pay 150 AED (2,380 rubles).  But then for the money they set up another berth in the room.  For babies who are not even two years old, a cot is provided free of charge. </p>

    <h2>  Vacation packages </h2><p>  Most travel enthusiasts, intending to go to Sharjah, at Red Castle Hotel Sharjah 4 *, decide to buy a ready-made tour, and not plan their trip on their own.  This makes some sense, since trips are always cheaper.  Yes, and tickets for direct flights do not need to be searched (which, by the way, is very problematic) - after all, the tour operator is engaged in everything. </p><p>  So, the most inexpensive tour costs around 45-50 thousand rubles for two people.  This price includes: </p><ul><li>  Payment of air tickets in both directions. </li><li>  Taxes and fees (including fuel). </li><li>  7 nights in a standard room. </li><li>  Breakfast for the entire stay. </li></ul><p>  There are, of course, options and more expensive.  The price depends on the tour operator, as well as on what the proposed package includes.  It is logical that a business class and all-inclusive trip will cost 3-4 times more than the economy option. </p>
