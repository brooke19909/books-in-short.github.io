Nice city, France</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city of Nice (France) is another living museum of the country.  It is located literally thirty kilometers from the Italian border, and its banks overlook the Bay of Angels.  Nice is the capital of the <span>Cote d'Azur,</span> where very, very rich tourists come to rest every year.  This area is also famous for its penthouses, fabulously expensive hotels and boutiques. </p><h2>  Location of the city and its layout </h2><p>  This resort city is by no means a typical France.  Nice is divided into two parts, not conditionally, but, one might say, in one strip.  The central point of the city is Massena Square, to the east of which there are old houses, churches, temples, in general, everything that the ancestors of the French left here.  The western part of the city directly rises above the waters of the Mediterranean Sea and is famous for its high-rise hotels, restaurants, towers and new elite neighborhoods.  Even in the very center of Nice, there is a gorgeous promenade - the Promenade des Angles, where every tourist goes in order to take a walk, breathe in the fresh air and enjoy the local scenery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="france nice" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/471249.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Going on a trip to Nice </h2><p>  Each of us knows very well where France is located on the map.  Nice is a city located in the southern part, 960 km from Paris.  If you fly there by direct flight from Moscow (several airlines fly), the journey will take more than 4 hours.  You can also get to Nice from Marseille or Paris.  So, in the air you will spend no more than one and a half hours.  The airport in this resort town is located directly on the coast of the French Riviera.  When the plane lands, do not forget to look out the window to enjoy a beautiful view.  From the airport itself, you can get to the city by bus, which will cost no more than 4 euros, by train (within <span>1 euro),</span> or by taxi - the cost will depend on the distance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nice france sights" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/471252.jpg" width="600"></div>

France, Nice in particular, is located in the tropical Mediterranean climate zone.  Even in the winter months, the air here warms up to 13-17 degrees Celsius, and in the summer the column reaches 30 or more.  It is worth noting that in the summer months it is very hot and dry, as the region is protected from the west by the Alpine mountains.  The sun almost always shines, and the rainy season begins only in the middle of autumn, and ends very quickly.  Water in the sea is always warm - 25-28 degrees.  But it is also nice to come here in the winter months, even though the swimming season is closed.  There is almost never snow here, and the sun warms the earth very well. </p><h2>  We drive around the city.  What is better? </h2>

    <p>  Despite the fact that Nice is the haven of millionaires, a budget tourist can easily move around it.  There is the world famous bus route "Azure Line", which delivers everyone to any part of the city.  A day pass costs only 4 euros.  You can also take a taxi around the city - each trip will cost you no more than 20 euros.  On this type of transport, you can also go to neighboring settlements.  It is only important that you have a map of France with cities, as well as several hundred euros.  You will get to Cannes for 70 euros, and St. Tropez - for more than 250. We can not say that helicopter taxis are one of the most popular modes of transport in the resort, of course, for wealthy tourists.  From a bird's eye view you can enjoy beautiful views: all of Southern France will open before you.  Nice, St. Tropez, Cannes, Antibes - all the best cities will be in full view. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="France Nice Cote d'Azur" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/471250.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Russian monuments of architecture for which Nice is famous </h2><p>  France, whose sights have an extremely interesting history, has always attracted tourists.  So, in due time Anton Pavlovich Chekhov visited this wonderful city.  Then he stayed in one of the local guest houses, which today has turned into an Oasis hotel.  Also in the same building rested Vladimir Lenin.  In honor of both famous personalities of our country, commemorative tablets are hung on the building. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But special attention deserves the Cathedral of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, located in Nice.  This is the largest Orthodox church in Western Europe.  Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolayevich, his family, and also a mass of Russian emigrants are buried here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather france nice" class="if" height="236" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/471246.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kokad cemetery, or Nikolaevskoe: in memory of our ancestors </h2><p>  Once part of the French lands in Nice was bought by the Russian government for the installation of heavy artillery.  A few years later, it was decided to turn it into a cemetery for people who came from the Russian Empire, for whom France became a new home.  Nice is now the burial place of more than three thousand of our ancestors.  Representatives of famous noble families, such as Obolensky, Lazarevsky, Gagarin, Volkonsky and many others, rest here.  The cemetery is also famous for St. Nicholas Chapel, which is another small corner of Orthodoxy in Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in France" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/471248.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Features of local architecture and history </h2><p>  Now consider what its characteristics are characterized by Nice.  France, the sights that are on its territory and cultural heritage - all this represents a living history.  It begins with the campaigns of the Roman emperors.  They founded this city, calling it Cimiez, and built many architectural monuments here.  Today, they are all dilapidated, and looking at the ruins, you can imagine what were once terms, arenas, ancient temples and aqueducts.  Later, all those houses and temples that are still in the Old City were erected.  Walking on it is best without a specific route.  Just walk along the winding streets, inspect each colored house.  Sooner or later you will go to the Place de Gaulle, where the central market will open before you. </p><h2>  Nice city center </h2><p>  Near the central squares, the largest and most beautiful of which is considered to be Rosetti, many chic palaces have been erected.  Among them is the Laskari residence, which was built in the seventeenth century by decree of the Duke of Savoy.  True, at first the facade of the building may seem very modest, but it‚Äôs worth stepping over the threshold, as everything changes dramatically.  Vaulted <span>portals, arches,</span> stucco molding and forging, painted walls and candelabra, chandeliers, candlesticks, prints, chic furniture - the luxuries of this palace simply have no limits!  Now in this building there is an operating museum of musical instruments, where anyone can go.  No less luxurious, the current museum is the Opera of Nice.  There are performances every day, however, getting only in the lobby of this ancient building, you understand that this is a real work of architectural art. </p><h2>  <span>French cuisine</span> in Nice </h2><p>  Gourmet meat dishes, small portions, a passion for sauces and wines - France is famous for these gastronomic features.  However, things are a bit different in Nice.  Along with many Spanish towns, this place was also previously a fishing village.  Since then, there have remained many warehouses in which they decided to open restaurants with traditional fish food.  You can taste fish soup, a sandwich and a salad with tuna, sweet dishes from the marine flora, as well as snacks from seaweed and small inhabitants of the Mediterranean.  Nevertheless, luxurious restaurants with gourmet cuisine are located at the hotels.  Non-guests can also go there, but they will have to pay extra for the entrance. </p><h2>  Paradise for shopaholics </h2><p>  It is known that Nice is famous for its high prices, however, many products, and even clothes here, can be bought for a penny.  A shopping trip here begins with the Kur-Saleya flower market, where various souvenirs and symbols of the region are often sold.  However, on Mondays, there are massive sales of antiques.  Among these products you can find household items, household items, clothes and jewelry.  In comparison with price indicators in other European cities, the cost of such products is simply ridiculous, so you can buy everything you want.  Well, if you can‚Äôt imagine a <span>vacation in France</span> without typical shopping, then go to the CAP-3000 shopping center.  Here you can also buy branded clothes and accessories at low prices. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, one of those countries that must be visited is France.  Nice (the photo can be seen in the article) is its peculiar southern capital, which is constantly filled with tourists eager to swim in the local turquoise water, buy a lot of souvenirs and things at low prices, look at all the beauty and luxury of the city.  It is impossible to get bored here, because just a walk, even on foot, through the streets of this city will give you as many new experiences as sometimes we don‚Äôt get for half a year at home. </p>
