Neither the manufacturer nor the satellite television operator charges for them.

    <h2>  Precautions While Entering BISS Keys </h2><p>  The operation of not only the channel, but also the tuner as a whole depends on how the BISS keys are correctly entered.  This operation must be carried out without haste.  You need to make sure that the numbers that the user enters into his tuner are suitable for this particular brand and this model.  Before confirming the entry of the BISS key, you need to check several times whether it is correctly written.  If everything is correct, then you can click the "OK" button. </p><p>  If the key is entered incorrectly, then all tuner settings are instantly lost.  In no case should you try to correct the mistake yourself, otherwise it will only aggravate the situation.  Instead, it is recommended that you immediately call technical support and call specialists.  They will not only restore all the settings, but also enter the necessary data themselves. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  You can enter your BISS keys yourself.  No special skills are needed for this.  It is important to remember only a few points: the BISS key must be suitable for the make and model of the tuner, and do not rush while entering numbers.  Otherwise, the problem cannot be solved without the intervention of specialists. </p><p>  This article is a small guide on how to insert BISS keys into your tuner.  Following the step-by-step instructions and recommendations, you can independently and quickly complete the entire operation. </p>
