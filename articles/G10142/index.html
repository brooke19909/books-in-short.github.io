    <h2>  Description of the city </h2><p>  Prague is the main tourist Mecca of the Czech Republic, one of the most popular cities in Europe.  Millions of tourists come here every year.  Prague is known for retaining the charm of the Middle Ages.  This is without a doubt one of the most beautiful cities in the world.  It is pleasant to stroll along its ancient streets, where completely different architectural styles are mixed, to visit historical places inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, in particular Charles Bridge, Czech Castle and many others. </p><h2>  When is the best time to relax in Prague </h2><p>  Holidays in the Czech capital are good at any time of the year, but here in the summer and during the Christmas holidays there is no crowding.  Locals joke that here at this time there are more tourists than Czechs.  Actually, speaking in the season is easier here in English, even if you know Czech, because when you meet a person on the street, you will most likely see a tourist than a local one.  Prague in September and October is beautiful and charming.  Tourists at this time becomes a little less, and nature is buried in the enchanting colors of golden autumn.  In November, the amount of precipitation in the Czech Republic increases, therefore it becomes damp and dank.  But sunny days in November are not uncommon.  Winter in the Czech Republic is also very interesting, since the ski resorts begin to work here.  In Prague itself, it is not very interesting in winter, because many castle-museums are closed at this time.  But here Christmas is very fun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also interesting to go to the Czech capital in March-April, to European Easter. </p><h2>  How to get to Prague </h2><p>  Almost all major European carriers have flights to the Czech capital.  However, flights from Moscow are not so many.  Aircraft "St. Petersburg - Prague" also fly not very often.  The bulk of traffic between Russia and the Czech Republic is carried out by Aeroflot, Czech Airlines Czech Airlines, and more recently, Rossiya Airlines. </p><p>  A direct flight from Moscow to the Czech capital will cost 9,000 rubles, and most often it costs about 13,000-14,000. Tickets for the St. Petersburg ‚Äì Prague route are usually several thousand more expensive. </p><p>  From the airport to the Start 3 * hotel, the easiest way is to take a taxi, but you can also use public transport.  It will cost less, but you will have to do a few transfers. </p>

    <h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  There is not much entertainment in Start 3 * in Prague, because people come to the Czech capital not to spend time in rooms.  Hotel "Start" can offer its guests a quality vacation after an active day.  In the warmer months, guests can spend time in the evening on the outdoor terrace, savoring delicious beer or excellent Czech wine and admiring the surroundings.  In winter, such "gatherings" are held in the hotel bar.  In addition, in the winter months in Start 3 * ski, sled and skate rentals are available.  That, perhaps, is all that you can entertain yourself in this hotel. </p><h2>  Who is this hotel suitable for? </h2><p>  All tourists can be divided into two groups: </p><ol><li>  Those who consider the hotel to be solid and quite suitable for their money.  Such tourists, as a rule, came to see exactly Prague.  For them, a hotel is nothing more than a place to sleep, relax in between excursions, as well as have a good time in the evenings.  For such cases, the hotel in question is quite suitable.  Good bar, delicious hearty breakfasts, normal distance from the center.  Tourists are quite happy.  Unless some say that it is not too convenient to get to the center by two modes of transport. </li><li>  Those who are used to relax on the all inclusive system.  For such a hotel, the Start 3 * may seem too simple.  Indeed, the furniture here is rustic, and the color of the walls is a little boring. </li></ol>
