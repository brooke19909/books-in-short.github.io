Presenting the new model of the device at one of the European technology exhibitions, Lenovo showed the audience both of its modifications.  They differed at first glance only in size.  The first one had an 8-inch screen, the second one - 10. Users and experts who saw the Lenovo Yoga tablet being presented (photos of the device are presented below) did not see a significant conceptual difference. </p>

    <p>  However, after the experts got acquainted with the characteristics of each, it turned out that the larger device is more technologically advanced.  It used, in particular, the innovative IPS-matrix.  The device with an 8-inch display, in turn, was much inferior to the "big brother" in terms of screen characteristics.  Therefore, it was completely clear what kind of feedback on the market would be received by the brand that announced the Lenovo Yoga tablet.  The reviews of experts who saw completely unjustified ‚Äúdiscrimination‚Äù between the 8- and 10-inch versions of the device were sometimes completely unflattering. </p>

    <p>  Apparently, taking into account the criticism, shortly before the launch of devices on the market, Lenovo caught on in time.  The new Lenovo Yoga tablet in the "small" version would be equipped with the same matrix that is installed on the "big" one.  Therefore, the technological differences between the two tablets were minimized.  But they are.  And today we will try to find them.  What are the features of each version of the device?  What are the competitive advantages of each of them?  Which of the design (or hardware) components make the devices unlike similar solutions? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design and dimensions </h2><p>  In terms of appearance, both tablet models have an interesting feature.  In its design, a support element is uncharacteristic for most such devices.  It allows you to set the tablet in different positions.  Another feature is a cylindrical shaped battery.  If we talk about the "small" version of the device, then, according to experts, this tablet is less than its other counterparts like the iPad Mini, which is considered in terms of design "exemplary" for the 8-inch Androids. </p>

    <p>  The case of both devices is made of glossy silver plastic.  The supporting element described above is made of aluminum.  The screen is covered with a reliable layer of durable glass.  Case materials, experts say, were selected very well.  The dimensions of the devices, experts admit, are well balanced.  The Lenovo Yoga Tablet 8 tablet has a length of 213 mm, a width of 144, a thickness of 7.3.  "Formula" for the large version of the tablet: 261 x 180 x 8.1 mm. </p><p>  There are three buttons on the tablet case.  The first two control the volume level, they are located on the side.  The third is responsible for powering the device, its location is the battery area.  On the front side of the screen is an additional camera.  The main one is at the back, also in the battery area.  Conveniently, the micro-SD flash connectors, as well as the micro-SIM card, are brought out.  You can open them by gently pushing the supporting element.  Under the screen are voice speakers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Table Curtsy </h2><p>  Using the support element-stand, as we said above, the tablet can be arranged in a variety of ways.  This kind of flexibility of the device, in fact, led to the name - Yoga.  There are three main modes of fixing the device to the surface.  Firstly, this is the "awning", when the tablet is located on the table with extended support element.  In this position, it is most convenient to type on it.  Secondly, it is a "stand" when the tablet is located vertically relative to the plane of the table.  In this mode, it is convenient to watch video on it.  Thirdly, it is "hold" when the device is conveniently located in the hands of the owner like a paper magazine. </p>

    <p>  Interestingly, each mode is recognized by the device, and as soon as this happens, a certain backlight turns on.  With "hold", in particular, warm yellowish tones are activated.  When the tablet becomes an "awning", then the shades turn into cold.  When the device operates as a "stand", illumination of a mixed color is turned on.  However, all the color shades of the backlight can be adjusted manually. </p><p>  The above design feature of the tablet prompted to leave users who were fortunate enough to buy a Lenovo Yoga tablet, the most positive reviews about the know-how. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  As we said above, the manufacturer equipped the 8-inch tablet with a modern IRS-matrix.  However, as experts say, her resolution is not very large - 1280 by 800 pixels.  At the same time, experts characterize the quality of the picture as excellent.  The screen is clearly visible even at large viewing angles, it is very bright, the color reproduces in natural and rich colors. </p>

    <p>  The Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 tablet has the same technological characteristics, supported by an increased resolution - 1920 by 1200 pixels.  In one of the latest modifications of the device, namely <span>Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10</span> HD +, technologies are applied that provide a very high density of dots on the screen, thereby achieving almost perfect picture quality. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The 8-inch tablet has a processor with four cores and a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  The amount of RAM is 1 GB.  This is enough, experts believe, to solve most everyday tasks: surfing the Internet, watching videos, listening to songs and launching resource-less games (such as, for example, GTA Vice City).  The tablet is equipped with a built-in flash memory of 16 GB (13 actually available).  There is support for additional micro-SD cards. </p><p>  In the "large" version of the device, the processor is more powerful - 1.6 GHz.  Therefore, we can expect that the tablet will ‚Äúpull‚Äù the game a little more demanding than GTA.  There are as many built-in flash memory in some modifications of the 10-inch device as there are in the ‚Äúyounger‚Äù model, there are also those on the disk - 32 GB. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The main camera of the 8-inch device has a resolution of 5 megapixels, an additional 1.6.  The first is equipped with an autofocus function.  The 10-inch tablet is equipped with a more powerful main camera, its resolution is 8 megapixels.  Additional - also 1.6.  The experts did not raise significant complaints about the quality of the images.  However, as some of the experts note, the camera is far from the most important <span>characteristic of the tablet,</span> and therefore its capabilities are not among the critical ones.  Approximately in the same vein, users who have studied the Lenovo Yoga tablet speak in the same way.  Owner reviews to a very small extent reflect people's interest in the quality of the camera. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The device is equipped with two batteries.  The manufacturer does not publish information about the battery capacity of the 8-inch tablet, but reports in their description that the maximum battery life that the user can count on is 18 hours.  Expert tests showed that Lenovo's promises generally reflect the true state of affairs.  With an average intensity of operation of the device, the batteries provided about 14-15 hours of tablet operation without recharging.  Moreover, experts say, in standby mode (or minimal use - for example, to quickly view mail on the Internet), the device can work up to a week.  Experts acknowledge that in terms of battery capacity, this device is one of the leading solutions on the market.  There is a version that this device from the point of view of battery resources is also the best Lenovo tablet among all the lines. </p>

    <p>  But regarding the battery of the 10-inch version, there is information about the capacity.  And these numbers are impressive.  The battery capacity of the "large" modification of the device is 9000 mAh.  And if in the "small" version this indicator is comparable, then the excellent results in terms of measuring the battery life achieved by experts are understandable.  Needless to say, the tests of the 10-inch tablet, conducted by experts, once again confirmed the thesis that this line of devices from Lenovo is one of the best on the market. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Both tablets support Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, in some versions equipped with 3G-modules.  These are absolutely standard specifications for the devices of which the Lenovo Yoga tablet belongs.  The experts did not cause any complaints about the operation of the wireless device interfaces. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Both versions of the Android tablet, supplemented by a proprietary branded shell, are controlled.  Experts note that in appearance its interfaces are similar to iOS in version 7.  In particular, there is no ‚Äúclassic‚Äù menu for Android platforms for selecting applications.  Shortcuts for launching programs are located on separate working screens or in folders.  However, there are a large number of possibilities to customize the interface to individual preferences. </p>

    <p>  There are relatively few pre-installed applications, experts say.  There is only a "Gallery", a scheduler, a browser, a program for reading mail, "Maps" and a regular video player.  However, experts say this is more of a plus, since a user who is likely to need additional applications has an incentive to explore more features of the Google Play catalog and its analogues. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  What do people who buy a Lenovo Yoga tablet write?  What kind of reviews are most common?  It is expected that the first thing that many tablet owners in both versions pay attention to is the battery life of the device.  Many users in vivid detail talk about how they traveled from one edge of Russia to another, and the tablet‚Äôs battery did not even think of landing.  The owners of the devices also note the high performance of the devices.  Of course, the "yoga" concept, which provides for the location of the tablet in the three modes, which we talked about, earned the highest marks.  What else caused positive feedback from users who decided to put on the reviews characterizing the Lenovo Yoga tablet?  The price of the device.  Which is more than democratic given the original design and powerful battery.  Depending on the particular online store, a tablet can be bought for 10-14 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Expert Summary </h2><p>  The specialists who tested the device were impressed by studying almost every aspect of the device: appearance, characteristics, performance.  According to experts, the tablet has every chance to occupy a solid niche in its segment.  Which is not surprising: the Chinese brand tried to give the device competitiveness in several components at once: design, battery life and the overall level of quality of the device. </p>
