The best manufacturer in this area is considered and will be considered Apple for a long time, however, even they still have room to move.  After all, there is a problem common to smartphones of all companies that Apple has not solved.  It‚Äôs about discharging the battery too quickly.  For almost ten years, since the release of the very first iPhone, users of Apple products have been waiting for the device to finally be able to live without recharging for at least three days with active use.  You can, of course, forget about accessing the Internet and applications, use a smartphone exclusively for calls, in which case the device‚Äôs battery will last quite a long time, but why then get such an expensive multifunctional smartphone? </p><p>  Fortunately, a solution was found with the advent of portable batteries or, as they are called in the original, Power Bank.  Such "banks" come in a variety of shapes and sizes, with and without additional functions, but they are all created with one purpose in mind - to serve your mobile device.  Now in a situation where you urgently need a connection, and your smartphone has treacherously sat down and there are no sockets nearby, a portable <span>charger for iPhone</span> 5 will come to the rescue. </p><p>  How to choose the best model, if there are a lot of them on the market now?  To do this, consider the best options. </p><p>  So, a list of the best portable chargers that are perfect for your iPhone. </p>

    <h2>  Mophie juice pack air </h2><p>  Many do not dare to invest in an external battery, because they are confused by the insufficient compactness of some models or the need to connect to them through a cable, which makes it uncomfortable to hold a smartphone in your hand and simultaneously charge it.  Especially for this, Mophie Juice Pack Air, a portable charger for iPhone 5 in the form of a case, has long been released. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  That's right: this device is simply worn on your smartphone and serves as a cover (there are even models made of more durable material that <span>will protect the phone</span> from falling), and when it becomes necessary to recharge, with a simple touch of a button it turns into a portable battery. </p><p>  The main disadvantage is the <span>battery capacity:</span> only 1700 mAh.  About the same in the battery of the iPhone 5s itself.  The capacity of the Mofi battery is enough for about one full charge of the iPhone.  There are much more powerful models, but they are not so convenient. </p><p>  Otherwise, everything is in order with this power bank.  Thought out all the smallest details.  In addition to a neat cutout for the camera and speakers, there are also ‚Äúbackups‚Äù of all buttons on the case.  The kit also has a special adapter for headphones. </p><p>  In addition, Mophie is one of the few companies officially authorized to use Apple technology, so you will find the Lighting plug on the bottom of the case.  No need adapter for iPhone. </p>

    <h2>  Anker Astro Pro2 </h2><p>  This portable charger for iPhone 5s in its characteristics is the exact opposite of the previous model.  Firstly, it is distinguished by its size: the device is quite large, you can‚Äôt call it compact at all - 4.4 x 6.6 x 0.6 inches.  And it weighs a kilogram.  But the battery capacity is truly impressive - as much as 20,000 mAh.  This is enough to charge your iPhone up to 10 times before the external battery sits down. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The device implements special PowerIQ technology.  It allows you to determine the type of device to which Anker is connected, which significantly increases the charging speed.  A small display will tell you the current charge level. </p><p>  Not the most convenient model for carrying, and the price bites, but copes with its direct responsibilities with a bang. </p>

    <h2>  RAVPower RP-WD01 Wireless Wi-Fi-Disk </h2><p>  Finding this model is not so easy right now, but it's worth talking about it.  Perhaps this is the most versatile portable charger for <span>iPhone 5. Reviews</span> of it very flattering, so pay attention to the "pauerbank". </p><p>  The battery capacity is not the most impressive - 3000 mAh.  But in our case, this is not important, because with just one click, RAVPower turns into an access point for wireless Internet.  In principle, if you often use it to transfer Wi-Fi, it is unlikely to charge your smartphone with it, very often the external battery will drain. </p><p>  The wireless capabilities of the device are not limited to wireless Internet transmission.  It can also read SD memory cards, for this there is a special connector in its case. </p><p>  It should be noted the dimensions of this model.  Powerbank is as small as it could have been, providing it with all the extra features. </p>

    <h2>  Jackery Mini 3200 mAh </h2><p>  Finally, we move on to a truly compact and miniature model.

In addition, the model will pleasantly surprise you with its low price.  In general, there is nothing more to say about her. </p><h2>  CHOETECH Flashlight Power Bank </h2><p>  Fans of travel and all kinds of extreme hiking will appreciate this portable charger for iPhone 5, because it has a built-in flashlight.  The charger is not afraid of almost no falls. </p><p>  As for the main function, CHOETECH Flashlight copes with it very well.  Again, for its compact size.
