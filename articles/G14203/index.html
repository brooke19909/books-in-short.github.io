Various companies through their sites offer a fee for certain actions.  Depending on the complexity of the proposed task, the final income of the person who performs such work also varies. </p><p>  There is nothing surprising in this, so you probably already knew about the existence of such services.  They operate in various fields, so any specialist can receive their Internet earnings. </p><p>  On the other hand, in addition to really paying resources, there are also a lot of imitators - sites that create visibility by imitating a real company.  The goal of such projects is completely different, and we will talk about one of them in the framework of this article. </p><h2>  Online fraudsters </h2><p>  Surely you have heard about how common the practice of cheating on the Internet is.  The conditions for scammers are simply perfect - online to find the real person who lured your money, without the involvement of government agencies, is simply insignificant.  In addition, the operations by which users are deceived can be scaled in every way, repeating again.  Therefore, the only way to protect yourself is simply not to mess with projects that can deceive you. </p><p>  Today we‚Äôll talk about one of the sites that conducts its fraudulent activities for a fairly long period of time.  This is supposedly a payment system <span>I-Cash.in.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> about him show that for several months the users of this project were misled, because of which they lost their real money, trying to earn virtual ones.  We will tell you more about this a bit further - about what the essence of fraud was and how fraudsters urged people to transfer their funds to them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In the meantime, let's start with the general characteristics of the I-Cash.in resource.  Feedback from real participants in the system will provide an opportunity to fully reveal the issue of such earnings, and will also warn the following victims that they will not contact this site. </p><h2>  Project concept </h2><p>  The site referred to in today's review is still operational.  This means that now he can attract new members, promising them additional income online.  In fact, we don‚Äôt know how many people were ultimately deceived by them - but the numbers of money earned by the administration are probably very large.  On average, each project requires an amount of about one hundred dollars.  And the advertising campaign of this site was really large-scale - some custom-made articles and publications about it can still be seen. </p><p>  So what is <span>I-Cash.in?</span>  <span>Reviews</span> note that this resource is presented as a payment system or electronic wallet that accepts payments in various online currencies.  On the main page, in confirmation of these words, you can find a <span>list of payment systems</span> that can (supposedly) be exchanged and stored in this system. </p><p>  Here you can also see a set of words - a description of the resource in English.  It says that we have before us an international, advanced, large, world-famous system that allows payments to be made ... In general, frankly speaking, this information does not carry any significant semantic load. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  As the reviews describing I-Cash.in show, the appearance of the site (its design, images, text) is copied from another similar resource.  The meaning of that project resembles our object exactly. </p><h2>  Essence of the work </h2><p>  You will say: ‚ÄúThis is a payment system!  How can you make money on it? ‚Äù  We answer: it‚Äôs very easy, using the desire of people to receive money without much effort and a fairly simple scheme, which many users pecked at. </p><p>  On behalf of the administration of this resource, work was offered on other sites.  A person had to deal with the distribution of funds in different accounts.  That is, his task was to send different amounts of money to separate accounts in different payment systems (a total of about 150 pieces).  The work is simple, but very routine and monotonous;  they promised to pay for it 0.5% of the amount of funds spent by the system participant. </p><p>  Since each of the transactions was from $ 50 to $ 150, it is easy to understand that in a couple of hours of such a distribution a person could earn $ 200-300.  Very good, especially when compared with rates that are set on other types of earnings online.  And these actions, as described on the site http://I-Cash.in (the reviews we were looking for), can be carried out from anywhere;  the main thing is to have an Internet connection and access to a tablet computer or laptop.  Looks like a dream job, doesn't it? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Conditions </h2>

    <p>  And the participant http://I-Cash.in, flattered by the easy money, (we just read the reviews of those deceived) started a hectic career.  People did not complain about the conditions for fulfilling the task, since it was really easy. </p><p>  You opened an office in the system, which you had to go to.  In it, for the employee, several accounts were set up (which actually never existed in real payment systems).  They were supposed to transfer money to them (probably it was a technical game site).  The man thought that he was really engaged in the distribution of real funds and applied maximum zeal to this, although, in fact, no one allowed him money.  Sending non-existent money also had to be done in strict order, according to the instructions.  All this continued until a participant in the system earned an amount that could be withdrawn to a real account from I-Cash.  Reviews of the company show that it was here that we should expect the biggest catch. </p><h2>  Payment </h2><p>  After a certain amount is accumulated in the participant‚Äôs internal account, he can withdraw it in any payment system convenient for him.  True, this is permitted only after a number of conditions are met. </p><p>  Firstly, you need to pay $ 95 for account activation (supposedly necessary for further cooperation with the system. Secondly, a person is also asked to pay $ 200 for issuing a bank card for which he will receive his funds. </p>

    <p>  Attention!  The trick was that it was impossible to take the indicated $ 295 into the account of the money that was brought during this time.  Otherwise, the whole fraudulent trick would come to naught.  This was what should be taken into account by those who really sent their funds.  As the reviews about I-Cash about the company show, many understood the trick - and simply abandoned this idea.  However, there are even those who continued to work and believed that they could make money here.  Well, and, of course, some of the workers still sent the money to the specified details, expecting to hit the big jackpot.  As you can guess, after this, the representatives of the site stop communicating. </p><h2>  Demand </h2><p>  Paying $ 295 is really a serious condition that fraudsters have set.  Probably, this money was really paid to them by a large number of people, because otherwise they could set a fee of $ 45 or $ 25, hoping to get more transfers.  But no, a high price threshold was deliberately set here to increase the proceeds of criminals. </p><p>  Given the anonymity of payments on the Internet and despite the security of various payment systems, it is not yet possible to identify where the funds went and how they disposed of it in the future.  However, the site owners do not need to keep it on any Indonesian hosting, and send the accounts to an offshore bank operating outside of any jurisdiction.  Therefore, only a very naive user can hope for a refund. </p><p>  Describing our I-Cash (international payment service), reviews note that many have filed a complaint with the police, but you also should not expect that this will help. </p><h2>  Cheating </h2><p>  Very popular on the Internet is a similar technique.  It is used by various sites for earnings, which operate in various fields.  It can be, for example, a platform for trading binary options, a site with polls, a news resource.  In fact, the same ad could be seen on the pages of simple portals.  Its scheme is simple - to make it appear that the participant receives a certain benefit (in the form of funds already earned by him) that require the return of a part of real money (to make a contribution of $ 295).  Logically, the same amount could be subtracted from what the user expects, but the company does not do so, referring to some fictitious obstacle.  People who believe in I-Cash (international payment service), of course, do not read reviews - and simply trust their funds, expecting to get much more in return.  At this stage, the scammers completed their task, after which they can only disappear. </p>

    <p>  As for the I-Cash.in resource, site reviews, traffic analysis and the presence of the resource in Google‚Äôs issuance confirm that it continues to function.  This means that at the moment, despite the mass of complaints, no one can close the resource.  And scammers continue to use their scheme.  So, the <span>payment system I-Cash.in,</span> reviews of which are still not read by as many people as we would like, is still deceiving.  And naive people continue to give their money into the wrong hands. </p><h2>  Foreign scam </h2><p>  In fact, not only the Russian Internet segment has such fraudulent sites.  Payment system I-Cash.in, the reviews of which we have provided, has its own foreign counterparts.  And by the number of them much more.  This is explained by higher solvency of citizens of other countries.  As verification and reviews on the I-Cash.in website show, the overwhelming majority here are residents of the CIS countries.  Whereas there are scammers whose audience affects visitors from the USA, Great Britain, and Europe.  It is easy to understand that such resources also lure more money. </p><p>  For example, many are wondering what constitutes a Quick Cash System site - is it a divorce or is it true?  Reviews about the resource are presented in English, so many of our compatriots do not know how to contact former clients of the fund.  Because of this, problems arise.  Google Translate can help. </p><p>  All foreign forums, blogs and websites write about how Quick Cash System deceived everyone.  Reviews show that this site offers its own binary options earning scheme.  The system is based on the fact that the user must purchase a guide that will tell you about a win-win earnings strategy.  As proof of this, a quick video is posted on the <span>Quick Cash</span> website <span>(reviews of</span> people confirm this) in which the website‚Äôs services are advertised by a successful wife and mother who allegedly use the method described on the website and earn millions of dollars. </p><h2>  Forex Trading Segment </h2>

    <p>  In general, in the field of "Forex" should be extremely careful.  And now we are talking not only about the Quick Cash System (a divorce or the truth - reviews have already answered this question).  There are a large number of different brokerage companies, trading platforms and other projects that can easily lure your money.  To prevent this, check the reputation of each resource according to the recommendations of other participants - and so you can definitely avoid scammers. </p><h2>  Site network </h2><p>  In general, we are not only interested in describing scam with Quick Cash reviews.  Fraud is a wider phenomenon, since anyone can launch hundreds of sites similar to the heroes of today's article.  And to guess which one is a real successful project, and which one has beautiful advertising and deception, is very difficult.  You need to understand the scheme of work, and not the appearance or attractiveness of a project.  Only in this way will you be able to determine certain scam by their appearance, without thinking about whether we really have a working, successful resource with which we could earn, or another scam. </p><h2>  be careful </h2><p>  Anyway, be careful.  If you are offered something very profitable, think about it: why would anyone need it.  What will be the benefit of the organizers of a project if you take part in their program?  And what guarantees that you will not be thrown? </p><p>  As people‚Äôs <span>comments</span> criticizing <span>the Quick Cash System system</span> , always think a little further, going beyond the boundaries of a beautiful advertising wrapper.  It may very well be that tomorrow you will be offered to take part in some new project that seems too tempting to refuse.  Think about our article and remember the people who sent $ 295 for a card and activation, don‚Äôt understand what. </p><p>  The best thing is to work on proven and stable projects that offer the real value of certain services.  Whether it be freelance, website creation, Internet arbitration - there are a lot of those where you can get money.  All of them are available to each of us, subject to the availability of free time, desire and Internet access.  The main thing is to choose a permanent lesson for yourself and earn real money without thinking about some obscure programs and sites where you are supposedly paid too much for strange tasks to make it more attractive to the user. </p>
