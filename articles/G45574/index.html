    <p>  The buyer will be able to buy an apartment that already has a kitchen, electric stove, plumbing, faucets, tiles in the kitchen and bathroom and a laminate on the floor.  Also, in each apartment in the Park Lakes residential complex, interior and exterior doors, two-chamber metal-plastic windows are installed.  The buildings in the microdistrict are located in such a way that residents can enjoy the picturesque view of the park and ponds without leaving the walls of their choir. </p><p>  Apartments ("Park Lakes") are presented in several layout options.  In particular, you can buy apartments for finishing (plaster, screed, plumbing, installed electricity and heating), and there is also the opportunity to buy a renovated apartment.  Ceiling height is 2.7 meters.  The houses include passenger, freight and emergency (fire) elevators from Otis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Naturally, the question of what will result in the purchase of housing in the Park Lakes microdistrict cannot but arouse interest. </p>

    <p>  The prices for apartments here depend on a number of factors: area, number of storeys, the type that opens from the window, the availability of repairs, etc. Naturally, a lot of things determine the financial capabilities and wishes of customers.  In already completed properties, the average cost of apartments is approximately the following: a 1-room apartment (area - 48 sq. M) costs 1 200 000 hryvnias, a 2-room apartment (area - 70 sq. M) costs 1 700 000 hryvnias, and for 3 -room apartments (area - 95 sq. m) will have to lay out 2 150 000 hryvnia. </p><p>  One way or another, but renovated housing in Park Lakes has risen in price compared to last year.  If earlier for the finishing of 1 square meter it was necessary to pay 700 hryvnias, now this figure has not only increased, but also converted into currency.  For repairs today, the buyer will pay about $ 150 per square meter.  Thus, in LCD "Park Lakes" apartment prices do not become cheaper. </p><h2>  Calculation Procedure </h2><p>  There are several ways to purchase housing in a new neighborhood.  The company "Intergal-Bud" offers potential buyers by installments.  In this case, you can make money both until the end of construction, and within 12 months after the house was put into operation.  The minimum contribution is 10% of the transaction amount. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The Internet portal of the developer company contains comprehensive information on the conditions of the purchase of an apartment.  There are no hidden additional allowances to the cost of housing.  The infrastructure development is pleasantly striking to the inhabitants of the new microdistrict: all the necessary institutions are nearby, although you have to go to Kiev for major purchases. </p><p>  Buyers are also satisfied that all the nuances and subtleties associated with payment and paperwork are clarified and negotiated without any delays. </p><p>  If the client accepted the work, received the keys and documents of title, and after he had complaints about the quality of the builders' work, they are recorded on paper, and then the discovered defects are eliminated.  Employees of the construction company try to solve all problems in a civilized way: if they promised something, they will definitely call back and inform.  It also bribes that apartment owners are given the right to independently install individual heat meters, which significantly saves the family budget. </p><p>  But the foremen and masters, unfortunately, do not always promptly eliminate defects and flaws.  Customers had to remind them repeatedly to correct deficiencies properly.  Also, some owners are indignant at the fact that the built houses are not commissioned on time, as a result of which it was necessary to postpone the move for several months.  Another minus from the owners of new apartments is poor-quality sound insulation in apartments.  Some residents also complain that Victory Park is not always safe, because sometimes people with an asocial lifestyle walk there. </p>
