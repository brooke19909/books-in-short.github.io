The northern capital at one time became the founder of the spread in the country of the latest and very promising mode of transport.  Despite the fact that many years have passed since the birth of the railway, St. Petersburg is still at the forefront of the innovative movement in terms of expanding and creating new routes of communication, as well as improving their infrastructure.  A vivid proof of this is the Ladoga station. </p><h2>  History of creation: Ladoga station, St. Petersburg </h2><p>  Ladoga Station is today a complex transport <span>hub in St. Petersburg.</span>  It all started with a small station, the opening of which took place in 1914. Initially, it was called "Yablonovka", as well as the neighboring village.  A little later, the station was renamed according to the ownership of the lands owned by Prince Dolgoruky, to Dolgorukov‚Äôs Cottage. </p>

    <p>  Already in the mid-sixties of the last century, the idea was born of creating a new node on the railway.  This thought was prompted by the congestion of existing capacities.  However, the plan was not implemented for bureaucratic, political, and financial reasons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Implementation of the idea </h2><p>  Ladoga station was opened on May 25, 2003. It became the sixth in the city and the only transit railway junction.  The Ladoga station was opened on the occasion of the centenary of the Northern capital.  However, after the official launch of work on the refinement of some infrastructure facilities were continued.  The haste of the events led to the incident with the locomotive (he received damage to the side due to non-observance of the distance between the apron and the extreme rail).  However, the youngest station in the city quickly got rid of flaws and became a reliable and safe transportation hub. </p><p>  Ladoga <span>Station (St. Petersburg)</span> was designed by architect N.I.  Yavein.  Today, this transport hub, meeting the requirements of high modern speeds, has significant reserve potential. </p>

    <h2>  Specific traits </h2><p>  Ladoga station, unlike other similar structures of the Northern capital, performs a transit function.  This refers to the most popular destinations in Murmansk and Helsinki from Moscow.  The track capacity of this transport hub is also unique.  It consists of an upper and lower level. </p><p>  Ladoga station is considered the most ‚Äúsmart‚Äù in Europe.  It is a huge building, in which there are numerous services, facilities for passengers and railways.  Moreover, all this was placed in a small area thanks to the original solution that the architect found. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Ladoga Station (St. Petersburg) was built in a difficult urban situation.  The small size of the site did not allow the construction of the usual "coastal" type of building.  In order to preserve the transit movement of trains at this railway junction, a carefully thought-out three-story building was constructed.  It combined the functions of a station-tunnel and a station-bridge.  A transport hub can simultaneously accept twenty-six pairs of trains that travel in long directions, and fifty pairs of suburban trains.  At the same time, the station is equipped with state-of-the-art electronic equipment.  The operation of all equipment is designed to increase safety, comfort, as well as the quality of passenger transportation. </p>

    <p>  The scheme of the Ladoga station is simple.  This complex consists of two structures: the one where local trains stop, as well as the station, designed for long-distance trains.  The above buildings are located both on the aboveground and on the underground level. </p><h2>  Lower tier </h2><p>  The underground train station, located in the underground, can be reached by escalator.  This moving walkway runs downhill from a subway station above the ground.  The suburban station, built at a depth of fifteen meters, is equipped with ticket offices for the sale of tickets.  Turnstiles for access to electric trains are also installed here.  Not far from them is a waiting room that communicates with the platforms.  From the lower tier you can get to the metro station "Ladoga", which is underground. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Middle level </h2>

    <p>  An escalator leads to the upper tier of the Ladoga station, which works on the rise.  Its beginning is located at the ground lobby of the subway station. </p><p>  Almost the entire space of the upper part of the Ladoga station is occupied by the Light Hall.  Waiting for the arrival of their train, passengers can enjoy beautiful views of St. Petersburg through its transparent dome.  In the Light Hall there are ticket offices working around the clock, mail and left-luggage offices, a car rental service and much more.  There is a car platform in front of the long-distance train station.  It is located <span>15.3 m</span> above ground level.  It can accommodate one hundred personal cars and taxis at the same time. </p><p>  Remarkable is the architectural solution of the station.  The construction of iron and glass is literally striking in its lightness.  It seems that it soars above the ground. </p><p>  At the station, one of the branches of the Baltic Bank operates.  In it you can make a currency exchange.  Various catering establishments located in the upper tier offer passengers a bite to eat or purchase food before leaving the train. </p><h2>  Planning decision </h2><p>  All three tiers of the station complex are interconnected by stairs and escalators, as well as huge light wells and ramps.  The building is literally riddled with passages and transparent elevators, as if soaring bridges and consoles.  All this allows you to create a whole gamut of images of the twenty-first century. </p><p>  In terms of development, the Ladoga station has a rectangular shape.  On the sides are two structures with cylindrical shapes.  These outbuildings house administrative premises.  There is a VIP-hall, as well as a room intended for official delegations, rest rooms for passengers, commandant's office of military communications. </p><p>  Along the extreme route of the railway is a low block, in which auxiliary services are located.  At the same time, this structure serves as a <span>noise shield.</span>  This block is separated from the metro by an access area intended for urban surface transport. </p>
