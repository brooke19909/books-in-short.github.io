A mini-hotel in the center of St. Petersburg under the name "Peter" rents out nice rooms that have everything you need for a not-too-fastidious traveler.  It can be found at: st.  Italianskaya, 12.

It is really inexpensive.  Mini-hotels with in-room amenities in St. Petersburg are generally more expensive.  For only 200 rubles there is an opportunity to have breakfast right at the hotel, judging by the reviews of the guests, all the dishes are fresh and tasty. </p><p>  In addition, the mini-hotel offers guests to use the equipped kitchen and prepare their own meals.  To do this, there is a stove, microwave and kettle.  The hotel also has a washing machine, and upon request, an ironing board, iron and hairdryer are provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mini-Hotel &quot;Peter&quot;" class="if uuid-2584093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2584093.jpg"></div><p>  Summing up, I want to say that prices for accommodation in St. Petersburg are different, it is not necessary to spend large sums of money to get a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpositive emotions from visiting this hospitable city. </p>
