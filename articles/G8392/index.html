This amazing country, in the name of which there is the word "freedom" - "thai", many Russians consider exotic.

The holidays here are so varied that everyone, even the most experienced traveler, will be able to find something of their own in ultramodern Bangkok or the fiery club Pattaya, on the exotic islands of Samet and Koh Chang, on the pristine <span>beaches of Samui</span> and the fantastic Krabi.  This country attracts Russians not only because of its unusualness, combined with the study of numerous local attractions, or the developed tourist infrastructure, but also by its relatively inexpensive opportunity to relax comfortably in any season of the year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aiyaree Place Hotel 3" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1047458.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It really has everything that a tourist wants to get from a tropical resort: these are the magical waters of two oceans - the Pacific and Indian, magnificent hotels with a huge range of both services and prices, as well as a surprisingly friendly population.  Those who have traveled to Thailand joke that for Thais, simply raising their voices while speaking is tantamount to inflicting a near-fatal resentment.  And if you add to this the centuries-old history of the kingdom of Siam, numerous ancient cities that can be seen in the northern part, a stunning variety of fruits, many of which are unknown to Russians, and, of course, a fabulous Thai massage, you can understand the desire of tourists to visit at least once this corner of the globe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pattaya </h2><p>  This small town is located on the coast of the South China Sea.  It is reliably protected from tsunamis and hurricanes.  Pattaya is often called the Asian Riviera.  It is visited annually by a very diverse army of tourists: Europeans, Americans, young people and families with children come here.  About four million people fly to Pattaya every year to not only swim and sunbathe, but also to see such interesting objects as the Temple of Truth, a crocodile farm, look at the surroundings from the observation platform of Pratamnak Hill, take a walk through the Nong Nooch tropical garden or zoo with tigers, visit the ‚ÄúElephant Village‚Äù and, of course, on Walking street - Red Light District. </p><p>  In Pattaya there is literally a royal abundance of cafes and restaurants with national or European, Russian or Arabic, Indian and even Turkish cuisines.  Along the resort area there are a lot of coral islands, where everyone can retire to the bosom of exotic nature, enjoying a world untouched by civilization.  Fans of shopping will be delighted with the numerous salons, boutiques and noisy markets where you can buy everything from pareos to beautiful necklaces by local craftsmen.  Those who prefer a vibrant nightlife will be satisfied with visiting clubs and discos where dance programs and various shows are held. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aiyaree Place Hotel 3 Pattaya" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1047460.jpg" width="600"></div>

The program includes rafting on the river, a trip to the most beautiful waterfalls, as well as swimming in radon springs. </p><p>  Among the places that you definitely need to see when going to Thailand, to Pattaya in particular, in the first place is a tropical Garden called Nong Nooch, where it is not only beautiful, but also very exciting.

    <p>  In Pattaya, you can and should bargain.  If the seller does not understand English, you can simply type the price on the calculator.  You can discount the cost in two or even three times.  This is evidenced by most reviews of Russians staying at Aiyaree Place Hotel 3 * (Pattaya). </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Upon returning home, many tourists immediately share their impressions of the trip.  I must say that they largely help compatriots to decide on the choice of hotel.  Aiyaree Place Hotel 3 *, reviews of which are mostly positive, attracts many with its characteristics.  Firstly, low price: this parameter is very relevant for tourists vacationing in economy class. </p><p>  A lot of good words are said about the rooms.  Some believe that for a three-star hotel they are simply chic.  If the room that was previously booked is not yet available by the arrival of the guests, then, according to the rules, they will be given the keys to the apartments one category higher.  Many especially liked the balconies overlooking the indoor pool, with a table and two armchairs.  Here you can have a great time admiring the surrounding tall palm trees. </p><p>  Not every room in a hotel with a higher category can boast such furnishings as in Aiyaree Place Hotel 3 *.  Reviews of tourists regarding this issue are the same: natural wood furniture, a large corner bathtub, a beautiful view from the balcony, a full fridge, a kitchen, an excellent plasma TV - all this contributes to a comfortable stay. </p><p>  English is well spoken at the registration desk, so there are no problems with explanation even with the most superficial knowledge of the language.  Those Russians who come from Aiyaree Place Hotel 3 * leave reviews directly upon arrival.  Among them, a lot of those who rested in this hotel with young children.  For them, of course, the main thing is that the room is clean and safe for the child.  Many of the parents, especially mothers, were pleasantly surprised that they did not have to wash or clean the room after the maids.  Everything was always clean. </p><p> The air conditioning in the room is not installed above the bed, so you can sleep peacefully without worrying about what your child is blowing.  In addition, the split system has many modes, so you can adjust it.  Towels are changed every day.  The beds in the rooms are comfortable with orthopedic mattresses. </p><p>  Russians rated the food on a solid four, especially breakfast.  Lots of vegetables and fruits.  The pool on the territory is always clean, with a minimum chlorine content, there is also a hydromassage.  Near the restaurant there is a river where tourists can fish. </p><p>  Many especially remember the settlement when, as a compliment from the hotel, they hung garlands of orchids on their neck and presented a basket with exotic fruits. </p><p>  The only negative, according to many, is not a very clean public beach.  Some Russians complain about the lack of bathrobes and slippers in the rooms, however, besides the fact that this is a very minor minus, it should be understood that they may not be in a three-star hotel.  In the reviews, tourists recommend being especially attentive to the number of towels issued upon check-in.  Sometimes, instead of two, the staff gives one, and then you have to pay extra for the second. </p><p>  Many of our compatriots who have visited the Aiyaree Place Hotel 3 * recommend it as excellent for youth active as well as measured family vacations. </p>
