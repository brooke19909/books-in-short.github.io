If it falls on summer time, then the choice of tourist destinations is huge.  These are the resorts of Russia and foreign recreation areas.  Many of our compatriots who prefer to bask after a long winter under the gentle rays of the sun, turn their eyes to Egypt - a country that thousands of tourists from all over the world visit every year. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="26.820553" data-lng="30.802498000000014" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="5"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/4/1/3/17413.png"></div><p>  Everyone who planned a trip to Egypt in June is interested in what weather is in the resorts of this country at this time.  Therefore, we will dwell on the description of climatic conditions in more detail. </p><h2>  June weather features </h2><p>  In Egypt, a hot season begins in April, lasting until October.  At the same time, there is not a large outflow of tourists at local resorts, as, for example, in the UAE.  The heat is much easier to tolerate in dry climates and does not interfere with a pleasant stay. </p><p>  Resorts of Egypt are highly appreciated by travelers from different countries.  Judging by the reviews, in June the weather in Egypt is almost the same in all areas, although there are some differences.  For example, the north of Egypt is in a desert subtropical climate, the rest of the country is tropical.  Probably, for some, these terms do not mean anything, so let's move on to the numbers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt in June" class="if uuid-3216794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3216794.jpg"></div><p>  Egypt is always a very hot June.  In the resorts of the Mediterranean Sea, for example, in Alexandria in the daytime, the air temperature ranges from +27 to +35 ° C.  Red Sea resorts (Makadi, Dahab, Safaga, Marsa Alam, Hurghada, El-Gouna, Sharm El-Sheikh,) delight vacationers with more constant temperature indicators than in Mediterranean cities, where in the middle of the month the air can warm up to +37 ° FROM. </p><p>  Nights on the Red Sea coast are also warm - from +25 to +30 ° .  Off the coast of the Nile (in Luxor, Aswan), where tourists are taken on excursions, the weather is even hotter in June.  In Egypt, the air temperature in these areas sometimes reaches +44 °  during the day, but on average it is +39 ° .  Not so hot and suffocating nights save at this time, when the air temperature does not exceed +28 ° .  In the central part of the country, in contrast to the coastal regions, slight temperature differences are observed throughout the month, although it certainly does not happen cold. </p><h2>  Weather in Cairo </h2><p>  We continue to understand what the weather in Egypt is in June.  In the capital of the country - Cairo, it is also very hot at this time: in the daytime the thermometer can rise to + 43 ° C, but on average it is about +39 ° C.  And evenings and nights are probably the coolest in the country during this period - from +20 to +26 ° C. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dahab Resort in Egypt" class="if uuid-3216821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3216821.jpg"></div><h2>  Humidity and Precipitation </h2><p>  As you can see, in June Egypt has very hot and dry weather.  Not a single cloudy or rainy day happens throughout June - a bright and hot sun shines over the country.  At the beginning of the month, the wind intensifies, but it is warm, and only accelerates the hot air, bringing relief to tourists not accustomed to such temperatures. </p><p>  June is the sunniest and brightest month of the year: daylight hours exceed 14 hours.  It always dawns very sharply and quickly, at about six in the morning. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.classic-collection.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt in early June" class="if uuid-3216968" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3216968.jpg"></div><h2>  Egypt water temperature in June </h2><p>  In June, in Egypt, the Red Sea is warmer than the Mediterranean and swimming in it is much more pleasant.  The average water temperature in it is about + 27 ° C, while by the end it rises by two degrees.  In Sharm or Hurghada, it is about the same.  And here, in the north of Taba, it is colder by one or two degrees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A bit cooler the Mediterranean.  In the Alexandria region at the beginning of June it warms up to only + 23 ° C, and by the end of the month to + 26 ° C.  According to people vacationing in this sunny country at the beginning of summer, the purchase of a tour to Egypt in June is quite justified given the climatic conditions. </p><h2>  How to choose a resort </h2><p>  For tourists who do not tolerate extreme heat, the climate in the vicinity of Alexandria is most suitable.  Despite the fact that the sea water temperature there is slightly lower than in other parts of the country, in the daytime the thermometer rises to +28 ° C.  Evening and night give freshness and coolness. </p><p>  Coming to Egypt in June, do not rush to poison on excursions to the Giza pyramids.  In this area, during the daytime, the temperature can reach +48 ° C.  Postpone sightseeing until the heat ends. </p><p>  The Aswan resort has a very high humidity level in June, and therefore you should not visit it at this time.  Fans of diving, other water sports can use the resort of Dahab.  It rains rarely and the weather in June is quite comfortable for a beach holiday - not the hottest air temperature (+32 ° C) and warm sea (+28 ° C). </p><div class="photo" data-original="sofitel.accorhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Which resort to choose" class="if uuid-3216971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3216971.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to these resorts, in June you can fully relax in Marsa Alam and Hurghada, where vacationers can visit many entertainment complexes.  Elite hotels are located in Sharm El Sheikh and Soma Bay.  A mild climate and comfortable living conditions await tourists in El Gouna, Nuweiba and Al Quseyr.  Always calm and calm weather in June at the health resort Safaga. </p><h2>  Entertainment in June </h2><p>  Based on numerous reviews of tourists in Egypt in June, it can be argued that at this time it is more interesting and more fun in large cities - Sharm el-Sheikh, Hurghada, Alexandria and Cairo.  Although there is something to do in smaller resorts. </p><p>  Rest in this country will be remembered by many if the hotel, where tourists stay, has animation.  In this case, you can play a little on the beach or by the pool, and in the evening, without leaving the hotel, take part in various shows.  Animators entertain guests from 10.00 to midnight, taking only small breaks.  Most hotels have children's animators, so you can safely plan a vacation with the kids. </p><p>  June is the best time for water sports: parasailing, surfing, water skiing, kitesurfing, bananas, buns, catamarans, etc. </p><h2>  Diving </h2><p>  The most comfortable weather in Egypt in early June or in the middle of the month.  In the last decade, the days are getting hotter, and this does not allow you to travel through the desert.  Nevertheless, even at this time, trips to Egypt are very popular: the Red Sea is famous for its excellent diving conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ikreis.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Diving in Egypt" class="if uuid-3216985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3216985.jpg"></div><p>  Fans of snorkeling and diving have long been attracted by the beauty of the underwater world of this sea, and the resorts have all the conditions for classes: diving stations, diving schools, as well as rental equipment in all hotels.  Among the divers around the world, the Blue Hole, located in the Sinai near the resort of Dahab, gained immense popularity.  In a vertical well, the underwater descent begins right in the bay, not far from the shore.  Divers who once visited Dahab return after diving with full albums of colorful photos and a lot of vivid impressions.  However, only divers with wide experience can afford such an adventure. </p><p>  All hotels have diving centers where, under the guidance of experienced instructors, those who wish can be taught diving.  In addition to traditional diving, those who wish can take up its variety - river diving.  This is a fascinating survey of sunken ships.  And then, you can refresh yourself in water parks that are in Sharm, Makadi and Hurghada. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  You can complement your beach vacation in June with excursions.  Let's not hide - in the heat it is quite difficult to travel in the desert, but with a good supply of water, a hat and sunscreen, such a trip will give you pleasure.  In almost all resort cities of the country, there are offices of many travel agencies and representatives of travel agencies work who organize trips. </p><p>  In June, you can take part in safari tours, ATV trips in the desert and to the Bedouin village, boat trips, a glass bottom boat, etc. Separately, it should be said about trips to ancient cities.  Egypt is a country with a very interesting history.  Ancient objects have survived to this day.  We already talked about the fact that in June the weather in Egypt doesn’t have to see historical sights, which are mostly under the hot sun in open space.  Therefore, it is advisable to choose the palace “A Thousand and One Nights,” the Monastery of St. Catherine and the show of singing fountains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stevemace.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palace of Thousand and One Nights" class="if uuid-3216991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3216991.jpg"></div><p>  The town of Safaga, located on the east coast, is one of the original corners of the country.  Here are the remains of the harbor of the pharaohs, the cathedral of the god Serapis, as well as the Turkish fortress of the XVI century. </p><h2>  Holy Tours </h2><p>  Although Egypt is very hot in summer in summer, Orthodox Christians celebrate the Trinity Day in June.  Therefore, tourists are offered a mini-tour of the shrines of the country, where Christianity came from Palestine back in the 1st century.  The oldest and most popular of them is the temple of St. Catherine in the vicinity of Sharm el-Sheikh.  He is known among believers thanks to the Basilica of the Transfiguration, the chapel of the Virgin Mary, the Burning Dome.  The majestic marble structures and unique mosaics of the monastery make a great impression even on atheists.  The holiness of this land is felt in the monasteries of St. Anthony and St. Paul, where regular trips are organized by travel agencies. </p><h2>  Hurghada </h2><p>  The closest to these attractions is the resort of Hurghada. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Monastery of St. Anthony" class="if uuid-3217013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3217013.jpg"></div><p>  And in the city itself, you can see the Christian Coptic church, which was built in the East Byzantine style.  30 kilometers from Hurghada is the ethnic Bedouin village.  Ethnography lovers strive to get on this tour.  Here you can see how fakirs juggle with torches and "walk" on hot coals.  In the village there is a zoo in which desert inhabitants are gathered. </p><h2>  Egypt in June: reviews and recommendations of tourists </h2><p>  A trip to Egypt at any time of the year leaves a lot of pleasant impressions and memories.  June in this sense is no exception.  However, it should be borne in mind that the weather at this time is very hot, so for elderly people who can’t tolerate the heat, families with small children should choose another time to visit the country or choose a resort with a cooler air temperature (Alexandria, for example). </p><p>  Experienced travelers recommend to anyone planning a trip to Egypt in June: </p><ul><li>  Take care of the headgear and sunscreen.  Egypt's weather at this time is insidious: the risk of overheating and heat stroke is great. </li><li>  During the day, spend more time in the shade and avoid being in direct sunlight. </li><li>  Bathe and sunbathe in the morning or evening hours. </li><li>  Try local fruits, including exotic ones.  The hotel restaurants offer watermelons and melons, apples and bananas, strawberries and grapefruits.  In mid-June, Egypt collects delicious mangoes. </li></ul><p>  If you rested in Egypt at the beginning of summer, share your impressions in the comments to the article.  They will be useful to everyone who is planning such a trip. </p>
