Of course, everyone wants to get a cash loan and pay a minimum amount of interest.  Others want to receive money exclusively in cash.  To understand the full variety of existing offers, it is worth considering the most interesting loan programs from well-known banks.  Each of them is distinguished by limits on the issuance of funds and interest rates. </p><h2>  "Opening" </h2><p>  To date, in this financial institution there are two credit programs for consumers.  One of them was called "For their own", and the other - "For the right things."  The first option is provided for those citizens who are already holders of salary, debit or pension cards of this bank.  The program “On the right things” is available to new customers. </p>

    <p>  The interest rate of overpayment can be from 14.9 to 15.9%.  This variation is explained by an individual approach to each specific case.  If we talk about the basic conditions of such a loan, then it is worth paying attention to the loan term, which can be up to 5 years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Moreover, the client has the right to apply for a loan in the amount of 25 thousand rubles to 750 thousand. Applications can be considered from 15 minutes to 2 business days, it all depends on the credit history.  Otkritie Bank programs also allow early repayment of loan debt. </p><h2>  "St. Petersburg" </h2><p>  If we talk about this bank, then a consumer loan can be issued for individuals or corporate customers of the bank.  However, it should be borne in mind that in this case, money can be received only if the guarantee of a particular organization. </p><p>  Roughly speaking, in this case, the guarantor, or rather the guarantor, will be the director of a particular company in which the borrower works.  Perhaps this loan program is not suitable for everyone, but it has several advantages. </p><p>  First of all, money can be received not only in Russian rubles, but also in foreign currency.  The minimum loan amount is 25 thousand rubles, and the maximum can reach up to 1 million rubles.  Moreover, the interest rate depends on the currency in which the loan was issued. </p><p>  If we are talking about Russian rubles, then the overpayment will be 15.5%.  When a loan is received in dollars, the interest rate is 13.5%.  The smallest rate is designed for those citizens who make out a loan in euros.  In this case, the overpayment will be 12.5%. </p>

    <p>  The term for payment of funds under this loan program may be from 1 year to 15 years.  The good news is that it is not necessary to provide a certificate of income.  This is not surprising, because the guarantor is the direct supervisor of the borrower. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also in this bank, the minimum age for potential customers is slightly lower, which today is not 21 years old, but 18 years old.  In addition, customers must be citizens of the Russian Federation and provide appropriate registration. </p><h2>  "Alfa Bank" </h2><p>  This credit institution is very popular due to lower interest rates on loans.  In addition, at Alfa Bank, when applying for a loan, you can get a special local plastic card.  Thanks to this simple device, you can easily find out information about the status of accounts, as well as perform the necessary operations at any Alfa-Bank ATM. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about the conditions, the loan term can be from 3 to 36 months.  Moreover, the minimum amount is 55 thousand rubles, and the maximum reaches 580 thousand rubles.  Interest rates are calculated individually, but the minimum overpayment will be 14%.  It can be reduced if a citizen is already a client of the bank and has a credit or debit card.  Bank loan programs allow early repayment of loans.  Fines and surcharges in this case are not removed. </p><h2>  "Russian standard" </h2><p>  In this bank you can get a loan in the amount of 30 thousand rubles to 300 thousand. In this case, the overpayment will be 36%, and the term for payment of funds may vary from 6 months to 3 years.  Despite such a high overpayment, the advantage of the bank is that the decision is made very quickly, within 15 minutes.  If a citizen is already a client of this financial organization, then in this case he can count on preferential terms. </p><p>  In this case, the loan amount will be from 50 thousand rubles to 500 thousand, and the interest rate on loans will drop to 24%.  If the client needs to take a loan in the amount of up to 1 million rubles, then the percentage overpayment will also be 24%, however, the application will be reviewed within 24 hours. </p><h2>  Raiffeisenbank </h2><p>  The main advantage of this financial institution is that it does not charge a fee for servicing credit accounts.  In addition, there is no need for the client to provide a deposit or bring a guarantor with him. </p>

    <p>  When obtaining a loan, you can simultaneously issue a plastic bank card, the service of which will also be free.  In addition, you can take out life and health insurance directly at the very branch of a financial organization. </p><p>  There are no penalties for early repayment of loans.  The interest rate is quite acceptable, it ranges from 19.5 to 21.5%.  However, if a citizen already has a Raiffeisenbank salary card, then the overpayment will be reduced to 15.9%, and the maximum loan repayment period will be 5 years. </p><h2>  VTB 24 </h2><p>  In this bank, a consumer loan program is available to customers.  In this case, citizens of the Russian Federation from the age of 21 can take a loan in the amount of 50 thousand rubles to 3 million. However, in the case when the amount is more than 750 thousand rubles, the presence of a guarantor is mandatory. </p>

    <h2>  Sovcombank </h2><p>  This bank has a “Credit Doctor" program, which will please the owners of a bad credit history.  As a rule, this is not practiced in banks, and those who have at least once tarnished their reputation rarely receive money. </p><p>  In Sovcombank you can get small loans for a period of 3-6 months or from 6 to 9 months.  In this case, the loan amount will amount to 5 thousand rubles and 10 thousand, respectively.  However, in this case, the interest rate will be 34%.  Also, customers can get a loan of up to 60 thousand rubles for a period of 18 months.  In this case, by bank transfer by card, the overpayment will be 26%.  If the borrower wants to receive cash, then the interest rate will be increased to 36%. </p><p>  On the one hand, overpayments at this bank are quite impressive.  However, when it comes to bad credit history, you have no choice.  In any case, it is much better to contact a bank than a microloan company. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  It is also worth paying attention to the family loan program from Sberbank.  She received the name "Young Family".  According to the terms of this program, couples with 3 or more children can count on impressive discounts on interest if they apply for a mortgage.  In addition, spouses can attract co-borrowers or use additional preferential programs from the state or local authorities. </p>
