And therefore, more and more often have to think about where to get a million.  It doesn‚Äôt matter, rubles or dollars.  The main thing is that people are looking for either additional ways to earn money or some sources of cash.  A million rubles is not such a big amount for the modern world.  Therefore, getting it is quite real.  The question is different - how exactly?  The best tips and tricks for finding a million will be presented later.  You can‚Äôt say exactly which options are suitable for a particular person.  The issue of obtaining a million is decided on an individual basis. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to get a million rubles" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1466884.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Relatives </h2><p>  Where can I get a million rubles, and even on a free (or interest-free) basis?  The thing is that you can borrow the specified amount.  Or ask for a gift.  Seek help from relatives.  For example, to parents. </p><p>  The method is good, but it is not suitable for everyone.  Especially when it comes to money as a gift.  Borrowing such large amounts of money from relatives or parents is a step that entails many consequences.  If relations with the family are normal, there will be no major changes.  Otherwise, relatives will begin to recall a debt or a gift in any quarrel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A loan from loved ones is the first way out of the situation.  An actual offer is only for those who will definitely not be remembered for help.  But, as many say, contacting relatives on financial matters is more expensive.  Therefore, it is better to look for other answers to the question of where to get a million. </p><h2>  Friends and acquaintances </h2><p>  The next tip is somewhat similar to the already known proposal.  This is a loan or gift from close friends or acquaintances.  As a rule, the first option is more common in practice. </p><p>  Of the benefits - friends are unlikely to ask for interest.  Also, with friends you can easily discuss at any time issues related to the repayment of debt.  And even delay it.  But there are also disadvantages.  First, if you do not pay the debt, trust between people will be lost.  Secondly, the second time you can‚Äôt turn for help, even the smallest one. </p><p>  Where to get a million?  Relatives, friends, family and acquaintances - all this is good.  Only, as already mentioned, this is not the best way affects the relationship of people.  It is worth looking for less dangerous methods of obtaining funds for relations between citizens. </p><h2>  Win </h2><p>  Where to get a million for free?  The following advice does not give a 100% guarantee.  But take it into account anyway.  The thing is that you can get rich without any debts by winning money.  For example, in the lottery. </p><p>  In this case, the citizen will have to give a certain percentage of his winnings to the state, and leave the rest to himself.  Playing the lottery is a matter of luck.  A person may be lucky, or maybe not.  Therefore, it is clearly not worth focusing on a similar version of the solution to the problem posed.  It is enough to buy lottery tickets from time to time and hope that one million will be won someday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to get a million" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1466883.jpg"></div>

If a person wants to quickly receive money for certain needs, you can contact the bank.  And take a loan there.  This is the most common scenario. </p><p>  Where urgently to get a million rubles?  In any bank that works in a particular city.  In this case, it is worth paying attention to the fact that loans are not issued: </p><ul><li>  children </li><li>  To old people; </li><li>  unemployed. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, for a loan for such a large amount to be approved, a citizen should initially have good earnings.  Important: many banks do not give out money to those who had problems with previous loans. </p><p>  Where to get a loan (one million rubles)?  In Russia, they often turn to the following banking organizations: </p><ul><li>  Sberbank </li><li>  VTB 24; </li><li>  "SKB-Bank"; </li><li>  Loko Bank; </li><li>  Tinkoff </li><li>  Raiffeisenbank. </li></ul><h2>  MFI </h2><p>  Where to get a million dollars or rubles?  A good alternative to banks is a variety of MFIs.  They are in great demand in Russia.  People usually turn to <span>microfinance organizations</span> in order to get a quick small consumer loan.  But you can come here for large sums too. </p><p>  As a rule, MFIs offer registration for one passport in just a few minutes.  But the interest that you have to pay with the loan is quite high.  The final overpayment will be substantial.  It is precisely because of this nuance that microfinance organizations are an extreme case.  Usually they resort to circulation when there are no other sources of funds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to get a million loan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1466882.jpg"></div>

And not in all cases it is required to receive 1 000 000 rubles quickly and immediately with a single amount.  If a person is thinking about <span>how to get rich,</span> then it is proposed to receive the indicated money in parts for a certain time. </p><p>  Where to get a million?  Provide yourself with <span>passive income, the profit</span> from which will be monthly deferred.  So for a while a million rubles will be received. </p><p>  Most often, renting property is used as passive income.  For example, apartments.  At the delivery of housing, you can save a million in about 8.5 years.  And this is provided that the <span>rent is</span> 10,000 rubles per month.  Usually it is possible to get the desired amount faster. </p><h2>  Deposit income </h2><p>  Where to get a million rubles without interest?  The following method is well suited for those who already have a lot of money.  It is proposed to put a large amount on a deposit at a bank.  Every month, a citizen will be able to withdraw interest accrued on the initial amount.  And so over time, a million will accumulate. </p><p>  The method is good, but unreliable.  Especially now, in a crisis.  Firstly, if a person already has a lot of money, then he is unlikely to think about how to get 1,000,000. Secondly, now to open a deposit in large amounts is a high risk.  And few agree to it.  Thirdly, you have to wait a long time for the accumulation of the required amount. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where urgently to take a million rubles" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1466885.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Work </h2><p>  Where to get a million rubles?  The most correct way is the answer, which, unfortunately, does not fully satisfy the population.  Where to get this or that amount of money?  To earn.  Work is the main source of cash.  To get 1,000,000 rubles in Russia for a certain period of time is quite realistic. </p><p>  For example, in Moscow you can do this in just 5 months.  It is enough to earn 200,000, but not to spend a single ruble of them.  The offer is well suited for families in which both spouses work.  Then the income of one person can be spent on life, and the other can be postponed.  The speed of achieving the goal depends on wages.  Therefore, at official work it can be very difficult to get the final million. </p><h2>  Business </h2><p>  You can try to open your own business.  If everything works out, then 1,000,000, for example, per year is not so much for your business.  Getting rich with a successful business is easy. </p><p>  True, not everyone has been given certain heights.  Initially, business is a costly affair.  Yes, and there is always a risk of burnout.  Therefore, first you have to weigh the pros and cons.  Nevertheless, as the prospect of getting the first million, the business is perfect.  It is simply necessary to take it into account. </p><p>  By the way, even small business is taken into account.  Sometimes this is how one can manage to earn 1,000,000 quite quickly. But, as already mentioned, such a technique does not suit everyone.  It may happen that a person receives only debts and expenses instead of profit. </p><h2>  Exchange and luck </h2><p>  Where can I get a million?  Another rather interesting way to make money is to play on currency exchanges.  For example, at Forex.  Well suited to people who are knowledgeable in economics.  It‚Äôs easy to earn 1,000,000 rubles or dollars here, but you can lose that amount in minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to get a million rubles without interest" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1466887.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The game on currency exchanges is not recommended for those who do not thoroughly know what it is.  In general, a similar method of obtaining large cash is roulette.  No one can say for sure whether to win or not.  It all depends on personal skills and luck.  If it is on the player‚Äôs side, there will be profit.  Not?  Then you have to prepare for huge expenses. </p><h2>  Books </h2><p>  If a person thinks not about where to quickly get a million, but how to earn it, you can give a lot of advice.  The next trick is the publication of the book.  Successful writers earn a lot of money on their creations.  And all over the world. </p><p>  The method is unreliable, it requires a huge amount of time, nerves and strength.  In addition, the publication of the book itself requires certain expenses.  Therefore, this method is not suitable for quick income.  In addition, a high probability of failure.  It‚Äôs hard to become a famous writer.  This means that you can‚Äôt earn big money on writing books.  Although, if you have time and extra money, it‚Äôs worth a try. </p><h2>  Network marketing </h2><p>  You can earn a million by doing network marketing.  Or just online sales.  This is a pretty lucrative business.  But, as practice shows, first you need to invest in it. </p><p>  Not everyone is given the chance to become a successful network manager.  You have to be active, persistent and savvy.  If it works out, it will be possible to earn a lot, moreover, stably.  And then 1,000,000 will quickly accumulate.  But in case of failure, no serious consequences will come.  No debts, no interest.  The only thing they pay attention to is spending.  If you fail to become a successful network manager, the money invested in projects and your own development cannot be returned. </p><h2>  Sales </h2><p>  Where to get a million rubles for free?  If we are not talking about urgent receipt of money, then you can do sales.  Set aside all revenue and save.  As an alternative - selling your own property. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to get a million dollars" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1466886.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Again, as in the case of renting, it is best to sell apartments and houses.  Then at once you can get more than a million rubles.  Some go to realtors and start reselling real estate.  The difference is taken away. </p><p>  One million rubles in this way is easy to accumulate.  True, it is very time consuming.  But this is only when it comes to resales.  In the case of a single real estate transaction, the indicated amount can be received very quickly. </p><h2>  State </h2><p>  And where to get a million for business?  This question quite often worries those who plan to open their own business.  In Russia, entrepreneurs, especially new ones, are trying to support.  Therefore, each businessman in one case or another can apply to the state to receive development subsidies.  Certain amounts are issued to companies from the state budget annually.  But, as practice shows, once.  That is, an entrepreneur can receive money for the development of his business 1 time. </p><p>  It is enough just to go through a competitive selection and get into the list of applicants for receiving subsidies for the development of business and entrepreneurship.  It is recommended to find out more accurate information on this issue from the administration of the city in which the company is registered. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear where to get a million for free or with a refund.  There are a lot of options.  But if you think about it, then the most reliable, although not always fast method, is the answer "earn". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to get a million rubles for free" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1466888.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Based on everything written earlier, we can distinguish the following options for receiving funds: </p><ul><li>  gift / inheritance; </li><li>  profit from the sale / delivery of property; </li><li>  earnings; </li><li>  opening a business; </li><li>  loans </li><li>  interest on deposits in banks; </li><li>  loans (from relatives or friends). </li></ul><p>  In fact, getting a million, and even more so earning it for a certain period, is not so difficult.  The main thing is to learn to earn and save.  If you need money urgently, then the solution can be considered loans and the sale of property.  As has been repeatedly said, in other situations, it is recommended to honestly earn the desired amount in one way or another. </p>
