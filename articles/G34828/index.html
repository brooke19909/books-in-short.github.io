    <p>  Fans of billiards, as well as outdoor games - tennis, football, and tennis - will be where to show their skills.  There is a gym on site. </p><p>  For seminars, corporate events there is an audience for 30 people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Beach and Pool </h2><p>  The guesthouse has a sand and pebble beach with sunshades and sunbeds.  Beach equipment rental is paid.  The beach is 400 meters away. </p><p>  Like most resort complexes located in the city of Sudak, the Zvezdny boarding house has a large water complex, which includes an outdoor pool and a hydromassage area with a jacuzzi.  There is a bar nearby where you can enjoy drinks. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  Of the entertainment for children provided by the Star, we note a playground with swings and carousels and a games room.  Especially for children, discos are organized.  The management did not forget about splashing around as well - in the adult pool there is a fenced off "paddling pool".  For the convenience of parents, babysitting services are provided.  Do not forget that all small clients need a certificate of vaccination.  Children from 2 to 5 years are admitted free of charge. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The territory on which the Zvezdny boarding house is located is Crimea, Sudak, so fresh fruits and vegetables are a priority in the diet of guests.  All meals take place in a separate dining room, which can be reached through a closed warm passage. </p><p>  Depending on the permits, the sanatorium offers three <span>types of food</span> : </p><ul><li>  breakfast; </li><li>  breakfast and dinner; </li><li>  three meals a day </li></ul><p>  There is a cafe and bar on site, where you can grab a bite to eat during the day. </p><h2>  <strong>Reviews about the pension "Star"</strong> </h2><p>  It's time to talk about the impressions that the Zvezdny boarding house (Sudak) left in the hearts of the guests.  Reviews, as usual, have a different color.  Those guests who visited the boarding house a few years ago write reviews in a positive manner.  The only negative is the cramped rooms.  But there were no complaints about the cleanliness and change of linen. </p><p>  According to those guests who rested in Zvezdnoy in 2012, the food was not very varied and the portions were moderate.  Eaten lovers may be unhappy.  But you must admit that 1200 rubles per day per person is a low cost, and for this price of Turkish abundance it is ridiculous to expect. </p><p>  Let us summarize the opinions of guests who visited the Zvezdnyi boarding house (Sudak): the reviews characterize the services of the sanatorium for a solid four, all the necessary amenities are fully provided, accommodation prices are affordable for everyone, and we sincerely wish this resort complex many years of work and prosperity. </p><h2>  <strong>Pensions Sudak</strong> </h2>
