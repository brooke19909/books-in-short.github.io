    <p>  The doll came to us from ancient times.  Back in the days of <span>cavemen,</span> mothers tried to make a toy for their child.  Of course, progress does not stand still, and dolls have undergone modifications.  They are created by human hands and therefore are charged with special energy.  Previously, this process was treated with reverence.  The Russian folk doll has its own special character.  With their own hands, absolutely anyone can do it.  But before that, you need to familiarize yourself with the nuances of history. </p><h2>  History of occurrence </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The doll appeared the very first among the next toys.  She has been known since very ancient times.  Folk dolls have their own traditions and designations.  Almost all women made dolls for their children.  At that time, there were no stores selling these toys important for children.  Historians claim that the doll is more than a thousand years old.  Of course, very few traditional products of that time have come down to us.  This is due to the fact that dolls were made of wood, straw and fabric.  Material of natural origin decomposes and collapses in a matter of years.  Especially if it lies under the earth. </p><p>  Each village has its own doll making technique.  Any hostess wanted to introduce a special zest into her product.  To do this, a characteristic embroidery was made on the clothes, or a unique knot technique was used.  At that time, dolls could not be thrown out and treated with carelessness.  The Russian folk doll guarded the family and had its own soul.  She was respected and played with her carefully.  A special doll was made for the baby.  She lay in the cradle of the baby.  It was believed that such a product kept a sweet infant's sleep. </p><p>  Puppets were made for the holidays and all special occasions.  But they made them without faces.  People believed that an evil spirit could not infuse such a doll.  She decorated wedding cakes and walls of houses.  They made dolls with a special meaning in each of them.  Attention was paid to sizes, shapes and details.  For example, a doll with ten hands was presented to a newly made wife.  Such a number of hands testified that the daughter-in-law should be in time for everything.  And the peasant had a lot to do. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Folk dolls carried their meaning.  Some could be played.  Some were hanged over the matrimonial bed.  And there were those who were always worn in a pocket. </p><h2>  Play dolls </h2><p>  Such dolls were made for the kids' fun.  Until a certain age, the Russian folk doll was intended for girls and boys.  The toys in the children were the same until they ran around the hut in their shirts.  But as soon as the girls put on their skirts, and the boys put on the ports, the interests were divided. </p>

    <p>  Two folk dolls clung to a stick.  One was male and the other female.  They were made of colored pieces of cloth and put on folk costumes.  The ‚ÄúHorse-Fire‚Äù dolls were especially fond of.  They were a symbol of wealth and prosperity in the future family. </p><h2>  Manufacturing Features </h2><p>  They make dolls in Russian folk costumes without using a needle.  The fabric is simply folded and tied with threads.  Pieces are torn apart by hand without using sharp scissors.  It was believed that it is necessary to make a chrysalis according to all established rules: </p><ul><li>  Do not use a needle and scissors. </li><li>  The face is not drawn, since the product with the face is vulnerable to evil spirits. </li><li>  The outfit was made not for beauty, but with meaning. </li><li>  It was impossible to fit the body of a female doll.  Sundresses should hide forms and charms. </li><li>  For each holiday its own doll was made. </li></ul><h2>  Folk dolls as a business </h2><p>  Many craftsmen make good money on folk dolls.  Women make toys according to all the rules of ancient Russia.  Such dolls are sold at folk art fairs.  If you want to decorate your home with such a product, then make it yourself.  You may like the manufacturing process, and you decide to take this craft seriously. </p>
