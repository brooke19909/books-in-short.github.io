    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  Hotel Telstar 3 * is located almost in the center of the Italian city of Rimini, in an area called Rivazzurra.  Not far from the hotel there are such famous sights as New Fiabilandia (this is a large amusement park), the Congress Center, the Temple of Malatest, and the Arch of Emperor Augustus.  Rimini is also a major transport hub: there is an airport, a railway station, and intercity buses run regularly.  Since the vast majority of tourists come to the Adriatic coast, including for an excellent beach holiday, when choosing a hotel it is very important for them to find out the proximity of the beach.  As for the Telstar Rivazzurra 3 * hotel, it is located on the second coastline.  The distance to the beach is only fifty meters, but along the way you need to cross the road and overcome the promenade stretching along the coastline. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Telstar 3 * <span>(Rimini): reviews of</span> tourists from Russia </h2><p>  In order for you to have a more accurate impression of the hotel in question, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the comments of our compatriots who stayed here during their stay in Italy.  In general, it should be noted that most of the tourists were quite satisfied with their choice of accommodation.  However, we suggest learning more about everything. </p><p>  As for the hotel rooms themselves, they, as stated in the description, are cozy and comfortable.  The situation in them is not new, but the furniture is in good condition, and household appliances and plumbing are working properly.  Clean the rooms regularly.  Sometimes maids forget to change bed linens on time, but a reception at the reception quickly solves this problem. </p><p>  Our compatriots also liked the location of Telstar 3 *.  So, the Rivazzurra area is quite calm.  The center of Rimini is within walking distance.  Also pleased with the tourists and the fact that next to the hotel there is an area on which any events are constantly held.  So, animators work here, artists perform, the market comes, etc.  Also nearby is a large amusement park and several attractions of the city.  In short, going beyond the threshold of the hotel, you will always find something to do. </p><p>  As for meals at the Telstar Hotel, according to tourists, it is in full compliance with the three-star level.  Everything is quite tasty and quite diverse.  However, experienced travelers recommend diversifying their own menu, having lunch and dinner outside the hotel.  Moreover, in Rimini there are many different restaurants, cafes and taverns for every taste. </p><p>  The main delight of our compatriots who visited here was caused by the Adriatic Sea.  The beaches in Rimini are sandy and pebble, very clean, with a gentle entry into the water.  Almost everywhere you can stay for free on your towel.  If you want to use a sun lounger or parasol, you will have to pay for it.  Also for a fee on the beaches you can rent equipment for water activities. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that if you are looking for a comfortable accommodation in Rimini at an affordable price and do not plan to spend whole days in your room, then the three-star Telstar Hotel, located in the Rivazzurra district, is perfect for you. </p>
