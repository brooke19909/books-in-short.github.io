You can have a good time here both in summer and in winter.  For those who have chosen Arkhyz as the place for their trip, the Eagle's Nest will be an excellent accommodation option.  Such a beautiful name is the camp site located in this village. </p><h2>  Useful rest in Arkhyz </h2><p>  The first thing that comes to mind when we hear the name Arkhyz is, of course, mineral water.  And indeed, it is bottled here, in the village of Arkhyz, which is located in the Karachay-Cherkess Republic.  The Arkhyz locality begins in the plains and is called Lower Arkhyz.  Then she rises to the mountains.  These places are called the Upper Arkhyz.  The nature here is indescribable.  It is here that the village of Arkhyz itself is located. </p><p>  "Eagle's Nest" is one of the guest houses of this place, which is represented by various cottages.  It is worth noting that almost the whole of this village consists of wooden houses grazing here and there cows, rural shops and similar beauty of rural life. </p>

    <p>  At the same time, due to its climatic and natural indicators, Arkhyz is perfect for a resort place.  Like Dombay and Teberda located in the same region, this village occupies a hollow surrounded by massive mountains with magnificent pine trees.  Such walls do not allow cold winds here and maintain a very mild and pleasant climate here.  In combination with the cleanest local air, all these circumstances make Arkhyz a great place for a relaxing holiday in the lap of nature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is also a gradually developing ski resort, which is located not very far from the village of Arkhyz.
