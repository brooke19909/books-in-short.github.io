It is very cold and there is a lot of forest, and there are also lakes of the Emelyanovsk region. </p><p>  As a rule, the majority of people most often choose to travel abroad.  But once you see the beauty of Siberia once in the summer, and falling in love with this amazing land will appear from the first minute.  This area is famous not only for <span>dense forests,</span> but also for its lakes.  <span>In the Krasnoyarsk Territory</span> there are a lot of them.  However, not everywhere you can swim - somewhere an unequipped approach to water, and in other places the environment does not allow.  But more and more in the <span>Krasnoyarsk Territory</span> ennoble ponds.  This is exactly what tourists will see Lake Emelyanovskoye. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lake emelyanovskoe" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1144258.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  brief information </h2><p>  The reservoir is located in the central part of the <span>Krasnoyarsk Territory.</span>  The lake got its name from the urban-type village of Emelyanovsky, which was formed after the unification of the villages of Zaledeev, Emelyanov, Ustanov and the village of Areyskoye in the middle of the XIX century.  The <span>Moscow-Siberian tract</span> passed through these settlements <span>,</span> and in the 18th-19th centuries many famous people drove past the villages that today are called the town of Emelyanovskoye.  Among them was Tsarevich Nikolai. </p><p>  But still, in the first place, these places are famous for their simple and breathtaking beauty.  Not far from the airport is Lake Emelyanovskoe, which seven years ago was turned into a modern holiday destination, having built a whole complex for tourists.  At the same time, it was possible to preserve the virginity of nature, flora and fauna, and even to ennoble this place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Emelyanovsk lake Krasnoyarsk" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1144259.jpg" width="600"></div>

Here you can find perch, pike, catfish, crucian carp.  You can fish both in winter and in summer.  A similar result was achieved only after Lake Emelyanovskoye cleared of silt and launched several dozen fish fry. </p><h2>  Lake Change </h2><p>  One change in the structure of the bottom was not limited.  The reservoir was completely drained, cleaned and scooped up water from the nearby Elovaya River.  All the requirements of Rospotrebnadzor were met (water samples were taken for this), so we can say with confidence that all environmental standards have been met.  Decorative shrubs were planted on the territory.  Specially grown lawn for those places where grass did not grow, and looked through the black soil.  This was done in order to create a convenient approach to the lake for swimming people. </p><p>  The reservoir was not just cleaned, but gravel was poured into it.  The beach was covered with sand, which was specially brought from the Lena River.  It dries quickly after heavy rains.  The sand was distributed along the coastal zone, and a beautiful beach turned out.  Now it is a wonderful place to relax.  It rightfully bears the name "Emelyanovskoe Lake of Dreams." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="emelyanovskoe dream lake" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1144006.jpg" width="600"></div>

On its territory installed cabins for changing clothes, deck chairs, volleyball courts.  There are also cozy cafes with affordable prices on the shore.  Equipped an amusement park for children, there are catamarans.  300 seedlings of bird cherry, which is a symbolic tree of Siberia, were planted.  Convenient access leads to the beach, asphalt road, there is parking for cars.  All safety requirements have been complied with - there is a rescue point on the territory, and video surveillance is being conducted. </p><h2>  Safari Park </h2><p>  A safari park under development will decorate Lake Emelyanovsk (Krasnoyarsk) very soon.  Its area will be about 50 hectares.  On the territory it will be possible to observe the life of some wild animals, feed them, play.  It is known that here they plan to <span>breed ostriches,</span> bison, bison and other animals that can cause interest among vacationers. </p><h2>  "Island of lovers" </h2><p>  In the middle of such a reservoir as Lake Emelyanovskoye, there is an island, which after the arrangement of the territory was popularly called the ‚ÄúIsland of Lovers‚Äù. </p><p>  Themed holidays are organized here on weekends.  Vibrant events with the performance of creative teams like the residents of Krasnoyarsk and city guests.  The best part is the Dream Lake complex is now open all year round.  In winter, you can rent skis and skates, cheesecakes, ride horses and ponies, rent a barbecue or just enjoy a walk in the fresh air.
