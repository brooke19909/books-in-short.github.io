The Slavs believed that <span>cross-stitch patterns, patterns of a</span> certain orientation could protect against dangers and bring success and prosperity to a person‚Äôs life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="simple character" class="if uuid-3104135" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3104135.jpg"></div><h2>  Embroidered Amulets </h2><p>  Symbols and signs became known to people even before the advent of the letter.  In ancient times, each ornament had its own power and could attract good or evil into human life.  Slavic women used embroidered elements to protect them from the evil eye and attract happiness.  Most often, patterns were placed on clothes in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe arms, neck and chest. </p><p>  Modern versions of the embodiment of Russian folk patterns of cross-stitch can be found on the back, legs and stomach, depending on the cut and model of clothing.  Also, symbolism is often used in paintings as an artistic frame.  The embroidery could: </p><ul><li>  protect from ill-wishers; </li><li>  bring good luck and peace to the house; </li><li>  help get out of the disease and improve health; </li><li>  to give harmony in the house and improve communication between spouses; </li><li>  protect children from evil forces. </li></ul><p>  The symbolism of embroidery is quite diverse, so there are different categories and types of patterns that are used in specific cases.  These include symbols on health, luck, prosperity, the attraction of happiness and goodness, on luck, from evil forces and to protect the home.  In cross stitch patterns, patterns are also divided into several types: for men, women, children and infants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="two-tone amulet" class="if uuid-3104121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3104121.jpg"></div><h2>  Simple patterns </h2><p>  Ornaments can be of varying complexity, and depend on the function and the goal.  Novice craftswomen can embroider the color of a fern to protect the masculine from negative.  Such a symbol will give vivacity and fortitude, help to make the right choice in life and not make mistakes. </p><p>  The symbol of Svarog helps to find the meaning of life and get rid of problems in the form of various kinds of dependencies.  He also lights sparks of hidden talent and helps to find himself in the world.  In the patterns of cross-stitch patterns, patterns for women are not much different from men's, but contain more additional elements. </p><p>  So, to treat female diseases and improve their health, the craftswomen embroidered on their clothes the symbol of the goddess Lada, which resembles a flower. </p><p>  The Makoshi symbol is embroidered to improve relations and harmony between spouses, to establish personal life and attract success and prosperity.  The sign is embroidered not only on the clothes of adult women, but also for girls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fabalabs.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic symbol" class="if uuid-3104119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3104119.jpg"></div><h2>  Children's embroidery </h2><p>  Embroidered items are also used for children and infants to protect against bad influence.  Cross stitching the simplest patterns in the form of a small cockerel or another bird helps to protect against the evil eye and disease.  Such a pattern is sewn on the chest.  Although the symbolism is used as protective, but the scheme can be combined with other elements and thus create a whole picture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="peacockandfig.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cross-stitch" class="if uuid-3104146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3104146.jpg"></div><p>  For babies, beginner needlewomen can embroider Radinets.  This symbol is placed on bibs, scarves, or clothes.  It gives the newborn peace of mind and gives a good sleep.  For little girls embroider the symbol of Lelia, daughter of Lada, who in Slavic mythology is considered the goddess of spring and the birth of a new life.  According to needlewomen, this sign affects the development of femininity and good health, bestows beauty and gentleness of character.  Cross stitching of Slavic patterns is quite popular both on clothing items, and in the form of micro-embroidery for earrings, bracelets and necklaces. </p><p>  Symbols hidden in the pendants protect the owners from negative influence and help to achieve what they want.  Even simple combinations of elements have a magical meaning. </p><h2>  Embroidery for well-being </h2><p>  In addition to improving health and protection from negativity, embroidered symbols can attract money and success to the house.  To do this, embroider the sign of Veles.  This pattern for cross stitch for beginners not only helps in business, increases luck and increases success, but also develops intuition and sets up to find the right solution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="charms for welfare" class="if uuid-3104116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3104116.jpg"></div><p>  An alternative to the pattern can be a star.  A fairly light element that is embroidered on tablecloths, pillows or napkins and also helps to attract good luck and prosperity to the house.  It is embroidered with red or black threads on a white cloth. </p><h2>  Color selection </h2><p>  The power of embroidery and the filling of characters with a magic value depend on this parameter.  Black, red, green and yellow colors are used.  Each of them has its own meaning and fills the embroidery with special power.  As for the shades, in the patterns of cross-stitch embroideries, which have a protective value, only pure colors without transitions are used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="health symbol" class="if uuid-3104114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3104114.jpg"></div><p>  Contrast emphasizes the magical power of the chosen sign and creates beautiful outlines for the characters.  No more than two colors can be combined in one pattern.  An exception to the rule is Makosh, which uses three: red, black, and yellow. </p><p>  Recently, colors for protective symbols are selected according to the zodiac signs.  This helps to establish a mental connection between the symbol and human energy.  In one scheme, needlewomen are not advised to combine different symbols so that their meaning is not confused. </p><h2>  Action enhancement </h2><p>  In order for the symbol to begin to influence the owner, it is necessary to embroider on the growing moon and not think about the bad.  The mood of the craftswoman affects embroidery, and the threads are able to absorb information, passing it on to the rest.  Need to embroider a new needle and without knots.  This means that novice needlewomen need to master the technique of micro-stitches and fix the thread with it to picture patterns on the canvas. </p><p>  Russian folk cross-stitch patterns have not only deep historical roots, but also have a magical connection with subtle worlds, and can also have a positive effect on people's lives. </p><h2>  Selection of materials </h2><p>  This requirement is considered basic, since the result depends on the quality of the threads, their composition, thickness and type of fabric.  For embroideries of ornamental type, the craftswomen recommend using thick woolen threads that tighten crosses well and make embroidery voluminous.  But not all patterns of cross-stitch patterns require such a seal.  If the sewing is incomplete, it is better to use thin cotton threads, which will add accuracy and lightness to the work. </p><p>  You can embroider on an ordinary canvas with clear squares, as well as on more dense foundations.  The choice of material depends on the type of embroidery.  For folk motifs on shirts, patterns for cross-stitch can be done on linen or homespun linen.  Separate plots can be performed on the canvas and then sewed onto a regular canvas. </p><p>  Sometimes craftswomen use non-woven or water-soluble canvas, which is enough to lay on the base and embroider in squares, after which the product is washed and dried.  In the patterns of cross-stitch patterns for beginners, ordinary threads and fabrics are used, but in more complex versions, shiny threads, sewing techniques, beads, pebbles and other types of stripes can be used. </p>
