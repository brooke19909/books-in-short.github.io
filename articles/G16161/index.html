They have a very interesting and diverse form.  If you look at them from different angles, it becomes clear that from this natural material you can create a whole zoo.  One has only to show imagination, and your <span>crafts made from cones, made</span> with your own hands, will turn into cute animal figures or beautiful and sophisticated interior decorations.  Also, cones on New Year's Eve can serve as unusual decorations for your spruce, you just need to decorate them and dilute them with additional accessories - such as bows, ribbons, beads and sparkles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-17640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10636/17640.jpg?1539780249"></div><p>  When starting to create the next <span>craft from the cones</span> with your own hands, it is necessary to take into account the fact that the cones after they completely dry out, open.  Consequently, the shape of the cone will completely change the appearance and the already made crafts will deteriorate.  Sufficiently strong deformation occurs if crafts made from fir cones are smooth, regular in shape, which will turn into fluffy and round balls.  In order to use a fresh bump and maintain its original shape, it is necessary to prevent its change.  To do this, lower the cone in a warm solution of <span>wood glue,</span> in which it should lie for a while.  In the meantime, while it is in solution, it seeps in, and its scales stick together.  After completing this procedure, you need to give the cone time to dry completely.  After that, you can safely transgress to making crafts from cones with your own hands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cones can be used not only fresh and closed, but also already dried and opened.  Turn on your imagination - and an ordinary ordinary-looking bump will stun everyone with its newfound appearance, becoming, for example, a three-dimensional figure of an animal.  Cones can be interconnected.  If your composition requires several cones, then you can use hot glue or super-glue.  For children's fakes, you can replace the glue with plasticine, since it is completely harmless.  Plasticine is much safer and more practical.  From it you can fashion a cute face or any missing details of the animal that you are trying to portray.  Thus, crafts made from cones, made together with children with their own hands, will look more vivid and attractive.  The creation of such crafts can not only captivate you, but also serve as an original decor for decorating the interior of an office or your apartment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-17643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10636/17643.jpg?1539780249"></div><p>  Crafts from cones and plasticine, created by children's hands, are a great way to keep kids busy for a while.  But this is not just entertainment, but a wonderful way to develop children's imagination.  Also, the creation of such crafts helps to improve the motor skills of children's fingers and favorably affects the mental abilities of the child.  It is necessary to appreciate the creativity of children with admiration, since the craft is a magnificent little thing expressing their creative and mental potential. </p><p>  Read more at <noindex>  <span>Handskill.ru</span> </noindex>  . </p>
