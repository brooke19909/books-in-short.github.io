And this is the island of Crete.  Indeed, this is the center where the mysterious Minoan civilization was formed - not only lovers of the sea come here, but also connoisseurs of archeology and architectural art.  Because where, if not in Greece, this can be admired. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Tourists, choosing the most suitable hotel option, in which one could stay for a few days and be sure that he will fully arrange them in all respects, pay attention to such an important factor as the place where the hotel complex is located.  This is really important.  For example, a hotel located somewhere on the outskirts of the city will not be popular, unlike a hotel that is located right on the first coastline.  And in this case we are talking about Zephiros Beach 4. This hotel is not just near the sea - it is located right on the beach, less than 200 meters separates guests from clear azure water.  In addition, I want to note the immediate proximity to the airport - a little more than 20 kilometers.  This is also important, as some tourists stay in hotels, which take about one and a half to two hours from the airport.  And this is not very pleasant, especially after a difficult flight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  A few words should be said regarding the hotel complex itself.  It was built not so long ago, but has already managed to gain popularity and establish itself as a budget option with good quality of service.  Everyone knows that Greece is a very friendly and hospitable country, and the Zephiros Beach 4 hotel is just as welcoming.  It is made in a traditional national style, with pronounced Greek architectural features.  I would like to note that the hotel area is very well maintained and neatly decorated.  The original octagonal pool, illuminated by bright lights at night, beautiful palm trees, <span>exotic flowers,</span> green vegetation - it's really nice to spend time here. </p><h2>  Near the hotel </h2><p>  It was said that Zephiros Beach 4 is located right on the beach and that the airport is relatively close to it, but this is not all territorial advantages.  For example, it was not said that the hotel is located on a very busy street.  There are numerous souvenir shops, shops, cafes and taverns.  Therefore, if you want to go for a walk - without pleasant souvenir shopping, the tourist will definitely not return to the hotel.  Yes, and I must say, having been in Greece, you can‚Äôt stop by one of the shops and buy fragrant olive oil, collection wine or real coffee there. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Options and cost of accommodation </h2><p>  There are not so many rooms in Zephiros Beach 4 - 85. They are divided into standard single, as well as triple and double rooms.  Also, apartments can be offered to the attention of potential guests.  And, of course, Superior rooms - that is, improved standard ones.  I must say, despite the fact that the hotel corresponds to the class of four stars, the cost of accommodation here is quite small.  So, for example, if we take into account a weekly tour for two, then one person will be kept in the amount of about 11 thousand rubles.  This, as you can see, is very little for the services provided and comfortable rooms.  When booking, potential guests can indicate their personal wishes regarding accommodation: for example, order a double bed in the room or two single beds.  It is better to make reservations in advance, at least a month before the departure date, since the apartments in Zephiros <span>Beach Hotel 4</span> are literally snapping up. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Zephyros Beach is not only a hotel complex, it is also a place where you can spend your leisure time pleasantly.  The hotel administration made sure that guests did not have to get bored.  Of course, the first thing to note is the pool.  Guests can also visit the jacuzzi, enjoy the sauna, watch movies or programs in the TV lounge.  You can also play billiards, table tennis or enjoy water sports.  By the way, in the evening the hotel hosts various entertainment programs. </p><p>  If guests come to rest with their children, then they do not need to worry about the fact that their kids will be bored.  On the territory of this hotel complex there is a swimming pool designed specifically for them, as well as a children's playroom and even a mini club. </p><p>  A few words should be said regarding a beach holiday.  Parasols and sun loungers can be offered to guests for an additional fee.  And one more thing about entertainment.  This hotel is more likely an option for families.  However, young people will also like it here, because Heraklion is nearby, which is less than half an hour's drive away.  It is not only a cultural center, it is also the place of noisy parties, parties, nightclubs and entertainment.  So if you want more ambitious fun, you should go to Heraklion and spend some amazing nights there, which will long remain in your memory as the brightest moments of life. </p>
