This resort today is popular with tourists coming here from different parts of the world.  Of course, people need to stop somewhere.  Before each potential visitor, the question arises: which hotel is better to book a room in?  Well, White Lion 2 * (Hotel 2 *, Nha Trang) will be a great option.  And why, it is worth telling in more detail. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The first thing I would like to note when talking about the White Lion Hotel 2 * hotel is the place where it is located.

In addition, in the immediate vicinity (5 minutes at a calm pace) is a spacious and clean beach.  There is also a popular and visited club called Sea Links. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="white lion 2 hotel" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1136831.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Quadruple apartments </h2><p>  Another category.  It is also very popular, as many travel to Nha Trang with a company or family.  Therefore, the best option is to contact White Lion Hotel 2 * in advance and reserve a four-bed apartment.  They also belong to the deluxe class.  These numbers are also subject to favorable discounts and offers.  For example, if you book apartments long before arrival, you can save a good amount.  For four guests, renting such a room for 14 nights will amount to ... only 37-40 thousand rubles!  And it‚Äôs very cheap, considering that the apartments are also deluxe. </p><p>  The room has a living area of ‚Äã‚Äã45 squares and two spacious double beds.  The room is air-conditioned, its floor is tiled, besides there is a large TV with cable and satellite TV inside.  Coffee and tea making facilities are also available.  The rest - all the same amenities as in the previously described apartments.  Just more space and designed rooms for 4 people. </p>

    <h2>  other services </h2><p>  The White Lion 2 * Hotel does not have a pool (because the sea is nearby), but there is a terrace.  More guests can rent bicycles.  I am glad that the hotel reception is open around the clock, and there is also a tour desk.  Ticket services are also available.  And they can leave their luggage in a storage room. </p><p>  It also offers ironing services, food and drinks can be delivered to the room, in addition, if a person is used to ‚Äúbeing on wheels‚Äù, he has the opportunity to rent a car.  The administration of White Lion 2 * Hotel took care of this.  A paid transfer to or from the airport is provided.  Also, if guests wish, they can be allocated a soundproofed room or one that is designed for non-smokers. </p><h2>  Reservation </h2><p>  It is better to be puzzled by the issue of booking a room in White Lion Hotel 2 * in advance, at least one and a half months before the date of arrival.  Since the hotel belongs to the category of popular, rooms free from guests may simply not stay, especially if it is the high season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel white lion hotel 2" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/1136213.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In White Lion Hotel 2 * special conditions can be offered for guests who come to rest with children.  If the child is under 10 years old, then they are free of charge in existing beds.  In the event that his age exceeds the above mark, then he is considered an adult guest.  So you need to add it to the list of visitors and reserve a room with the appropriate capacity.  It is necessary to take this into account so as not to get into trouble later on due to our own oversight.  These are the rules that the White Lion Hotel 2 * established, and you need to follow them.  By the way, the hotel accepts several cards - ‚ÄúVisa‚Äù, ‚ÄúMasterCard‚Äù, JCB and ‚ÄúAmerican Express‚Äù. </p><h2>  Guest reviews and comments </h2><p>  White Lion Hotel 2 * (Vietnam), despite its low "star rating", is very popular among travelers and tourists.  And why, this can be understood from the foregoing.  A favorable location is, firstly, low prices, and secondly, comfortable conditions and decent staff attitude - thirdly.  People who stayed at White Lion 2 * leave reviews, in any case, only positive! </p>

    <p>  They say that this is a great option with excellent value for money.  Even the cheapest rooms have everything you need.  Cleaned every day, towels changed with the same regularity.  There are still breakfasts that delight with their variety.  Everything is fresh, tasty, original, and even the atmosphere in the cafe is pleasant.  True, they feed guests at a neighboring hotel, but it is in close proximity, so this does not affect the quality of the service provided. </p><p>  In general, if you want to spend an unforgettable vacation, improve the delights of Vietnam and get only positive emotions, while spending a minimum of money on renting a hotel room, you should go here.  Many guests who have already been here, come back here again and again. </p>
