However, a sound economy class is now most in demand in the hotel business. </p><p>  The reception area Best Delta 4 * occupies part of its first floor, with one and a half ceiling height.  The pastel-verdise-colored floor lined with artificial stone sets off the whiteness of the tetrahedral columns.  In the lobby, the reception desk is decorated in the same light colors.

Lighting is professional, matte, not straining the eyes. </p><p>  The hotel itself is equipped with many cozy mini-recreation areas for guests, where you can freely sit down with friends and chat.

    <p>  The balcony is furnished with a plastic table and a pair of armchairs from the same material.  From the upper floors of Best Delta 4 * a picturesque view of the sea opens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The bathroom is equipped with good plumbing, spacious and comfortable.  It regularly updates the set of shampoos, gels, etc. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned daily and linen and towels are changed daily. </p><h2>  Poolside relaxation </h2><p>  The relaxation area by the pool is comfortably equipped.  In its arrangement, the principle of open architecture is used.  The hotel restaurant located its tables both in the corresponding hotel room and on the terrace.  Vacationers take food right on the terrace, sitting in cozy wicker chairs from the vine at round small tables.  Those who wish can also have a meal in the spacious restaurant hall, where a pleasant pastel brown color prevails. </p><p>  Small square tables covered with starchy tablecloths and compact half-chairs are harmonious with the space of the hall. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  We describe the path to the beach.  From Best Delta 4 * you should first walk about twenty minutes along the winding road to the Beach Club, and then go down the stairs.  Thus you can go to the rocky beach of Cala Blava.  It is landscaped and adapted for recreation of adults, confidently swimming.  The fact is that the depth here begins immediately from the coast.  Resting on it, it is advisable to use silicone slippers because of the stones.  But the clear water and many fish on the beach leave a good impression. </p>

    <p>  Families with young children relax on another sandy beach belonging to the S'Arenal resort, located a 15-20 minute drive from the Best Delta 4 * hotel. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The restaurant of the Best Delta Maioris Decima 4 * hotel deserved good reviews.  A team of chefs cooks really delicious.  Guests choosing from the buffet can never repeat the same dish for a week.  The restaurant prepares European and Mediterranean food.  Breakfast, as usual in hotels, is standard: cereal, omelettes, cheeses, sausages. </p><p>  The menu of lunches and dinners always has several types of fish, meat: beef, pork, chicken, liver, turkey, many vegetable dishes, fruits.  Soft drinks for dinner are paid.  A bottle of water costs 2 ‚Ç¨, a glass of juice - 3 ‚Ç¨.  From the drinks of the bar, guests praise the Mojita cocktail for 5 ‚Ç¨ in their reviews. </p><p>  It is naive to believe that tourists who come to a country called the ‚Äúfruit garden of Europe‚Äù will be limited to a menu within the framework of all inclusive.  Most tourists staying in Spain are fully fortified: </p><ul><li>  in May medlar and nispero ripen here; </li><li>  in July oranges, tangerines appear; </li><li>  in September - persimmon, gray ranet, mango, avocado; </li><li>  in October - cherimoya, grapes, pomegranate, quince; </li><li>  in November - clementine, kiwi. </li></ul><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Hotel guests recommend excursions to places associated with the famous personalities of the island (65 ‚Ç¨ per person), to beach parties in Ibiza (75 ‚Ç¨ per person), to Luke Monastery and Sa Calobra Bay (65 ‚Ç¨ per person), to Ams Cave (35 ‚Ç¨ per person), for a sightseeing tour of the island (tourists will pay 300 ‚Ç¨ per group), for real fishing for large sea fish (600 ‚Ç¨ per group). </p>
