    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Despite all the advantages of the Soviva Resort 4 * hotel (Tunisia), the reviews suggest some shortcomings.  So, the following negative comments can be considered the most significant: </p><ul><li>  if you don‚Äôt leave a tip to the maid, you can not even hope for cleaning, as well as replacing linen and towels; </li><li>  there are many ants in the rooms that you will surely bring home in your suitcases; </li><li>  the TV is very old, but because the image quality is poor; </li><li>  dirty and shabby bedding; </li><li>  the air conditioner makes noise, whistles, creaks and makes a lot of unpleasant sounds, because of which it has to be turned off at night; </li><li>  dirty dishes in the dining room; </li><li>  for lunch and dinner, the restaurant always gathers lines near the distribution; </li><li>  the safe boxes are very small, and therefore nothing but money and documents will fit there (all the expensive equipment must be carried around); </li><li>  on the beach, police watch the vacationers, which creates a tense atmosphere; </li><li>  maids do not replenish hygiene supplies, and therefore it is better to bring their own (towels are also recommended to bring with you, as they are very reluctant to change them here); </li><li>  the beach bar is always short of glasses; </li><li>  in the territory, as well as in the halls of the hotel, all possible lighting is turned off at night, and therefore, if you arrive at the hotel at night, you will have to work very hard to find the administrative building, and then your room; </li><li>  despite the fact that the pool is quite large, the Arabs (85% of whom are in the hotel) swim in their national costumes, which take up a lot of space in the water; </li><li>  despite the fact that there are a lot of police and military around the hotel, there are no metal frames in the hotel itself, and no one is inspecting guests at the exit from the bus (given the unstable situation, this is very imprudent); </li><li>  the staff is very cool towards guests, and therefore you should not count on fulfilling requests and prompt response to a comment; </li><li>  due to the fact that the hood does not work well in the kitchen, there is a very strong smell of food in the dining room, which soaks all clothes and hair. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Reviews of the Soviva Resort <span>4 *</span> hotel <span>(Tunisia)</span> do not allow to make an unambiguous impression.  Someone is completely satisfied, while someone categorically denies all the positive aspects inherent in this hotel.  Perhaps it all depends on the purpose of the visit.  If you are a tourist who wants to enjoy high-class service, blue pools and clean beaches, then you are definitely not here.  This hotel is more likely for travelers who seek to see the world as it is and are ready for any unexpected events. <br><br>  To begin with, it is worth saying a little about the specifics of a <span>vacation in Tunisia.</span>  Given the tense military-political situation and the increased threat of terrorist attacks, there are a lot of police and military around the hotel, as well as on the beach.  Nevertheless, the illusion of security dissipates quite quickly.  When you check in, no one will even try to search you for weapons or explosives.  In the process of relaxation, you will often notice people in camouflage who, having put aside their machines, lazily sip tea, play cards and so on. </p><p>  If you want to get to know the Arab culture closer, then here you are.  The fact is that 85% of vacationers are local people.  They are reluctant to make contact, but no conflict situations arise.  The only inconvenience - the Arabs literally occupied the pool.  If not for their voluminous bathing suits, then there would be enough space for everyone, but the fact remains.  But on the beach is always not crowded.  Usually, guests from the CIS countries and Europe rest there.  As for nutrition, it is quite acceptable here.  Only queues at the distribution and poorly washed dishes can spoil the impression.  Yes, and air conditioning in the dining room leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  Going on vacation to this hotel, you should be prepared for the fact that instead of the declared four-star service, you will get 3, or even 2 stars.  This is manifested both in the quality of cleaning, and in the equipment of rooms, and in relation to the staff, and in other significant factors.  You can‚Äôt get into the pool, the beach and the sea as a whole are quite dirty, and therefore you will not get pleasure from water and sun baths.  And there is no place to walk outside the hotel, because this is not Turkey and not Greece.  The only option to get acquainted with Tunisia is excursions, which, at times, can be very long and tiring. </p>
