Modern Nimes (France) is a popular tourist center that welcomes guests all year round. </p><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  The Mediterranean climate of the city of Nimes with hot summers and mild winters, when the temperature rarely drops below 6 degrees, is comfortable for people.  However, it is worth considering that strong winds blow here, the speed of which exceeds 100 kilometers per hour.  Most often they dominate in autumn and winter, and most foreigners come here from April to September. </p><h2>  Some facts about the ancient city </h2><p>  The cozy city of Nimes, located in the picturesque valley of the Rhone River, is the former capital of the Gallic tribe, which was captured by Roman soldiers in 121 BC.  The valiant emperor Augustus founded a city on this site that began to develop economically.  Unfortunately, after only a few centuries, the largest population center of the country was attacked by the Visigoths and Arabs who plundered it. </p><p>  The main industries of the city, located in the south of the state, on the border of Provence and Languedoc, are wine and textile.  So, Nimes (France) became the place where denim was first released - denim. </p><h2>  Les ar√®nes </h2><p>  Incredibly elegant and well-groomed city, very reminiscent of colorful Paris in miniature, does not look like a provincial one.  The real open-air museum, nicknamed the "French Rome", boasts an abundance of historical corners, keeping many secrets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nim france sights" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1783019.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From past eras there remained a huge number of antique architectural monuments, among which the most important is the oval amphitheater of Les Arenes, erected even before our era.  Built on the model of the Roman Coliseum, the building received approximately 25 thousand spectators, spellbound watching the battles of gladiators and performances with the participation of predators and prisoners sentenced to death.  In the Middle Ages, it was used as a defensive fortification, and residential buildings grew inside it, demolished after the decision of local authorities to restore the ancient monument, which is now proud of Him (France). </p><h2>  Maison carr√©e </h2><p>  The ancient Roman temple Maison Carr√©, which reached the descendants in good condition, is located in the heart of the city.  He managed to survive thanks to the fact that he turned into a Christian church, and in the Middle Ages the building was not destroyed.  Since the 19th century, the National Museum has been located on its territory, introducing visitors to interesting historical exhibits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nim france" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1782979.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Jardins de la fontaine </h2><p>  The delightful garden of the Fountains, which is a favorite place for walking, originally supplied the city of Him with drinking water.  Later, the luxurious corner turned into a huge complex with a theater, baths, a temple and an imperial palace.  In the middle of the XVIII century, the authorities decided to build a park on this site, and the ancient Roman statues, elegant fountains and double staircases very successfully fit into the classical style of a green oasis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Temple de Diane (Nimes, France) </h2><p>  What else to see for tourists in a picturesque park?  Here are the most famous sights that enjoy well-deserved fame.  The dilapidated temple of Diana, erected in the II century, causes a lot of controversy among scientists who believe that this is not a religious monument, but therms with large halls decorated with columns. </p><h2>  Tour magne </h2><p>  An interesting object of Gallo-Romanesque architecture immediately attracts attention - an unusual-looking Mane tower, included in the list of historical monuments of France, which are protected by UNESCO.  Amazing panoramas of a beautiful city open from the observation deck of the former mausoleum of a wealthy Roman. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nim france what to see" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1783023.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pont du gard </h2><p>  The colorful Nimes (France), whose sights reflect its rich past, is incredibly proud of the oldest aqueduct more than 275 meters long, built in the 1st century AD.  The two-story high construction of the Pont du Gard was part of a multi-kilometer water supply, from which life-giving moisture entered the city.  Later, the excellently preserved aqueduct was used as a bridge for crossing <span>horse-drawn</span> carts <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof him" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1783005.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bullfighting and Theater Activities </h2><p>  Residents of the administrative center of the Gard department have long been passionate lovers of bullfighting, and it is no coincidence that five-day festivals are held in the arenas of the city, including the amphitheater, at which bullfighters from around the world show their skills. </p><p>  The French pearl also adores theater performances, dedicated to various periods of history.  In the evening, when the heat subsides, tourists continue to have fun in nightclubs and theme bars, tasting the best wines that ancient Nimes (France) is famous for all over the country. </p><p>  The modern city, the architectural monuments of which it is very difficult to describe in one article, is a paradise for history buffs.  In Nimes, which reverently keeps the memory of the past, time has stopped, and every tourist unwittingly becomes a participant in important events, getting acquainted with ancient sights. </p>
