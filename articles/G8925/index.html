For this Asian country, it is difficult to choose the words that are suitable for the description, because it is unique and original.  The land of the rising sun is the most modern technologies and ancient temples, blooming sakura and the snow-white cap of Fuji, incredible art objects and delicious dishes of national cuisine.  But words alone in order to describe the unique flavor of this country are still not enough.  Discover the soul of this island nation can only trip to Japan. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Trip to japan" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1712462.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The country of the rising sun through the eyes of a tourist </h2><p>  Every student knows that the state of Japan consists of an archipelago of islands.  The largest are: </p><ul><li>  Hokkaido </li><li>  Okinawa. </li><li>  Kyushu. </li><li>  Honshu. </li><li>  Shikoku. </li></ul><p>  Traditionally, the main island of the country is Honshu.  The Japanese conditionally divide it into several parts, in which life differs significantly from each other.  For foreigners, all Japanese seem to be similar to each other, but in fact this statement is very far from reality.  Each island has its own dialect, traditions and cultural monuments.  Therefore, a short trip to Japan will not always provide an opportunity to see the diversity of this country.  But even a week-long stay on the territory of the island state will give you an unforgettable experience and invaluable experience. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Japan as a tourist destination </h2><p>  It is worth noting that Japan has always been an exotic tourist destination that not everyone can decide on.  This is influenced by many factors, including the remoteness of the country and the relatively high cost of a tourist permit.  Although at the beginning of the twentieth century, the Land of the Rising Sun began to experience a surge in interest in its culture.  This was reflected in the opening of a large number of Japanese restaurants around the world, cultural centers and, of course, the influx of tourists.  Our compatriots also did not pass by the fashion trend and the Russians began to actively buy tours to Japan. </p><p>  Trips to the Land of the Rising Sun stopped after the Fukushima accident.  It was a sad time for Japan - a large number of people died, radioactive waste from the surrounding territories became infected, the economy began to decline, and tourists began to be wary of traveling to the Japanese islands. </p><p>  Over time, the situation changed, and Putin‚Äôs trip to Japan in 2016 again stirred up Russian interest in his strategic and economic partner.  It is worth noting that our president was very warmly received by the Japanese prime minister and several important agreements were signed during the meeting.  As a result, a trip to Japan has become a very affordable and attractive way to spend a vacation.  Today, many Russians prefer independent travel to the Land of the Rising Sun.  Why are they more popular than package tours?  We will try to clarify this point. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Travel package or independent travel: pros and cons </h2><p>  A tourist trip to Japan can be of two types: </p><ul><li>  independent; </li><li>  as part of a group. </li></ul><p>  Both options have their pros and cons, so we won‚Äôt advise you anything, but simply list all the nuances of the trip. </p><p>  If a trip to Japan for you is a strict orderliness, a company of compatriots and the absence of any worries, then, of course, choose the purchase of a travel package.  Thus, you will deprive yourself of some sense of freedom and excitement, but at the same time you will feel quite calm in such an unusual country as Japan.  In addition, the agency will take care of all the documentary issues, and you will only have to pay for the visa and arrive at the airport on time. </p><p>  A trip to Japan is fraught with a number of difficulties.  But believe that they are all surmountable.  You will need some effort to get a visa, make a route and find cheap flights and hotels.  But in the end, you will get an incredible trip, during which you can explore almost any corner of the country.  Each of them has its own unique flavor and is worth it to spend at least one day there. </p><p>  If you are attracted to an independent trip to Japan, then our article will prove to be an indispensable source of useful and important information for you.  So, we begin to plan a trip to the Land of the Rising Sun. </p><h2>  Trip planning </h2><p>  What do you need to travel to Japan?  In principle, not very much, but preparation will still require some effort from travelers.  Before you start collecting suitcases, you need to perform the following items on the list: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  choose travel dates; </li><li>  create a travel budget; </li><li>  to issue tickets; </li><li>  to book a hotel; </li><li>  make a route; </li><li>  apply for a visa; </li><li>  write a list of attractions. </li></ul><p>  It doesn't look too hard, does it?  Therefore, a trip to Japan is independently accessible even to those travelers who have never traveled outside our country without a guide accompanying them. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="A trip to Japan for two" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1712475.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Japan: the best time to travel </h2><p>  In the Land of the Rising Sun, it‚Äôs just an amazing climate, thanks to which the air temperature very rarely drops to minus indicators.  And this makes the country accessible for tourism at any time of the year. </p><p>  Despite this, it is not worth planning a vacation for the summer months - June and August.  Typically, in June, frequent rain spoils the mood for tourists, and in August the trip will be complicated by increased humidity and unbearable heat.  This is especially felt in megacities, where asphalt literally melts from the hot sun.  But in shopping centers you will constantly freeze from air conditioners turned on at full capacity. </p><p>  Many tourists say that a <span>trip to Japan</span> for two can be very romantic.  Therefore, wedding agencies often recommend this country for a honeymoon.  Usually a trip to Japan is offered for a week, but the newlyweds, returning home, always talk about the fact that this time was not enough for them to enjoy an unusual and unique country.  Many come back here repeatedly in other seasons.  This factor explains the country's incredible attractiveness for romantic couples - each season in Japan has its own color and smell.  The seasons here have a vivid characteristic, but each of them is surprisingly beautiful. </p><p>  For example, April is the time of sakura blossom.  The whole country is immersed in a pink veil, past which it is simply impossible to pass without stopping.  Hardworking Japanese at this time take several days off and spend them contemplating incredible beauty. </p><p>  <span>Autumn is</span> very warm <span>in Japan</span> , and the whole country acquires a rich crimson hue.  Getting into the autumn rock garden is simply an indescribable pleasure for the soul.  Forgetting this sight is simply impossible. </p><p>  If you want to plunge into a fairy tale, then for you - a winter trip to Japan.  Reviews of tourists about this trip are simply replete with enthusiastic epithets.  Despite the fact that the piercing wind can slightly spoil the impression of relaxation, hot springs and comfortable ski resorts will quickly change things and add positive emotions. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tourist trip to Japan" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1712474.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Travel budget </h2><p>  Of course, you can go on vacation alone, but still we are more interested in a trip to Japan for two.  Its estimated cost can be guided by planning a trip alone. </p><p>  Naturally, the most expensive budget item is air travel, although Japan can also be reached by sea.  This method is mainly chosen by residents of Vladivostok and nearby cities.  And the rest of the potential travelers choose the usual movement by plane.  Two airlines operate from Moscow and St. Petersburg in this direction: </p><ul><li>  <span>Japan Airlines</span> ; </li><li>  Aeroflot </li></ul><p>  The cost of the flight is approximately the same, the level of comfort both airlines provide is quite high.  The price of a flight in all seasons is kept at a significant level, so it is better to book tickets for six months.  Then there is the opportunity to save a little.  On average, a two-way ticket from Moscow for two people will cost seventy thousand rubles.  Moreover, this amount often fluctuates in both directions. </p><p>  Be sure to include accommodation, travel around the country and sightseeing in the expense line.  We will talk more about this in the following subheadings of the article.  Food is the smallest part of the budget, of course, if you do not intend to turn your trip into a gastronomic tour of the country.  In general, taking into account all the above points, the cost of a weekly trip to Japan will be one hundred fifty - one hundred seventy thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Visa application </h2><p>  This is the most difficult stage of preparation for the trip.  Many Russians have great difficulty applying for a visa to the Land of the Rising Sun.  What documents are needed to travel to Japan?  Unfortunately for inexperienced tourists, this list is quite extensive. </p><p>  In addition to standard papers, such as a passport, copies of it and bank statements, you will need an invitation from the host country.  And it can only be given by a hotel in which a room is booked, a travel company or Japanese friends.  If you do not have either one, then you can forget about a visa to Japan. </p><p>  Usually, Russians prefer to transfer the right to draw up documents for travel to Japan to a travel company.  Of course, you have to pay about one hundred and fifty dollars.  But in this case, you can be sure that in two or three weeks you will have a passport with a treasured visa in your hands.  Sometimes travel agents in addition to money for their services offer tourists to buy from them several excursion programs.  Most often, Russians agree, because all this in any case is easier than to draw up documents on their own. </p><h2>  Living in Japan: budget options and not so </h2><p>  In the Land of the Rising Sun it is difficult to stay for long in any one city, because you want to see so many interesting and unusual things.  Therefore, be sure that you will spend no more than two nights in the same hotel.  Many tourists generally give one day to each of the major cities in Japan. </p><p>  When looking at hotels, keep in mind that they are all divided into two categories: </p><ul><li>  European </li><li>  Japanese </li></ul><p>  The latter will suit lovers of national color.  Already at the reception you will be asked to take off your clothes and put on a kimono, then you can visit the national bathhouse, fed with thermal water from the geysers, and taste delicious sushi that you could not try in any other country in the world. </p><p>  European hotels are focused on numerous tourists and are quite typical.  The cost of a double room in a five-star Tokyo hotel is equal to one hundred and seventy dollars.  Helpful staff will offer you breakfast in the morning. </p><p>  If you are not ready to spend such amounts on accommodation, then look at the hotels in a lower class.  The advantage of Japan is that even two-star hotels are usually well equipped, sterile clean and provide a high level of service.  The only inconvenience may be the size of the room - some of them do not exceed six square meters.  Such a pleasure will cost travelers an average of fifty to one hundred dollars per night. </p><p>  Japanese hostels are also a good option for an overnight stay.  A bed in a room for several people will cost you forty dollars.  For this money, a shared shower, free internet and a kettle are at your disposal.  You cannot find a cheaper option. </p><p>  Some travelers prefer to rent apartments, but keep in mind that this is not the most convenient and cheapest option for living in the country.  For a large sum, you can get a small apartment with "cardboard" walls. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Trip to japan reviews" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1712473.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Travel itineraries: traditional and not quite ordinary </h2><p>  The route depends on how much you know the country and immerse yourself in its culture, so it‚Äôs worth taking it very seriously.  If you have a trip to Japan, the reviews of tourists who have already been here should for some time become your guide to action. </p><p>  Familiarity with the country is better to start with traditional routes, so leave all the delights for the next trip (and it will definitely happen).  A week will be very acceptable to explore Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka.  All of them are located on the <span>island of Honshu.</span>  In each of the above cities, you will be interested at any time of the year.  In Tokyo, Europeans are absolutely surprised by everything, but in order not to overload yourself with impressions, confine yourself to a few attractions: </p><ul><li>  visit any local restaurant where sushi is made - we assure you, the delight you will receive is simply incredible; </li><li>  examine Koke - the castle of the emperor and his family; </li><li>  Disneyland </li><li>  Miraikan Museum is an amazing place where the future is already becoming present. </li></ul><p>  After the bustling Tokyo, Nagoya may seem surprisingly calm to you.  There are incredibly many thermal springs, where you can relax even under winter snowfall.  Such a rest is simply indescribable experience, which you will definitely want to experience again in the near future.  Nagoya ski resorts are also good, but if they do not appeal to you, then visit a small village in the vicinity of the city.  Here, the life of the Japanese was preserved in its original form, as if you went by a time machine two hundred years ago.  This incredible sight will definitely appeal even to those who have never been interested in the culture of Japan. </p>

    <p>  Osaka is ideal for walking on it.  During a quiet walk, you will surely stumble upon a couple of museums, look into the park and be sure to spend time visiting the aquarium.  This city is practically created for independent travelers who are ready to patiently discover it for themselves. </p><p>  If you have little experience, then deviate from the traditional route and visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  These cities will turn your view of the Japanese and the tragedy that happened to them more than seventy years ago. </p><p>  For those who can not do without a day on the beach, we can advise Okinawa.  The Japanese themselves do not really like this type of vacation, but for foreigners they have built numerous hotels with a high level of service and developed infrastructure. </p><h2>  Tips of an experienced tourist </h2><p>  In order for the results of a trip to Japan not to be deplorable, inexperienced travelers should know about some of the features of a vacation in the Land of the Rising Sun: </p><ul><li>  in the cafe, champing and sipping are welcomed, this is considered an expression of pleasure from the food consumed; </li><li>  it is better to travel around the country with the help of high-speed trains; it is cheaper to buy a Japan Rail Pass ticket; </li></ul>

    <p>  Of course, Japan is just an incredible country.  It captures the mind and penetrates the heart of a European tourist.  It is almost impossible to get enough of it, each new journey opens up other facets of this island nation.  If we managed to arouse your interest in the Land of the Rising Sun, and you firmly decided to go here soon, do not forget to return a detailed report on your trip to Japan upon your return.  Perhaps for someone it will be very useful. </p>
