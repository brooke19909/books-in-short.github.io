We suggest you go to the relatively small, but no less famous town of Side, located 75 km from Antalya, to the newest Dream World Aqua 5 * hotel here. </p><p>  Having arisen 300 years BC, Side has seen a lot in its long century.  He had a chance to learn and a fabulous flowering, and complete collapse.  Now it is a relatively calm resort town, in which gray-haired antiquity perfectly coexists with amazing modernity. </p><p>  A vivid example of this is the Dream World Aqua hotel.  It has been functioning a little over a year, so everything here sparkles with novelty and purity.  Due to its stylish look, the hotel fits perfectly into the colorful view of the city.  Designers and designers tried to create a real paradise for tourists here.  Let's see what they did. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Tourists have no consensus on the convenience of the Dream World Aqua 5 * location.  Side is located on a small peninsula, washed on three sides by the Mediterranean Sea.  It is 75 km from the main regional city of Antalya, and only 15 km from the popular Manavgat among tourists.  Many people call Side a city-museum, because literally every corner here is covered with legends and recalls the glorious deeds of bygone days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dream World Aqua 5" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1531560.jpg" width="508"></div>  Here in such a wonderful place in 2015, hospitably opened the doors of Dream World Aqua 5 * for tourists.  Its guests can quickly and easily reach all the main attractions, the market, shopping centers, since they are less than 6 km away.  From this side, everyone likes the location of the hotel.  But it‚Äôs about 800 meters from the coast, which some tourists have been complaining about.  Another minus mentioned in the reviews is that there are no interesting natural objects around the hotel, only other hotels and the highway.

Flights from many Russian cities are carried out here.  On the highway, the distance to the hotel is a little over 60 km, which is not so much for modern comfortable transfers.  But taking into account the fact that tourists are always brought to other hotels along the way, the travel time stretches for 1.5-2 hours. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The full name of the hotel is Dream World Aqua Resort <span>SPA 5 *.</span>  It is located on a solid area of ‚Äã‚Äã23,000 square meters.  Since the hotel is new, its territory can not yet boast of a chic garden.  Most of the trees here are still young, but landscape designers have tried to plant them in such a way as to beautifully distinguish between separate zones, and in the future to get cozy rest areas for people of all ages.  But even now, curly-cut evergreen bushes and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãall kinds of flowers give the territory a pleasant look.  Its main part is occupied by the water park and huge pools.  There was also a place for a free car park, several bars, multiple sports grounds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dream World Aqua Resort SPA 5" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1531513.jpg" width="507"></div>
