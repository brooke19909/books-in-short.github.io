    <p>  A clearly expressed ideological focus on exaltation of the cult of the pharaoh and the ruling elite is a distinctive feature of that period.  This suggests that the art of Ancient Egypt was the first reflection of class inequality.  Most clearly, these trends are traced in monumental painting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The history of art of <span>Ancient Egypt</span> (in particular, architecture and painting) has <br>  several stages of its development.  With the advent of the first monumental buildings, there was a need to somehow design them.  <span>Wall painting</span> received the specific goal of its existence - to fill the artificially created space, while perpetuating the exploits of people.

    <p>  Since the slave system is the main form of the state of Ancient Egypt, painting (the dynamics of its development) was subject to the influence of the ruling elite.  The main figure depicted was the pharaoh.  He was endowed with a super-powerful body, portrait images were idealized, and his greatness was emphasized by the environment of the gods. </p><p>  Two types of mural painting technique were used.  They were either performed by tempera on a dry surface, or by embedding colored pastes in previously made recesses.  The paints were natural - of mineral origin. </p><p>  In the art of Ancient Egypt, the content of the paintings and the rules for placing them on the walls were well-established.  The king was portrayed larger than slaves, and was always motionless.  The paintings glorified the deeds of the pharaoh, and if they were located on the walls of the tomb, they were scenes of ritual significance, designed to give the king bliss in the afterlife. </p><p>  The painting and architecture of Ancient Egypt, and now striking the imagination with its grand scale and bright colors. </p>
