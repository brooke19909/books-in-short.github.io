And today there are a huge number of possibilities for this, one of which we will consider today.  This is crocheting a rug for the home.  Let's take a closer look at how to make a rectangular rug crocheted.  The scheme for beginners will help to make it even for an inexperienced knitter. </p><h2>  Rectangular crochet mat: simple outline and description </h2><p>  Today, it becomes very fashionable to decorate your home with handmade products.  Many things for interior decoration are hand-made, for example, pillowcases for decorative pillows, baskets of knitted yarn or rugs.  Such things in the house give a special touch and cosiness.  In this article, we will just consider the basic principles of knitting such a rug for the home, the basics of creating such a thing from all kinds of yarn.  Let's try to crochet a rectangular rug.  The schemes that will be required for this will be presented below. </p><h2>  The choice of yarn for the future rug </h2><p>  In order to craft a rectangular rug crocheted, you need not only a diagram.  You must first select the yarn from which it will be made.  Nowadays, the variety of yarn suitable for these purposes is simply huge.  The main point that should be taken into account in the choice of yarn is its thickness. </p><p>  For products of this type, it is preferable to choose a thick and rather coarse thread.  Most often knitters choose knitted options for crocheting rectangular rugs according to the scheme.  There are a lot of manufacturers of such yarn, and the color scheme is very wide.  Therefore, anyone can choose the option to taste.  Often use a mixture of cotton with acrylic or pure synthetics that stretches.  There are also cotton cords, which are also often used for products of this type.  In general, the choice is quite wide and you should be guided only by your taste and wishes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Floor mat </h2><p>  Another important point when choosing materials for the manufacture of the rug is the choice of substrate.  The fact is that if the mat is planned to be laid on a laminate, linoleum or other similar surface, then there is a high probability that the product will slide.  And for these purposes, it makes sense to put special material under it that will prevent this from happening.  Such substrates are sold in any construction or hardware store and are quite inexpensive. </p><p>  So, consider the principles of crocheting a rectangular rug with a pattern.  This is not at all difficult, especially when there are basic, basic skills in crocheting and the ability to read patterns.  There are quite a lot of offers on the Internet, but we will consider the simplest crocheted rectangular rug patterns. </p><h2>  Rectangular Rug Crochet - Pattern for Beginners </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scheme 1" class="if uuid-3117418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/120544/3117418.jpg"></div><p>  The first option for making a rug by a crochet suggests that knitting starts from the middle of the rug and knits in a circle with increases in four sides, gradually increasing the dimensions of the rug to the desired ones. </p><h2>  Detailed description of the circuit </h2><p>  We collect a chain of air loops.  Its length depends on what length and width of the rug you require.  Typically, for a small rug measuring about 80 x 50 cm, you need to dial about 20 stitches from thick knitted yarn.  Next, in the very last loop, knit seven crochet stitches and knit the first row of crochet stitches to the end of the chain.  At the end of the chain, in the last loop again, seven double crochets should be made, thus forming the symmetrical edges of the future rug.  Next, we knit crochet posts in the same chain of air loops.  Knitting takes place in a circle.  This chain in the diagram below is indicated by the number 1. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After completing the first row in a circle, we make two or three air loops and continue to knit the crochets in the second row, reaching the place where we knitted seven crochets in one loop.  In this place, in the second of seven columns, we again knit seven double crochets, then we knit three double crochets and again seven double crochets in one loop.  So we form two corners of one of the edges of the mat.  Again we knit a series of double crochet stitches to the place where we have seven double crochet stitches in one loop and repeat everything written above with the other edge of the mat.  So we completed row number 2 in the diagram below. </p><p>  As a result, we carry out as many rows as we need to the desired size of the rug, without forgetting to increase the number of double crochet knitted between the corners of the rug.  And the corners of the product are conventionally called seven crochets, which we knit at four corners. </p><h2>  The following scheme for crocheting a rectangular rug </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="scheme 2" class="if uuid-3116845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/120544/3116845.jpg"></div><p>  The scheme indicated above differs from the previous one in the style of knitting and the density of the future rug.  Such a product turns out to be openwork, loose, but nevertheless beautiful and original.  Here 13 air loops are knitted initially, and already from them again we knit in rows in a circle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  First row - we collect three air loops, which then will serve as a double crochet.  In the same loop we knit two more double crochet and knit one air loop.  We knit the next three double crochet through two air loops, as shown in the diagram.  And so on, with the only difference being that from the extreme sides between the three double crochets, we knit not one air loop, but two. </p><p>  Thus, we knit the second, third and further rows, increasing the size of the rug to the necessary.  Such a product turns out to be loose and it is better for him to use a slightly smaller hook than the manufacturer recommends.  This will make the knitting not too loose. </p><p>  The following scheme is similar to the previous one with the difference that the increments with the help of air loops are made in four places, and between the columns the air loops are not made.  Columns fit in straight rows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scheme 3" class="if uuid-3117427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/120544/3117427.jpg"></div><h2>  Another knitting option </h2><p>  There is also a scheme and description of a rectangular rug crocheted.  A product is knitted along it, which is something average in density between the first and second options.  Here, openwork rows with air loops alternate with rows, where the crochet posts are knitted in continuous. </p><p>  So, again we collect a chain of air loops.  It can be of any length, depending on what size rug is planned to knit. </p><p>  The first row of crocheted columns with a continuous fabric, in each loop.  The increments are made from two ends of the chain, while three columns are knitted in one loop, then an air loop is made and three columns are knitted again in the same loop, again an air loop and three columns.  Thus, in the extreme loop there are nine columns and between them two air loops. </p><p>  On the other hand, we make chains of air loops of increase in the same way.  As a result, we knit the first row in a circle, with two increases on both sides. </p><p>  We knit the second row again with double crochet, which alternate through one air loop.  The additions here are already being made in four places, as indicated on the diagram while forming the corners of the mat. </p><p>  The third and fourth rows are knitted like the second, only between the increments more columns with crochets are made, expanding the canvas. </p><p>  The fifth row is knitted in solid columns, in each loop, without air loops.  And then we repeat knitting from the second, through the fifth row alternately.  That is, three rows make columns alternately with air loops and the fourth row are continuous columns without air loops. </p><p>  Crocheting a rectangular rug can be done in another way.  It can be changed at will, for example, rows with air loops should be made not in three, but in one or in two with continuous rows.  Or, on the contrary, knit several continuous rows, and there will be one row with air loops.  It all depends on the taste and desire of the needlewoman.  If you knit such a rug with multi-colored threads, it will turn out even more interesting.  The following is another crochet pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="barbantesaofrancisco.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="scheme 4" class="if uuid-3116869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/120544/3116869.jpg"></div><p>  And here is another rectangular crocheted rug.  The diagram below is also not particularly difficult for a beginner needlewoman. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yourcrochet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="scheme 7" class="if uuid-3116837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/120544/3116837.jpg"></div><p>  This pattern is similar to the ones above, but there are differences in how the increments are made.  They are formed by knitting three air loops between the bundles of three double crochets.  Increases are made on both sides of the air chain.  So the first row fits.  Moreover, it should be noted that bundles of three double crochets are woven into the original chain of air loops and they are not diluted with air loops. </p><p>  The next row is knitted in a similar way, but four increases are already being made, and the bundles of columns between them increase in quantity.  The pattern for the rug is less openwork due to the absence of air loops between the bundles of columns.  But some airiness is still present in it, which makes it interesting and beautiful. </p><p>  There is an even simpler rectangular crochet rug with diagrams and description to do when knitting starts not from the middle, but from one edge.  The mat simply grows in subsequent rows to the desired size.  There are schemes when a coarse and thick thread, for example, jute, is taken as the basis of the rug.  It becomes, as it were, a frame for a rug, which in the end turns out to be rather tough and more suitable for outdoor use, for example, on balconies and verandas.  And if you choose soft fantasy threads, for example, ‚Äúgrass‚Äù, then the rug will turn out fluffy, soft and pleasant to the touch.  Such rugs can and should be knitted in the nursery.  They will be quite easy to wash, and made with your own hands, they will fit perfectly into the interior and just warm you with warmth. </p><h2>  Mat color </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lovecrochet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="multi-colored rug" class="if uuid-3116877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/120544/3116877.jpg"></div><p>  Consider the various schemes and description of other crochet rugs.  As for the color gamut of such products, there are also many options here - from plain to rugs made from sectional yarn.  You can also use yarn with a transitional color.  At first, such a rug has a dark shade of color, and then it smoothly turns into a lighter one.  Sometimes knitters use several multi-colored, contrasting skeins of yarn and form some kind of pattern from them.  Some knit sections of yarn of different colors, and then sew these motifs in a checkerboard, alternating, chaotic or any other order, thus forming a rug. </p><h2>  Other knitting options </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ravelry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="square rug" class="if uuid-3116879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/120544/3116879.jpg"></div><p>  Rugs knitted in rainbow colors look interesting.  There are knitting options when the craftswoman uses two threads at once at the same time and an interesting mixed color product is obtained. </p><h2>  Yarn structure for a specific room </h2><p>  To crochet the rug according to the scheme and description, you need to choose not only the color of the yarn, but also its composition.  As for the structure of the yarn, then, as mentioned above, it all depends on which room the product fits into.  If this is a room in which there are often a lot of people and where you often have to clean (kitchen, for example), then you should knit a smooth, dense rug, which will then be easy to vacuum or shake.  And in the bedroom it is worth making some more comfortable option.  It can be fluffy or made of some softer and more pleasant yarn, which it will be a pleasure to walk with bare feet. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In general, there are many options.  It is worth taking a closer look at each and choosing the most suitable in your case.  Guided by this is not only their taste and wishes, but also approach the issue from the point of view of practicality.  It is important to consider for which room the product is made, who will live in it, and how much such a rug will fit into the overall design of the room. </p>
