Is it possible to rest somewhere in our country, when autumn is already approaching its equator or even stepped over it?  Maybe you should look for happiness in Turkey, Egypt or other southern parts?  Let's look at the warmest city of the Russian Federation, Sochi.  It is located, as you know, near the slowly cooling Black Sea, under the protection of the high Caucasus mountains.  Such an arrangement makes the microclimate in Sochi very attractive in October.  Rest, prices, hotels in the all-Russian resort in the middle of autumn - we will consider all this in our article.  The information was taken to a large extent from the reviews of tourists who visited Sochi this month.  In the article you will also find useful information about what things to take with you on vacation, what events will take place at the resort, what to do there in October. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacation in sochi in october" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/983676.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  It is believed that the swimming season in the Krasnodar Territory, where the city of Sochi is located, lasts from May to the end of September.  In the first <span>month of autumn</span> , the "velvet season" begins, when the temperature of water and air are practically compared.  The thermometer column stops at +23 degrees comfortable for the body. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The high mountains of the Caucasus reliably shelter the city from the dank northeast winds.  Therefore, such a fertile microclimate is being established here.  But to taste the delights of the velvet season, the Russian elite gathers in Sochi.  Therefore, you can‚Äôt count on a budget vacation in September.  And then October comes.  The daylight hours are reduced, and in connection with this, the nights become cold, and the morning and evening hours become fresh.  Meteorologists have noted an increase in rainfall.  But they do not really affect the <span>rest in Sochi in September-October.</span> </p><p>  Another picture occurs when autumn passes over the "equator".  In the second half of October, weather can upset vacationers with a downpour, and the sea can frighten a serious storm.  Moreover, the water will be cloudy for another two days.  But the temper in autumn weather in Sochi is changeable.  The southern sun will come out again, quickly dry the puddles, and again it will be possible to sunbathe and even swim. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacations in sochi in october reviews" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/983524.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Vacation in Sochi in October: weather </h2><p>  According to reviews of tourists, choosing a resort in mid-autumn, you need to rely on luck.  In some years, as, for example, in 2011, all of October was hot in summer, and it rained rarely.  Typically, rainfall occurs at night, but it also happens that rainfall will charge for the whole day.  At the same time, the sea has not yet cooled.  It is deep on the Sochi coast, and therefore keeps summer warmth.  It so happens that the temperature of the water is higher than air!  The Caucasus Mountains are the main factor influencing the rest in Sochi in October.  If the slopes after the peaks are covered with snow, wait for bad weather.  Cold air descends from the mountains - boron.  The wind raises waves in the sea.  But this phenomenon passes as quickly as it begins.  The very next day, water can be +20, and air - +25 degrees.  Reviews are advised to go to the beach at eleven in the morning and leave it at four in the afternoon.  With sunset, the temperature of the mountain air begins to plummet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi in October vacation prices" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/983634.jpg" width="499"></div>

Umbrella should be packed in a suitcase.  It‚Äôs also good to take a couple of warm clothes with you so as not to spoil your vacation in Sochi in October with a cold.  But there are plenty of warm days in the middle of the autumn at the resort.  Therefore, we take bathing suits, shorts, t-shirts, sandals, slippers.  For people with a light skin tone, it is not superfluous to grab a sunscreen.  We proceed from what we plan to do in Sochi.  Visit the water park?  Go to Krasnaya Polyana on a lift to the mountains?  In the second case, you should take not just autumn sweaters, but also a jacket and a hat with gloves.  For trips on excursions, stock up on suitable shoes.  Reviews are advised to take two pairs of sneakers.  A raincoat will also not be amiss.  Need warm clothes and when visiting the <span>Vorontsov caves.</span>  Indeed, underground all year round the same temperature - +9 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacation in sochi in october all inclusive" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/983725.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Things to do in October Sochi </h2><p>  Many vacationers are frightened by the thought that they will find cafes boarded up for the winter and closed excursion bureaus at the resort.  But this is not so.  Holidays in Sochi in October, reviews of tourists are called measured, but not at all boring.  The main influx of tourists subsides, local residents cease to beat the fever of profit.  The atmosphere in the city is becoming more soulful.  But Sochi is a year-round resort.  Sanatoriums are still working, where you can improve your health.  And the main entertainment complexes continue to function as usual.  You can visit the aquarium in the park "Riviera" or relax in the water park "Lighthouse".  In the summer, the heat discouraged any desire to go on excursions to the mountains.  In October, ecotourism comes to the fore.  Mountains, painted in bright colors in the fall, simply attract you to yourself.  You can also go fishing or pick mushrooms.  Tour agencies organize tours to the waterfalls, which are gaining power by the fall.  You can go horseback riding or jeeps on SUVs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacation in sochi in september october" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/983720.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  What to try in October Sochi </h2><p>  Do you know that the inhabitants of the North Caucasus also have their own analogue of Beaujolais Nouveau?  If you came to rest in Sochi in October, reviews strongly recommend tasting the young Majari wine, made according to the old recipes of the Highlanders.  This drink can not be stored for a long time, so it is sold at low prices, because there are already few tourists.  Those vacationers who found in Sochi the end of October can enjoy roasted chestnuts.  Just the time comes for their harvest.  You can pick them yourself.  But it‚Äôs better not to stab your hands, but to buy a bag of hot chestnuts from street vendors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacation in sochi in october weather" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/983724.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Events in Sochi</span> in October </h2><p>  Of course, most theater troupes and pop stars prefer to travel to this city in high season.  Then you can put together a full audience hall, and even relax.  But the middle of the month does not mean calm in the cultural life of the city.  The Winter Theater hosts performances by the best theater groups in Russia.  So a beach and sightseeing vacation in Sochi in October can be combined with trips to performances or music concerts.  In 2014, it was in the second month of autumn at this Caucasian resort that the Formula 1 racing car competition took place.  True, prices also soared during this period.  There are always many interesting sporting events taking place in Krasnaya Polyana.  Lifts at this ski resort are open all year.  <span>Sochi arboretum</span> in October is especially beautiful.  Choose a nice day to enjoy the <span>chrysanthemum ball.</span>  <span>Museums in Sochi</span> in October operate normally.  On a rainy day, you can spend time in the Art Gallery or the House of Nikolai Ostrovsky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacation in sochi in october tourist reviews" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/983723.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Prices for holidays in Sochi in October </h2><p>  The undoubted advantage of the autumn resort is that literally everything is getting cheaper here.  Demand for housing is falling, and this means that property owners are looking for you, not you.  True, in the Central District, hotels keep their high bar.  But in the resort villages of Greater Sochi (Dagomys, Loo, Khosta, Matsesta) prices are reduced by 25-50% of August.  The same situation is observed in the markets.  Vegetables and fruits, as if by magic, are getting cheaper.  So you can relax here without prejudice to the family budget. </p><h2>  Housing prices in October </h2><p>  What was the situation in the rental housing market in 2015?  In the private sector, prices started from 500 rubles per person per night.  In guest houses and mini-hotels, the cost of living is already higher - from a thousand rubles.  The best rest in Sochi in October, reviews are recommended to search in the sanatoriums - there you can eat and heal.  True, the cost of living is from 2000 rubles.  Hotels with breakfast are also nice.  Often an indoor pool is located on their territory.  Such a vacation will cost from 1800 rubles per night. </p><h2>  Prices for All Inclusive Hotels </h2><p>  It is clear that the above cost of rental housing makes staying at the resort very budget.  But if we want to relax to the fullest, with maximum comfort, without thinking especially where to find food, is such a vacation possible in Sochi in October?  ‚ÄúAll Inclusive‚Äù is a favorite format of Russian tourists.  And in Sochi, <span>hoteliers</span> understood <span>this a</span> long time ago.  Some hotels with All Inclusive are located in the city center.  This is the spa hotel Neva International, boarding house Breeze, sanatorium Zapolyarye.  But more comfortable conditions for the same money are offered by hotels located in Greater Sochi.  Among them stands the boarding house ‚ÄúAqua Loo‚Äù.  It is located in the village of Loo.  The price of accommodation (1500 rubles per day) includes not only food, but also the use of water attractions of the water park.  In Adler, you can recommend the hotel "Valentine".  But some hotels, such as Prometey Club, operate in the "All inclusive" mode only in the summer.  In October, they only offer breakfast. </p><p>  Have a nice vacation! </p>
