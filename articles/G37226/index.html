It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  This is not only an important architectural object, but also a symbol of the independence of Portugal. </p><h2>  The history of the monastery </h2><p>  Juan I - king of Portugal, in 1386 laid the foundation for the construction of the monastery of Batalha.  The story goes that on the eve of the battle of Aljubarrot, the king vowed the Virgin Mary to erect a monastery in her honor in case of victory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.creationearth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Courtyard" class="if uuid-2588502" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91082/2588502.jpg"></div><p>  A miracle happened, and the king was able to win, despite his small army.  This battle was of particular importance for the whole of Portugal.  Indeed, the independence of the state depended on its outcome.  Not surprisingly, the construction of the promised monastery was soon begun. </p><p>  The monastery was completely completed only in 1517.  Various architects were engaged in its design, and during the whole period of its construction six kings were replaced - they all rest in the tomb of the monastery. </p><p>  In 1755, the building was partially destroyed due to an earthquake, but most of all it suffered during the war with Napoleon - it was looted and burned. </p><p>  In 1840, large-scale restoration work was begun, and in 1980 the monastery was opened to the general public as a national museum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of the architecture and sights of the monastery </h2><p>  From the site in front of the western facade offers a magnificent view of the monastery.  Here you can appreciate its scale, as well as admire the exquisite lace carvings on windows and walls. </p><p>  The portal on the south side is an example of typical architecture of the Middle Ages.  Here there are carved emblems of its creators and a huge window - the largest in the Gothic architecture of the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.creationearth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Openwork arches" class="if uuid-2588500" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91082/2588500.jpg"></div><p>  On both sides of the main entrance are sculptures of 12 apostles standing on stone consoles decorated with stone.  In the center of the composition is the Savior, surrounded by evangelists, above which are vaults with figures of kings from the Bible, prophets and angels.  Significant in the sculptural composition is the scene of the coronation of the Virgin Mary. </p><p>  On the right side of the entrance is an octagonal chapel built in the 15th century.  King Juan I and his wife Queen Philip rest in it.  Their grave became the first marital tomb in the history of Portugal.  The walls of the chapel rest their sons, including Prince Henry the Navigator, who also took part in the construction. </p><p>  The interior of the monastery is a vivid example of Gothic architecture.  The aisles and naves are separated by powerful columns, on which floral ornaments and patterns flaunt, beautiful stained glass windows of the 16th century stand on the windows, filling the interior with colorful highlights - this creates a special spiritual atmosphere in the temple. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the square in front of the monastery stands a monument to Alvarez Pereira, the commander who became the national hero of Portugal.  Under his leadership, the battle of Aljubarrot was won. </p><p>  At night, the monastery changes its appearance - dozens of spotlights turn on, in the light of which the monastery seems even grander and brighter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="destinationportugal.over-blog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stained glass window" class="if uuid-2588514" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91082/2588514.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to the monastery? </h2><p>  The address of the monastery of Batalha: Portugal, Leiria, Batalha, 2440.

After all, it gives the impression of a large-scale, but thought out to the smallest detail and in the details of the structure.  This place is definitely recommended for a visit - it is not in vain that it goes to the list of 100 wonders of the world. </p><p>  On some of the evenings, a light show takes place on the wall of the monastery, which lasts about 15 minutes and looks unusual and beautiful.  It is better to visit the monastery accompanied by a guide or a guide - this way you will be able to notice the smallest details, find out interesting facts and immerse yourself in history.  For example, inside is the tomb of the Portuguese Romeo and Juliet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="destinationportugal.over-blog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal tomb" class="if uuid-2588519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91082/2588519.jpg"></div><p>  For Russian-speaking tourists, a kiosk inside the monastery will be a pleasant discovery, in which there is the opportunity to purchase brochures with information about the monastery in their native language (in case of visiting without a guide), and all kinds of souvenirs are sold there. </p><p>  The Batalha Monastery in Portugal is an amazing creation of human hands.  This is a grandiose building, which everyone who happened to be in this country should see. </p>
