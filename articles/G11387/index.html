    <p>  This is probably the best keyboard for your Android tablet.  The program went to Google’s branded service, Play Market, a few years ago.  Since then, she is there and receives well-deserved ratings from users.  In some smartphones, the keyboard was already integrated as the previous, as they say, factory software.  Compared with the default “android” keyboard, “Swiftkey” has advanced functionality.  There is a method called predictive input.  Its essence lies in the fact that he suggests possible words.  This principle works surprisingly high quality. </p><p>  A good keyboard for Android, the review of which we are currently doing, is self-learning.  The longer the user uses it when communicating on social networks or instant messengers, the more words she learns and the more accurately she will select them for using predictive input.  It turns out that the more time they use this keyboard, the more convenient this process will be for the owner of the smartphone.  A very important point is the presence of a large number of themes that can be installed for additional personalization.  Some of them are paid, but most are distributed in free mode.  The user has the opportunity to make the keyboard look as he wants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Personalization Features </h2>

    <p>  “Swiftkey” has a whole mountain of settings that allow you to configure the application.  The feature of the program is that you can activate the surface input function.  It consists in the fact that you can type messages using the “Swipe” method, that is, without lifting your finger from the screen.  Until recently, the program in the service was provided for a fee.  However, not so long ago it was transferred to the category of free ones, and now users of smartphones running the Android operating system family can download it and use it for their pleasure.  You can install the application not only on a smartphone, by the way, but also on a tablet computer. </p><h2>  Dexilog </h2><p>  Dexilog is a really good keyboard for Android.  4 PDA actively discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the application, which we managed to learn.  Dexilog has been fighting for the title of the best application in its segment for quite some time.  Unfortunately, it does not differ in modern design, and this probably affects the fact that it is inferior to other programs by estimates.  In terms of appearance, there are no special opportunities for personalization, since there are a limited number of them.  But the functions and settings open up a huge scope for us. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This good keyboard for “Android” with T9 is suitable for those people who like standard input, but want to configure it for themselves.  That is, change the size of the keys, adjust the appearance and so on.  Dexylogue does not provide any special research in this regard, although some possibilities still exist.  Suppose a user misses a push-button telephone.  In this case, the program can be used to expand the old <span>12-key keyboard</span> and use it when typing messages. </p><h2>  After some time </h2><p>  Developers are finalizing this program.  In recent versions, innovations have been added, such as, for example, emoticons.  In general, “Dexilogue” is trying to catch up and make serious competition to its closest rivals.  However, the program has not yet been brought to the “Lollipop” style, and this is a serious drawback.  You can get the application in the “Play Market” service for free, however, an advertisement will periodically pop up asking to purchase it.  Notifications can be ignored, but if the user wants to get rid of them once and for all, then you can spend 140 rubles. </p><h2>  Google </h2>

    <p>  Another good keyboard for Android.  A few years ago, custom keyboard options were ahead of the Google app.  But not so long ago, developers seriously grasped the program and brought its most important parts to mind.  To date, the proprietary keyboard successfully competes with the programs described above, and competes on an equal footing.  It comes “out of the box” along with smartphones on board which the version of the Android Lollipop operating system is installed, but the user can download it from the service. </p><h2>  From company to users </h2>

    <p>  The program is distributed free of charge.  Gesture input is available for users.  A huge selection of language features is compensated by the lack of a large number of topics and other settings.  But we can say that the expected plus sign are emoticons called “emoji”.  They appeared in the previous version of the operating system.  It’s very important that the keyboard from Google works with the speech recognition function.  I would like to see developed predicative input.  However, the company messed up here, although over time this good keyboard for Android will learn everything from the user. </p><h2>  Fleksy </h2>

    <p>  Not always a good keyboard for “Android” should have a huge set of features for personalization.  Minimalists will appreciate this application.  What makes it different?  Laconic design, a few (but well-designed) list of beautiful topics.  However, this application is paid.  To use it all the time, you will have to pay 125 rubles after the trial period.  It is, by the way, 30 days.  You will have to spend even more money on topics. </p>

    <p>  The free version of the program does not even contain emoticons.  However, this is obscured by the possibility of using various widgets.  For example, you can set the search string.  GIF keyboard lovers will also appreciate the program.  Although not everyone will appreciate such opportunities.  Here it’s more likely to be an amateur, even though widgets for the most part are not only interesting, but also useful.  There are traditional options thanks to which you can adjust the number of layouts and activate the fifth row to arrange numbers.  There is no swipe dialing method.  However, special gestures of control came to replace them. </p>

    <p>  Installation is made from the Play Market service.  The user will be given primary instructions.  Someone will like the application’s minimalism, and after the end of the trial period the user will want to continue to use the device.  However, to say that this is a really affordable and good keyboard for “Android” is definitely impossible: the need to purchase in the system interferes. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, today we have sorted out several programs that will allow you to add additional personalization to your smartphone.  You can do it by changing the shell, but choosing a new keyboard instead of the default one is often the right step to make communication more interesting and convenient.  After all, after some time, you get tired of seeing the standard keyboard, which is already disgusted to the core.  It is clear that the Play Market service is replete with such programs, and we all would not be able to fit them in this article if we wanted to.  However, the choice remains only with the user, and only he has the right to decide which keyboard he should install on his favorite device. </p>
