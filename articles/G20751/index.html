  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a hair dryer</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Hairdryer is one of the most popular household appliances.  Most often, ladies use it, since they feel the need for a variety of hair manipulations: from simple drying to a variety of styling at all levels of difficulty.  And therefore, it is they who often have the question of how to choose a hair dryer. </p><p>  The variety of hairdryer models in the modern market is huge.  In order not to get lost in this abundance of goods, you should, first of all, decide on the functions of this device that you need.  Then you will not be disappointed with the result and do not overpay for additional properties that you are not going to use.  How to choose a hair dryer correctly and what features should you pay attention to? </p><p>  <strong>How to choose a hair dryer: what types are</strong> </p><ul><li><p>  If you need this device only for drying hair, then you should not purchase an expensive tricked-out hair dryer, which is used by professionals in salons.  Choose the most reliable small size hairdryer with a minimum of nozzles.  The only requirement is the presence of a cold stream.  Such a compact hairdryer is useful to you if you travel a lot or go to the gym, pool, etc. </p></li><li><p>  If you often do styling, it is best to purchase a professional or semi-professional model.  If you have short or medium length hair, then a hair dryer is also suitable for you, which helps to model your hair and give it shape. </p></li></ul><p><strong> </strong></p><p>  <strong>Which hair dryer is better?</strong>  <strong>Let's talk about power, temperature, airflow</strong> </p><p>  The power of a hair dryer is one of the <span>stumbling blocks</span> between consumers and home appliance experts.  Many people think that additional power does not give special advantages in the quality of styling, and this is just a subtle <span>marketing move</span> that allows you to make the device more expensive.  Nevertheless, most professionals who use hair dryers for more than a year claim that it is much more convenient to work with a powerful hairdryer.  The high power of this device is not only a high temperature, but also the strength of the air flow, which allows you to quickly dry your hair without burning it.  If you choose a hair dryer with high power, it is best to choose a ‚Äúgun‚Äù with a large number of modes, for example, with a range from 1900 W to 2200 W, and for hair dryers-brushes that are in direct contact with hair - from 650 to 1000 Tue  Using such a device, do not forget about high-quality thermal protection of hair. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you buy a mini-hairdryer for traveling, it is best to take a high-power one, so as not to waste time on long hair drying. </p><p>  Choose hair dryers with a large number of temperature modes and preferably with different buttons for adjusting the strength of the air and temperature - this will allow you to combine different modes. </p><p>  <strong>How to choose a hair dryer: shape and weight</strong> </p><p>  First of all, the hairdryer should be comfortable and not too heavy (especially for travel appliances).  The "nose" of the hair dryer should not be too long - otherwise it will be inconvenient for you to do styling on the back of the head.  The angle at which the hair dryer handle is attached to its body should not be more than 90 degrees. </p><p>  <strong>Looking for a hairdryer: how to choose nozzles and additional features</strong> </p><p>  The only extra feature you'll need in any case will be the cold air mode.  It helps the head to "cool down", and also fixes the styling.  As for nozzles, the only necessary thing is a ‚Äúhub‚Äù, it is also a ‚Äúslot‚Äù.  This nozzle allows you to direct the flow of air.  A half nozzle is needed to straighten and raise hair at the roots.  The diffuser nozzle with fingers adds volume and makes natural or artificial curls more beautiful.  For curls or creating volume, you need a nozzle in the form of a round brush.  The hair comb deals with hair straightening, but the curling nozzle allows you to make curls.  As you can see, there is no need to buy hair dryers with a large number of nozzles - just combine 1-2. </p><p>  Another interesting additional feature is ionization, which smoothes hair and reduces electrification.  For healthy hair, it is not too necessary, but if the hair is slightly fluffy even under a layer of special smoothing serums and sprays, then such a hair dryer can be very useful. </p>
