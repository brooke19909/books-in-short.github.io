Moreover, one-bedroom apartments are the most expensive.  In two-room apartments, the price is already reduced to 49 thousand per square meter.  And in the three-room apartments it rises again to 51 thousand rubles per square meter of housing. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  The complex has many advantages, but also many disadvantages.  Of the pluses, it is worth noting the inclusion in the project, in addition to residential buildings, of the necessary social infrastructure facilities.  As well as their location near the complex, especially the school and kindergarten.  An autonomous boiler room is a great indisputable advantage. </p>

    <p>  As a disadvantage, an insufficient number of parking spaces in the parking lot should be noted.  Also, many buyers do not like the fact that the apartments are rented without finishing.  Although currently apartments in a similar form are rented by almost every first developer.  Because every buyer starts to make repairs anyway. </p>
