It is enough to purchase a tuner, a <span>parabolic antenna,</span> tune it to the desired satellite, and you can enjoy high-quality image and sound without airborne interference. </p><h2>  Digital Satellite Broadcasting </h2><p>  Almost all satellites broadcast FTA channels, for the reception of which conditional access systems are not required.  The Hot Bird satellite, for example, broadcasts about 500 open television channels, including 17 high-definition channels and more than 260 radio stations.  Paid channels broadcast in Conax, Mediaguard, Irdeto, Viaccess, Betacrypt, Cryptoworks, Nagravision, PowerVu, BISS.  To get access to them, you will need to buy a smart card, an expensive satellite receiver and pay a monthly fee. </p><p>  Sometimes encoded TV channels can be viewed using a smart card emulator - a program that simulates the operation of cards in different encodings.  To decode the signal, the emulator needs keys that can be entered manually from the remote control or received from the network, if the <span>satellite receiver</span> has such an opportunity.  The firmware of the <span>satellite tuner is also used.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Card sharing </h2><p>  If the above method does not help, then you can access the official card over the network even in the absence of a conditional access module (CAM module) and a card reader.  This method is called card sharing and consists in the fact that the satellite receiver, for decrypting the signal, accesses the smart card installed in the server‚Äôs DVB card through a network connection.  In this case, it is not so much the speed of the connection that is important as its stability.  A large signal delay can affect reception quality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Card sharing can be used to watch satellite TV on multiple TVs at no extra charge.  For example, the operator ‚ÄúTricolor TV‚Äù for the ability to watch its TV channels on two televisions simultaneously increases the monthly fee by two-thirds, which amounts to 800 rubles.  in year. </p><h2>  Operators in Russia </h2><p>  An example of satellite broadcasting in Russia is the Tricolor TV system.  Broadcast to the European part of the Russian Federation is carried out from the geostationary position 36E, and to Siberia and the Far East - from 56E.  The main package includes 195 television channels, including 30 high-definition, 35 radio stations and 2 ULTRA HD television channels.  In addition, you can connect 15 children's channels of the Children's package, 8 channels of the Night package and the Our Football channel.  Broadcasting is in Exset and DRE-Crypt encodings. </p><p>  The first satellite TV operator was NTV-Plus.  Broadcasting is from positions 36E and 56E of the <span>geostationary orbit.</span>  The basic package includes 167 channels, and additional ones - 115 more. Viaccess coding system is used. </p><p>  The satellite TV operator Orion Express is broadcasting from satellites at positions 85E and 140E.  Offers satellite TV under the brands: </p><ul><li>  "Content TV" - position 85E, 50 channels + 13 free and there are HDTV channels, Irdeto encoding. </li><li>  "Orient Express" - position 140E, 46 channels +11 free, Irdeto encoding. </li><li>  ‚ÄúTelecard‚Äù - position 85E, more than 170 channels, Conax encoding. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="digital tuner firmware" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/1113641.jpg" width="491"></div></h2><h2>  Why and how to change the firmware? </h2><p>  Whatever tuner is used - FTA or with a CAM-module, with or without an emulator, it is always necessary to replace the software (software) of the satellite receiver. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The reasons may be different: </p><ul><li>  troubleshooting or bugs in software; </li><li>  the emergence of new software features, such as the addition of a clear interface language, teletext, improved design; </li><li>  the ability to tune in new satellites; </li><li>  streamlining frequencies and channel names; </li><li>  return to the old firmware version due to deterioration of the tuner; </li><li>  the ability to watch more channels. </li></ul><p>  There are several options for updating the tuner software: </p><ul><li>  manual replacement using a personal computer; </li><li>  replacement with a similar tuner with new firmware; </li><li>  from satellite or via CAM-modules and cards; </li><li>  via internet connection. </li></ul>

    <p>  Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. </p><p>  So, the minus of installing from a PC is the need for a computer, an Internet connection or any storage medium with firmware recorded on it, a special cable.  The advantages are the freedom to choose software and the ability to download it at any convenient time.  The firmware of the tuner can be easily found on the websites of manufacturers and websites of satellite TV lovers. </p><p>  When downloading from a satellite manually, its data and the parameters of the software update channel will be required.  But the signal may not be received, and the benefits of the new software are unknown.  The positive aspects of this method are quality assurance and unlimited time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Downloading firmware from a satellite in automatic mode is inconvenient in that it can start at any time, but it is undesirable to interrupt it.  There are also incomprehensible benefits of replacing the tuner program.  However, the stability and speed of updating speak in favor of this method. </p><p>  Using cards and CAM modules to download firmware is complicated by the fact that many tuners do not support this update method, and, of course, you need a CAM module and a smart card.  The advantages are the same as when manually booting from a PC, plus the ability to use a card and module to view closed TV channels. </p><p>  The latter option is possible only with the support of a satellite receiver network interface or Wi-Fi and the presence of such a possibility in the firmware of the device.  In this case, most likely, the update is limited by the scope of already installed software. </p><p>  So, installing the firmware from a PC looks the most preferable.  The possibility of updating must be considered when choosing a satellite receiver. </p>

    <h2>  Precautionary measures </h2><p>  Receiver software and programs for recording it are usually delivered without any guarantee, therefore the responsibility for the result of their use, especially if it is test software, lies with the user.  Moreover, unsuccessful firmware of a digital tuner leads to a loss of warranty for a satellite receiver, so it is advisable to entrust this procedure to a specialist. </p><p>  The connection of the tuner and the PC should be done with the devices turned off.  In this case, a null modem cable is used. </p><p>  For recording, use only programs that are designed to work with the satellite tuner of this model. </p><p>  Before the tuner firmware with new software, it is advisable to familiarize yourself with the reviews of users who have already installed it.  Make it easier on the satellite TV forums.  Indeed, sometimes after installing new software, some features of the previous version that I would like to keep lost. </p><p>  You cannot turn off the PC or tuner while recording a program. </p><h2>  Null modem cable </h2><p>  To flash the receiver from a similar device or PC, you will need a null modem cable.  The transmission and reception lines in it are cross-connected, which makes it possible to connect two devices using the RS-232 protocol without a modem.  Mostly used 9-pin female connectors.  Data is transmitted sequentially in full duplex mode. </p><p>  If you wish, you can make a null modem cable yourself using two ordinary cables for the COM port.  To do this, you need to unsolder the plug connector of one cable and solder the socket connector in its place in accordance with the diagram.  It is enough to connect the contacts 2-3, 3-2, 5-5 and the "case-to-case". </p>

    <p>  As a result, the bootloader and firmware of the TV tuner for the <span>satellite dish</span> will be updated.  But that is not all.  The new firmware of the Tricolor TV tuner already contains keys that will allow you to open part of the encoded channels, but there is no list of channels, as the former was destroyed by replacing the firmware. </p><p>  For normal operation of the receiver, you should scan the channels, or rewrite them from another device with the same bootloader, or flash them using a computer if there is a ready-made list of channels.  In addition, the new filling will need actual keys.  The key downloader program will help. </p><p>  The Eurosky tuner firmware described here is also suitable for OpenFox 4100, GLOBO 4000C / 4050C / 4100C / 9100a, Opticum 4100C, Orton 4050C, Tiger Star 8100, Star track SR-55X, WinQuest 4050C / 4100C receivers. </p><h2>  OPENBOX SX4 Base HD update via technical support server </h2><p>  The firmware of the satellite TV tuner OPENBOX SX4 Base HD in occupied space exceeds 70 MB.  To update the firmware over the network, you need a reliable high-speed connection.  Otherwise, long wait cannot be avoided, and the final result will be unpredictable. </p><p>  First you need to connect the USB-stick with FAT32 and go to the menu ‚ÄúDownload - Software‚Äù.  The satellite receiver itself will connect to the server and display a list of available software.  The selection should be confirmed by pressing the red button on the remote control, after which the tuner firmware will begin.  The receiver will report the completion of the process with a message and reboot. </p>
