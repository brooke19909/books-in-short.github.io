  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do-it-yourself gifts and fun crafts for Easter</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On Easter, it is customary to go on a visit, ‚ÄúChristendom‚Äù and give small gifts, souvenirs - the symbols of this bright holiday.  Preparations for the celebration begin ahead of time, thinking over the decoration of the table, methods for making gifts, techniques for coloring eggs, looking for recipes for traditional Easter treats.  The most enjoyable, sweetest occupation, of course, is painting eggs.  Many Slavic peoples have a tradition of creating colorful Easter eggs rooted in the deep past.  Eggs painted with symbolic patterns, following strict canons of craftsmanship, are not only a bright decoration of the holiday, but also a gift-message, a <span>gift-wish for health,</span> prosperity and joy. </p><p>  You can do crafts for Easter with your own hands, introducing children to this.  The traditional Easter symbols are an egg, a nest with colored eggs, chickens and hens, rabbits, spring primroses and, of course, the famous Easter tree - a symbol of eternal life and rebirth. </p><p>  Easter eggs </p><p>  Eggs are painted not only with food colors, but also in other ways, using <span>aniline paints,</span> gouache, watercolor, various natural materials, the decoupage technique.  Such souvenirs are used exclusively for <span>decorating the table,</span> so first you need to ‚Äúblow‚Äù the egg, leaving only the shell.  You should pierce the egg with a thin needle on both sides, mix the yolk with a long narrow stick inside, then insert the narrow tube into one of the holes and blow the contents into a plate. </p><p>  You can make Easter gifts with your own hands or decorate the eggshell table in different ways.  The first method is decorating with colorful clippings using decoupage technique.  We select a beautiful thematic picture on a napkin or thin paper, cut it out along the contours, slightly moisten it with water, blot excess moisture, put it on an egg greased with diluted glue, smooth it with a soft brush, cover it with glue and dry it again.  To make the egg edible, we use egg white instead of glue. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Crafts for Easter with their own hands are made from eggs, using crumbled eggshells for decoration, pre-painted with different colors in gouache or <span>watercolor.</span>  It turns out a kind of mosaic, which is laid on the surface of the egg, smeared with PVA glue, randomly or in the form of a pattern.  Eggs can be decorated with colored braid, lace, dried herbs and flowers, colored beads and beads. </p><p>  Egg Crafts </p><p>  Using an empty shell as a basis, you can make other crafts with your own hands for Easter.  For example, turn shells into funny chickens.  On a flatter top of the shell we glue eyes made of small buttons or beads, in the center under the eyes we attach a beak - a triangle cut from a piece of felt or cardboard, on the top of the head we build a crest of colored chicken feathers.  We cut the cardboard cellular packaging for eggs into separate pockets, shape their edges figuratively, make holes on the three sides of each, into which we stretch a narrow silk or paper ribbon and tie a loop on top.  We insert a chicken into each prepared pocket-bag, and hang the decoration on spring branches.  <span>Chickens from eggs</span> can simply be planted in a basket, at the bottom of which from a strip of colored paper weave a nest.  Crafts for Easter with their own hands from eggs can be made in the form of rabbits, hens and males. </p><p>  The tree of Life </p><p>  A symbolic tree of life is built as an Easter decoration.  The easiest way to do it is from willow branches installed in a <span>floral sponge</span> in a flat plate.  The base should be decorated with colored straws, grass, intertwined with small twigs or delicate artificial medium-sized flowers, feathers.  Eggs are hung on branches on multi-colored ribbons, small colored birds are planted, various crafts are attached to Easter, made by oneself (flowers from beads, Easter cards).  A loop is threaded into the holes made at the two ends of the shell of the hole with the help of a long needle into which the ribbon is inserted, or a knitting hook.  Below, the outer ends of the tape are pulled into a bead and tied in a knot.  Decorated eggs are hung on branches for such an elegant loop. </p>
