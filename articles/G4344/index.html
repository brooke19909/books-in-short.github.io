Havana - a city in which time has frozen</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cuba is a small country in which time itself has stopped.  Surprisingly, despite its proximity to the United States, this state does not maintain friendly relations with the States, which affects the country itself.  The Cuban economy can hardly be called developed; there are no incredibly expensive hotels, grandiose artificial islands, or even a developed tourism industry in the state.  Cuba does not attract tourists. </p><p>  Everyone goes to the city of Havana.  The Capitol is one of the most beautiful Cuban attractions, but far from the only one.  In this country, everything is unusual.  Architecture, cars and even the locals themselves are all examples of the unique integration of different cultures. </p>

    <h2>  Caribbean babylon </h2><p>  The capital of Cuba is Havana, and the people even call it Caribbean Babylon.  By Cuban standards, it is the most developed and very populated city.  Its population is about 2 million people, which is 20% of the total population of the country.  Surprisingly, almost all of them are the ancestors of the Spaniards who settled the islands and founded a colony.  Everyone who wants to see with their own eyes how foreign culture penetrates an isolated state must go to Havana.  The Capitol is the center of attention of most tourists, but it is far from the only attraction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  They say that time has frozen in Havana, or maybe it has slowed down a little.  This is partly true.  Cuba is not the most open state, and it does not make friends with its neighbors.  Permanent sanctions and embargoes led to stagnation of the country's development.  The streets of Havana are still moving old American cars, which in any other country would inevitably be called retro. </p>

    <p>  The sculptural image of Cuba is not original.  This is a mixture of American, English, Spanish and Russian architectural thought.  Basically throughout the whole of Cuba, the style of the bygone colonial era is widespread: huge massive buildings with columns and wide balconies, large doors, bas-reliefs, stained glass windows and statues.  The capital has many squares, and throughout the country there are many forts and castles.  All of this is common.  However, this is only the outside of Cuban development. </p><p>  The most attractive and beautiful is the city of Havana.  The capitol and other attractions attract the attention of all tourists and skillfully mask Cuban slums and disadvantaged areas.  In difficult times, Cuban architects built buildings according to the cheapest designs - unremarkable concrete boxes for less affluent citizens.  For some time, the Soviet style of the Khrushchev era penetrated into Cuba.  That is why, walking along Havana, you can find the familiar five-story panel houses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  All roads lead to the Capitol </h2><p>  Whoever comes to Havana, he will definitely pay attention to the Capitol.  Havana, although it offers other attractions, but all excursion programs always give priority to this attraction.  There is nothing surprising in this, because it is a unique building.  In some ways, it resembles <span>the Washington Capitol,</span> but slightly higher than it. </p><p>  The architectural style of the Capitol is similar to the buildings of the Renaissance, but with its own characteristics.  It was built in 1926 and was actively used until 1959, but then became an architectural monument.  Roughly speaking, today it is an open museum. </p>

    <p>  The Capitol is the building of the Cuban Parliament.  Once it performed its functions to the fullest, but today it is nothing more than an object of cultural heritage.  If it ever meets again, it will be a very important meeting with historical significance. </p><h2>  Distance is important </h2><p>  Wherever tourists go, you will always have to deal with distance.  However, attachment to distance is important both in cartography, and in bureaucracy, and even in politics.  Almost every state tries to build a specially designed place that will not only become an architectural monument, but will also be a reference point for changing the distance within the country - zero kilometer.  Traditionally, architects try to make this place special and significant.  So the Cuban did not save on design. </p><h2>  More than a tourist attraction </h2><p>  The Capitol is a fundamental building.  It consists of many halls and rooms, but the central hall stands out.  This is a place of particular importance for the building.  You can even say that this is the face of the Capitol.  In the main hall, the entire floor is lined with expensive marble, there is a huge star on the floor, in the center of which is a striking diamond.  To be more precise, a platinum nest is mounted on the floor, and a stone in it.  It is this diamond that is the zero kilometer.  It is he who is the reference point for measuring distance in Cuba.  This is a fairly visited place, and in the summer season there are many tourists.  Due to the fact that the Internet is not widespread in Cuba, it will be difficult to purchase tickets online.  Have to defend a long line under the hot sun. </p>

    <h2>  City of Contrasts </h2><p>  Havana is a city of contrasts.  How many unusual things are gathered in one place.  Cuba itself is like a time machine or an open-air museum.  This is the passage to the middle of the last century. </p><p>  Tourists do not have to visit the Capitol.  The sights of Havana are diverse.  The city itself is a memorable place that deserves attention.  Many museums, interesting buildings, fortifications, fortresses and much more can be visited for free or on cheap tickets.  As a rule, free admission is associated with a large queue, so it’s better to pay. </p><h2>  Slum </h2><p>  There are slums in Havana.  Despite the fact that they are part of the architectural appearance, and the Cubans are peaceful and kind people, visiting the slums in the evening and at night is not recommended.  In the daytime, walking along them is quite safe.  However, in the slums does not catch the mobile Internet.  However, there are very big problems with him throughout Cuba. </p>
