Many tourists manage not only to ride from the mountain slopes, but also to visit nearby attractions of the area.  12 km from Auray is the Tannforsen waterfall, considered quite powerful and full-flowing.  It is also recommended here just to admire the mountain peaks and ridges.  Some tourists like to be photographed from the height of the Storulvons mountain station, from where the whole town of Auray and its attractions are viewed.  Here it is quite possible to order a Russian-speaking guide.  Tours to Sweden Russians book very often. </p><p>  Many vacationers note that the city has a well-established food delivery system, there are many shops.  Sports equipment is offered at every corner.  You can grab a snack between the lifts in specialized shops selling local homemade cakes and delicious cheeses. </p><p>  The reviews also mention spa treatments at the resort.  They can be ordered between skiing from the snowy slopes.  There are provided not only anti-aging, but also wellness treatments. </p>
