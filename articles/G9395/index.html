The power and capabilities of the electronic filling, located in a small case, exceed even the parameters of some computers.  When we talk, there is a feeling that no one hears the dialogue.  But it is erroneous, so when transmitting confidential information, you should remember that third parties can eavesdrop on you.  In this regard, the question arises: "How to check the phone for wiretapping?" </p>

    <h2>  Battery temperature </h2><p>  Absolutely any application consumes battery power.  Therefore, when no applications are running in the device, the battery is in economy mode.  It is one of the likely indicators of listening.  Only when using the device can the battery temperature be high.  It should be controlled after half an hour from the moment of the last conversation.  Touch the phone while it is inactive.  If it turns out to be heated, then this is the first sign that someone is eavesdropping on you.  Here it is necessary to remember that even the remote use of the mobile phone leads to battery heating. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Battery level </h2><p>  There is also another way to test your phone for wiretapping.  Pay attention to <span>the battery level,</span> as well as the charging time.  A sign of a potential threat can be the sign that the mobile phone discharges more often than usual.  During the time that you use this device, you can roughly figure out how fast the charge is being consumed.  If the battery starts to discharge much faster than usual, you have a reason to beware.  Even if the gadget looks lying idle, it can constantly <span>record a conversation</span> in the room without your knowledge.  Therefore, the battery loses its charge faster.  But the speed of this process can be tracked by some applications, for example, Battery LED or BatteryLife LX.  But remember that over time, these devices lose their maximum charge level.  Therefore, after annual use, the battery capacity will steadily decline, but how much depends on the intensity of use. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="telephone wiretapping how to determine" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18938/438999.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Off delay </h2><p>  Another alarming factor is the delay when dropping a call and turning off the mobile phone.  This is because listening programs, wedged into a conversation, require a certain amount of time for this.  As soon as you notice that the call does not end immediately, and the shutdown process began to be delayed, this serves as a reason for diagnosing the software and hardware of the device.  If everything is in order, then you need to check the wiretap of the phone.  Pay attention to his atypical behavior. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Self activity </h2><p>  This symptom requires immediate verification.  If various applications are installed without your participation, the backlight suddenly lights up, a call is made independently - this is an indication that someone else has access to the mobile phone, besides you.  Also, such actions by the device may occur due to interference arising from the transmission of data.  All this serves as an occasion to check the wiretap of the phone. </p>

    <p>  Still worth paying attention to the funds in your account.  This is necessary because all listening programs use the World Wide Web to send recorded information.  As a result of this, traffic becomes more, but you can notice it only if you have not connected an unlimited tariff. </p><h2>  Acoustic noise </h2><p>  If during a conversation you constantly hear some kind of electrical discharges, clicks, or crackling, then this also serves as a reason for immediate diagnosis of the device.  But keep in mind that such interference may be caused by your interlocutor‚Äôs environment or connection failures.  But a serious problem may be the pulsating noise during the inactivity of the device.  Here it‚Äôs worth considering the question: ‚ÄúHow to check the phone for wiretapping?‚Äù </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Electronic devices </h2><p>  In the vicinity of <span>speakers</span> and a TV, the GSM module can create noise, such as howling, crackling, loud clicks.  But you should be wary when these noises do not occur during telephone conversations. </p><p>  However, all these signs cannot unambiguously indicate that the phone is being tapped.  How to determine its availability, you will be prompted at the service center.  Perhaps this will turn out to be a simple self-renewal of the network, or the device independently checks e-mail, signal strength or messages. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="checking phone tapping" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18938/439010.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Disinformation </h2><p>  Many modern people ask themselves the question: "How do I know if the phone is on the wiretap or not?"  If such suspicions crept into your head, then you can try to bring a person to clean water.  Try to misinform him by communicating personal ‚Äúsecret‚Äù information in a telephone conversation to a person you trust.  You will get an affirmative answer to this question when you realize that the information has spread. </p><h2>  Network Search Oddities </h2><p>  When using the ‚ÄúOperator selection‚Äù function, a new and unknown operator appears in the list on the display of the device as a set of numbers.  Thus, without special equipment, you can establish the fact of tracking you.  It was once discovered by chance on an iPhone.  At the same time, the <span>brand of the mobile phone</span> does not matter <span>at</span> all <span>,</span> because the more modern it is, the easier it is to install malware on it. </p><h2>  How to protect yourself from telephone wiretapping </h2><p>  The first thing to do is to exclude or at least minimize the transmission by telephone of confidential information, such as card numbers, passwords, financial issues. </p><p>  For conducting important <span>business negotiations,</span> do not use mobile devices.  Preference should be given to specially prepared telephones or spatial noise systems. </p>

    <p>  It is very difficult to intercept a conversation that is being conducted from a moving car, as the distance increases and the signal becomes weaker. </p><p>  It is advisable to use a mobile communication system in which data is transmitted during an automatic frequent frequency change throughout the conversation. </p><p>  If you want to keep your location a secret, you need to completely turn off the device and remove the battery.  But when you feel that there is a wiretapping of phones, how to check this fact?  You can simply leave the office or car for an important meeting without him. </p><p>  Do not repair your device in suspicious, unverified workshops.  You can also contact the police.  They have special equipment that allows you to determine the wiretap of the phone.  But such a possibility of verification should be used only as a last resort, if you are sure that you are ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù. </p><h2>  Phone Tracking Software </h2><p>  Conversations in the form of * .mp3 files are recorded in the device‚Äôs memory, and then they are transferred to a computer for study.  To do this, a special program is secretly installed on the phone of the subscriber of interest.  In the same way, you can control messages and other <span>types of communication.</span>  In this case, it is necessary to take into account the type of device that you want to listen to, its operating system, the availability of access to the global network and Bluetooth, the amount of memory.  As for modern devices, for them there are several such programs that listen to the device, transmit data and are able to establish the location of the monitored subscriber.  At the same time, the surveillance data will be transferred by debiting funds from the ‚Äúaffected‚Äù subscriber, which will significantly affect costs.  Phones based on VOC JAVA Symbian do not have direct access to such wiretapping programs, but if you look carefully, you can probably find it.  This method is the most affordable for the average person. </p>

    <p>  There is also a method of so-called conference calling.  Since it gives a less successful result, for the purpose of eavesdropping this method is used extremely rarely, in addition, it is very imperfect. </p><p>  But it is worth emphasizing that wiretapping is a rather rare occurrence, and the likelihood of surveillance is very small.  If you still want to feel protected, then lock your device with a password and keep it with you at all times.  And while you are not using it, you should remove the battery from the compartment.  After these simple actions you will not be tormented by the question of how to check the phone for wiretapping.  Naturally, you simply do not give attackers a chance. </p><h2>  Telephone tapping - how to determine? </h2><p>  Absolutely any phone you can listen to if you wish.  Moreover, this can be done even if the device is in an inactive state, because the microphone can be switched on forcibly.  This will allow you to eavesdrop on all negotiations near the apparatus.  The digital models of the DECT standard have similar capabilities. </p>

    <p>  Unlike analog lines, where it is easy to establish an organized intervention, it is almost impossible to detect it without special equipment in mobile devices, since the technical principles of these networks exclude this possibility. </p><p>  How to find out the wiretap of the phone?  You cannot do this on your own, you can find out this fact only in the service center, because no additional icons will appear on the display, and this will not affect the quality of the connection. </p><p>  Here it is important to understand one thing: it is simply impossible to organize total surveillance, since there are neither human nor technical resources for this.  Moreover, the special services do not have such a need. </p>
