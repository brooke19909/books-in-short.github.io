For example, in Poland one of such places is the zoo in Warsaw.  This is not just a collection of animals and birds worth seeing.  The zoo rightfully boasts a long interesting history and is a unique complex. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The Poles saw the very first menagerie under King Jan III Sobieski, and a full-fledged zoo opened in the distant 1926.  Kangaroos, brown bears, crocodiles, monkeys, porcupines, etc. were placed on a small area along Koshikova Street. Menageries existed at that time in other quarters of the capital of Poland.  After a couple of years, namely in 1928, they were all combined into one common zoological garden.  In those days, there were about five hundred animals in it. </p>

    <p>  <span>The Warsaw Zoo</span> was badly damaged during the war, and staff had to kill predators and large elephants for security reasons.  Some of the animals died when the city was bombed, and the other part was transported by the Germans to Germany, where they were assigned to different menageries.  After the end of World War II, the zoo began to be restored and reopened to the public in 1948. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <span>zoological garden</span> is more than 40 hectares, it is divided into several thematic zones.  At the entrance to the zoo, visitors are greeted by a huge hippopotamus.  And then five thousand different animals and birds are waiting for you, which you can see, and sometimes feed, listen to their singing, growl, etc. There is a rehabilitation center for wild birds called the Bird's Refuge.  Here, specialists conduct treatment and rehabilitation of pets, the number of which each year reaches the figure of 1500. About half of the recovered birds are released. </p>

    <p>  Every resident of the <span>capital of Poland</span> knows that the zoo in Warsaw includes not only cages with animals and birds, but also several beautiful parks with clean air and amazing vegetation.  People come here just to take a walk and breathe, enjoy the views and watch the purity of the natural world. </p><h2>  Pride of the zoo </h2><p>  The zoo has modern pavilions and aviaries, where animals and birds live comfortably, almost like in their natural environment.  One of the latest leadership achievements was the opening of a new pavilion where hippos settled.  A special aquarium for sharks also appeared, and before that, gorillas, chimpanzees and jaguars received new housing.  In the Free Flight Hall, among the numerous green spaces, you can watch the flights of Asian birds, listen to their singing and the unusual noise of a waterfall. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  More than 50 species of reptiles are presented to visitors in the serpentarium.  There are a variety of turtles, and poisonous snakes, and crocodiles, and monitor lizards.  Above all this action, there is a cafe on top where you can have a cup of coffee or tea and watch the mysterious representatives of the fauna. </p><p>  The oldest building here is the ‚ÄúHouse under the roof‚Äù, erected in the year the zoo was founded.  Many years ago there were nurseries for zebras and camels.  Despite the fact that the Warsaw Zoo was badly damaged during the war, especially wooden buildings, this house has undergone restoration and today serves as a platform for various exhibitions. </p><h2>  Fairytale zoo </h2><p>  A favorite place for children and their parents is the "Fairytale Zoo".  In this place you can meet animals known to us from fairy tales, and play with them on the territory of the playground.  Under the supervision of menagerie employees, children are allowed to feed and caress pets, while adults at this time receive a moment to rest on the bench. </p>
