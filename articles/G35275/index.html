    <h2>  New word in communication </h2><p>  Tele2 is the mobile operator that has just begun work in many regions of Russia.  As practice shows, this phenomenon does not have the best effect on the quality of the services offered to us.  And still: Peter or <span>Moscow.</span>  <span>"Tele2"</span> reviews in the capitals are not getting the best.  This fact repels a new audience. </p><p>  But the main point here is that the company exists in Moscow and the region for many years.  And where, if not in the capital of the country, to begin your successful work?  True, according to consumers, this venture failed miserably.  Indeed, the Tele2 operator itself has been present in Moscow for a long time.  So, he should have set up his work in this area.  Practice shows that this is not so. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Advertising </h2><p>  Nevertheless, the company is trying to carefully hide all the negative aspects.  Often this is obtained at Tele2.  Customer reviews in Moscow quite often mention the fact that in a given area the corporation often carries out various types of promotions.  Anyway, he uses a variety of marketing techniques to attract new customers. </p><p>  And it works.  Indeed, if in the capital there is some kind of mobile operator, and even constantly conducting promotions, then it is already considered good.  This is the opinion of many.  But practice shows that frustration is growing among consumers whose place of residence is Moscow. </p>

    <p>  Tele2 often gets negative reviews.  For example, many immediately after the first days of connection immediately write that advertising is a real fraud.  What the company offers does not correspond to the real prices.  Important conditions of tariffs and their payment are hidden from view.  Or written in small print on banners.  So that to read them was difficult.  Few people, having seen a tempting offer at the stand, will additionally go to the company's website to inquire about the tariff.  Often, after the advertisement is seen, the user immediately goes to the operator‚Äôs communication office and connects to his services. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Work salons </h2><p>  Perhaps one of the few moments in which Tele2 receives positive feedback from subscribers in Moscow and the region is the work of the organization‚Äôs salons.  Their number can also be attributed here. </p><p>  The fact is that there are a lot of Tele2 communication offices throughout the city (and region).  Here you will find regular offices and typical tents in which you can easily and simply take advantage of all the services provided.  So, finding a connection point will not cause you any trouble. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the <span>"Tele2"</span> operating mode receives more than good <span>feedback from subscribers</span> in Moscow and other cities.  After all, there are 24-hour offices, and those that work up to 23 hours.  But as a rule, they are open from 8:00 to 22:00.  Such a schedule makes contacting the operator‚Äôs cabin comfortable and convenient for all consumers. </p><h2>  About work in the organization </h2><p>  Before delving into the issues of the quality of the operator‚Äôs communication, it‚Äôs worth to find out what <span>reviews of Tele2 employees (Moscow</span> and the region) are left about.  After all, not only do consumers think about this organization.  The reputation is also influenced by the opinion of the employees of the company. </p><p>  Unfortunately, in this case, the situation is no better than that of competitors.  Head office employees often complain about the huge flow of dissatisfied consumers who ask obscure questions.  And in the remaining departments, according to the majority of workers, crowds of people constantly accumulate who have no idea which tariff plan to choose.  As a matter of fact, the conditions for working at Tele2 are not entirely good in Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Needless to say, salaries are delayed here, and there are almost no days off and vacations?  Perhaps these points should not be forgotten either.  For consumers, this is undoubtedly good.  After all, at any time they will be able to contact the office for help.  But for employees - not really.  So in terms of employment at Tele2 (Moscow and the Moscow Region), the reviews are mostly negative. </p>

    <h2>  Customer service </h2><p>  Lame customer service as well.  Both potential and current.  This is often said by the consumers themselves.  Especially when it comes to Moscow and the region.  In this area, the flow of users at "Tele2" is huge.  And in case of failures or problems, everyone needs to be serviced. </p><p>  In communication offices, as has been repeatedly noted, there is a boorish and careless attitude towards consumers.  This factor greatly undermines the operator‚Äôs reputation, especially in such a large city as Moscow.  Tele2 therefore receives not the best reviews in terms of service.  Do not tear off your anger at customers. </p><p>  Things are even worse with those who still managed to take advantage of the switch to the tariffs of this operator.  The support service, according to numerous complaints, works as if it does not exist at all.  When you try to communicate with the operator, you are "thrown" to the robot voice.  And of course, you won‚Äôt get any sensible answers.  If you managed to get through to a live operator, then you run the risk of hearing rudeness addressed to you.  This is not the worst.  It is terrible that the Tele2 operator in Moscow receives feedback as a company that is not able to answer even basic questions from customers.  Probably, it‚Äôs already clear what impression the company has in this area. </p>

    <h2>  Communication work </h2><p>  Tele2 communications in Moscow receive even worse reviews than the company's offices.  After all, we are dealing with a large and developed city of Russia.  Where, if not here, should communications work great? </p><p>  For some reason, the Tele2 operator does not think so.  Despite the fact that it has existed in the city for a long time, the quality of the network has not improved since the moment this organization generally appeared in the Moscow region.  No matter how sad this may sound, consumers are not happy. </p><p>  Most often, the network disappears.  You can say: "This is Moscow!"  "Tele2" reviews are not earning the best in customer service, not only in the area.  So you should not think that in big cities mobile communication works worse.  On the contrary, it should function better. </p><p>  In addition, due to bad weather, according to customers, in Moscow and the Moscow Region, the Tele2 signal completely disappears.  And it is restored only after the weather improves.  According to most customers, this phenomenon can be closed in small cities, where the operator has just begun its existence.  But this is not our case.  So, the connection at Tele2 is just awful in Moscow.  In any case, this is exactly what consumers say. </p>

    <h2>  Internet features </h2><p>  As for the Internet, this topic requires a separate discussion.  It can be said that she is sick for most Tele2 subscribers.  It's no secret that almost all operators try to connect both the capital and small cities to 3G and 4G Internet.  In principle, Tele2 is also trying to do this.  But only this action did not quite succeed. </p><p>  In Moscow and Moscow region, you, according to subscribers, can use high-quality 2G-connection.  With the 3G Internet, as well as with the network as a whole, there are numerous interruptions.  And the innovation, 4G, is completely absent in the capital.  But this opportunity is present in Tula.  Consumers are in shock - what guided the operator when he didn‚Äôt worry about the comfort of providing Internet in Moscow?  To this day, it remains a mystery that does not please very many. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  At <span>"Tele2" tariffs (Moscow</span> and Moscow <span>region) reviews</span> are also not getting the best.  Especially when the question arises of choosing a permanent plan that you can use for a long time.  After all, Moscow is a city of opportunities.  And here you have to constantly communicate on your mobile. </p><p>  Many consumers emphasize that Tele2 tariffs (Moscow and Moscow Region) earn better reviews in terms of local services than competitors.  Not in all cases, but most of them.  But if you need to choose a plan for communication in Russia, then there will be problems. </p>

    <p>  In general, according to subscribers, "Tele2" is the second company by the high cost of tariffs.  In the first place in Moscow, as in most cities, is Beeline.  Nevertheless, there are consumers who willingly agree to the communication services of our company today.  Even though there are so many bad opinions about her. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  Well, as you see, the Tele2 operator is not getting the best feedback from subscribers in Moscow and the region.  The picture in this area is approximately the same as in most cities of Russia, where our operator is located. </p><p>  This does not mean that you should refuse his services.  In order to accurately decide for yourself whether you need to connect to Tele2 in Moscow or the region, buy yourself a SIM card for trial.  For example, the tariff is "Black".  For 99 rubles per month, you can try out all the capabilities of the operator, and then make the final decision. </p>
