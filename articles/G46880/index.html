  <section class="page js-page"><h1>German Spitz and varieties of this breed</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Spitz is the oldest breed known to man, since it comes from a Neanderthal peat dog, as well as the first domesticated animal.  In Germany, and especially in Pomerania, these dogs were most popular.  These were working dogs of the poor, the breed was appreciated because of its good adaptability, strength, quick wits and disease resistance.  Towards the end of the Middle Ages, an independent breed, the Spitz Sund, had already appeared in Germany, with a fluffy fur coat, a muzzle of a fox and a tail thrown back.  In the XVIII century, the aristocracy paid attention to these animals, and from that time began work on the miniaturization of the breed.  This is how Wolfspitz and Keeshond appeared (height at the withers 43-55 cm);  species such as gross (42-50 cm), mittel (30-38 cm), klein (23-29 cm) and the smallest variety of this breed is German <span>dwarf spitz</span> (18-22 cm). </p><p>  Thus, the doggie was noticeably smaller and moved from the category of ‚Äúworking dogs‚Äù to ‚Äúindoor-decorative‚Äù.  At the end of the long and painstaking work of breeding, a German <span>miniature Spitz appeared,</span> which is also called Pomeranian in honor of the federal state where he was bred.  He is three times smaller than his ancestor and several times lighter than him - the mass of the animal should not exceed three kilograms.  In fairness, it should be noted that <span>Great Britain</span> also carried out work on the development of the ‚Äúorange‚Äù <span>.</span>  <span>Queen</span> Victoria, a passionate lover of such crumbs, ordered to improve the ‚Äúshirt‚Äù of the pomeranium (as this dwarf dog was called in England) to give it sophistication.  And now in the <span>British Isles</span> for the miniature Spitz there is a local name - ‚ÄúQueen Victoria Pomeranium‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Initially recognized German Spitz only white.  The exception was Wolfspitz, who by definition (wolf is a German wolf) was required to be gray.  Then orange and beige suits became fashionable.  Keeskhond should be zoned gray, with black stains.  Later, black and brown colors of dogs came into use.  As for Pomeranians, from 1915 English clubs are not allowed to exhibit representatives of this breed who weigh more than 3.6 kg (the ideal weight is 3 kg).  However, oranges are held in the same ring with other relatives. </p><p>  The German Spitz, despite the huge variation in the size and weight of the subspecies, has clear characteristics unique to this breed.  Firstly, it is a woolen coat with a short cotton-like undercoat, in which the hairs are wavy.  In oranges, the undercoat is long, and there is no axial hair.  These dogs are also valuable because their fur coat has the ability to clean itself, since axial hair produces a special secret.  Secondly, this is the fox's muzzle, tapering smoothly from the wide back to the pointed nose, with triangular erect ears and oval dark eyes.  Again, orange stands out, which is characterized by a clear transition from the forehead to the nose.  Their tail is very pubescent and lies on their back.  Tail bending is allowed in rings, but not in orange. </p><p>  German Spitz is on the list of long-lived dogs.  But in order for your pet to live a long and happy life, it must be fed with balanced feeds, provide it with physical activity and regularly show it to the veterinarian.  Ailments of the breed include allergies, a tendency to overweight.  A fluffy doggie fur coat needs to be combed daily with a special brush, but bathing should not be abused: its coat is already self-cleaning enough.  Once a week, the dog needs to clean its ears, and once a month - to cut its nails so that they do not damage the fingers. </p><p>  Character German Spitz is light and good-natured.  It is very easy to train, as he is smart and hardworking.  Likes to carry out commands and play outdoors.  But if other ‚ÄúGermans" should be burdened with physical exercises, then such tests are contraindicated for Pomeranian.  These dogs love to swim and, despite their modest size, are not afraid, easily take on the duties of an apartment watchman. </p>
