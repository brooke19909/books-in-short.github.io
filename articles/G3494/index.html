  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to catch perch in winter</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Fishing, no matter what alternative points of view are expressed, is, without a doubt, one of the most acceptable ways to spend your leisure time, primarily for men.  The winter season is no exception, moreover, there is a whole galaxy of fishermen who activate their hobby precisely in this period of the year.  At the same time, beginning fishermen often have a question about how to catch perch in winter, since, we can safely say, for beginners this is the most acceptable option, at least in the beginning. </p><p>  If you talk about why it is best to choose perch for fishing for lovers who are just starting their way, then it is necessary to focus on the habits of fish.  The fact is that in the case of biting there are practically no gatherings; specimens of this predator grab the bait sharply, boldly and without options.  Although, as in any business, it is very useful to possess at least basic knowledge and skills when cutting perch.  At the same time, it is worthwhile to understand that there are no classical technologies, and even more so, techniques in this business, the secrets of <span>catching perch in winter</span> for each fisherman have their own and vary depending on the traditions of one or another region of the country.  However, there are general tips that all fishermen should consider. </p><p>  The question of how to catch perch in winter should start with natural-climatic analytical calculations.  First of all, it should be noted that, as practice shows, the most intense biting is in the first weeks after the formation of ice in the reservoir, and, accordingly, closer to spring or even <span>in spring, when the</span> pre-spawning zhor begins in the vast majority of fish in our reservoirs.  In addition, during the winter itself, fish activity may depend on natural fluctuations in atmospheric pressure.  It is clear that the longer the constant pressure will stand on time, the higher the probability of a rich catch. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now a little about daily fluctuations.  It is clear that perch, like any other fish, is most active in the morning, when it was just dawn.  At the same time, the presence of a little frost is optimal, for the central zone of Russia it is no more than 10 degrees Celsius.  But nevertheless, if the fisherman left the pond all day, with or without bite, you should still wait for the first twilight.  As the long-term practice shows, it‚Äôs not always, but often, as they say, it‚Äôs possible to ‚Äúrun into‚Äù a really overactive nibble when catching perch in the winter on cicadas becomes an incredibly exciting activity, for the reason that there is enough fish for every stroke.  At the same time, the question of how to catch perch in the winter no longer arises, but there is another task in the head about how to get out more.  In fairness, it must be said that such a bite is very rarely long, as a rule, does not exceed about 30 minutes. </p><p>  The most common answer among amateurs to the question of how to catch perch in winter is the corresponding nodding <span>winter fishing rod.</span>  <span>The</span> fishing rod for this type of fishing rod, the second name is the whip, should be as light as possible, but not at the expense of strength, taking into account loads, about 20 cm long. It is desirable that the handle is as comfortable as possible, especially if you plan to fish for a sufficiently long time so that the hand not tired. </p><p>  Very often, manufacturers use various types of plastics as the material for the manufacture of nods for fishing rods.  It should be understood that such materials (and homemade fishing rods can still be equipped with nipples made of nipple rubber) react poorly to lower temperatures, losing their strength and elasticity - the best option, of course, is metal. </p><p>  Neither tail nor scales and good luck in life.  May luck smile at you not only in fishing. </p>
