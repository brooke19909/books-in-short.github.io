One of the richest countries in the world, the first mention of it in documents from 996.  Over the centuries-old history, many interesting architectural creations have been created in the country, many natural reservoirs have been preserved, so there are a lot of attractions in Austria and you should definitely see them with your own eyes. </p><p>  The country is divided into 9 federal states, each of which has a number of interesting places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tajikembassy.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Venetian palace" class="if uuid-2332533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2332533.jpg"></div><h2>  The capital city of Vienna </h2><p>  This is not only the center of Austria, but also the largest settlement in the country.  About 2 million inhabitants live here.  For several centuries, the city housed the residence of the Habsburgs.

The opera opened with the production of “Don Juan”, balls were held here, at which all young girls aspired.  In 1945, this place was partially damaged during the bombing.
