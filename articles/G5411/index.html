This year, England, France and Russia signed an agreement according to which they undertook obligations not to conclude a <span>separate peace</span> with their opponents. </p><p>  The Triple Alliance arose from the <span>unification of Germany</span> and Austria-Hungary in 1879.  A little later, namely in 1882, Italy joined them, which completed the process of formation of this military-political bloc.  He played a significant role in creating situations that led to the outbreak of World War I.  In accordance with the clauses of the agreement, signed for a five-year term, the countries participating in this agreement pledged not to participate in actions directed against one of them, to provide all possible support in relation to each other.  According to their agreement, all three parties were to serve as the so-called "insurers".  In the event of an attack on Italy, Germany and Austria-Hungary became its reliable defense.  In the case of Germany - its supporters, Italy and Austria-Hungary, which were a trump card in the event of participation in the hostilities of Russia. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The triple alliance was concluded on a covert basis and with small reservations from Italy.  Since she did not want to enter into conflict with Great Britain, she warned her allies that they should not count on her support in the event of an attack on any of them by Great Britain. </p><p>  The creation of the Triple Alliance served as the impetus for the formation of a counterweight in the Entente, which included France, Russia and the United Kingdom.  It was this confrontation that led to the outbreak of World War I. </p><p>  The tripartite alliance lasted until 1915, as Italy already participated in hostilities on the side of the Entente.  This redistribution of forces was preceded by the neutrality of this country in relations between Germany and France, with which the "native" was not profitable to spoil relations. </p><p>  The triple alliance was eventually replaced by a fourth, in which Italy was replaced by the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. </p><p>  The Entente and the Triple Alliance were extremely interested in the territory of the Balkan Peninsula, the Near and <span>Middle East.</span>  Germany wanted to capture part of France and its colony;  Austria-Hungary needed control over the Balkans;  England pursued the goal of weakening the position of Germany, securing a worldwide market monopoly, and also preserving sea power;  France wanted to return the territories of Alsace and Lorraine taken away during the Franco-Prussian war;  Russia wanted to take root in the Balkans, capture the western <span>lands of Germany.</span> </p><p>  The greatest number of contradictions was associated with the Balkan Peninsula.  Both the first and second bloc wanted to strengthen their position in this region.  The struggle began with peaceful diplomatic methods, accompanied by parallel training and strengthening of the military forces of the countries.  Germany and Austria-Hungary actively took up the modernization of troops.  The least prepared was Russia. </p><p>  The event that served as the impetus for the start of hostilities was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Serbia by student <span>Gavrilo Princip.</span>  Shot in a car that was driving, he hit not only Ferdinand, but also his wife.  July 15, 1914 Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia ... </p>
