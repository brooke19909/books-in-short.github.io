The company's products cover a fairly wide range of users, because the corporation produces both budget and expensive laptops.  Moreover, the guys from ‚ÄúAsus‚Äù are not afraid to experiment.  The company launches a new line of laptops with an enviable frequency.  And new products are not alterations of old laptops with a different price tag and a couple of additional functions, as many well-known corporations like to do. </p><p>  Each line of laptops is innovative, boldly brings something new.  Of course, such experiments are not always justified, but Asus guys learn from their mistakes.  For this reason, the Asus family includes a lot of interesting devices. </p><p>  In this article, we will look at the recently released device labeled X555LD.  What kind of laptop is this?  Should I buy the brand new <span>Asus X555LD?</span>  You can find answers to these and many other questions in this review. </p><h2>  Asus X555LD: review </h2><p>  The development of the device went unnoticed by the public.  The guys from "Asus" did not make any high-profile announcements in the style of Apple, did not arrange a PR company.  Nevertheless, the Asus X555LD in the early days of sales began to enjoy great popularity.  What was the reason? </p>

    <p>  The Asus X555LD is a fairly powerful machine that boasts high performance.  For a relatively low price, the device opens up a ton of possibilities for the user.  In addition, the lack of competitors affected.  In its price range, the Asus X555LD is the best laptop without any worthy rivals.  Want to know more about this device?  Welcome to this review! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The first thing that catches your eye is the appearance of the devices.  It is immediately noticeable that the designers from "Asus" tried their best.  Despite the fact that the device is made rather in a business style, the laptop looks pretty presentable.  Clear, strict lines once again emphasize the restraint of the computer.  The classic silver-black case of the new laptop pays tribute to the previous Asus lineups.  Everything is very concise.  There are no unnecessary details that could distract the user.  In terms of design, the device is pretty versatile.  The laptop will look great with a business suit, but the device looks good in combination with casual clothes. </p><p>  The bottom of the laptop looks pretty angry.  There you can see the ventilation grilles and the compartment, inside which contains a memory module and two stereo speakers.  The panel begins to narrow significantly, approaching the front edge. </p>

    <p>  The 258-mm (closed) case of the laptop is made of durable high-quality plastic.  To the touch it is a little rough, so the device does not try to slip out of the hand.  The build quality of the laptop, as always, is at the highest level.  There are no backlashes and creaks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But not without a fly in the ointment.  One of the main disadvantages of the device is its rather large dimensions.  Asus X555LD XX116H weighs about 2.5 kilograms, which eliminates a number of possible applications of the device.  For example, it is unlikely that you can always carry a laptop to work or study. </p><h2>  Input device </h2><p>  Asus X555LD boasts a pretty good chiplet keyboard.  The keys respond very clearly to each press.  Yes, and the distance between them is quite large, which reduces the likelihood of mislisk to zero.  A click when pressed is not heard at all, which is undoubtedly a plus.  Unfortunately, there is no backlight.  The keyboard is great for speed typing. </p>

    <p>  The touchpad looks stylish and pleasing to the eye.  <span>The touch panel is</span> pleasant to the touch and does not cause any complaints.  Sensitivity is also on top - not a single user movement will be ignored.  We can say that the Asus X555LD XO825H has excellent input devices.  In any case, the keyboard and touchpad from Asus are much better than those of competitors. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  On the laptop there is a dual-core processor from Intel with the i3 4010U marking.  It can be safely attributed to the number of economical.  Despite the fact that the processor includes a whole bunch of components, it consumes quite a bit of energy.  In addition, Asus X555LD already has two video adapters integrated.  The first is a video chip from the same Intel called HD Graphics 4400. This video card is active only during simple tasks, such as surfing the Internet, reading, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main work is undertaken by the <span>Nvidia GeForce 820M.</span>  Although this video card can not boast of incredible power, but it copes with the launch of various games and other three-dimensional applications.  Switching between the two graphics chips is done thanks to Nvidia Optimus technology.  This is quite rare in touchpads.  Therefore, the <span>Asus X555LD laptop</span> deserves attention at least for the use of such innovative technology. </p>

    <p>  A classic hard drive with a capacity of 500 gigabytes is used to store user data.  The popular Windows 8 system is already installed on it. However, if the user has something against the G8, then the default operating system can easily be demolished and put what you like. </p><p>  Thanks to the coordinated work between the processor and video cards, the laptop has excellent performance.  Using the Asus X555LD XX116H, you can surf the Internet without any sagging, watch movies, listen to music, etc. Moreover, the X555LD can even launch modern games at low or medium graphics settings.  For example, Far Cry 4 at low produces stable 26 FPS, Watch Dogs - 25 FPS, <span>Assasins Creed</span> Unity - 15 FPS.  That is, the Asus X555LD XX116H laptop can be considered not only a working device, but also to some extent a gaming device. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Perhaps the weakest side of the device is the glossy 15.6-inch display.  The low brightness of the image and poor color rendering, which cannot be corrected even after lengthy user settings, are disappointing.  In this case, the screen does not have any anti-reflective coating.  Therefore, it is unlikely to work comfortably with a laptop on the street on a sunny day. </p>

    <p>  Viewing angles are quite limited.  If you look directly at the screen, then everything is perfectly visible.  But if you deviate a little, a noticeable distortion in color and brightness begins.  Contrast, fortunately, is at a fairly high level.  In general, you can work and watch movies on the device.  But the screen does not satisfy all the needs of demanding users. </p><h2>  Ports </h2><p>  The Asus X555LD XO825H has all the modern interfaces.  There are three USB-connectors, and two video outputs, and even a wired Ethernet network.  Among the wireless standards, there is only Wi-Fi, which is more than enough.  BlueTooth is missing, which is not such a big loss.  The X555LD boasts an integrated optical drive that reads CS and DVD discs.  For modern devices - this is a rarity. </p><p>  Also, the laptop has a built-in camera with a resolution of 720 pixels.  It is simply magnificent and transfers a high-quality image even in low light.  With its help, you can safely hold various video conferences or simply communicate with friends through Skype.  Also, the camera takes fairly high-quality images, which simply can not but rejoice.  The built-in microphone also does not cause any complaints.  The sound is crisp and clear. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The laptop consumes very little energy (10 watts during the execution of simple tasks, 40 watts for large computing loads).  Surely this was achieved thanks to the aforementioned Nvidia Optimus technology.  But the manufacturer did not bother to install a good battery with a large capacity.  Asus X555LD is equipped with a lithium-polymer battery, whose capacity is only 4840 mAh. </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, the laptop has a rather mediocre indicator of autonomy.  Like other devices of this class, Asus X555LD 90NB0622 continuously works without connecting to a network for 4-5 hours at light loads.  During complex computing processes, this figure drops to 3 hours. </p><h2>  Noise and cooling </h2><p>  The X555LD is a pretty powerful device.  As you know, the scourge of all powerful laptops is overheating and noise.  Fortunately, the brainchild of Asus does not suffer from these ailments.  Thanks to the same Nvidia Optimus system, which correctly distributes the load, the laptop heats up very weakly.  If the temperature nevertheless begins to rise, the cooling system is activated.  It works quite efficiently and practically does not make noise.  At the same time, the temperature does not exceed 37 degrees even with large computing loads.  Therefore, damage to the components of the device is not threatened. </p><h2>  Asus X555LD reviews </h2><p>  The device has a lot of advantages.  And buyers simply could not fail to note this.  Many praise the laptop for its amazing design, high performance, good autonomy, and convenient <span>input devices.</span>  Among the minuses, users notice low ergonomics and a rather poor display. </p>

    <p>  A controversial factor is the price of the device.  To become the happy owner of the Asus X555LD, you need to pay about 45,000 rubles.  On the one hand, this is a huge amount, and not every user can afford this laptop.  On the other hand, the modern market is filled with less worthy devices for an even larger sum.  Against this background, the cost of the X555LD laptop looks quite acceptable to itself. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Asus X555LD is an excellent laptop that has a lot of advantages.  Perhaps the main feature of this gadget is the modern Nvidia Optimus technology, which makes this laptop so unique.  Thanks to it, the X555LD has high performance and does not overheat.  The brainchild of Asus will allow the user to play modern demanding games and work with heavy programs (like 3D MAX, etc.). </p><p>  Of course, the laptop also has disadvantages, but they fade against the background of advantages.  If you need a powerful device, and you are willing to pay for quality, then Asus X555LD is the best choice.  If you need a gadget exclusively for work and Internet surfing, then it is better to turn your attention to more budget models.  Those Asus have decent options.  For example, X200MA or E202SA can be noted. </p>
