Such problems arise in large resorts, for example, Adler, Sochi.  The state farm of Russia is famous for its free beaches, clear water off the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="state farm russia reviews" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20295/463280.jpg" width="580"></div>  Small, sand-like pebbles cover the entire coast.  Due to this, the water is transparent.  In some places you can find huge boulders.  The beach is flat and wide, without breakwaters.  On its territory there are comfortable locker rooms, rental of catamarans and sun loungers.  Fans of water entertainment can ride on a "bun", scooter or banana.  On the beach, massage therapists offer their services for therapeutic massage.  Any beach area is free.

    <h2>  Housing </h2><p>  There are many options for living in the village: from cheap and modest rooms to comfortable rooms in mini-hotels for a very reasonable price.  The most common type of housing in the village is the private sector.  There are a lot of offers in it.  You can find an option for any wallet.  A lot of private hotels with various rooms are offered to their guests by the state farm Russia.  Photos of tourists will capture not only the beauty of local landscapes, but also comfortable comfortable rooms in mini-hotels.  They are clean, with good repair and everything necessary for a comfortable stay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="state farm Russia photo" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20295/463278.jpg" width="500"></div>  There are no sanatoriums on the territory of the village, but there are recreation centers and camp sites known since the times of the USSR.  The main advantage of housing at the Rossiya state farm is its affordable price compared to similar offers in other areas of the coast.  A room with the same living conditions in Sochi or Adler will cost the tourist much more.  And the Rossiya state farm also has an additional advantage - the cleanest sea and fresh air.  This, unfortunately, cannot be said about the more famous resort cities.  You can rent housing on a state farm directly with the owners, saving on the percentage of intermediaries.  When choosing a village to relax in the autumn, you need to remember about seasonality.  Many, but not all, residential properties receive visitors all year round.

Tsimlyanskaya, Staroshkolnaya, Uritsky and Staroklubnaya are the names of the four streets on which almost all the infrastructure and residential facilities of the village are located.  Its advantage is that any accommodation is located near the beach.  Uritsky Street is central in the village, a 5-minute walk to the sea.  Cypress trees grow on it.  The most popular among vacationers is Tsimlyanskaya Street, since it is the closest to the sea.  All houses located on it have an equipped descent to the sea.  Not all housing has a sea view on Tsimlyanskaya Street.  The coast can be observed from the windows of a private hotel (house number 1-a) or residential buildings after number 38, which are also removed from the center with its vibrant nightlife, which guarantees peace.  The remaining houses of Tsimlyanskaya Street, although they do not have a view of the coast, are located away from the highway with minibuses and a patch with night cafes.  The bus route runs through the streets of Uritsky and Nizhne-Imeretinskaya.  The convenience of housing on Tsimlyanskaya is that the beach is close by, walking close to entertainment is about 7 minutes, and a quiet sleep is provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="state farm Russia Tsimlyanskaya" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20295/463281.jpg" width="600"></div>  In addition, many houses have excellent living conditions.  Their advantage in comparison with the hotel is the presence of a cozy courtyard, surrounded by greenery.  In the shade of the trees you can dine or just sit in the fresh air.  Vacationers understood all the advantages of Tsimlyanskaya street, so many who come again or on the advice of friends choose housing on it.
