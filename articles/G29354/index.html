It has a rather intricate story.  This is due to repeated changes to the project Pokrovsky radius, and all sorts of historical circumstances.  Work in this direction was carried out at the very beginning of the construction of the Moscow metro, back in the first half of the thirties.  But the station, known to us today as the Semenovskaya metro station, entered the number of operating stations only in January 1944.  At that time there was a war.  However, it was then called "Stalin".  And not at all because the ‚Äúleader of all peoples‚Äù was somehow involved in it, but simply by the name of the entire Moscow region, which at that time had a similar name. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro semenovskaya" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/296334.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  <strong>How was the metro station "Semenovskaya"</strong> </p><p>  The project of this station, which is part of the Pokrovsky radius, was accepted for execution as early as 1932.  The blue line of the Moscow Metro was built from the historical center of the city in the direction of Izmailov.  Construction successfully continued until 1935, when the General Plan for the Reconstruction of Moscow was adopted at the highest state level.  And this plan forced to review, in particular, the project of the Pokrovsky metro radius, going to the eastern regions of the capital.  Several stations were excluded from the line, the decision to abandon the construction of which was decided.  The construction of the Semenovskaya metro station was suspended, despite the significant amount of work already completed.  They returned to the construction of the station shortly before the start of the war.  During the war, it, unfinished, was used in a bomb shelter during German air raids on Moscow.  And in January 1944, the Stalin station took the first passengers.  It was completed and put into operation as part of the Pokrovsky radius.  It was in spite of the enemies.  This was a great symbolic meaning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro station semenovskaya" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/296333.jpg" width="488"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Architectural features of the metro station "Semenovskaya"</strong> </p><p>  In its constructive type, it is a three-span deep-laid pylon station.  It was built on an individual project, and a number of architectural innovations were applied during its construction.  After a careful study of the geological situation, the structural basis of the main hall was facilitated by replacing the pylons with columns.  This allowed to increase the <span>interior space of the</span> station and make it more convenient for passengers.  Light marble and red Ural granite dominate in the decoration of interiors.  The conceptual theme of the decoration of the station is the <span>Soviet Army.</span>  The arch of the main hall is decorated with an ornament depicting various types of heavy weapons that took part in the war.  The end wall of the hall is decorated with a stylized image of the <span>Order of Victory.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to metro semenovskaya" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/296332.jpg" width="496"></div>
