    <h2>  History of Origami Art </h2><p>  Patterns of flowers, animals and birds made by folding paper began to come up in the distant past.  No one knows the exact date of occurrence of this interesting technique.  Some believe that this art is older than the paper itself.  The first figures were created from pieces of fabric and were used to drape Japanese clothing.  Others connect the origin of origami with pagan cults.  In ancient times, in China and Japan, paper was often used for various religious rites.  For example, at the funeral, it was customary to burn all the clothes and household utensils of the deceased.  Later they began to burn only the names of objects written on paper.  Even later, some things that were useful in everyday life began to be folded from paper.  The most common such figures were in Japan.  Paper was used there for the production of flashlights, umbrellas, screens, and even for the manufacture of clothing.  Gradually, the art of origami, the assembly diagram of simple figures and useful things in life, improved.  Paper models became more expressive and elegant.  Origami ceased to have a religious connotation and turned into court art.  Then folding the paper figures could be chosen by some, since paper was considered a very expensive pleasure.  The ability to make a figurine out of a leaf was considered a sign of refined taste and excellent education.  Today, when anyone can buy paper, the origami technique has become publicly available.  Now everyone can try their hand at creating bright and unexpected compositions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Origami paper for beginners </h2><p>  It turns out that it’s not so difficult to make beautiful figures.

    <h2>  Origami paper composition </h2><p>  Flowers, the schemes of which we will master today, are prepared using traditional technology.  One model has five petals.  Each petal of the bud is performed separately.  Then they are all bonded with PVA glue.  Having mastered the technique of making one petal, you can easily cope with the rest of the work.  If you wish, you can create a floral arrangement and decorate your house at the arrival of guests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Materials </h2><p>  You will need simple equipment that can be found at home with any modern person.  If something is missing, then buy everything you need in the nearest stationery store.  So, to create one flower you will need 5 sheets of colored paper.  Choose a color according to your desire.  Accordingly, if you have the patience to create a whole bouquet, then stock up on 30 sheets of paper.  The size of each square will depend on how much your bouquet will have.  It is optimal to cut squares with a side of 10-15 centimeters.  To form the buds you will also need glue.  It is better to take PVA, since it does not leave spots and does not deform the paper.  You can use office sticky paper, already cut into even squares. </p>

    <h2>  Make the first petal </h2><p>  So, let's take the first square and begin to prepare a simple origami for beginners.  The flower will consist of five petals, each of which is performed separately.  First you need to fold the square diagonally, carefully ironing the fold.  Lay the work up in front of you.  Now bend the right and left corners up so that you get a rhombus, and the base of the triangles are closed.  Next, visually divide the right triangle in half and bend it down along this imaginary line.  Do the same with the left side.  Now take two “sticking out” triangles with your fingers and close them.  Your petal should turn into a tube.  Former lower corners should be at the top.  They should be bent down and put in a small "pocket", formed from the folding of a rhombus.  Thus, your petal holds tight thanks to this design.  It remains to carefully iron all the corners to make the model neat. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="origami paper flowers scheme" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10919/380874.jpg?1398331554151" width="314"></div></h2><h2>  We form a bud </h2><p>  We continue to make our paper origami product.  Schemes for beginners, as a rule, are simple and of the same type.  At this stage, the most difficult is behind us.  Now you should repeat all that has already been done.  That is, for one bud you need to construct four more exactly the same petals.  Once everything is ready, apply glue to the central seam of each part.  Gently start gluing the petals to each other, aligning the length of the structure.  Continue to work until all five petals are glued.  Hold the bonding area of ​​the petals until the glue dries. </p>

    <h2>  Create a bouquet </h2><p>  If you have successfully completed the previous step, then you have already mastered the technique of making origami from paper.  Schemes for beginners, as a rule, are described in great detail so that the beginner does not get confused.  Therefore, you should not relax if you are ready to create a whole bouquet.  Make five more buds, carefully gluing each of them.  Now you should correctly combine all the flowers in one large and beautiful bouquet.  Everything needs to be done so that the glue is not visible, so it is important to be very careful.  First glue the first two flowers.  It is important to correctly determine the place of bonding.  These should be two leaflets located next to each other.  Glue the third flower to the second, also on two leaves.  Do the same with the remaining two colors.  Only one leaflet from each bud on the outside of the bouquet should not be affected by glue.  Thus, you should get a ring of five crafts.  Now it remains to insert the last, sixth, bud on top to complete our paper origami design.  Schemes for beginners, as you saw, are carried out very simply if you do the work carefully and without rushing. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, your craft is ready.  Now you can use it to decorate the wedding table or the interior of the living room for the holiday.  You can make several of these bouquets and lower them into the pool before the guests arrive.  Beautiful, floating bouquets will not leave indifferent any guest.  And your holiday is sure to be remembered for a long time by everyone present. </p>
