    <h2>  Attractions nearby </h2><p>  Near the hotel is Patong Pier, which offers a charming view of the stormy waters of the ocean.  The pier can be reached in less than half an hour on foot, while exploring the colorful streets of the city. </p><p>  One and a half kilometers from the hotel complex is Simon Cabaret.  Opened in 1991, now this cabaret is considered the most spectacular in Phuket and attracts many curious spectators. </p><p>  In the southern part of the island you can see the majestic beautiful temple complex of Wat Chalong.  Temple buildings are striking in their elegance and richness of decoration.  The territory of the complex is well-groomed, beautiful, with green spaces.  The atmosphere that reigns at Wat Chalong contributes to peace.  From the hotel to the temple can be reached by car, or by ordering an excursion to the travel agency at the hotel. </p><p>  <span>Phuket FantaSea</span> Park is 7 kilometers from the hotel <span>.</span>  This is a real Phuket legend!  A fantastic amusement park, bright, as if covered with a myriad of confetti, it will be interesting to both adults and children.  On the territory there is a theater, a zoo, a terrarium, shops ... In the evening, guests of the park will enjoy an unforgettable Thai-style show, based on the ancient local epic about the prince! </p><p>  In conclusion, I want to note that the Millennium Resort Patong reviews sometimes even get enthusiastic reviews.  This is a modern hotel with a convenient location, many useful services, good qualified staff.  There are more than 400 rooms (!), But thanks to the responsiveness and attentiveness of the employees, each guest can feel special. </p><p>  The hotel is equally suitable for single travelers and companies of young people who came to Phuket to celebrate their birthday, and have a good and active time.  It is suitable for young families with children and the elderly.  For each there is a number to taste and wallet. </p><p>  The administrator will be happy to help determine the choice of room.  For those who want a quiet secluded holiday, he will offer to settle in a building located away from the bustle of the main street, for those who care about the proximity of the shopping center, he will advise rooms in the building next to Dzhangtseylonom. </p><p>  Holidays on the exotic cozy island of Phuket will be sure to be remembered, and you will want to return there with friends, relatives, loved ones, show them amazing Thailand, delightful palm trees in the very center of the city ... Take them to the dazzling Jangzeilon, let you enjoy the gentle tropical wind and give you the opportunity to live in the amazing Millennium Resort Patong. </p>
