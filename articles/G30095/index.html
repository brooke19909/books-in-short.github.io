It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly 13 square meters.  km  The population in 2016 was about 10 thousand people.  The city itself is small, but its history is rich in interesting facts. </p><h2>  Briefly about the city </h2><p>  For the first time in the ancient Russian chronicles Kargopol was found in 1447 under the name ‚ÄúCargo Field‚Äù, and already in the next century this settlement became a major trading point.  In 1765, a huge fire broke out in the city, which incinerated many residential buildings and cathedrals, due to which it was almost completely rebuilt.  Some architectural sights of Kargopol were completely destroyed by fire. </p><p>  Now the city is a small town with many churches, cathedrals and other buildings, which must be visited by a person who is interested in the history of Russia and the Orthodox religion. </p><h2>  Unique 16th Century Cathedral </h2><p>  In Kargopol, there are more than a dozen objects of cultural heritage of Russia, attracting the attention of Russian and foreign tourists.  Guests visiting this city for the first time mainly turn their attention to the Nativity of Christ Cathedral. </p>

    <p>  The church has a strict square perimeter shape that is not very characteristic of an Orthodox religious building.  It, like most Kargopol churches, is built of white stone, and its top is marked by five domes.  Peter I personally made a contribution to its construction, having allocated 100 rubles in 1689. </p><h2>  Church of St. John the Baptist </h2><p>  This church belongs to more modern monuments of architecture.  It was built in the XVIII century.  The building was built according to all the canons of the Baroque style.  This structure has a distinctive feature.  It consists in the use of an interesting architectural solution.  The <span>Church of St. John the Baptist is decorated with</span> special double domes and octagonal windows.  It is the highest in the city (spire height is 35 meters). </p>

    <h2>  Church of Zosima and Savvaty </h2><p>  Almost all the diversity of Kargopol churches is combined into one large state historical-architectural and art museum, founded in 1919.  Here is an exposition dedicated to the heritage of the city.  The site for the museum is one of the richest churches in the interior of the city - the church of Zosima and Savvaty.  The period of its construction fell on 1814-1819.  Despite the fact that it has been two centuries since the construction, this building is one of the newest attractions of the city, which once again emphasizes the rich historical heritage of Kargopol. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  House museums </h2><p>  In addition to many beautiful temples, in Kargopol there are several architectural monuments that are not related to any religion.  Such is Veshnyakov‚Äôs two-story merchant mansion.  It is on the second floor is now an exhibition "Dollhouse".  This exhibition will certainly appeal to people who decide to see the sights of Kargopol with their children.  It is also recommended that parents with children visit the Shevelev family house museum.  Here you can enjoy the art of <span>clay toys,</span> which is a folk craft in the Arkhangelsk region.  Do not ignore the large ethnographic collection, which is located in another museum located in the building of a merchant's house.  It's about the house of Nikolai Fedorovich Annin. </p><h2>  Attractions in the vicinity of the city </h2><p>  Arriving in Kargopol, one should not forget that beautiful places are not only in the center of this settlement, but also on its outskirts or even outside the city.  They are so interesting that they must also be seen.  For example, to the west of the city, in the village of Lyadiny, there is a whole complex of temples built exclusively of wood and most recently restored. </p><p>  There are also remarkable architectural monuments in the village of Oshevensky, which is located north of Kargopol.  There you can see the Alexander-Oshevensky monastery and the wooden tent-roofed Epiphany church.  The latter, although it is a historical monument, preserved from the XVIII century, but does not apply to museums.  The church and now meets parishioners from all surrounding settlements. </p>
