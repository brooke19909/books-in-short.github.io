The description of the hotel would be incomplete if you do not recall the services that are provided for the youngest guests.  Since the complex is focused on family vacations, caring for children's leisure is quite logical.  The hotel has a children's playroom and babysitting services.  In addition, for children there is a separate pool with a shallow depth.  It is located near an adult reservoir, which makes it possible to keep the situation under control.  The children's pool uses thermal heated water, in addition, it is equipped with children's toys.  The hotel has a playground with slides, swings and all the necessary attributes.  The games room is located on the ground floor and is equipped with furniture and games.  The hotel's restaurants have a special menu for children, and the spa has even developed chocolate massage sessions for young tourists. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  Hotel Golden Line 4 * (Golden Sands, Bulgaria) has one of the largest territories in the resort.  The building of the complex is surrounded by more than a hectare of green space.  The entire hotel is at the service of vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golden line aparthotel 4 golden sands" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1509732.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The complex has at its disposal several banquet rooms, so you can hold celebrations here.  The rich interiors of the restaurants and the excellent banquet menu will make any event unforgettable.  The hotel staff helps organize high-level celebrations. </p><p>  In addition, the aparthotel has a conference room where you can conduct business meetings and negotiations.  The hall is able to accommodate 120 guests, it is equipped with all necessary equipment. </p><h2>  Golden Line 4 * (Golden Sands): reviews </h2><p>  Concluding the conversation about the hotel, I would like to discuss the reviews of tourists.  In their opinion, the complex has an incredibly convenient location, being in the very center of the resort.  The hotel building is completely new, it was built in 2012, respectively, the interiors are made in a modern style and have not yet fallen into disrepair.  Check-in is fast enough, if there are free rooms, then you will certainly be taken before 14.00. </p><p>  One of the most popular room categories in Golden Line 4 * is Studio.  Golden Sands is a fairly popular resort, here every vacationer can find affordable apartments: from the simplest to the most luxurious.  Nevertheless, the most popular are budget rooms.  Moreover, in this hotel all the apartments are new, with good interiors and decor. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned daily. Some guests are dissatisfied with its quality, and towels are also changed every day. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  As for nutrition, there are no complaints about it.  The hotel is really good and very diverse.  Only one fruit serves up to ten items.  There are always meat, side dishes, chicken, snacks, salads, cheese slices, cream soups for lunch.  In addition, a large selection of flour and delicious desserts is pleasing.  <span>All Inclusive</span> does not include much alcohol: beer, champagne, wine (white, red, pink).  Cocktails are paid separately. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel is located 100 meters from the beach, only a few minutes walk, but the pleasant fact is that you can‚Äôt hear the sounds of music from the promenade, as the cafes and restaurants here work until the last visitor.  Near the complex there are many establishments where you can eat deliciously.  This is especially interesting for those who do not pay "all inclusive", but prefer half board.  The rooms have excellent kitchenettes, but unfortunately there are no pots and pans.  Therefore, it is difficult to cook something. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel golden line 4 golden sands bulgaria" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1509788.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Near the hotel there is a wide sandy beach.  Sun beds and deck chairs on it are paid, but you can relax on your towels for free.  Entry into the sea is gentle, however, stones are found at the bottom.  Some tourists complain about this fact.  In general, the beach is beautiful and good, and the water in the sea is clean and warm. </p><p>  The hotel has a good kids club with entertainers entertaining young guests.  For adults and children, sports programs, shows and discos are held every day. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  According to the guests of the complex, the hotel has a decent level of service, food and accommodation.  This is one of the best resort spots in its category.  The hotel fully complies with the price-quality ratio.  It is especially pleasant that the hotel practices a system of discounts not only for regular customers, but also for large families and companies, so the prices for tours to it are quite reasonable. </p>
