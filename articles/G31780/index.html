Traditional levels and slats fade into the background, giving way to more functional and technological electronic counterparts.  Optical and laser devices for determining the position of construction objects provide high accuracy results, while performing complex mathematical calculations based on the data obtained.  And it is quite logical that, as the devices become more complicated, questions arise about how to work with the level?  The educational program for beginners, presented below, will allow you to master the basic rules for the use of such devices.  Despite their physical ergonomics, the operation process involves the implementation of a number of procedures, on which the correctness of the result will depend. </p>

    <h2>  The device of optical levels </h2><p>  The base of the device is formed by a tribrach - this is a metal circle, the position of which is fixed by three supports with adjusting elements.  The lifting screws allow you to optimally position the structure on the site, minimizing the risk of deviations.  The device also includes a horizontal limb, telescope, cylindrical levels and a compensator in the form of a magnetic or air damper.  <span>How to work</span> with a level of this type?  Initially, the adjustment is made by means of the above-mentioned screws, and the measurement itself is carried out through the telescope.  Depending on the configuration, optical devices may have several lenses in the kit, allowing measurements to be made under different conditions.  To correct the instrument for clarity, the head part with optics also provides for the presence of adjusting screws that reduce the risk of a large error.  With the help of such equipment, you can determine the height of the structure, the differences in the levels of the position of individual objects, fix the angle of inclination, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Laser Level Device </h2><p>  Models of this kind do not have a telescope, which saves the user from self-determination of the geometric parameters of the object.  The working base is a laser emitter projecting the beam onto the target area.  The design also provides for the availability of regulatory fittings, but in this case, the error tolerance is excluded, since most models, regardless of position, can automatically adjust the angle of the beam relative to the horizontal. </p>

    <p>  How does a laser level work?  The device prepared for the operation is guided by the optics to the object, as a result of which a point is reflected on the surface at which you can estimate the height and measure.  Such equipment is good in that it reduces the risk of error due to the human factor.  Also, its advantages include a wide range of additional options related to the processing of information received. </p><h2>  Features of rotation models </h2><p>  These are the most technologically advanced devices designed to perform marking on a construction site.  A key feature of such models is the presence of a rotating detector, in which there are two lasers.  They can move at a speed of about 600 rpm, projecting a beam in the range of 360 ¬∞.  How to work with a level of a rotational type?  The technique of handling such devices generally corresponds to standard laser devices, and the difference lies only in the organization of the final markup.  That is, if the beam in conventional models provides information about one characteristic, after which it needs to be moved, then the rotation technique from one position allows complex calculations.  This approach is especially effective when installing windows, performing surface finishes, and in other operations where it is necessary to obtain data on the position of different objects within the same room or construction site.  But in an open area, restrictions may arise related to <span>the distance</span> to the target. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  General Instrument Use </h2><p>  Before embarking on basic work activities, measures should be taken to ensure the safety of the device.  First of all, the case must be protected from water, dirt, dust and physical shock.  As a rule, the construction of building levels has a multi-level dust and moisture insulation, but this may not be enough.  For example, in heavy rain it is impossible to use even models with a protection class higher than IP54 without an additional shell.  The same applies to the threat of direct sunlight.  Temporary overheating of the equipment may not cause it to fail, but it will completely affect the accuracy of the measurements. </p><p>  How to work with the level, if the street is cold or hot weather and surface shelter does not help?  Initially, it is worth making sure that the device is, in principle, suitable for operation at a given temperature mode.  As a rule, models from large manufacturers can be used with an average range of -10 to 25 ¬∞ C.  But in this case, it is necessary to adhere to certain operating rules.  For example, optical models are sensitive to temperature extremes.  After completing the measurement, the device should be brought into a warm room and heated in a complete case for about 30 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What will be required for work? </h2><p>  Use a tripod to ensure the correct position of the device.  You can do without it in a room with an even foundation, but if it comes to working on a construction site on bare ground, then adjustable equipment will not be superfluous.  But even in a room without special supporting devices it will be inconvenient to work with the device.  Ergonomic holders are provided for such purposes.  They can be attached to walls, floors and even to the ceiling. </p>

    <p>  A special rail is also required.  Its scale will allow on the target surface to designate the divisions by which the desired readings will be recorded.  How to work with level and rail?  Traditional methods suggest that two people will participate in the process - one is directly responsible for fixing the data, and the second holds the staff.  However, the latest models of laser electronic devices automatically process data, taking into account the special bar codes of the rails.  In this case, the user only needs to activate the corresponding function and set the scale position correctly. </p><h2>  Optical Instrument Operation </h2><p>  As already mentioned, work begins with the adjustment of the telescope.  The main task at this stage is to achieve extreme clarity of the image of the object.  The adjustment is carried out by means of screws, and the correctness is evaluated by sight through the eyepiece. </p>

    <p>  Further work, unlike laser models, is performed together.  One worker perpendicular to the ground sets the rail, and the second takes readings using the image of the optical level.  How to work with it, so that during the operation the correctness of the data does not decrease?  Firstly, a lot will depend on the reliability of the position of the device.  Therefore, special attention is initially paid to the stability of the fixation of the legs.  Secondly, professional surveyors use spirit levels.  These are devices with bubble levels, due to which both the position of the tripod and the position of the level are adjusted.  When the device is ready for operation, the pipe sight is aimed at the divisions of the rail.  Then it remains only to record the testimony in a technical journal. </p><h2>  How to work with a laser type level? </h2><p>  The device is also fixed by means of a tripod or special holders.  After making sure that the installation is reliable, you can start work activities.  After pressing a special button, a beam is delivered to the target surface.  Lines can be projected on a horizontal or vertical plane, and some models also provide for the possibility of crosstalk.  After that, the device automatically takes readings from the prepared staff with divisions.  If marking is planned at large distances, then you can not do without a special receiver, which will separately record the position of the beam.  <span>How to learn to work with a</span> level supplemented by such a device?  Basic operations are also undertaken by automation.  The operator only needs to track the readings on the display of the receiver, which can fix the position of the points at distances of about 80-100 m. At the time of registration of the beam, the device will give the appropriate signal and display the received information, which is recorded in the log. </p>

    <h2>  Instrument Maintenance </h2><p>  The most demanding optical devices.  Therefore, after each application session, it is necessary to wipe the eyepieces, lenses and surfaces of the telescope.  The slightest pollution can affect the accuracy of data reflection.  For example, the Kondtrol company has a wide range of devices of this type, recommending regular verification as well.  In reviews of these products, criticism is often found in which it is noted that clarity does not work on the Sokia level.  The reasons for reducing the image quality of models in this series may lie in the dusting of optics, and in structural violations.  For example, if the same lenses were loose.  In this case, verification procedures should be performed using a white sheet of paper.  It is located at a predetermined distance near the marking rail.  Correction of optical equipment is carried out until the measurement results do not coincide with previously known actual data. </p><h2>  Optical Type Reviews </h2><p>  The main audience of users of such levels is professional builders and surveyors who clearly understand the principles of the work process.  According to them, optical devices, provided they are used correctly, can provide accuracy with an accuracy of 0.2 mm.  But their main advantage lies in the flexibility of organizing the measurement procedure.  The operator may, during the course of the procedure, make subtle adjustments depending on the operating conditions.  For example, how to work with a level at a construction site if the weather interferes or there are other kinds of interference?  It is a manual adjustment process adjusted for certain circumstances in such situations will be more profitable.  The user can shift the device without being distracted by the software settings, quickly capturing data. </p><h2>  Reviews about laser levels </h2><p>  Owners of such technology put convenience, high speed data processing and multifunctionality in the forefront.  How to work with a level of this type for a beginner?  Simple enough - you just need to place the device at the optimum point for measurement and run the computing program.  Next, the readings from the measurement site will be automatically taken.  Moreover, such equipment is used by both inexperienced home masters and professionals who are attracted by the presence of additional options - for example, the possibility of complex and serial calculations for given functions. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The arrival of the new generation of measuring equipment, of course, changed the very principle of organizing the marking process.  In many ways, the innovation eased the tasks of builders, engineers, and surveyors, but among lay people, it is quite logical to ask questions about how to use the level?  Operational features of optical and laser devices are associated with a higher responsibility for preparatory activities.  The user has a whole range of regulatory operations, and the accuracy of the measurement results directly depends on the setting.  This is less true for laser models, so they are primarily recommended for domestic use.  Optical devices, however, are complex not only in terms of tuning, but also directly at the stage of the workflow. </p>
