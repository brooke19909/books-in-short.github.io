    <p>  The October Revolution is a complex, ambiguous phenomenon in the life of the Russian state, which still causes a lot of controversy.  It was caused by many reasons and prerequisites, which inevitably should have led to such a grandiose resolution of the problems that have arisen in the country. </p><p>  From 1914 to 1918, Russia experienced the <span>First World War, the cause of</span> which was the struggle for influence due to the lack of a single legal and <span>market mechanism</span> in Europe.  Russia in it was forced to take a defensive position, the army lost many soldiers and suffered permanent defeats.  Against this background, the situation was such that the country was left without an authoritative government.  At the same time, negative factors in the economy were growing (shortage of raw materials, transport, labor, rising prices, etc.).  Among politicians, organizations and circles began to mature conspiracies against Tsar Nicholas II. </p><p>  The October Revolution had causes of both a subjective and objective nature.  The objective ones include class contradictions, which reached their climax by 1917.  The bourgeoisie did not manage to take measures in time to reduce the intensity of the class struggle.  The situation in the village was even more acute.  Neither the reform of 1861, nor the Stolypin transformations solved the problems of the peasants who wanted to receive land in the property and the right to dispose of it.  In addition, a clear differentiation of the peasantry itself was identified in the village.  The beginning of the revolution accelerated the national movement, intensified after the February revolution.  The overwhelming mass of the population very seriously experienced the hardships of war and longed for a peace.  This was especially true for soldiers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The October <span>Revolution of 1917</span> was an event that led to the transformation of the feudal country into a bourgeois state. </p><p>  The interim government could not solve the accumulated problems of society (issues of peace, land and bread).  Against this background, the significance of the Soviets was clearly noticeable, which promised to give the people what they expected. </p><p>  The October Revolution also had subjective reasons.  Socialist ideas were very popular among the people.  In addition, a party already existed in Russia that advocated radical transformations and was ready to raise the masses for revolution.  It was a party of Bolsheviks with a strong leader - V.I. Lenin. </p><p>  In such circumstances, the opposition of the regime in the person of the Bolsheviks, who carried out active anti-war and anti-government agitation and advocated the transfer of power to the Soviets, was supported by the people.  Lenin demanded an immediate <span>armed uprising.</span>  Kerensky and the interim government began to draw troops to Petrograd.  And the Presidium of the Petrograd Soviet and the Executive Committee <span>(L. Trotsky)</span> supported the course of Lenin. </p><p>  To coordinate the actions of the rebels, the Politburo was created (V. Lenin, L. I. Stalin, Trotsky, A. Bubnov, G. Zinoviev, L. Kamenev) and the Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee (Y. Sverdlov, F. Dzerzhinsky, I. Stalin, etc.).  Bolshevik commissars were appointed to command posts in <span>military units</span> .  The Provisional Government proceeded to rout the Bolshevik printing houses in order to prevent Soviet agitation. </p><p>  The October Revolution began with an armed uprising on October 24th.  Immediately the bridges on the Neva, the Central Telegraph, Nikolaevsky Station, the State Bank were seized, military schools were blocked, etc. </p><p>  On the night of October 25 to 26, with a salvo of Aurora, the Winter Zimny ‚Äã‚Äãwas launched.  The interim government has lost power.  At the head of the state were the Bolsheviks.  At the II All-Russian Congress of Soviets, Decrees were adopted on power (its transition to the Soviets), peace (without indemnities and annexations) and land (the abolition of private ownership of land, its redistribution between peasants).  At the Congress, the Council of People's Commissars was created - a government body that was supposed to work until the convening of the <span>Constituent Assembly.</span>  It included V. Lenin (chairman);  I. Teodorovich, A. Lunacharsky, N. Avilov, I. Stalin, V. Antonov, etc. A new composition of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee was elected. </p><p>  The October Revolution was logical in Russian history and had many obvious premises. </p>
