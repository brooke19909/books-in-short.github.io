  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to crochet a blouse for a girl?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every year there are more and more people who prefer knitted clothes.  This is due to the fact that such wardrobe items not only allow you to warm up in the cold, but also look stylish, original and undoubtedly attractive. </p><p>  Despite the abundance of goods presented in stores, it often happens that the buyer can not find a thing that completely suits him.  And then many creative people decide to tie it on their own.  But only experienced needlewomen clearly know the sequence of actions of the whole process.  Beginners will help the instruction.  In the article, we will consider how to crochet a blouse for a girl. </p><h2>  How to choose the most suitable skein of yarn? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="crochet-kingdom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blouse models for girls" class="if uuid-3016884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3016884.jpg"></div><p>  Professional needlewomen are convinced that the first thing to consider is the design of the desired wardrobe item.  At least schematically draw a blouse style on a sheet of paper, pick up a pattern, and then knit threads.  Since in the presented material we study the technology of making children's clothes, experts advise giving preference to bright colors. </p><p>  When buying, it is important to pay attention to the composition of the yarn.  Acrylic yarn or made from natural but not prickly wool is best suited for our product.  If you are at a loss to make a choice yourself, experienced craftsmen advise you to purchase special children's yarn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Monochrome, pastel or calm yarn should be used to crochet blouses for the girl in which the pattern is provided.  If the craftswoman plans to knit with hosiery or garter stitch, it is wiser to choose an unusual skein.  For example, melange knitting thread. </p><h2>  Which tool to use? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="blouse crocheted summer" class="if uuid-3016880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3016880.jpg"></div><p>  The question formulated in the title of the current paragraph requires special attention.  Professional craftsmen are convinced that a good hook ensures speed and quality of work.  Therefore, it is necessary to choose a medium-length tool that is convenient to hold in your hand.  It should be carefully examined.  There should be no chips or roughness. </p><p>  In addition, it is important to consider your skills.  If the reader tightens the loops very much, it makes more sense to purchase a metal tool.  And if she knits too loosely - wooden.  In any case, you should pick up the hook to the yarn, which will be used to knit a blouse on the girl.  The hook and thickness of the thread should match. </p><h2>  Features of taking measurements </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="blouse for girls crochet patterns and description" class="if uuid-3016847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3016847.jpg"></div><p>  In order not to make a mistake with the size of the model, it is necessary to measure the girl on whom we will knit a blouse.  Pre-prepare a piece of paper and a pen.  It is important to note that a beautiful lady should be in something tight.  For example, a T-shirt or turtleneck.  Otherwise, the obtained parameters will be inaccurate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We proceed to the procedure.  We measure: </p><ul><li>  chest girth; </li><li>  neck circumference; </li><li>  sleeve length; </li><li>  forearm girth; </li><li>  product length; </li><li>  the distance from the bottom of the blouse to the armpit. </li></ul><h2>  Subtleties of the translation of centimeters </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="blouse girl crochet pattern" class="if uuid-3016858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3016858.jpg"></div><p>  If you knit a blouse for a girl with a crochet, focusing on a centimeter tape, you can make a lot of mistakes.  Not to mention that even getting the right number of loops will hardly succeed even on the second attempt.  After all, the canvas stretches, which means that the parameters will change each time.  Therefore, professional craftswomen strongly advise beginners to pre-calculate the required units of measurement.  To then just crochet a children's blouse, following your own calculations. </p><p>  It is very easy to do.  It is only necessary to prepare a template or pattern for use in knitting ideas.  However, you should not be scared, there is not much work to be done!  It is enough to prepare a square with a side of ten centimeters.  Then divide the girth of the chest, the girth of the neck and the girth of the forearm by 10 and multiply by the number of loops contained in the template.  Also divide the length of the sleeve, the length of the product, the distance from the lower edge of the blouse to the armpit by 10 and multiply by the number of loops contained in the sample.  Each new parameter must be fixed on a piece of paper.  And already then start crocheting a children's blouse. </p><h2>  Simple blouse </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet baby blouse" class="if uuid-3016841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3016841.jpg"></div><p>  Professional needlewomen say that even ordinary products can be varied with decorative elements.  And this statement is demonstrated by the model presented in the article.  To tie her up: </p><ol><li>  We collect a chain equal to the circumference of the chest. </li><li>  We lock in a ring and knit in a circle to the armpit. </li><li>  We fold the product in half, knit a row and add air loops from each side, the number of which is equal to the circumference of the forearm.  These manipulations must be performed both when crocheting a summer blouse for a girl and a winter one. </li><li>  We knit five rows without increases and decreases. </li><li>  In the remaining rows, we gradually reduce the loops, trying to reach the calculated neck circumference. </li><li>  We break the thread and knit the sleeves. </li><li>  After we knit three colorful balls and a brown or beige triangle. </li><li>  Sew to the blouse, spreading ice cream. </li><li>  In conclusion, we complement the product with pearls. </li></ol><p>  Thus, it is possible to tie a blouse for the girl with a crochet with a reverse raglan.  The model in the photo is warm, but if you use different yarn, you can create a product for the summer. </p><h2>  Jacket for the girl </h2><p>  If you want to connect a different model of the studied wardrobe item, you should carefully study the material presented.  It explains in detail and understandable language the whole process of work. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="sn2SFKetkXw" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn2SFKetkXw" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/3/0/8/2/13082.jpg"></div><p>  We hope beginners will enjoy crocheting a blouse for girls.  Schemes and descriptions will not only help to understand the technology, but also come across new interesting ideas. </p>
