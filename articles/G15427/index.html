    <h2>  Industrial park </h2><p>  Management Company "Industrial Park Kamskiye Polyany" is a complex of modern and cost-effective enterprises for the production of raw materials for construction, the automotive industry, agriculture, the textile industry, as well as the manufacture of packaging materials.  This object was created in 2010.  A network of high-tech industries specializing in the processing of polymers as the main element of the national innovation system has been formed here.  Full-scale implementation of the project can stimulate the development of this depressed region.  Here it is planned to create infrastructure facilities necessary for the smooth operation of industrial facilities, in addition, it is necessary to help increase the level of investment attractiveness of this territory.  It is planned that <span>the project</span> will reduce the share of imports of petroleum and chemical products in the region, amounting to more than fifty percent of consumption.  It is also proposed to create a complex of cost-effective industries, new jobs, which will lead to an increase in the living standard of the population. </p><h2>  Unusual tourism </h2><p>  This object is completely not interesting for people who want to spend their holidays at sea, in the forest, in the mountains or other places rich in historical and cultural attractions.  However, for those who are constantly expanding their horizons, they believe that knowledge is not superfluous, and absorb it from everywhere, it will not be superfluous to visit Kamsky Polyany located near the city of Nizhnekamsk.  This industrial village will be interesting for those who were in the coal mines of Donbass, the Far East gold mines, the kimberlite pipe ‚ÄúMir‚Äù, offshore oil platforms and the largest industrial enterprises of the modern industrial world.  UK ‚ÄúKamskiy Polyany Industrial Park‚Äù (Tatarstan) does not yet have a rich history, but has already loudly declared itself on the market of the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kama glades Tatarstan" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/457080.jpg" width="600"></div>
