    <h2>  Turkish Resorts: General Description </h2><p>  Holidays on the coast of Turkey will be one of the brightest moments in your life.  And this is not surprising, because this country can provide tourists with a choice of hotels on several seas at once.  Potential travelers simply run their eyes from advertising photographs in catalogs of potential travelers.  In addition, each resort has its own characteristics, which tourists usually learn about already on the spot.  How to choose the <span>best coast of Turkey?</span>  It's simple, we will tell you all the most interesting about them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When choosing a resort, tourists primarily pay attention to the beach on which they will have to relax.  Most of them prefer sandy beaches with a gentle entry into the water, but there are also lovers of pebble coastal zones that have their own special flavor. </p><p>  The best resorts of the country are located on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey and the coastal zone of the Aegean Sea.  These areas can offer vacationers sandy, pebble and mixed beaches.  Almost all of them are well equipped, and many are marked with a blue flag, which means that this place is especially clean.  When planning a vacation in Turkey, try to choose hotels located on one of these coasts.  And about what are the distinguishing features of good hotel complexes, we will tell you in the next section of the article. </p><h2>  Best turkish hotels: characteristic </h2><p>  As we have already found out, in Turkey the beach where the hotel is located is of great importance.  Therefore, choosing a tour, ask if the hotel complex has its own beach or if you have to relax on the municipal coastal strip.  Naturally, the best hotels are those that have their own beach area.  You can be sure that there will be security, developed infrastructure and perfect cleanliness.  This is carefully monitored by hotel complex employees. </p><p>  It is worth considering the "stardom" of the hotel, because they go to Turkey not only over the sea and the sun, but also for excellent service and entertainment.  It so happened that five-star and four-star hotels are the best.  They have a vast territory with a large number of infrastructure facilities, an excellent team of animators and provide a high level of service.  Therefore, in this case, do not skimp and look for budget "treshki".  In Turkey, the level of stardom is very important, and the difference between hotels, for example, the category of "three stars" and "four stars" is very noticeable.  We have prepared for you a list of the best hotels on the Turkish coast, but we will return to this issue a little later. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mediterranean Resorts </h2><p>  When we talk about the Mediterranean coast, we primarily mean <span>Antalya resorts.</span>  But do not forget that Antalya itself is significantly different from other resort places in its province.  These places are distinguished by their location and characteristics of the beaches.  The following resorts are among the best on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey: </p><ul><li>  Alanya; </li><li>  Belek; </li><li>  Side; </li><li>  Kemer; </li><li>  Antalya </li></ul><p>  We paid attention to each resort in a separate section. </p><h2>  Alanya </h2>

A distinctive feature of Belek are beaches.  Most of them are marked with a <span>blue flag,</span> and this indicates environmental cleanliness.

    <p>  About Side, we can say that this is a fairly young resort on the coast of Turkey.  Not so long ago, it was a tiny settlement, but it quickly transformed into a stunning tourist destination.  Now it is incredibly popular among Russian tourists. </p><p>  The western part of the resort is developing more rapidly, so there are many hotels, and the beaches are filled with vacationers.  But eastern Side belongs to calm resorts with beach areas that perfectly fit into the beautiful natural landscape. </p><p>  On the beaches of the resort I want to say separately.  They are fabulously beautiful.  Imagine a wide strip of sand stretching along the emerald waters of the Mediterranean Sea, which literally glistens in the sun.  For the sake of such a spectacle, it is worth going to this young resort. </p><h2>  Barut Hemera 5 * </h2><p>  In Side, this hotel is considered one of the best.  It has its own beach with a length of 100 m. This area is fully equipped for relaxation, so guests of the hotel complex can absolutely spend their time here with comfort. </p><p>  In the hotel itself there are water slides, a variety of pools, several restaurants and bars, as well as a large number of entertainment centers for children and adults.  Many guests of Barut Hemera 5 * consider it the most worthy of all located in Side. </p><h2>  Turkey, Kemer: coast </h2>

    <p>  This resort covers a very vast territory, which is divided into at least five practically independent resorts.  Our compatriots were especially fond of Kirish, Goynuk and Beldibi. </p><p>  Keep in mind that almost all Kemer beaches are pebble.  The stones are very small and do not cause much discomfort when walking along the beach.  However, it is this fact that allows water to be transparent.  On the entire coast of Turkey, the Mediterranean Sea is the cleanest here.  This is noted by tourists and numerous experts who monitor the quality of beach areas. </p><p>  Kemer has a very developed infrastructure, which is why young people often come here who prefer to have fun all night.  There are many restaurants and colorful national cafes where specialties of lamb and seafood are prepared. </p><h2>  Antalya </h2>

    <p>  If you are attracted by numerous shops and the bustling nightlife of Turkey, the <span>Antalya coast</span> is what you really need.  Antalya is a noisy and large resort with beautiful sandy beaches located mainly within the city. </p><p>  The choice of hotels here is very wide.  Young people usually prefer simple hotels in the city center with extreme proximity to bars and restaurants, and families with children tend to the suburbs.  Recently, Russian tour operators began to sell permits for hotels located in the small village of Lara.  It is a suburb of Antalya and has more than ten luxurious five-star hotel complexes.  The only drawback may be the buzz of airliners going for landing, because there is an international airport close to Lara. </p><h2>  Hotel Barut Lara 5 * </h2><p>  This is one of the best hotels in the suburbs of Antalya.  Its beach is a piece of the famous Lara beach, which is a long sand spit. </p><p>  This hotel complex is called chic by guests, because it has a very developed infrastructure, excellent cuisine and great design.  The hotel staff are very polite, caring and pay attention to details.  Guests always feel that they are treated as long-awaited guests, and tend to return here again. </p><h2>  Aegean coast of Turkey: resorts </h2><p>  The resort areas on the shores of the Aegean are no less beautiful than on the Mediterranean coast.  However, they are much more expensive, therefore Europeans mainly relax here.  Of course, Russians also come here and note that local resorts resemble European ones.  The best places are Marmaris and Bodrum.  We will give a brief description of them in the following sections of the article. </p><h2>  Marmaris </h2>
