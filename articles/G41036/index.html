It has less than a thousand inhabitants, mainly Kazakhs and Altai.  The territory belongs to the Kosh-Agach district, the largest in area in the Altai Republic.  You can get to Tashanta via the Chuysky tract.  In the area there are often tourists seeking to visit the Russian or Mongolian mountain Altai, since only here you can cross the border.  Inhaling a breath of fresh air, getting to know the antiquities and customs of Altai Kazakhs, relaxing on a hillside or the shore of a picturesque lake, from where you can see the snow-capped peaks of the mountains in the distance - these are not all the possibilities that are presented when visiting this region. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The village of Tashanta of the Altai Republic is located at an altitude of about two kilometers above sea level.  Near the river Tashantinka.  The village has a little more than twenty streets, all of them have preserved Russian names, since the days of the Soviet Union.  For example, there are: Pushkin, Lenin, Zarechnaya.  There is also a border crossing;  motorists wishing to get from Russia to Mongolia or in the opposite direction are lining up.  Staying in the most populated area for travelers from Russia has no restrictions.  It is enough to show the Russian passport to the border guards.  But for residents of foreign states, special rules apply for staying in the border territory. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tashanta Altai Republic rest" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2023512.jpg" width="584"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the borders of the states of the PRC and the Republic of Kazakhstan are not so far located.  The local nature is rather scarce: there are few plants, there are practically no forests nearby.  In the photo of Tashant in the Altai Republic it appears as a small village, the main purpose of which is a border post. </p><h2>  What to see? </h2><p>  The famous attraction of this place are cave paintings.  They can be seen on a long stretch, especially on the cliffs between the Tashantinka and Yustyt rivers.  By the number of images, more than a hundred, among them petroglyphs with various animals: camels, goats, and occasionally - eagles.  You can find them, following the east of the village.  The path is not long: you need to walk about 10 kilometers. </p><p>  People come to Tashantu of the Altai Republic to look at the steles of the Yustyt complex.  The oldest mounds are nearby.  Stones in the form of idols with carved human faces make a strong impression on inexperienced tourists.  Against the backdrop of high mountains and hills, you can make a series of beautiful photographs in memory of the trip.  After walking a little further, you can find many funerary structures found by archaeologists.  They are called Kereksurs.  They look like a mound with a fence made of round stones.  The sight is unusual, so a lot of tourists visit the place every year. </p><p>  The Chuysky tract is world famous - the road along which the path to Tashanta passes.  Her beauty was admired by travelers from different countries.  While driving, you can see stunning views on the sides: mountain slopes, snow-white peaks, winding stormy rivers, flowering mountain plants. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  From the windows of the car you will see the famous Altai <span>Katun River</span> with turquoise water. </p><h2>  Other interesting places </h2><p>  Among other attractions of Tashanta in the Altai Republic, it is worth mentioning a place in the vicinity called Kyzyl-Chin.  This is a territory with an unusual landscape: a tract in which, due to the high concentration of metal ore, clay soil has a red tint.  The attraction was jokingly nicknamed ‚ÄúMars‚Äù, there are no plants here, desert lands were covered with cracks in places.  Rising higher into the mountains, photographers can capture other shades of the landscape: green, brown, white (the color was influenced by the time of formation of each soil layer). </p><p>  Not far from Tashanta in the Altai Republic there are many beautiful lakes.  Near the border with the neighboring state, there is a large in area and stunning in beauty Lake Kindyktykul. </p>

    <p>  The complex consists of stone blocks of large diameter laid in a circle shape.  Numerous petroglyphs are applied to the surface.  Historians have established that the local Stonehenge appeared in the Bronze Age.  There are different versions of the purpose of the structure, one of which says that stones were used to study astronomical bodies. </p><h2>  Rest in Tashant (Altai Republic) </h2><p>  Visiting tourists can stay for the night with local residents, or put up tents near the village.  The most suitable will be a place by the river.  There are several organized campsites near archaeological sites.  A little in the distance, but in the same area, there is a fairly well-known camping Tydtuyaryk, which provides tour services and the opportunity to spend the night in a yurt.  And hotel rooms with all amenities can be rented in the village of Kosh-Agach. </p><p>  The local river dries up periodically, so it is recommended to stock up on the road along the way.  There are several infrastructure facilities in the village of Tashanta in the Altai Republic: small rural shops and cafes. </p>

    <p>  Here, travelers can purchase groceries and essentials.  The assortment of goods, however, is small.  Therefore, a better option would be to stop in a larger settlement along the way (Kosh-Agach, Aktash). </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The choice of route depends on where the tourists will come from: from Mongolia or from Russia.  On the way to Tashanta through the Altai Republic, there will be several settlements and vast territories of the Chui steppe.  Its length is not less than 70 km, on both sides there are ridges and mountain ranges. </p><p>  The path lies through Kosh-Agach, and after the tract Ulandryk, the wooden houses of the Tashantins will already be visible.  Those who plan to travel by car, can do it by taxi (ordering, for example, a car from Biysk or Gorno-Altaysk) or use the shuttle bus that goes to the district center.  But the bus schedule should be clarified in advance. </p>
