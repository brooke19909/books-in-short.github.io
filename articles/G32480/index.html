  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A4Tech HS-60 Wired Headset Review</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If a person likes to play while in an Internet cafe, and he wants to buy his stereo headset, then do not overpay the extra money.  A typical A4Tech device should be considered.  It's about the HS-60, which will allow voice communication.  It will be interesting to the consumer in that it has a convenient design.  Fur ear pads are installed on the headphones.  They will come in handy if the room is cold.  There is a volume control on the cable, the microphone is good.  However, due to the too low price, excellent sound quality should not be expected. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.laraibmusic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Headphones in a box" class="if uuid-2243961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243961.jpg"></div><h2>  Packaging and equipment </h2><p>  The described device is delivered in a small package.  When opening, you can notice the headphones themselves, two pairs of ear pads, a warranty card and a device that allows you to fix the headset on the monitor.  In general, this set is unusual. </p><p>  Many are struck by the fact that one pair of ear pads is fur, the second is made of leatherette.  Also, not all users immediately understand what a plastic clamshell is, which serves as a hook to attach the A4Tech HS-60 headphones to the monitor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.daraz.pk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Headphones for the winter" class="if uuid-2243964" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243964.jpg"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  These headphones are a stereo headset.  The speakers have the following characteristics: impedance is 32 Ohms, the frequency range ranges from 20 Hz to 20 thousand Hz.  Sensitivity is about 100 dB.  The microphone is mounted on a flexible leg.  There is a special key that disables it.  A <span>volume control</span> is also integrated <span>.</span>  Cord 2 m long. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Such characteristics are quite suitable for the price category of this wired headset.  It does not stand out, since these indicators are basic.  The only thing that should be noted is that the speaker impedance is quite high, but the sensitivity, on the contrary, is low.  This combination can have a bad effect on playback at too high a volume, which is often written by users in the comments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telemart.pk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Headphone with microphone" class="if uuid-2243972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243972.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The first thing that attracts in this device is a thin metal arc.  Along with it are rectangular ear pads.  If we talk about the tint range, then it is black, there is a silver color.  The metal headband is hidden.  Because of this, the design seems a little aggressive and extraordinary.  To prevent the metal from touching the head, the manufacturer used a soft fabric backing.  It is through it that the cable to the right speaker also passes.  The microphone in this wired headset has a flexible foot, so it can be installed in completely different positions.  That is, if it is not turned on, then the microphone is allowed to be rejected until it stops. </p><h2>  Using </h2><p>  Fur ear pads are installed on the headphones, which can be used in the cold season.  The consumer will feel as comfortable with them as possible.  However, in the warm season it is inconvenient to use them, as it becomes very hot.  That is why the manufacturer added a spare pair of conventional ear pads to the A4Tech HS-60.  The cable has a volume control, as well as a button that mutes the microphone.  These are not superfluous functions, therefore it is necessary to attribute this nuance to advantages.  The wire has a length of about 2 meters.  It will be enough to comfortably use. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The stand is a three-piece cot.  One of them is designed to attach the hook to the monitor or to another plane.  It may seem that the sticky surface will not support the weight of the A4Tech HS-60, however this is not so.  If you fold the third part, you get a stand for the headset.  The design seems flimsy, but the weight of the headphones is small, so this device can withstand. </p><p>  The headset sits comfortably on the head, the ear cushions are pleasant, the ears are not completely covered, and the fabric lining also shows its best side.  The materials, of course, are of poor quality, since the A4Tech HS-60 is inexpensive.  To the touch, the plastic is quite good, but it is fragile. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mega.pk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Headphones" class="if uuid-2243975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243975.jpg"></div><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  It should be said right away that the device in question costs a little less than $ 15, so you do not need to demand cool Hi-Fi sound from it.  It copes well with the task of communicating over the Web.  This is the merit of the microphone, and it should also be said about a comfortable fit.  Ear pads isolate from external sounds by 100%.  It should be noted that the deep bass and midrange are not very impressive when playing.  In this case, high frequencies are allocated.  However, this is quite enough for a device of this type. </p>
