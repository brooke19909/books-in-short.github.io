  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Camcorder Canon XF100: description, specifications, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Canon XF100 HD is an amazingly compact professional camcorder that supports almost all the functionality of the 3-touch XF300 in a smaller form factor with a single image sensor.  Using HD technology and a reliable MPEG-2 codec, the device is capable of recording Full HD video on affordable Compact Flash cards, which provides maximum versatility.  The Genuine Canon 10x HD lens focuses images on a 1920 x 1080 pixel CMOS sensor, which is saved in the MXF file in user-defined quality (up to 50 Mbps), resolution and frame rate.  Image adjustment and HDMI output, component and composite ports fully comply with the capabilities of the XF300. </p><p>  Not content with just the status of a ‚Äúlittle brother,‚Äù the camera offers its own unique features.  These include IR shooting and (with another XF100 or XF105) recording 3D images.  The successful combination of portability and many controls makes the model an ideal tool for video journalism, shooting documentaries about travel, independent cinematography and video. </p><h2>  Codec </h2><p>  Canon adapted MPEG-2 for the XF100, calling it XF Codec.  This ensured broad compatibility with existing industry infrastructure and non-linear editing systems.  Thanks to the MXF shell, video and audio can be stored in one file along with important metadata.  The XF100 supports Full HD 1080p resolution, transfer rates of up to 50 Mbps and 4: 2: 2 color subsampling. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The latter provides twice the color resolution of HDV and supports other codecs that use the 4: 2: 0 format. 4: 2: 2 downsampling preserves tone transitions and image quality with post-processing such as chroma-plating, color correction, and improved compositing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cvp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="CANON XF100 HD" class="if uuid-2573506" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2573506.jpg"></div><h2>  Record </h2><p>  Unlike other models using non-standard memory systems, the Canon XF100 stores video on inexpensive and affordable <span>Compact Flash (CF)</span> cards <span>.</span>  The camcorder is equipped with two CF card slots and offers versatile functions, including pre and relay recording, hot swapping, copying and backing up files. </p><p>  Saving data as files facilitates the workflow by reducing transmission time when moving video to non-linear editing systems.  In addition, metadata can be entered when capturing an image, and pictures can be viewed immediately after recording, which ensures the correct registration of each file. </p><p>  Canon XF Codec is supported by leading manufacturers such as Adobe, Apple, Avid, and Grass Valley.  This ensures wide compatibility with existing industry infrastructure and non-linear editing software. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The XF100 file structure uses the MXF interchange format.  This is the international standard for a container for sharing video and audio materials.  Using MXF, video and audio can be combined into one file along with important metadata.  At the same time, the camera not only benefits from a high level of compatibility with non-linear editing systems, but also with the systems used by many television networks and movie studios. </p><h2>  Recording options </h2><p>  Several recording modes, resolutions and frame rates make the XF100 creatively flexible and able to work in virtually any production environment.  The camcorder can perform any work ranging from Full HD 1080p with a recording speed of 50 Mbps to compatible with HDV 25 Mbps. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon XF100 Camera" class="if uuid-2573513" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2573513.jpg"></div><h2>  Lens </h2><p>  Canon competency is clearly visible in the Genuine Canon 10x HD Video lens.  It provides flexibility in capturing images with a zoom range of 30.4‚Äì304 mm (35 mm equivalent).  You can set the zoom speed in constant and variable settings in 3 modes: fast (2-60 s), normal (3-180 s) and slow (4-285 s). </p><h2>  Image sensor </h2><p>  The type of the Canon XF100 sensor is 1/3 "CMOS. It provides high-definition video recording with minimal noise. The maximum resolution for Canon XF100 video shooting is 1080 p. However, the image quality, according to user reviews, leaves much to be desired. The number of sensor points corresponds to the resolution of the camera. This is not bad since it avoids scaling distortions, but it is critical that monochromatic data is captured. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If the XF300 camera used separate sensors for each of the 3 colors and the result corresponded to the standards of commercial television, the XF100 sensor detects colors using Bayer interpolation. </p><p>  Greater flexibility in creative choice is provided by support for slow and fast shooting, and compactness contributes significantly to superior field performance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ormsdirect.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon XF100 Camcorder" class="if uuid-2573516" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2573516.jpg"></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The XF100 is equipped with the powerful DIGIC DV III GPU, which provides improved shading, realistic tonal gradations, all kinds of image settings and low power consumption.  GPU is characterized by high performance, thanks to which the function of detecting faces is supported.  Videographers will love the ability to track one face in a large crowd. </p><h2>  3D support </h2><p>  The camera can be paired with another XF100 or XF105, providing true stereoscopic 3D recording.  Several functions designed for stereo shooting are supported.  For example, OIS Lens Shift serves for optical alignment of two cameras.  For each of them, the relative focal length is displayed and the software helps to calibrate it. </p><p>  The compact size of the Canon XF100 compares favorably with large 3D installations, allowing the film crew to work faster and more efficiently while providing the necessary functions to capture exceptional 3D images. </p><h2>  The night vision </h2><p>  The XF100 Professional Camcorder operates in a mode that gives users the ability to shoot video in total darkness when other models are useless.  To do this, the IR filter is removed from the optical path during capture.  Combined with a specially designed lens coating, this allows infrared light to enter the image sensor.  In addition, the XF100 is equipped with an IR emitter with a diffuser that provides sufficient illumination even in complete darkness. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon XF100 Lens" class="if uuid-2573522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2573522.jpg"></div><h2>  Brilliant ergonomics </h2><p>  The Canon XF100 camcorder is ultra-compact without compromising functionality or usability.  Its small size is ideal in situations where every centimeter and gram counts: for example, when flying to the place of shooting or on an expedition.  The camera can easily be placed in the trunk of a car or in a backpack.  Thus, it allows you to go anywhere, anytime. </p><p>  Greater versatility is provided by a built-in graduation type neutral density filter (approximately 1/8), as well as an 8-blade metal diaphragm. </p><p>  Unlike the typical 6-blade, the Canon XF100 aperture, according to user reviews, provides the effect of an unusually smooth out-of-focus ‚Äúbokeh‚Äù.  Additional petals also reduce light diffraction, which allows smaller holes to be used while maintaining image quality. </p><p>  The Canon XF100 is equipped with a SuperRange image stabilization system based on shift optics, which operates in standard, dynamic and enhanced modes. </p><h2>  Autofocus </h2><p>  When shooting HD video, high sharpness is most critical.  The camera combines an external sensor with built-in autofocus.  These 2 sensors reduce focusing time even in low light conditions, low contrast or high brightness, and also improve autofocus when pointing at complex subjects. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": Bob Thompson, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon XF100 with 400mm lens" class="if uuid-2573530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2573530.jpg"></div><h2>  Digital zoom </h2><p>  Digital zoom complements the optical zoom and can be selected from 1.5x, 3x and 6x.  This feature is needed when extreme telephoto shooting is required, whether it‚Äôs a sporting event or wildlife photography, as well as in law enforcement or military tracking systems. </p><h2>  Slow and fast shooting </h2><p>  In these modes, the XF100 records video at a frame rate other than the playback frequency, which results in faster or slower motion.  Since the camera saves real frames and changes the playback speed, there is no loss of quality and the maximum image quality is maintained. </p><h2>  Interval recording </h2><p>  With this function, users can program the camera to capture a certain number of frames at set intervals.  Such a technique can be used for long-term observation of natural phenomena.  You can set 25 frame-spacing values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom 1 s to 10 minutes.  It is also possible to record a certain number of frames, which is ideal for projects such as loop animation. </p><h2>  LCD monitor and viewfinder </h2><p>  The Canon XF100 camcorder is equipped with a 3.5 ‚ÄùLCD monitor.  Its 920,000 points provide a sufficient level of detail to confirm focus and 100% field of view.  The display opens on the left side of the case. </p><p>  The camera is equipped with a 260 thousand-dot color electronic viewfinder and 0.24 "diagonal providing 100% field of view. This allows you to precisely compose the frame and facilitates the work of the operator. The brightness, contrast, color, and viewfinder illumination are adjustable. Its tilt angle is adjustable within 68 ¬∞. </p><div class="photo" data-original="videokamery.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon XF100 Camera Controls" class="if uuid-2573545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2573545.jpg"></div><h2>  Focus functions </h2><p>  Thanks to the Focus Assist system, a red and green monitor is displayed at the bottom of the LCD, and 3 Canon XF100 focus check zones are displayed.  The green wave represents the overall sharpness of the image, and the red wave shows the focal points.  Thanks to this dynamic feedback, the user can intuitively sharpen and quickly change the focus area. </p><p>  In standby and recording modes on the LCD monitor and in the electronic viewfinder, peak load modes and an auxiliary focus function are available, which allow the operator to easily check and confirm critical focus. </p><h2>  Customization </h2><p>  Users can control all the functions of the camera.  This allows you to fully adapt it to the technical and artistic problems of shooting.  For maximum convenience, owners have access to image settings, user functions and display settings.  All interface parameters can be saved on a memory card to quickly configure multiple XF100 and XF105 camcorders. </p><p>  The owner can manually set the image quality and save the parameters in 9 configurations in the internal memory and up to 20 on the SD card.  You can adjust the color gamut, black level, black gamma, saturation, sharpness, noise reduction, skin detail, selective noise reduction, color matrix, white balance, color correction, etc. </p><p>  Custom functions allow you to set 15 unique parameters, including smooth adjustment of the gain level, smooth adjustment of white balance, AE response, maximum aperture value, direction of adjustment when rotating the aperture ring and recording the on-screen display.  And for quick access to frequently used functions, the XF100 is equipped with 10 customizable control buttons. </p><p>  The user display allows you to set 32 ‚Äã‚Äãdisplay elements in the display and viewfinder, including the zoom position, volume level, remaining recording time, exposure, subject distance, current time, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cvp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon FX100 Kit" class="if uuid-2573509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2573509.jpg"></div><h2>  Processing convenience </h2><p>  A hassle-free and efficient post-processing process is very important.  Canon XF codec is supported by leading manufacturers, including Adobe, Apple, Avid and Grass Valley.  This ensures wide compatibility with existing infrastructure and non-linear editing software. </p><h2>  Audio system </h2><p>  The XF100 also has a stereo microphone and 2 XLR audio inputs with +48 V phantom power and a 3.5 mm jack.  A built-in microphone provides exceptional recording quality in fast-paced situations, and ports allow you to connect external audio recording devices.  In addition, other professional audio equipment can be connected to the XLR inputs.  The built-in and external microphones can be used simultaneously. </p><p>  Audio is recorded in 16-bit PCM format with a frequency of 48 kHz.  The amplification of all input signals can be automatic and manual.  To prevent the volume level from changing, the control can be locked. </p><p>  According to reviews, the sound controls become loose over time, as they are made of plastic, and create feedback or unwanted noise. </p><h2>  Connectivity options </h2><p>  The camera not only gives the professional user complete control over the image, but also provides complete freedom of action thanks to the presence of an HDMI port, component and composite video output (3.5 mm), USB 2.0, and a remote control port (compatible with the LANC protocol). </p><h2>  Signal monitor </h2><p>  Operators use this feature to confirm accurate exposure and color levels during image capture.  As a rule, it is available only with expensive external devices.  The Canon XF100 has a signal monitor built-in.  It details the overall brightness of the image and RGB components. </p><p>  The camera is capable of generating 2 types of color bars (compatible with SMPTE or ARIB) and an audio signal at 1 kHz. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The XF100 is compatible with the BP-925 battery and the BP-955 and BP-975 lithium-ion batteries.  They report the remaining operating time (accurate to the minute) and send data to the camcorder, so the user is always well informed.  On the outside of the battery, 4 LED lamps allow you to quickly assess the charge level in the field.  The camcorder is also compatible with BP-900 batteries, which can be inserted and removed with the power cable connected. </p><h2>  Photography </h2><p>  For storyboards and promotional shots, the XF100 offers the ability to capture still images in 1920 x 1080 resolution. Photos can be stored on an SD memory card during recording and playback. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The camera comes with software compatible with Mac and Windows platforms.  Canon XF Utility provides simple clip management and playback functions.  In addition, it allows you to work with clip lists in several formats, as well as add and edit metadata.  The program is an effective backup tool. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Do the superior controls and functionality of the XF100 offset the mediocre image quality?  Perhaps for some owners this is enough.  DSLR video has its drawbacks (such as insufficient sharpness and gradation), but digital cameras give in return something valuable: the highest quality of optics, a small depth of field and the ability to work in extremely low light conditions. </p><p>  This model works well in a narrow range of lighting conditions, but the image will still be noisy even in bright daylight, and its quality becomes unacceptable when the light level drops. </p><p>  If you add the high price of the Canon XF100, which at the time of release was 124 thousand rubles, then soon the user begins to feel that the compact camera should be more versatile, lighter and even less professional.  Without a good sensor, professional controls and codecs are simply meaningless. </p>
