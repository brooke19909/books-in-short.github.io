    <h2>  Dadonghai Resort </h2><p>  One of the best resorts on the island is Dadonghai.  Its name is translated into Russian as the "Great East Sea."  The aborigines called it that way, since a very wonderful picture opens up from the shore to an endless horizon.  The resort is located just 4 kilometers from Sanya.  It is here, on the second beach line, that the Linda Seaview Hotel 4 * (China / Sanya) is located.  Mostly surf lovers come here.  The beach fully meets the requirements of athletes - conquerors of waves.  But he has one drawback: it is almost always crowded, because he was chosen for relaxation by the Chinese from different regions of the country.  All hotels are located on the first and second lines.  The aforementioned Linda Seaview Hotel 4 * (China / Hainan Island) is on the second line, nevertheless, it offers a magnificent view of the sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  ‚ÄúLinda Siaview 4 *‚Äù is located only 8 kilometers from the resort center.

In the evenings, cafes open on the beach where you can spend interesting evenings watching the sunset, and then the moonlit path on the water. </p><h2>  Hotel Linda Sea View 4 *: hotel reviews </h2><p>  ‚ÄúDescription is true,‚Äù we think, this is the best characteristic that a guest could give.  After all, we are often ‚Äúfed‚Äù with beautiful promises, but in reality it is the other way around. The Chinese are rather disciplined and responsible in their work. All the wishes of the tourists are fulfilled immediately, and the instruction for the hotel staff is fully respected. That's why the reviews are positive. Among more or less negative - assessments of the restaurant‚Äôs kitchen. But they are subjective. Some do not like spicy dishes, others like seafood. Most importantly, no one complained that he had to stay hungry. </p>
