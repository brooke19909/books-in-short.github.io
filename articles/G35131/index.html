Firstly, there is pure nature, secondly, beautiful landscapes, thirdly, the sights of Palma de Mallorca for every taste.  About 8 million people come here approximately every year.  The island is so beautiful that poems, songs are written about it, artists draw, and filmmakers use it to shoot their films.  The island is located in the southeast of Spain. </p><h2>  Locks </h2><p>  1. The first to be called <span>Belver Castle, the</span> photo of which is presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etraveltrips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castillo de Bellver Mallorca Spain" class="if uuid-2445304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2445304.jpg"></div><p>  It was created by an architect, whose name was Pere Salva.  This event occurred around 1311.  The king of the island of Jaime II built here his summer residence.  It is believed that the castle has a type, and this is the fortress of Herodion.  In the 16th century there was a fire, nature was to blame.  The castle was damaged, but it was reconstructed and improved.  There used to be battlements on the towers, but then they were removed and put down by loopholes.  The shape of the castle is a ring, it has two floors, inside there is a courtyard, the walls are towers, 4 pieces are made in the shape of a horseshoe. </p><p>  There is also a donjon tower, with a castle connected by an arch-type bridge.  Around the castle there is a moat, and along it there is a fortress wall, another moat was made behind it, there is also a drawbridge.  The lower floor is intended for utility rooms, for servants.  The wall has no windows, but only loopholes, they are very narrow.  On the second floor were the rulers' chambers, a chapel, various rooms and a kitchen.  There are two entrances to the castle: one in the northwest, this is the main one, in the northeast - the entrance that is made in our time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. The next castle of Capdeper. </p><p>  It is intended for defense, and began to be built in the 14th century by order of the same king.  At first it was a very powerful fortress, in the 18th century it became an architectural monument. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotelbellport.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="CASTILLO DE CAPDEPERA" class="if uuid-2445312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2445312.jpg"></div><p>  The castle is located on a hill, it has a chapel with frescoes that tell an interesting story.  According to legend, when the enemies attacked, the defenders carried out the image of the Madonna, and suddenly a fog came, so thick that the invaders did not see anything. </p><p>  If you climb up, you can enjoy magnificent views.  Now there is a museum, there is a very large tank designed for water.  It was created due to the fact that springs from the ground beat. </p><p>  3. Alaro. </p><p>  The attractions of Palma de Mallorca include this castle.  It began to be built in the fourteenth century, when the Spaniards conquered the island.  They founded a settlement, the center became a castle, which inscribed itself in history thanks to King Alfonso.  Now the hotel is located here, it works around the clock.  The castle has architectural monuments, they are well preserved, they belong to the early Christian and Muslim periods. </p><p>  The city is not very big, you can walk.  In addition to the castle itself, there are very beautiful landscapes.  And near Alaro there is a magnificent mountain, in the city itself there is a historical museum (see below). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Architectural Buildings </h2><p>  1. Many tourists come here for the sake of the Cathedral of St. Mary.  It was built on the coast.  This is the main attraction of Palma de Mallorca.  It is 20 meters long, 55 meters wide, and 44 cm high. They began to build this cathedral in 1229. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.urlaubsguru.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Mary's Cathedral" class="if uuid-2445328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2445328.jpg"></div><p>  There is such a legend: Jaime I, the ruler of the island, sailed with his fleet, and a very strong storm flew over them near Mallorca.  Then the king offered a prayer to the Madonna, swore an oath, if he was saved, he would certainly build a temple for her.  Jaime escaped, so he ordered the construction.  But it was built for a very long time, and was ready only in the seventeenth century.  However, the vaults collapsed, and therefore the temple was restored.  In the XX century, reconstruction was done, Antonio Gaudi began to participate in it and spent electricity in the temple. </p><p>  The main decoration is stained-glass windows.  In the east, this is a rose window, which is also called the Gothic window.  It is believed that this rose is the largest in the world.  The stained-glass window is made in the shape of the star of David, and twice a year the light of the Sun falls through the glass and draws a projection of a rose on the wall. </p><p>  2. Cape Formentor. </p><p>  A lighthouse used to work here.  Now there are observation platforms.  Lovers of lighthouses and photographers because of this place come to Palma de Mallorca (photo sights can be seen below). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.navartur.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cape Formentor" class="if uuid-2445335" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2445335.jpg"></div><p>  If you come here, you can see very beautiful reviews, here is just a magnificent coastline.  So amazing landscapes that it is impossible to take your eyes off: a very blue sea, and over the waters, as if painted, rocks.  Forests never lose their greenery, and white sand lies on the beach.  The places are very beautiful, so tourists are in no hurry to leave here, so they built a hotel here. </p><p>  3. Luke Monastery. </p><p>  Once the monks were near a mountain stream located near the rock, and at this rock they discovered the image of a saint, who, in fact, is dedicated to the monastery.  For a long time people lived in this area, and until now, archaeologists often find bronze and iron things here.  Muslims also came to these lands and called them "mountain" or Al-Yibal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.abc-mallorca.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Luke Monastery" class="if uuid-2445372" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2445372.jpg"></div><p>  The image was taken with them, taken to church, local residents came to pray and they did not find it.  When they began to search, they found next to the same stream.  So the image acted 2 times, so a church was built on that spot.  She is acting now.  At the monastery, a children's choir called Els Blauets was opened, back in the 16th century.  It can be heard now. </p><p>  4. The Palace of Almudine. </p><p>  It is considered the oldest in the country.  When the Moors ruled Spain, the viziers lived here, in 1230 it became the property of the king and his family.  Currently, it houses the National Museum and various military services.  The foundation is rectangular, at the edges are high towers.  At the top of the largest of them is a sculpture of the Archangel Gabriel, it is made of copper, and he is considered the patron saint of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.palma-di-maiorca.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Almudine Palace" class="if uuid-2445348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2445348.jpg"></div><p>  This tower was built in the 14th century, it is called the Tower of the Angel.  The name of the other tower is not very pleasant - the Head Tower, since it was used for executions.  When the criminals were cut off their heads, they were exposed on the tower so that people could look at them.  Here is the main decoration - this is the Royal Courtyard, also called Honorary.  Here is the chapel named after St. Anne, built in the 14th century.  The style of the temple is Romanesque, near the entrance there is a pattern where various mythical animals are depicted.  Tourists also like the Gothic throne room, there are Arab baths, from which, unfortunately, there are only ruins.  Near the palace you can find very beautiful royal gardens. </p><p>  5. Cartesian monastery. </p><p>  The palace used to belong to King Sancho, but he abandoned it.  Then the monks turned to him and asked the ruler to give him the order, and they would build their monastery there.  The king decided to satisfy the request of the monks, but not the whole monastery was preserved, but only some of the buildings were partially preserved. </p><p>  When Chopin and <span>George Sand</span> arrived in Mallorca in 1838 on vacation, they could not rent a room in any local hotel.  The fact is that the local customs were really strict.  Not finding themselves a roof over their heads, they decided to turn to the monastery and lived in cells.  Sand wrote about this in a book, and her lover created a play called "Raindrops", as well as some preludes that became famous. </p><p>  6. Alcudia. </p><p>  The construction was not preserved, the ruins remained.  The fortress protected the island from pirate raids and, according to some sources, was 10 meters high.  In 2004, archaeological excavations were carried out and many things were found, most of them date from the 15th century.  The inhabitants of the island have been saved more than once thanks to the fortress, so they monitor it and restore it.  Tourists are very fond of these attractions of Palma de Mallorca, they often come here on foot.  You can walk along the walls of the fortress, as well as go to the church, built in honor of St. Jaum. </p><p>  7. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Kura. </p><p>  This place is about 7 hundred years old, it gained fame thanks to Ramon Lewle.  The writer traveled and really wanted to find solitude.  Arriving here in 1273, he became known for laying the foundation for the literary Catalan language.  Bishop Luis de Prades also came here to live; he spent three decades on the top of the mountain in a narrow hole that is still visible.  Currently, volunteers live here, as well as four monks.  Workers help them with the sanctuary.  There is also a museum and gift shop.  It is not difficult to find the sanctuary if you go along the Palma-Algaida highway.  There you will definitely find signs, you will reach the village of Randa, and there already a road leads to the monastery. </p><h2>  Bays </h2><p>  Sa Kalobra - it is very beautiful, and when tourists come here, they are literally delighted.  First you need to overcome the serpentine in the mountains, but the landscapes are very beautiful, and all the people who love the heights are delighted. </p><p>  The bus travels very slowly, because the edges are abyss, and the track is very narrow.  But the windows are so beautiful that nobody pays attention to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hectorgarciacanadas.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sa calobra" class="if uuid-2445360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2445360.jpg"></div><p>  People just do what they take pictures.  For some reason cats love the gorge very much.  It is still unknown why these animals so adore this place.  There are several assumptions and legends about this, but none of them can be called reliable. </p><p>  The sea is restless, waves are splashing ashore.  Here were filming the film "Sinbad the Sailor."  This is a very beautiful place and we advise you to definitely visit it. </p><h2>  Pearl factory </h2><p>  The factory makes artificial pearls, but it is so high-quality that it will not yield to natural.  It is quite difficult to do, and allowed to observe the process.  Alabaster is presented in the form of a sphere or a drop, a solution is applied to it.  There will be 30 layers in total, various substances enter the solution itself, including mother of pearl and fish scales.  Top necessarily apply varnish. </p><p>  It is very exciting to walk around the factory, it is very popular with tourists. </p><h2>  Alaro History Museum </h2><p>  Previously, the building, which now houses the museum, was owned by the Jesuits.  It was built in the Gothic style, has several rooms, and each has its own historical period, for example, Roman culture. </p><p>  The museum has archaeological finds, the building of the museum around the 14th century. </p><h2>  Alfabia Gardens </h2><p>  In fact, this is a manor, it was rebuilt more than once.  They added a lot of fragments and increased the area.  There are water sources in the gardens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.abc-mallorca.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alfabia Gardens" class="if uuid-2445375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2445375.jpg"></div><p>  To enter the garden, you need to enter the alley, very picturesque, then in the second.  There are columns in the amount of 32 pieces, as well as 20 fountains.  The upper garden is called the Queen's Garden, because Isabella II came here.  Below you can admire various trees from the tropics, for example, orange trees, squeeze juice from their fruits and sell them at a local cafe.  The place is really beautiful, there are benches in the shade to sit and enjoy the scenery. </p><h2>  Nature Park </h2><p>  1. Galatzo. </p><p>  To get into it, you need to drive 17 kilometers from the city.  You find yourself directly in a mountain valley, tourists are most often brought here for 2 hours.  The park has 30 very beautiful waterfalls, various animals and plants.  Barbecue allowed.  You can swim in the waterfalls, so tourists are told to take swimsuits with them.  There are also mounted bridges.  If you are pretty dexterous, you can climb the rocks and go down the ropes. </p><p>  2. Park Mondrago. </p><p>  This park became a nature reserve in 1992.  Here you can walk or ride a bike.  If you like animals and plants, then you definitely need to come here.  So here is a magnificent bay and a wonderful underwater world.  There is a beach that is considered the best on the islands.  There are a lot of routes for tourists. </p><p>  3. The natural park of Albufera. </p><p>  It has a very large area, between it and the sea are sand dunes.  The park has swamp zones, the largest in the Mediterranean.  Since the microclimate is unique, different birds come here from all over Europe, they breed chicks.  It is forbidden to have picnics here, especially to make bonfires, but you can take a walk.  To get to the park and look at it, you need to get to the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPlaya de Muro. </p><h2>  Puerto de Polensa </h2><p>  Basically, people of bohemia hang out here: poets, artists, artists.  Tourists come to the local port, most of them are very rich, so we can say that this is the center of cosmopolitans.  Entertainment: walks by the sea, visiting the bay, very beautiful landscapes and swimming in the sea. </p><h2>  Banyalbufar </h2><p>  On the road from Esporl to the coast, this city is located - with fertile lands, overlooking the vines.  The name comes from the Arabic language and means "founded by the sea";  The irrigation system has been preserved since the Moorish period.  The city and villages are located near four small mountains, and most of the landscape is covered with oak forests, which makes them a great place for walking. </p><p>  Legend has it that the <span>Malvasia wine</span> made here was so good that it played a key role in King Aragorn's decision to launch an invasion of the island. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  1. Paseo de Born. </p><p>  This street is known for the fact that most often there are various events, such as carnivals or festivities.  There are a lot of cafes, shops, mansions, boutiques and shops, sculptures.  It can be said that this is a symbol of Mallorca. </p><p>  2. Kathmandu House. </p><p>  The building is an entertainment center.  And the most interesting thing about him is that this house is upside down.  That is, going into the house, you will not walk on the floor, but on the roof.  The rooms have a variety of entertainments, including robots, skeletons, optical illusions and, of course, Hogwarts.  There is an opportunity to watch different films, play golf.  Vacationers love this house.  There is also a spooky quest - The Asylum.  It is a dark corridor, only adults are allowed there.  If you go to the 4D cinema, there are four worlds to choose from that you can explore.  Children are allowed here from the age of 3 years, they purchase children's tickets, adults - if you are older than 12 years.  Little ones are allowed free of charge, but when quests are carried out, they should sit on the lap of their companions. </p><p>  3. Adventure Park "Jungle Park." </p><p>  This is a very large territory, its area is about 9 hectares.  There are platforms on which there are obstacles.  They are suspended, there are 100 of them.  To move, you have to use bridges and ropes.  Security here is of a high level, you can visit from any age, and even if you are not very prepared for sports. </p><p> If your child is not yet in school, then you can send him to the track, made specifically for children - Piratas. </p><p>  4. The oceanarium. </p><p>  In total, there are 50 aquariums (or more) in this place, where different species of animals live.  The oceanarium is very large, its area is approximately 40 thousand square meters.  m. To go around the entire room and see what the aquarium offers, it takes about 4 hours.  Sharks also swim in a special compartment located above the heads of passing people. </p><h2>  Caves </h2><p>  These, one might say, are also the sights of Palma de Mallorca in Spain.  The caves are countless, but 2 of them deserve special attention.  The first is called Dragon Cave.  It is located near the city of Porto Cristo and, they say, as if the Templars themselves locked their treasures here somewhere.  They chose for this the deepest and farthest sections.  There are a lot of labyrinths in the cave.  Investigated them closer to the beginning of the 20th century, and that‚Äôs not all.  They made a map, but did not find any treasures.  To go to the cave, it is best to take sneakers, and the caves are very cold, so it is better to stock up on something warm.  There are not moves, but platforms, there are lakes, as many as 6 pieces, and halls, various grottoes, very beautiful, a lot of stalactites. </p><p>  Arta Cave - to this attraction of Palma de Mallorca, many come on their own on foot, walking along the coastline. </p><p>  Scientists have found evidence that once ancient people lived here.  Most often, hermits and sea robbers lived here.  There are lakes in the cave, whole waterfalls made of stone.  The main attraction is the stalagmit, whose height is as much as 23 m. To get to the place, you need to drive 11 km from the city.  The cave is not fully understood, so some rooms are closed.  They leave places for visitors to guarantee safety. </p><h2>  Red bus route </h2><p>  If you travel to Palma de Mallorca, sights in one day are very easy to see.  For this, sightseeing buses are used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.allesovermallorca.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Red bus route" class="if uuid-2445298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2445298.jpg"></div><p>  At the heart of their work is a system called Hop On - Hop Off.  I liked some sights, for example, a monastery, went near it, examined the room, and then got on the bus.  The bus has two floors, and in the summer they travel every 20 minutes, and in the winter every 30. The main point of departure is Antonio Maura Avenue. </p><p>  This is very convenient, especially if you have a child or if you do not want to see all the sights.  There is also an audio guide that supports many languages, there is Russian.  In total, there are 18 stops on the route, the duration of the routes is approximately 80 minutes. </p>
