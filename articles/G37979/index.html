    <h2>  Negative reviews: hotel flaws </h2><p>  Like any other complex, the hotel Thalassa Sousse 4 * (Tunisia) receives negative reviews.  Tourists are unhappy with the following shortcomings of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  The restaurant does not have enough seats and utensils for all guests.  To dine, tourists have to stand in line. </li><li>  Neglect of the staff towards the guests.  They do everything extremely slowly, do not seek to help with solving problems. </li><li>  A lot of jellyfish swim in the sea, so burns constantly remain on the legs and arms. </li><li>  The beach is poorly cleaned.  There are a lot of cigarette butts, plastic glasses and other rubbish in the sand.  The urns here are always crowded. </li><li>  Tasty food in the main restaurant.  The fried eggs are greatly overcooked, spicy sauces and spices are added to all dishes. </li></ul><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  We can say that the Thalassa Sousse 4 * hotel (Tunisia), the photo of which is presented above, is perfect for a budget holiday.  Nevertheless, many tourists note that the complex does not correspond to four stars.  There are significant flaws here that can ruin your vacation experience.  In general, the hotel can be recommended to families with children who really like the local water park.  The youth here will also not be bored. </p>
