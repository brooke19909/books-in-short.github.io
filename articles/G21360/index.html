In summer, the air temperature is +16, closer to the southern part +19 degrees, and in winter - from -1 to -4.5 ° . </p><p>  Precipitation falls in the maximum amount in the mountainous regions - up to 1800 mm, and in the plains - up to 500 mm. </p><p>  Therefore, winters in Poland are quite snowy, and summers are cool and humid.  And in view of such climatic features, lovers of resort vacations during the holiday season can hardly afford to relax in natural conditions.  Fortunately, many modern complexes have been built in Poland: water parks, hotel aquazones, indoor pools. </p>

A feature of this town is a water park of the same name. </p><p>  This is a magnificent complex of medium size.  There are several places for swimming: a large pool, a river (along which you can swim on air mattresses), as well as a children's pool with a ship and slides. </p>

    <p>  The river overflows around the entire water park.  You can also go to it from a high hill. </p><p>  And in the pool with artificial waves only guests with a height of more than 1.4 meters are allowed to be! </p><p>  The main “figures” of the aquacomplex are sharks, which are located in a special aquarium-pool behind glass.  They can be seen rolling down the hill.  The administration guarantees 100% safety for vacationers from these rather big fish. </p><p>  There is also a jacuzzi bathtub located in the vent of an impromptu volcano. </p><p>  In general, the atmosphere in the water park is warm, as is the temperature.  And if it seems cold, then there is a sauna.  However, children are not allowed into it. </p><h2>  Sopot (Poland) </h2><p>  The water park is the most popular in the country, but it is slightly smaller in size than Reda.  But one of the largest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Jacuzzi in the water park of several types: calcium and mud.  Such baths are quite healthy. </p><p>  On the territory of the water park there are special places - terraces, designed for relaxation, sunbathing and a simple contemplation of local beauties. </p><p>  Very good cuisine in the restaurant: varied and hearty, good bar with cocktails and other drinks.  And what is most pleasant and important, friendly staff.  As for the prices, they are quite acceptable.  The price of the ticket to the water park also includes a towel, which must be returned at the exit. </p><p>  In addition to water procedures, there are bowling, billiards, a golf club for vacationers, and a trampoline and slot machines for children.

Although the guests of different water complexes in Poland leave different reviews.  There are few pools or the lines for slides are too long, the water temperature is low, etc. But for someone, everything is perfect.  From negative reviews, they do not become worse or less popular. </p><p>  After all, it’s great when in rainy weather or in the cold season you can throw off your warm clothes and plunge into the warm, pleasant water of the pool or ride a 800 m long slide. </p>
