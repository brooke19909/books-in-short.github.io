USSR equipment lagged far behind European countries, and the country's security needed to be maintained.  Soon, Russian designers and military engineers set to work. </p><h2>  Targets and goals </h2>

With rapid force, the country's military production spun.  The plan was successfully implemented.

    <p>  Over 136,000 thousand aircraft, over 100,000 thousand tanks, and about half a million small arms were produced. </p><p>  Let us consider briefly what the safety equipment of the USSR was. </p><h2>  Armored and mechanized troops </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="USSR safety" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/2187190.jpg"></div></h2><ul><li>  The most popular at the beginning of World War II was a high-speed tank - BT.  He developed a speed of up to 70 km / h, had a power reserve of 700 km, and could ride on water.  He was very maneuverable and agile.  On a bad and broken road he moved on tracks, but on a good and even road he could drive like a car - tracks were discarded. </li><li>  Heavy <span>tank KV.</span>  Exceeded in its characteristics and power any German tank.  It had strong armor, good maneuverability and handling.  In the battle of Moscow, KV markedly distinguished itself: it destroyed a large number of Nazi special equipment, soldiers, officers, and caused indignation and amazement at the enemy.  For all the time while he was shooting at German fortifications and destroying the Nazis, no one could destroy and set him on fire. </li><li>  The T-34 is a medium tank that was launched in 1940.  Initially, he did not meet all the requirements and showed himself rather poorly.  But during the modernization, its characteristics were improved.  The "new" version of the T-34 was reliable, well-controlled, and developed a speed of up to 55 km / h.  It had a relatively small weight for the tank.  It was equipped with a powerful gun, which can easily penetrate any German tank of 1941-1943. </li></ul><h2>  Artillery equipment of the USSR </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="military equipment of the ussr" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/2187196.jpg"></div></h2><ul><li>  A-19- such guns were made back in the 30s.  Created for <span>counter-battery warfare.</span>  With the help of such deadly guns, enemy rear lines were suppressed, all paths for transporting food and ammunition were cut off.  The A-19 exceeded all foreign artillery pieces of this type in its characteristics.  She was very effective and accurate.  The big disadvantage of this gun was its weight.  She was heavy. </li><li>  57-mm anti-tank gun - the first one was assembled back in 1940, but because of the large mass, it was decided to redo its design.  As a result, in 1941 a new 57-mm gun was released.  She exceeded the capabilities and characteristics of her English counterpart.  Could penetrate 90 mm tank armor.  It was created to suppress infantry fire weapons, tanks, armored vehicles and manpower. </li></ul><h2>  Soviet aviation </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="USSR technique" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/2187191.jpg"></div></h2><ul><li>  Pe-2 is a bomber that appeared in 1940.  It was equipped with modern for its time electrical engineering and specialized equipment.  In particular, it had a pressurized cabin and a remote control.  Used for bombing attacks from horizontal flight. </li><li>  IL-2 - combat aircraft.  It provided substantial air support to the Soviet ground forces.  Originally created as a single.  But since the losses among the IL-2 aircraft were large, the design was modernized.  Second place was added for the gunner. </li><li>  Yak-3 - was a development of the Yak-1M combat aircraft.  Developed a speed of up to 650 km / h, it was very maneuverable and light. </li><li>  LA-7 - a wooden fighter.  It was adopted near the end of the war.  The design was equipped with powerful weapons.  Reduced weight.  Improved aerodynamics. </li></ul><p>  Some <span>aircraft of the</span> USSR were made of wood because metal during the war became a deficit.  The production of tanks, shells, artillery installations consumed large reserves of metal.  Therefore, in the construction of many fighters and combat aircraft used birch, delta wood and plywood. </p><p>  Such aircraft, upon completion of construction, were coated with resin glue and carefully polished.  In the language of the pilots they were called "grand pianos." </p><p>  That was it - the weapon of Victory. </p><h2>  Post-war technique </h2>

It was at this time that such types of automatic and artillery weapons were designed as a Kalashnikov assault rifle, self-propelled guns, Simonov‚Äôs rifle, an updated Goryunov machine gun, Degtyarev light machine gun, various machine gun anti-tank grenade launchers.
