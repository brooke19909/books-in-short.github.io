It ranks second after New York in terms of population in the States and 13th worldwide.  A huge metropolitan area stretches over 1000 square kilometers along the Pacific coast.  Currently, the population of Los Angeles exceeds the mark of 4 million inhabitants.  A little over half a century ago, four out of five citizens were white, not of Hispanic descent.  Now the situation has changed radically - the indigenous population is already less than 50%.  The metropolis is multinational, diverse and this makes it even more interesting. </p>

    <h2>  From the history of the city </h2><p>  The territory of modern Los Angeles in the 16th century was inhabited by the Chumashi and Tongwa Indians.  Europeans first embarked on this shore in 1542, sailing in two ships under the command of the famous navigator Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo.  The next missionary mission went to these places after more than 200 years.  By 1820, the population of the city of Los Angeles was 650 people.  It was the largest settlement in California.  Rapid development was facilitated by several factors at once: a climate favorable for agriculture, a favorable geographical position and access to the ocean, and the discovery of oil fields. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the moment, the main industries of the city are the computer, television and film industry with billions of dollars in profit, metalworking, automotive, tourism.  Los Angeles accounts for about 90% of all US film production. </p>

The main and largest of them are: Hollywood, East, South, Center, Mid-Wilshire, Westside, San Fernando Valley, South Bay and Harbor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  According to 2010 data, 452 thousand Koreans (immigrants or their descendants) live in Los Angeles, which is about 1.2% of the total population of the city.  This is the largest Diaspora of the people in the United States.  The area is located in the very center and is the most densely populated.  Speaking about which population of Los Angeles prevails in it, an amendment is necessary.  Despite its name, the area is a mixture of cultures, where, with a large number of Koreans, the Hispanics are still leading in the presence of 53%, 22% of whom are Mexicans. </p><h2>  Russian-speaking community in Los Angeles </h2><p>  By number of people is one of the largest in the United States.  It is located in West Hollywood.  The ethnic composition of the Russian-speaking population is mainly Jews who moved to these places in the 70-80s of the last century.  It was rather difficult to equip life and life alone, so the former compatriots tried to stick together.  Here you can find almost everything that immigration can miss: from pickles and herring to marshmallows and seeds.  A large number of shops and shops offer goods of various profiles, restaurants with traditional Russian cuisine - all this is available, in addition, magazines and newspapers are published, artists come on tour. </p><h2>  China Town </h2><p>  One of the oldest areas of the city, which formed at the end of the nineteenth century, is now located in downtown Los Angeles.  The decline observed in its development since 1910 gave way to a recovery a decade later.  Since that time, mainly with the aim of attracting tourists, a new stage in the modernization of the place has begun.  At the moment, it is concentrated not only the Chinese population, but also many other Asian peoples - Vietnamese, Thais, Indonesians, Filipinos, etc. It should be noted how much of the population in Los Angeles is of Asian origin - 13.1%, including and Japanese, Koreans.  This is an amazing, colorful and amazing place with an indescribable atmosphere of the traditional East. </p>
