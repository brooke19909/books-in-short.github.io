Due to its rich history, here you can see many interesting architectural buildings, including beautiful colonial buildings and magnificent mosques.  Many objects of modern architecture are also attractive.  This is a city of colors and contrasts with a unique multinational flavor.  Several cultures mixed together wonderfully, their traditions and customs intertwined. </p>

Kuala Lumpur owes its origin to a small handful of Chinese who discovered tin deposits on the site of the modern city and created a small settlement here.  With the increase in tin mining, more and more people came here.  Already in 1880 the city became the capital of the principality of Selangor, and since 1895 - the capital of the Federation of Malay states.  The merger of several cultures led to the formation of a kind of cuisine, the emergence of new music and entertainment.  Here live Malaysians, Indians, Chinese.  All of them try to maintain their national identity as much as possible.  The city even has distinct areas where certain communities live, which makes it diverse and colorful. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kuala lumpur malaysia reviews" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/288122.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is green enough, has many beautiful parks, shady squares and just lawns.  So, in the very center of Kuala Lumpur lies the Lake Gardens city park, the layout and design of which are carried out in the English style.  It consists of numerous green hills, on one of which stands the government house of receptions - Kings House.  Aristocratic areas are mainly located outside the central part of the village. </p>

Most international flights operate through section C, located behind the runway.  It is connected to the main part of the airport by a monorail.  From the city it is separated by a distance of 90 kilometers.  Kuala Lumpur can be reached in several ways.  The fastest of them is with the help of Aeroexpress, which will cover this distance in 30 minutes.  Those who prefer a more economical way should use the bus, which leaves the airport every 30 minutes and goes to the Nilai station.  Next, you need to transfer to the train, which will take you to your destination.

They are considered a kind of business card of this locality, symbolizing present-day Malaysia.  This unique <span>architectural structure</span> reaches a height of 452 meters.  Inside the towers there is an art gallery, a concert hall, one of the largest shopping complexes in Suria.  But this is not the tallest building in the city.  Minara TV tower takes the leading position in height.  Among other architectural creations, it will be interesting to see the eighteen-story <span>building of the Parliament,</span> towering on a green hill. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="malaysia kuala lumpur" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/288119.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Continuing to explore Kuala Lumpur <span>(Malaysia), the sights</span> can be supplemented with religious buildings, including the Masjid Jame Mosque, the construction of which dates back to 1909.  The building was created in the Indian style with a large onion dome and exquisite arched colonnades.  No less impressive is the Masjid Negare Mosque, which is a snow-white structure of an unusual shape.  It has a thin minaret that ends with a pointed needle.  The main room of this building is crowned by a dome shaped like an 18-pointed star.  Black basalt columns are installed in the hall in a circle, and the windows are decorated with openwork lattices.  In addition, the city has many interesting museums and parks. </p>
