However, a person who does not have Russian citizenship, but is officially employed, will have to purchase a voluntary insurance policy.  What is <span>voluntary health insurance for</span> foreign citizens will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Benefits of a VHI policy for foreign citizens </h2><p>  Non-residents of the Russian Federation working at enterprises, naturally, can get sick or get an <span>industrial injury.</span>  As you know, free medicine and service in clinics leave much to be desired.  That is why the best way would be to buy a VHI policy for foreign citizens.  With such a document, a person will be able to receive first aid in an institution with a high level of service.  All of them are private, that is, paid, and not public.  Accordingly, in such medical organizations, new high-tech equipment has been installed with which you can put the correct diagnosis and select the necessary treatment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="voluntary health insurance for foreign citizens" class="if" height="236" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/1094321.jpg" width="600"></div>

In addition <span>, a citizen</span> has the right to seek the help of a dentist if necessary.  The same applies to highly specialized doctors, as well as medical and transport assistance.  If a foreign citizen wants to undergo an examination and get a diagnosis on unique and expensive devices, he will need to include this in the list of services. </p><p>  Voluntary medical insurance for foreign citizens, the price of which is very ‚Äúbiting,‚Äù is not a cheap thing.  Of course, sometimes treatment is even more expensive than the owners of such policies, but, as a rule, most non-residents do not use it.  This fact explains the frequent refusals from VHI.  However, some firms hire foreigners only if they take out insurance.  It should be noted that the cost of an ordinary policy for Russian citizens is one and a half to two times less than for guests of the country, and ranges from one and a half to five thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="VHI for foreign citizens" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/1094341.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Documents required for registration </h2><p>  Before collecting documents, you should know that people older than 75 years (in some cases older than 81 years), as well as people with disabilities of groups 1 and 2, cancer patients and having congenital diseases will be refused a policy.  Voluntary medical insurance for foreign citizens can be obtained provided that they are legally employed and have a residence permit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Below is a list of documents that are required from a non-resident: </p><ul><li>  Passport. </li><li>  <span>Migration card.</span> </li><li>  Location data. </li><li>  Birth certificate of the child in the case when the policy is necessary for him. </li><li>  Statement indicating insurance organization </li></ul><p>  Registration of VHI for foreign citizens does not take much time, if everything is in order with the papers.

    <h2>  What you should pay attention to, or subtleties of design </h2><p>  When receiving a VHI policy for foreign citizens, you should be aware that it begins to operate only after 5-7 days from the date of submission of documents.  If something happens to the person during this period of time, he will have to pay for the treatment at his own expense.  Only after five to seven days a so-called temporary policy is issued to a foreign citizen.  He will receive the main document one month after submitting the application. </p><p>  Voluntary medical insurance for foreign citizens is valid only during the employment contract.  If the contract has ended, the employer has the right to terminate the insurance contract. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="voluntary health insurance for foreign citizens Price" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/1094353.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  VHI features and goals </h2><p>  Usually, the desire to insure your health in order to get free medical care - this is the motive for which everyone wants to buy a policy.  However, this is not the only goal.  Some non-residents come to Russia to work with families, and children need a policy.  Without VHI, some schools or kindergartens will not accept children for foreign citizens.  In addition, adults themselves will not be able to conclude an employment contract without this document. </p><p>  Insurance makes it possible to receive quality medical care in paid clinics.  If a person often goes to the doctors, or he often has a sick child, then the conclusion of an agreement with an insurance company is simply mandatory.  Patient care is carried out exactly on the day and hour that will be prescribed by the doctor.  Thus, a person feels confidence for his own health outside his country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="VMS for foreign citizens" class="if" height="245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/1094364.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  In the event that a foreign citizen has lost a policy, he should contact the employer or the personnel department.  A duplicate will be issued there, and a person will be able to provide it if necessary.  Voluntary medical insurance for foreign citizens is mandatory since 2015.  That is why now even those people who do not want to acquire it, simply can not officially get a job.  The choice is behind every hotel non-resident.  Sometimes it becomes unprofitable to buy a policy.  In this case, you need to weigh the pros and cons and think about the future.  Naturally, the ambulance will provide first aid, but further treatment will require additional expenses that could have been avoided with insurance. </p>
