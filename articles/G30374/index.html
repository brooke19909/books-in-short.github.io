  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bright accessories for the kitchen. Crochet Potholders</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Hand</span> -made kitchen <span>gloves are a</span> wonderful accessory.  They have so many positive properties that you can bend and bend your fingers, listing them.  Firstly, bright and unusual products will decorate the kitchen, and secondly, they will help the hostess in her daily ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù with pots and pans.  Thirdly, knitting gloves is a good way to master the techniques of this needlework, fourthly, is the ability to use the accumulated leftover knitting threads, and finally, fifth, sixth, seventh - this is unlimited scope for creative imagination. </p><p>  Potholders can be any: round, square, in the form of various figures.  The easiest way is to <span>crochet a</span> square <span>tack</span> .  Here you can show imagination by combining different colors of threads, and then decorate a knitted fabric with embroidery or applique. </p><p>  Crocheted square tack </p><p>  Let's try to crochet the tack.  To work, you need cotton yarn of medium thickness, 200-250 grams of three colors (for example, white, yellow and green), a hook of 4 mm.  We will crochet with crochets. </p><p>  1. We start <span>crocheting the tack</span> with a chain of 35 air stitches with green thread, adding at the end one air stitch for lifting.  We turn the knitting and knit single crochet from the first to fifth row, in the following sequence: 5 columns of white yarn, 5 columns of yellow yarn, 5 white, 5 yellow, then again 5 white, 5 yellow, we end the row with 5 columns of white yarn.  When changing the color of the thread, we stretch the unused thread along, removing it into knitting.  There should not be any broaches on the canvas.  At the end of each row, do not forget to make one air loop for lifting. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. Now from 6 to 10 rows, we change the order of colors, start and finish knitting a row of 5 columns of yellow yarn. </p><p>  3. So, alternating colors every 5 rows, we knit 35 rows with single crochet.  After finishing the last row, cut the thread, stretch it into the last loop and tighten. </p><p>  4. We tack the tack in a circle with a green thread with single crochet, making 3 loops in the corners of the square in one loop of the base.  The last row of strapping is done by the ‚Äúcrayfish step‚Äù,  SCs are not executed as usual from right to left, but from left to right.  It turns out a dense structural edge.  At one corner of the tack, we knit a loop from air loops and tie it with crochets. </p><p>  Crochet potholders can be done in a circle.  To do this, knit a chain of 5 loops, close it in a ring and begin to tie a row of single crochet columns, inserting a hook into the middle of the ring.  After knitting the first row, the knitting is turned, an air loop is made for lifting and the next row is knitted in a circle.  In each row, the number of columns is increased so that knitting is flat.  So, row by row, knit a circle of the required size. </p><p>  The bell potholders are very original.  They are conveniently put on the handle of a pan or ladle.  Crocheting a tack in the form of a bell is also done in a circle, only the number of loops added in each row is small, so that it is not a flat circle, but a bell cone.  The added loops are evenly distributed in each row.  Such bells can be knitted several pieces of different colors, tied to each a long loop in the form of a green stalk and hung on a single hook in the kitchen as a bunch of flowers. </p><p>  Knitting gloves </p><p>  Knitting a tack with knitting needles is even easier than crocheting.  Want to try some knitting pattern?  Tie his rapport in the form of a tack, learn how to knit a pattern and get a convenient accessory for the kitchen.  The knitting needles must be crocheted around the edge with a ‚Äúwild step‚Äù, just single crochet or semicircular scallops made with different crochet stitches.  Simple knitted fabric is decorated with embroidery ribbons or <span>chain stitch,</span> knitted appliqu√©s, beads or colored buttons. </p>
