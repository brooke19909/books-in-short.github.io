Almost all have swimming pools and water slides, convenient playgrounds.  A good option for relaxing in economy class is Murat Hotel 3 * (Kemer Center), which, judging by the reviews, is fully consistent with the ratio of price and quality. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Murat Hotel 3 * (Kemer) is not yet very familiar to Russian tourists.

It is considered small, since there are only forty rooms in its room stock.  Nevertheless, this is rather not a minus, but a plus, since there is a real homely atmosphere here, despite the fact that the building itself is located in the center of a noisy resort. </p><p>  The hotel is fifty kilometers from the airport.  The transfer is carried out in a comfortable minibus, so the children carry it quite calmly. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Since the three-star Murat Hotel is located in the most vibrant area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKemer, where every meter of land is worth its weight in gold, its area is small.  However, it is fully equipped - planted with trees and flower bushes, divided into lawns, between which paths are laid. </p><p>  Every corner of the territory is thought out and used very rationally.  The hotel has a small guarded parking lot, which must be reserved when booking. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Murat Hotel (Kemer) 3 * offers the following services: a doctor‚Äôs office and laundry are provided on the ground floor of a three-story building.

There is also a fax machine and a left-luggage office.  In all public areas, including the pool, there is the possibility of free Internet connection. </p><p>  You can also rent a car at the registration desk or book excursions.  Those who did not arrange a transfer can use this service.  In addition, on the ground floor there is a corner with computers. </p><h2>  Rules of residence </h2><p>  Murat Hotel 3 *, like all other hotels, has its own standards established by the administration.  Upon arrival, the checkout time of which is set in the rules, a visitor must provide a passport.  Upon departure, vacationers must vacate their rooms until noon.  At the same time, upon delivery of the keys, the final payment is made: tourists need to pay for all those additional services that were provided to them and which were not included in the price. </p><p>  For the convenience of customers, the hotel operates not only a cash payment system, but also non-cash - with plastic cards.  However, in order to avoid misunderstandings, options need to be discussed in advance with the administration. </p>
