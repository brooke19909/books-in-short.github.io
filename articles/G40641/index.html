And there really is something to see, because each building is a real work of art.  But among them there are architectural monuments from which one cannot look away.  What sights on Nevsky Prospect are required to visit? </p><h2>  Stroganov Palace </h2><p>  At the very beginning of the avenue is the famous Stroganov Palace.  Its construction began in 1753 after a fire destroyed the previous building.  The project of the new palace was prepared by the famous architect Francesco Rastrelli.  The building was erected in just two years, and after its opening, it became a favorite meeting place for the St. Petersburg aristocracy.  Often he was visited by such writers as Fonvizin, Derzhavin and Krylov. </p>

    <p>  After the revolution, the palace was nationalized by Soviet power.  Initially, it housed the People‚Äôs House Museum, and in 1925 the building was transferred to business facilities.  Only by the beginning of the 90s the palace was transferred to the Russian Museum, which immediately began to carry <span>out restoration work</span> in it <span>.</span>  They were completed only in 2005.  Nevsky Prospect, whose attractions tourists love so much, received another restored historical building. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kazan Cathedral </h2><p>  Kazan Cathedral is one of the famous buildings of St. Petersburg.  Under the direction of the <span>architect Voronikhin,</span> in 1801, a cathedral project was developed that resembled <span>Catholic churches in</span> appearance <span>,</span> rather than traditional Russian churches. </p><p>  Construction was completed in 1811.  A year later, the cathedral was used to store military trophies.  During the Patriotic War of 1812, several dozen keys from the captured cities and fortresses of Europe were placed here.  In 1812, the temple became the resting place of the great Russian commander in chief M. I. Kutuzov. </p>

    <p>  After the October Revolution, <span>Kazan Cathedral</span> was nationalized, and worship services ceased.  The temple was converted into the Museum of History and Atheism, and until 1992 excursions for tourists were regularly held there.  After the collapse of the USSR, he was returned to the ownership of the Orthodox Church, becoming the cathedral of the Northern capital.  In 2001, the icon of the Mother of God of Kazan was returned to the temple, and Orthodox tourists flooded Nevsky Prospect.  The sights of the Kazan Cathedral do not end there.  On its territory are sculptures of two famous Russian military leaders: M. I. Kutuzov and M. B. Barclay de Tolly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Anichkov Palace </h2><p>  The palace was built by order of Empress Elizabeth.  The purpose of the construction was an attempt to ennoble entry into <span>St. Petersburg.</span>  <span>Nevsky</span> Prospect, whose sights now extend much further than the palace, in those years ended just at this place.  <span>Anichkov Palace</span> is considered the oldest building on Nevsky Prospect.  Its construction began in 1741, and the design of the building was developed by Mikhail Zemtsov.  When the construction was completed, the palace was presented to Elizabeth's former lover - Alexei Razumovsky. </p>

    <p>  After the revolution, the Palace of Pioneers opened in the building, and all the treasures were sold abroad.  During the blockade of Leningrad, the palace housed a hospital.  Now the Palace of Youth Creativity is located here, as well as guided tours for tourists visiting Nevsky Prospect.  The sights of the palace can be seen daily <span>from 10</span> to 18 hours. </p><h2>  Singer House </h2><p>  The construction of the unique building began in 1902.  Few people know that Nevsky Prospect, whose sights are not very high, could have its own skyscraper.  After all, it was him who was originally intended to be built by the Singer sewing company, but this idea was not approved by the authorities of St. Petersburg.  Then it was decided to erect a building six stories high, made in the Art Nouveau style.  The project was developed by architect Pavel Suzor.  For the first time in Russia, he used metal frames in construction, which made it possible to create large display windows.  At that time, the building was considered the most modern in the city.  It was equipped with elevators, as well as a device for automatically removing snow from the roof. </p>

    <p>  The building did not belong to the company for long.  After the revolution, the house was nationalized, and numerous publishers were located in the room itself.  In 1938, the Book House, famous throughout the USSR, opened here, which continues to function to this day.  The upper floors of the building are occupied by the offices of the famous social network VKontakte. </p><h2>  Eliseevsky shop </h2><p>  Another monument of Art Nouveau was the building of the trading house of the Eliseev brothers, built in 1904 according to the model of architect Baranovsky.  Here is a store where you can buy exotic products from around the world.  For example, oysters, wine, coffee, truffles, tropical fruits.  The Nevsky Fars Theater is also located here. </p>

    <p>  After the revolution, the store was transferred to Soviet power.  He still worked, but received a new name - ‚ÄúGrocery Store No. 1‚Äù.  Now rare products were bought by members of the party elite.  In times of general shortage, black caviar, pineapples, and smoked sausage could be bought at the store.  Now the building continues to operate a grocery store, and a restaurant is located in the basement. </p><h2>  Monument to Catherine II </h2><p>  Monuments everywhere adorn Peter.  Nevsky Prospect, whose sights are not only churches and palaces, is no exception.  The main decoration of the street is a monument to Empress Catherine II on Ostrovsky Square.  The decision to erect a monument to the centenary of her ascension to the throne arose in 1863, but the preparation of the project was delayed, and the sculpture was installed only in 1873. </p>

    <p>  The monument was designed by the sculptor Mikeshin.  On the monument, in addition to the empress herself, outstanding figures of her era are located.  Next to her were Potemkin, Suvorov, Derzhavin, Ekaterina Dashkova and others.  In 1903, a large-scale restoration of the monument was carried out.  The monument survived the revolution and still stands in its place, ennobling Nevsky Prospect. </p><p>  Sights, the photos of which are presented above, have attracted tourists not only from Russia, but also from other countries of the world for many years.  Of course, the article does not list all the significant places on the street.  Each house of the avenue has its own unique history, so you need to devote a lot of time to a walk along the Nevsky. </p>
