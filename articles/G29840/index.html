    <h2>  Resort Rethymnon </h2><p>  The city meets the needs of all categories of vacationers.  Here (since this is Greece after all), there is everything: wide sandy beaches with a gently sloping bottom for bathing children, secluded coves, as if created for lovers, pacifying rural landscapes on the outskirts, fun and shopping in the city itself.  The historical center is more like an open-air museum than a settlement, and a tourist eager for excursions will find here a rich Byzantine and Venetian heritage, Ottoman mosques and fountains.  If you are in love with Crete, then you can not find a better place for deployment than Rethymnon.  From here you can easily make radial trips around the island.
