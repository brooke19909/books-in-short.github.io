One of these can be called <span>Nokia N9</span> - a smartphone that changes the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmobile phones in principle. </p><p>  In this article we will talk about this smartphone and find out why it is so special, and for what reason you should pay attention to it. </p><h2>  Performance concept on a ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù OS </h2><p>  I immediately want to note that the phone was released back in 2011, so now, we can say, it is somewhat outdated.  True, due to its concept, the phone does not lose its relevance to this day.  And the whole thing is the approach taken by the developers. </p>

    <p>  The phone was released not on the usual (already at that time) Android, but on the little-known MeeGo platform.  This is a Linux-based system introduced a year earlier (in 2010).  Intel, Microsoft and Nokia participated in the project.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the latter began selling the phone on this OS. </p><p>  A logical question arises: ‚ÄúWhy is this system?  Why is it better than Android? ‚Äù  That's the point - Nokia presented the device on an unpopular, but optimized system. </p><p>  Due to the fact that no applications and games in high quality and with a set of relevant requirements (technical nature) were available on MeeGo, the developers managed to release the fastest phone, not burdened like other smartphones on popular OSs.  It is this approach that has earned the attention of many users - the device really quickly responds to all commands, does not hang and does not overload. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But from the general presentation of the phone, we will move on to more obvious things, for example, design.  It is with him that each user begins to get acquainted with the next device. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  It can be seen that manufacturers have worked hard on the appearance of the <span>Nokia N9</span> model <span>.</span>  The phone looks quite impressive due to the monolithic case, which does not contain any slots.  Even the SIM card slots and connectors from the charger and headphones are located on the bottom panel.  In addition, they are closed with special caps, thus creating a security effect. </p><p>  All that stands out on the rounded body of the model is just the side keys for adjusting the sound and locking / unlocking the display.  And then, thanks to special technology, you can also turn on the device‚Äôs screen with two short taps on the screen. </p><p>  As for the finishing material, the Nokia N9 presents a special matte plastic, which has several functions at once.  Firstly, it is decorative, because the phone looks quite attractive.  Secondly, we can talk about protection from scratches and bumps.  The matte surface will not be spoiled even by overwriting - therefore, your phone will not lose its appearance under any circumstances.  In addition, it should be mentioned a set of special covers, pads.  They have different colors, so each user is given the opportunity to choose a color scheme for their Nokia N9 individually. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  Of course, following the appearance, the screen of the device should be discussed - the main element in the management of any smartphone.  If we talk about our model, then the size of its display is only 3.9 inches.  With a resolution of 480 by 854 pixels, the image on it can be called acceptable for work - only fine grain is observed when approaching.  To protect the screen, glass is used, developed by <span>Gorilla Glass</span> technology (first generation).  It is believed to withstand shock and resist scratches. </p><h2>  CPU and filling </h2><p>  Since we are talking about a phone that entered the market in 2011, we should not expect that it has an ultra-powerful processor that shows performance wonders.  In fact, there is an ARM Cortex-A8 with a clock frequency of 1 GHz.  It would seem that by the standards of modern smartphones this is not so much, however, I repeat, this is quite enough <span>for the MeeGo operating system</span> specifically on this device.  Moreover, the gadget is not required to play bulky games stuffed with graphics, in view of their absence under the specified OS, which was already mentioned earlier. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  The device has a fairly powerful camera, the matrix resolution of which is 8 megapixels.  In fact, if you run it, it resembles the <span>Nokia N8</span> camera <span>.</span>  True, reviews note a lower quality of images. </p><p>  This device has several additional functions at once to create better pictures.  In particular, this is automatic focusing, color distribution;  if we talk about video - it‚Äôs also the ability to shoot in HD-quality. </p><p>  The conclusion is that for an amateur session the camera of the phone is quite suitable - with Nokia N9 (the firmware that will be installed on the device does not matter) you will receive a series of photos that can be shown to relatives.  However, with the transmission of colors the apparatus has problems - the main part of the picture is simply ‚Äúlit up‚Äù. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The gadget, despite the release date, is actually equipped with communication technologies at the level of a modern device.  In particular, we can note the <span>GPS module</span> (together with the Nokia-map application, it allows you to navigate the terrain, determine the location, and so on), as well as 3G support.  As for the Internet, there is the possibility of working also through WiFi. </p><p>  In addition to these ‚Äúcore‚Äù ones, the Nokia N9 also has the NFC option installed - the ability to make payments using your smartphone at a short distance (up to 10 centimeters).  True, as practice and user reviews show, this function is rarely and rarely used. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Of course, in any device, the duration of its work matters.  The technical regulation states that the batteries will last for about 1 day of intensive and 2-3 - medium-sized operation of the Nokia N9.  The Chinese ‚Äúclone‚Äù, of course, will last much less - therefore, we do not recommend purchasing it. </p><p>  In general, the claimed capacity is 1450 mAh, which allows us to talk about quite a long time.  Moreover, you should consider what operating system the Nokia N9 runs on.  Android could hardly give such a performance that you can talk about with MeeGo.  Therefore, this can be called the strength of the smartphone. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  There are a lot of recommendations about Nokia N9, the price of which was only about 12 thousand rubles.  Most of them are positive, noting the simplicity and, at the same time, the functionality of this model.  Some users call the phone so that it has a basic set of functions (calls, SMS, browser) and, in addition, it looks quite solid. </p><p>  There are, of course, negative reviews.  To understand what a telephone is, you need to read them.  Such things are noted about Nokia N9: insufficient number of settings (this is probably due to the fact that the operating system is much simpler here than Android);  weak speaker for listening to music without headphones;  primitive music player (not satisfying the requirements of music lovers).  Also, the ‚Äúminuses" include the lack of the ability to view and change office documents;  lack of space on a device with 16GB of memory (since in fact there are only 9 available).  Therefore, regarding the last drawback, we can advise you to take a version with 32 or 64 gigabytes.  As it becomes clear from this characteristic, it is impossible to expand the volume with the help of a memory card. </p>

    <p>  A number of other reviews relate to the impossibility of updating the operating system - since, obviously, MeeGo is something of a ‚Äúone-time‚Äù product and, as we see, Nokia does not develop it in a separate direction.  Therefore, if the user has identified any flaw or error in the system - most likely, they will no longer fix it. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As a result, we can say the following.  In this article, we described a good (from any point of view) smartphone, which has a lot of advantages.  This is a fairly fast processor that allows for stable operation of the device.  The case of the phone does not differ in anything special, but it still looks nice and has considerable strength to <span>protect the phone</span> during operation of the Nokia N9.  The display of the device also deserves praise due to the colorful picture and, in principle, a high level of protection.  Optional features - communication modules, browser, navigation system - everything works smoothly, quickly and accurately.  Separately, we can mention the capacious battery. </p>

    <p>  The operating system interface is simple and straightforward, therefore the verdict on this device is ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù.  The device copes with its tasks perfectly, and if you take into account its age, it is clear that the phone deserves only praise.  Let's just say: this is a worthy alternative to Android and even iOS as of 2011.  Particular attention should be paid to the device for those who, in addition to the modern model, need a second smartphone - exclusively for work. </p>
