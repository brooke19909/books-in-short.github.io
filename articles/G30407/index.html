    <p>  The role of biology in modern reality is difficult to overestimate, because it studies in detail the <span>human life</span> in all its manifestations.  Currently, this science combines such important concepts as evolution, <span>cell theory,</span> genetics, homeostasis and energy.  Its functions include the study of the development of all living things, namely: the structure of organisms, their behavior, as well as relationships between themselves and their relationship with the environment. </p><p>  The significance of biology in human life becomes understandable if we draw a parallel between the main problems of an individual‚Äôs life, for example, health, nutrition, and the choice of optimal living conditions.  Today, there are numerous sciences that have separated from biology, becoming no less important and independent.  These include zoology, botany, microbiology, as well as virology.  Of these, it is difficult to single out the most significant, all of them are a complex of the most valuable fundamental knowledge accumulated by civilization. </p><p>  Outstanding scientists such as Claudius Galen, Hippocrates, Karl Linnaeus, Charles Darwin, Alexander Oparin, Ilya Mechnikov and many others worked in this field of knowledge.  Thanks to their discoveries, especially the study of living organisms, the science of morphology appeared, as well as physiology, which gathered in itself the knowledge about the systems of organisms of living beings.  An invaluable role in the development of hereditary diseases was played by genetics. </p><p>  Biology has become a solid foundation in medicine, sociology and ecology.  It is important that this science, like any other, is not static, but is constantly updated with new knowledge that is being transformed in the form of new biological theories and laws. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The role of biology in modern society, and especially in medicine, is priceless.  It was with its help that methods of treating bacteriological and rapidly spreading viral diseases were found.  Each time we think about the role of biology in modern society, we recall that it was thanks to the heroism of medical biologists that the foci of terrible epidemics disappeared from planet Earth: plague, cholera, <span>typhoid fever,</span> anthrax, smallpox and others no less life-threatening diseases. </p><p>  We can safely say, relying on the facts, that the role of biology in modern society is growing continuously.  It is impossible to imagine modern life without selection, genetic research, the production of new food products, as well as environmentally friendly energy sources. </p><p>  The main significance of biology is that it represents the foundation and theoretical basis for many promising sciences, for example, such as genetic engineering and bionics.  She owns a great discovery - the decoding <span>of the human genome.</span>  A direction such as biotechnology was also created on the basis of knowledge combined in biology.  Currently, it is precisely this type of technology that allows you to create safe medicines for prevention and treatment that does not harm the body.  As a result, it is possible to increase not only life expectancy, but also its quality. </p><p>  The role of biology in modern society lies in the fact that there are areas where its knowledge is simply necessary, for example, the pharmaceutical industry, gerontology, forensics, agriculture, construction, and space exploration. </p><p>  The unstable environmental situation on Earth requires a rethinking of production activities, and the importance of biology in human life moves to a new level.  Every year we become witnesses of widespread disasters that affect both the poorest countries and highly developed ones.  They are largely caused by the growth <span>of the world's population, the</span> unreasonable use of energy sources, as well as the existing economic and social contradictions in modern society. </p><p>  The present clearly indicates to us that the very continued existence of civilization is possible only if there is harmony in <span>the environment.</span>  Only observance of biological laws, as well as the widespread use of progressive biotechnologies based on environmental thinking, will ensure natural safe coexistence for all inhabitants of the planet, without exception. </p><p>  The role of biology in modern society is expressed in the fact that it is currently transformed into real power.  Thanks to her knowledge, the prosperity of our planet is possible.  That is why the answer to the question of what is the role of biology in modern society can be this - this is the cherished key to harmony between nature and man. </p>
