  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Audiovisual Learning Technology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The modern world is fundamentally different from the one that we all knew some ten years ago.  More recently, it seemed completely unbelievable that now surrounds us at every turn.  So are the new audiovisual teaching technologies in secondary and higher education. </p><p>  The education system inherently has always been somewhat conservative.  Oddly enough, but it is the old experienced teachers who often resist the introduction of new technologies into the educational process.  Guided by their experience, conservatively educated teachers of the old school achieve such results that young adherents of new methods did not even dream of. </p><p>  So, do new technologies themselves mean nothing at all?  Indeed, in the first place in the pedagogical process - nevertheless, the talent of the teacher and his rich experience.  But audiovisual learning technologies cannot be discounted, like other new trends in the educational process. </p><p>  Now it‚Äôs even hard to imagine that until recently, teachers‚Äôs assistants were only a geographical map and various thematic posters on subjects, proudly called ‚Äúvisual aids‚Äù.  And if the teacher himself did such benefits in his free time from lessons and checking notebooks, and even with students at extracurricular activities, then the experience of such a teacher was generalized and studied by his followers. </p><p>  Such a means of visual agitation as a cinema projection apparatus of the ‚ÄúSchoolboy‚Äù or ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù type was also popular, by means of which popular science films in geography or educational films in physics were shown to students in specially darkened classes, showing various experiments revealing certain patterns.  Thus, a film projection or a demonstration of transparencies can already be defined as the first audiovisual teaching aids, albeit with some stretch.  Ordinary turntable with black large vinyl records can also be attributed to the first audiovisual media. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is really new that audiovisual teaching technologies can provide to the modern educational process?  The fact is that modern media technologies, unlike the old familiar tape recorders and players, allow the student and teacher to practically move to a completely new communicative level, that is, to transfer or acquire new knowledge already at the media level - at the same time understand and, therefore, learn new material much easier and faster. </p><p>  Indeed, it is one thing to listen to and outline the lecture of the teacher, and quite another to participate in creating the same lecture in real time together with other students, influencing the course of events on the <span>interactive whiteboard.</span>  In addition, modern interactive audiovisual <span>teaching methods will</span> no longer allow the student to just sleep off at the lecture after a hectic night, because they require the student to participate directly and actively in the learning process.  In addition, experience shows that such classes are very interesting for students and they willingly attend them - the percentage of non-attendance is extremely low. </p><p>  Now we can talk about that new direction in education, which is called distance learning.  What is it and in what cases is it applied?  It is no secret that people with disabilities are limited not only by the ability to fully move in space.  They are limited in terms of getting a decent education.  The same can be said about those people who live in rural areas and for some reason do not have the opportunity to go to study in large cities of the country. </p><p>  This is where distance learning technologies come to the rescue, allowing you to engage with a teacher remotely using such a powerful communication tool as Skype.  In this case, modern audiovisual teaching technologies and other interactive methods are also used. </p><p>  But nevertheless, getting a real worthy education in our country will become possible only when students and schoolchildren cease to be ‚Äúlearnable‚Äù and again become students, that is, active participants in the educational process. </p>
