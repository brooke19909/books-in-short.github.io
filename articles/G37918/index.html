The era of devices created for radio amateurs will exist for many more years, because until now not a single mobile device with an integrated FM tuner allows you to catch short, medium and long waves.  But it is so interesting to listen to the broadcast of the entire globe, amateur and pirate radio stations, as well as to entertain yourself by eavesdropping on private negotiations in the open <span>frequency range.</span> </p>

    <p>  In this article, the reader is invited to get acquainted with the Chinese Degen 1103 receiver, capable of working on almost any radio frequency.  Overview, description, specifications and user reviews will allow potential buyers to find out more about this wonderful device with useful information. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The portable receiver works in all <span>frequency ranges</span> known to the world <span>,</span> this is its main advantage: </p><ul><li>  VHF (FM) 78-108 MHz in steps of 25 kHz; </li><li>  LW / SV / HF (AM) 100-30 000 kHz in 1 kHz steps, with the possibility of expanding the range in manual mode. </li></ul><p>  In addition, the Degen 1103 radio has dual frequency conversion over the entire AM range, and is also equipped with an automatic busy frequency scanning system.  A digital <span>volume control,</span> 268 cells for recording stations, working in the SSB (taxi, security and other private organizations) range, stereo mode support, built-in alarm clock and the presence of control buttons make this device truly unique in the market of digital audio equipment for listening to radio broadcasting channels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Get to know better </h2><p>  The Chinese managed to surprise even the most demanding customers who prefer European and American quality products.  The radio Degen DE 1103 has an unusually rich package: a charger, a set of batteries, headphones, an external antenna, a soft carrying case and a Russian-language instruction manual. </p>

    <p>  As for the build quality, there were some pleasant surprises here.  In the manufacture of the device case, high-strength plastic was used, which, even with effort, is difficult enough to damage.  In their reviews, many owners compare the Degen product with similar receivers created in the USSR (for example, Orion).  Only the telescopic antenna bothers users - its mount can be easily broken if handled ineptly. </p><h2>  Ease of use </h2><p>  The digital keyboard present on the device‚Äôs case clearly simplifies both entering frequencies to search for the desired radio station and setting up the Degen 1103 receiver. The instructions that come with the set describe in more detail all the functionality for which you need to enter numbers.  However, many users still have questions.  At the software level, the device does not allow you to enter frequencies that are beyond the limits stated in the technical specifications.  The gadget simply signals an error. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  As for the rest of the control buttons, there is a complete order.  All of them are multifunctional and allow the user to quickly configure the radio for full operation.  The LCD screen is quite interestingly implemented.  It has a digital display, but displays an analogue scale.  Quite an interesting imitation, besides fully working. </p><h2>  Little things </h2><p>  The Degen DE 1103 receiver, the price of which is within 5000 rubles, has a very interesting control of the frequency synthesizer.  A circular knob (switcher) allows the owner to tune to almost any frequency with maximum accuracy.  It is this functionality that draws attention to the device of potential buyers. </p>

    <p>  But the volume control can upset future owners.  The speaker is controlled by a built-in wheel.  At the first acquaintance, there is a feeling that the manufacturer simply mixed up the volume controls and the synthesizer.  Fortunately, many electronic engineers will have no problem solving the problem of controlling the sound volume. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Playback quality </h2><p>  Yes, the headphones that come with the Degen 1103 receiver leave much to be desired, there is clearly nothing to argue about.  Users who want to listen to radio frequencies without disturbing others should definitely consider acquiring a decent speaker system. </p><p>  As for the built-in speaker, things are much better here.  The Chinese have installed a fairly high-quality speaker (diameter - 77 mm), which perfectly reproduces high and medium sound frequencies.  The device has serious problems with bass, so you should not even spend time on fine tuning. </p><h2>  First steps to optimization </h2><p>  Better to start with the fact that the Chinese still made a mistake in picking their product.  The Delay 4WD 1300 mAh rechargeable batteries supplied in the box are of low quality and are not able to hold a charge for a long time, which largely affects the battery life of the Degen 1103. The price of the device in the domestic market is quite high, and the manufacturer simply had no right to do so with by buyers. </p>

    <p>  To extend the battery life of the receiver will help branded batteries with a capacity of 2200-2500 mAh from some well-known manufacturer (for example, Panasonic, Duracell or Philips).  There is not much difference in such products, so here the buyer should focus only on the cost of consumables. </p><h2>  Common problems with signal amplification </h2><p>  Knowledge of the basics of physics is good, only the Degen 1103 receiver is not designed to connect a more powerful antenna.  The maximum that the user can be limited to is to connect a remote signal amplifier, which is supplied. </p><p>  There are several problems.  Firstly, the input stage does not have capacitors and can simply burn out from overvoltage.  The user needs to install two capacitive drives of 100 pF each.  The second problem hides the YJ-7 <span>field-effect transistor</span> , which is mounted on the Degen 1103 receiver board. Having rejected a powerful amplifier and returning to using the native telescopic antenna, the user will find that there is no reception of AM channels.  The problem is solved by replacing the Chinese field effect transistor with a domestic product with the marking KP303B. </p><h2>  Problems of civilization </h2><p>  Oddly enough, the residents of megacities have a problem with receiving AM and SSB waves.  The fact is that almost all buildings, including residential buildings, are based on metal structures, which create a lot of interference in the operation of long waves. </p><p>  There are not so many options for solving this problem.  Someone suggests going out of town or climbing the roof of a multi-story building to listen to amateur stations.  And for someone it is easier to make a shielding of the signal board of the Degen 1103. The refinement, of course, requires some knowledge in electrical engineering.  It is recommended to install two screens: on a frequency synthesizer and on a quartz filter.  As a material, you can use copper foil or a piece of tin. </p>

    <h2>  Small tricks </h2><p>  To expand the lower limit of the frequency range, the user does not need a soldering iron and microcircuits.  You can bypass the limitation programmatically.  True, such a solution requires increased attention and perseverance.  Firstly, using the instructions, the owner needs to learn how to work with recording radio stations in the memory cells of the Degen 1103. Then you need to use the following algorithm of actions: </p><ul><li>  use the buttons to set the upper limit of the range: 21 951 kHz; </li><li>  run automatic scanning (Band + and Band-); </li><li>  Having seen the approach of the scan to the lower boundary (100 kHz), it is necessary to slightly turn the handle of the encoder; </li><li>  it is recommended to write this frequency in a pair of memory cells so as not to repeat the scan in the future; </li><li>  turning the scanner knob, you must manually search for the desired frequency in the lower range. </li></ul><p>  The same procedure can be done when scanning the upper frequency range (over 30 MHz), but here you already need to be more careful, both with automatic search and with manual settings.  The fact is that the receiver, trying to please the user, is trying to switch to the mode of receiving FM radio waves. </p><h2>  Feedback </h2><p>  About the Degen 1103 radio, owner reviews are pretty interesting.  Beginners who are far from knowledge of electrical engineering leave only positive comments, and radio mechanics professionals complain about significant manufacturer flaws.  True, each negative opinion is accompanied by an algorithm of actions to eliminate the problem. </p>

    <p>  The volume control fell out of favor with all customers - it needs to be redone, at the same time, and the circuit responsible for automatically increasing the volume should be modified.  The second serious problem that many users pay attention to is the operation of the built-in charger for removable finger batteries.  Too low current is supplying the power supply to the batteries.  Either you need to buy an external charger, or cut an extra resistor from the power board.  True, in the latter case, the power supply will heat up significantly during battery charging. </p><p>  As for the merits, it is simply impossible to list them in one article.  The Degen 1103 device works in almost all ranges and has a very high-quality reception, so the owner will always have a choice of at least hundreds of radio stations with high sound quality anywhere in the world. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The receiver is decent, it's just hard to disagree.  Outside of civilization: at sea, in the wilderness, at the cottage or fishing - everywhere there will be high-quality reception not only of your favorite radio stations, but also of amateur channels.  With a Degen 1103 device, you won‚Äôt be bored anywhere.  However, to get maximum comfort, you should still pay attention to a small refinement of the receiver, otherwise some unpleasant little things can disrupt a pleasant pastime. </p>
