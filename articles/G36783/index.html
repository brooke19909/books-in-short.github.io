    <h2>  Types of children's dresses </h2><p>  Obviously, it is impossible to list all the existing types of <span>knitted dresses for girls</span> within the framework of this article, since the products of each craftswoman are very individual, and there are countless combinations of various elements.  Here will be described the most popular models that make it easy <span>to</span> crochet a <span>dress</span> for a girl.  The scheme for the manufacture of the product can be used in the form proposed by the developer, or be changed by a knitter.  For example, you can add or remove a sleeve, increase or decrease the neck, and make the skirt more magnificent.  Do not be afraid to make improvements to patterns and patterns, as this is the way to real creative knitting. </p><p>  <span>Crochet summer dress</span> for girls can be: </p><ul><li>  With a round or square yoke. </li><li>  Connected directly (without coquette). </li><li>  Combined from several types of materials. </li></ul><h2>  Which yarn to choose? </h2><p>  In order for the summer dress to be not only beautiful, but also comfortable for the child, it is worth using good, high-quality yarn.  For example, cotton, linen, viscose, silk or thread with a low content of polyamide or nylon (not more than 30%).  Acrylic yarn, which is positioned as a child‚Äôs yarn, is quite popular now, but it is of little use.  The only plus is hypoallergenicity.  Of the disadvantages: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  It does not pass air. </li><li>  Does not absorb moisture. </li><li>  May cause excessive sweating. </li><li>  Products do not save from the cold, but extremely hot. </li></ul><p>  Cotton and linen are indispensable if you need to make a <span>casual dress</span> for a girl with a crochet.  The scheme is selected depending on the thickness of the thread. </p><p>  For smart models, viscose, silk and lurex are used. </p><h2>  Combination dress </h2><p>  This is a great option for beginner knitters.  It allows you to use existing dresses, which for some reason can not be worn: the child has grown, a stain on the top of the product, an inappropriate design model.  Also, as a skirt for such a dress, you can use a light scarf. </p><p>  Only a coquette is crocheted here.  It can be round, square or straight.  In the photo below, this part is connected directly. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dress for girls crochet pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1235801.jpg" width="427"></div>

    <p>  It turned out pretty <span>simple dress</span> for a girl crocheted.  The pattern design for such a coquette will suit almost any one, the choice of a craftswoman.  Details fit in accordance with the pattern.  This is necessary so that the neckline is flat.  At the end of knitting, they are sewn and tied around the edge with the simplest strapping. </p><h2>  <span>Knit dress</span> with a straight yoke </h2><p>  The next model is very similar to the combination dress from the previous paragraph.  The difference is that both the yoke and the skirt are crocheted.  The photo below shows a dress for a girl (crochet), a diagram of the main patterns and bindings, as well as a drawing of the pattern. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The peculiarity of such models is that the yoke is knitted from the bottom up, and the skirt from top to bottom.  In the drawing, the direction of knitting is indicated by arrows.  This technique is necessary so that the skirt does not turn out to be straight, but a little picked up. </p><p>  A pattern for this model may not be required, you can do only calculations.  However, it is necessary to carefully ensure that the reduction of the loops along the neckline and the armhole is performed symmetrically. </p><h2>  How to crochet a dress for a girl: a model with a circular yoke </h2><p>  This dress looks very beautiful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a dress for a girl" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1235802.jpg" width="564"></div>  Openwork always adorns the product.  In this case, the yoke is connected in the form of a circle, a napkin serves as the basis for its pattern.  Work begins with a neckline and takes place in a circle.  The principle of expanding the circular web is laid down in the scheme, so you just need to follow it, and then proceed to the manufacture of parts of the front and back.

    <p>  These canvases can be knitted separately from each other and then sewn together on the sides or immediately knit in a single circular cloth.  When implementing the second option, the main difficulty becomes adding loops to form armholes.  At this stage, it is important not to make a mistake and maintain the correct number of rapports. </p><p>  Armholes are formed when knitting a chain of air loops, which is thrown through a certain section of the last row of coquette. </p><h2>  Dress with raglan sleeve </h2><p>  The next model does not need a circuit, since its manufacture is quite simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet lace dress for girls" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1235805.jpg" width="600"></div>  Start work with the neck:

      <p></p>
    <ul><li>  The initial chain of air loops is equal to the circumference of the child‚Äôs neck, plus a few centimeters. </li><li>  In the first row, the canvas is divided into four equal parts.  At these points in each row, loops are added (three are knitted from one double crochet). </li><li>  The additions stop when each side of the web becomes equal to the planned sleeve width.  This means that it is time to move on to the manufacture of front and back parts. </li><li>  To get a sufficient width of these paintings, you need to add a loop.  This action is performed using a chain of air loops thrown between the parts.  In the process of knitting the next row, the resulting air loops are knitted in a pattern.  In the finished product, these areas are under the armpits. </li><li>  Further work is extremely simple: you need to knit crocheted columns and form a smooth or expanded canvas of the desired length.  To expand on the sides, columns are evenly added (1 column every 3 cm). </li><li>  At the last stage, all open edges are tied with a simple or openwork strapping. </li></ul><p>  The described methods will allow you to crochet a dress for a girl for any occasion: from a walk in the yard to a special occasion. </p>
