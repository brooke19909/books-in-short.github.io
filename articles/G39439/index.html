A sea of ‚Äã‚Äãinformation, including personal or confidential, which may become the property of an unfriendly thief, as well as the considerable cost of a new decent device, make mobile device users provide their reliable protection.  In this they are actively helped by all kinds of "spyware" applications and Internet services.  It‚Äôs good if nothing like this happens to you, but everything happens in life.  Therefore, we will devote this article to a topic absolutely relevant to this day: how to find a lost Android phone.  There is far from one completely affordable way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find a lost android phone" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18997/416372.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <h2>  Talklog </h2><p>  This program is designed specifically for such cases and allows you to track almost all the manipulations that are performed on your device, it is now even in the opposite point of the Earth.  Oddly enough, these capabilities are fairly easy to manage.  The main thing is that this service should already be installed on it at the time of the loss of the phone (it is advisable to do this immediately after purchasing the device).  A correctly installed application will easily determine the location of the device by GPS coordinates with an accuracy of one meter, and you can monitor its movement directly from the screen of your home computer, smartphone or any other device that supports Internet access. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Talklog Benefits </h2><p>  Such a pleasure, of course, is not free, but the money spent will justify itself in full, and you won‚Äôt have to wonder how to find the location of the Android phone without the help of outsiders or the police.  The service working in stealth mode in no way affects the functionality of other programs on your phone, so the thief will not even suspect that his movement is carefully monitored.  Such a "spy" is capable of: </p><ul><li>  Follow the call log and listen to all conversations.  Received records are stored on the server and the user's computer. </li><li>  Reread any kind of messages sent or received. </li><li>  Transfer all photos and videos to the server. </li><li>  Find an Android phone and set its location at any time. </li><li>  Read the history of the Internet browser installed on your device. </li><li>  Analyze the installation and remove any programs on the smartphone. </li><li>  Carry out audio monitoring.  This means that the Talklog user can connect to the stolen device, turn on the microphone on it and use it to hear in real time everything that happens at its location. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find a stolen android phone" class="if" height="472" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18997/416586.jpg" width="472"></div></li></ul><p>  If you believe the reviews of Internet users, Talklog not only knows how to find a lost Android phone, but also allows you to fully control its work.  An additional advantage of this service is the possibility of free familiarization with its work before direct purchase. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Plan b </h2><p>  An alternative to the previous program is the development of Lookout Mobile Security - a program called "Plan B".  Its main advantage is that there is no need to buy a service in advance - you can install the utility after the phone is lost or stolen.  Another advantage of the ‚Äúbackup plan‚Äù is the free installation.  To do this, you just need to create your account on the Android Market website, download the installation file and install it on a lost device by the remote principle.  After that, your device via satellite will determine its coordinates and transmit them to the owner via e-mail.  You can also use another phone: you need to send a message with the text "LOCATE" to the lost device, to which he should send a message with his coordinates.  As for the reviews of the free Plan B app, they are pretty controversial.  Some users are satisfied with everything and no longer worry about how to find a lost Android phone.  But the rest complain either about incompatibility with their operating systems, then at some other "glitches" in the program.  Well, all of these are the ‚Äúcharms‚Äù of free apps. </p>

Such a service can determine the coordinates of your device and show them on the map.  In addition, there is a function of realizing a remote call to a lost smartphone (even if silent mode is activated on it or a new SIM card is installed). </p>
