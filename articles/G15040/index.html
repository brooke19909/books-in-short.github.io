Residents of the village are especially interested in its <span>loan programs.</span>  We‚Äôll talk about them.  What do you need to take a loan at the Agricultural Bank? </p><h2>  Credit programs of the Agricultural Bank </h2><p>  The bank offers a choice of several types of lending: </p><ul><li>  consumer (the most popular way to get a cash loan at the Agricultural Bank), </li><li>  mortgage </li><li>  car loan </li><li>  special credit programs (they will help a pensioner, a gardener or the owner of a summer cottage to take a loan at the Agricultural Bank). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.oceanbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit at the agricultural bank" class="if uuid-2637844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2637844.jpg"></div><p>  Let us dwell on consumer loans.  After all, it is they who are popular, by the way, not only among citizens living in rural areas.  So, from residents of St. Petersburg to take a loan at the Agricultural Bank - in the order of things.  The bank is also popular in Moscow.  However, here its market share is much smaller.  Residents of Samara also do not refuse to take a loan from the Agricultural Bank - the conditions are acceptable, plus a profitable refinancing program (we will talk about it below). </p><h2>  Consumer loans of the Agricultural Bank </h2><p>  Let's say you saw an advertisement for a new TV with amazing functionality.  Here is a revolutionary screen, the Internet and movies in 3D.  You understand that you simply can‚Äôt live without him anymore.  But there is no cash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What to do?  Limit yourself and save a few months?  No, this is not an option.  After all, I want to use the new product now. </p><p>  Then you need to borrow money.  But where?  For acquaintances, such a sum is definitely not found.  And here you recall the banner of the Agricultural Bank, which you saw a week ago in your inbox. </p><p>  Here it is!  You decide to get a loan - you will be able to use the equipment now, and pay in a few months. </p><p>  <span>How to get a loan</span> at the Agricultural <span>Bank</span> ?  To begin with, it is worth familiarizing yourself with the bank‚Äôs offer in detail - reality is not always consistent with advertising. </p><h2>  Consumer lending programs of the Agricultural Bank </h2><p>  At your service are several consumer lending programs: </p><ul><li>  without collateral (will allow you to take a loan at the Agricultural Bank without guarantors); </li><li>  without security for payroll clients; </li><li>  with security; </li><li>  refinancing loan; </li><li>  improper consumer loan secured by housing. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="kredit-nsk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank branch" class="if uuid-2637849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2637849.jpg"></div><h2>  Unsecured consumer credit </h2><p>  In fact, it is not difficult to take a loan at the Agricultural Bank - you can calculate the interest rate and monthly payment online.  On the official website of the bank, each loan is presented on a separate page on which there is a convenient calculator that allows a potential client not to bother with calculations.  Just enter the required amount, loan term and your monthly income. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The program itself will calculate the interest rate, the amount of the monthly payment and the maximum possible loan amount.  It will also provide a payment schedule.  How to get a loan at the Agricultural Bank?  Personally come to the department with all the documents (the list is below) and fill out a questionnaire. </p><p>  Let's say you need 100,000 rubles for 12 months.  And your monthly income is 20,000 rubles.  Moreover, you do not fit the special categories of borrowers and refuse personal insurance.  Entering these data into the program, we obtain the following results: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Inappropriate consumer credit" class="if uuid-2636631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2636631.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, the bank is ready to provide you a loan at 20% per annum.  This is not at all the 10% that was promised in advertising. </p><p>  Let's see why.  In fact, this is just a clever marketing ploy.  The main thing for a bank is to attract as many customers as possible.  And a low interest rate in advertising works well. </p><p>  Do not think that advertising is deceiving you.  She simply does not specify that not everyone can take advantage of such an opportunity, how to take out a loan at the Agricultural Bank at 10% per annum.  Such a loan will be provided only to certain categories of customers, and then only as long as the action is valid. </p><p>  Let's try to slightly change the source data.  Imagine that you agreed to insure yourself in favor of the bank, are its ‚Äúreliable‚Äù client and work in a budget organization.  See what happens in this situation: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="inappropriate consumer credit" class="if uuid-2636625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2636625.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, even with ‚Äúideal‚Äù parameters, the minimum interest rate for you is 12% per annum. </p><p>  And one more ‚Äúthin‚Äù moment.  Please note that the differentiated payment is selected in the screenshot.  This means that every month the amount of payment will decrease.  As a result, for 12 months you will pay 106.5 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Now let's leave the one that stands by default - annuity.  This means that the loan is repaid every month with the same amount.  In this case, it is 8,885 rubles.  For 12 months you will pay 106.62 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Although the overpayment is not big, it‚Äôs more profitable to choose a differentiated payment.  Especially if you take a large amount for the long term. </p><p>  An important point - to take a loan at the Agricultural Bank without guarantors is possible not only under this program.  But it is she who is popular with borrowers. </p><h2>  Requirements for borrowers at the Russian Agricultural Bank </h2><p>  To get a loan, you need to meet certain criteria: </p><ul><li>  the borrower must be at least 23 years old; </li><li>  until the loan is repaid, the age of the borrower must not exceed 65 years; </li><li>  a person taking a loan must be a citizen of the Russian Federation and have a permanent ‚Äúresidence permit‚Äù; </li><li>  You need to document income. </li></ul><p>  The last paragraph is worth a closer look.  Here, not only your salary is taken into account, but also other incomes, which you must also document. </p><p>  To increase income and, as a result, available credit limit, can be used: </p><ul><li>  part-time work; </li><li>  entrepreneurial activity (only taken into account when lending for up to 3 years); </li><li>  private practice; </li><li>  pension; </li><li>  personal subsidiary plots (LPH); </li><li>  renting out real estate (taken into account if the borrower is the owner); </li><li>  intellectual property; </li><li>  work under a GPC agreement (civil law). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.dongaitway.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="conclusion of a loan agreement" class="if uuid-2637852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2637852.jpg"></div><p>  Note also that at the current place you must work at least 6 months.  In addition, over the past 5 years, your total work experience must be at least 1 year. </p><p>  If you receive income from private household plots, you will have to provide an extract from the <span>household book</span> stating that you have been engaged in this activity for at least a year. </p><p>  If your own income is not enough, you can attract a co-borrower.  Theoretically, this could be any person who meets the same requirements as the borrower.  The co-borrower also confirms his income documented. </p><p>  For customers who have already taken a loan at the Agricultural Bank and faithfully fulfilled their obligations, the bank is more loyal.  So in the last place it is enough for them to work out just 3 months.  And for the last 5 years you need to gain only six months of work experience. </p><h2>  What documents will be needed to obtain a consumer loan at the Agricultural Bank? </h2><p>  The following documents will be required: </p><ul><li>  application form (drawn up at the bank); </li><li>  passport; </li><li>  SNILS; </li><li>  military ID (or certificate of registration); </li><li>  marriage certificate, prenuptial agreement, birth certificates of children; </li><li>  copy of labor certified by the employer (valid for not more than 1 month); </li><li>  copy of the employment contract; </li><li>  certificate 2-personal income tax or in the form of a bank (usually issued with a "gray" salary). </li></ul><p>  The bank is entitled to demand other documents.  So you will have to document each of the additional sources of income. </p><p>  In total, you will stay in the bank for about an hour.  During this time, employees will fill out your questionnaire and conduct an initial verification of the documents submitted.  And the loan decision will be reported to you within 3 days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cyberactive-1.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="consumer credit" class="if uuid-2637854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2637854.jpg"></div><h2>  Unsecured consumer loans for payroll clients </h2><p>  The bank is more loyal to customers receiving a salary on a Rosselkhozbank card. </p><p>  To confirm income, the bank makes the same requirements for them as for customers who have already proved their solvency (3 months at the last place of work and 6 months of total experience over the past 5 years). </p><p>  And as a supporting document, the bank will accept a statement from the personal account.  It will be issued to you and certified directly in the bank.  It must be said that this is the only way to get a loan from the Agricultural Bank without an income statement. </p><p>  This is what the online calculator looks like for calculating loan parameters: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Inappropriate consumer credit" class="if uuid-2636627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2636627.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, under ideal (for the bank) conditions, the interest rate and monthly payment are the same. </p><p>  The difference is only in the maximum amount of a consumer loan - Rosselkhozbank is ready to issue up to 1.5 million to its salary customers, and only 750 thousand rubles to ordinary citizens. </p><p>  Another important parameter is the loan term: up to 7 years - for salary clients, up to 5 years - for everyone else. </p><h2>  Secured consumer loan </h2><p>  It differs in that certain property of the debtor is taken as a pledge.  This is usually a car.  After all, the main requirement for the subject of the pledge is liquidity (so that in the current situation it could be easily sold). </p><p>  Real estate can also act as collateral.  But in this case, Rosselkhozbank has a special lending program (see below). </p><p>  But as a guarantee, a guarantee of an individual or legal entity (or several persons) is also accepted. </p><p>  Moreover, the maximum loan amount for the salary clients of the Agricultural Bank increased to 2 million rubles, and for all the rest - up to 1 million rubles. </p><p>  It is strange that collateral does not reduce the minimum interest rate on a loan: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Secured consumer loan" class="if uuid-2636626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2636626.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, you will need to confirm your ownership of the collateral.  Also be prepared to insure it in favor of the bank. </p><p>  Another significant difference is that a secured loan can be obtained from the age of 18. </p><p>  Otherwise, the requirements for the documents provided and for the borrower are the same as for a regular consumer loan. </p><h2>  Consumer Refinancing Loan </h2><p>  Russian Agricultural Bank offers to repay your existing loans at the expense of a new, on more favorable terms.  Moreover, you will have to pay less and in one place, which is convenient.  Thus, the Agricultural Bank is ready to issue up to 3 million rubles.  Moreover, part of this amount can be received in cash and spent on current needs. </p><p>  Imagine that you have 3 active loans for 500 thousand rubles with an average annual rate of 20%.  This is not much even today, if you are not a salary client of the bank, do not have a positive credit history and do not work in the public sector.  And 2-3 years ago one could only dream of such an interest rate. </p><p>  Suppose you regularly pay them for 2 years.  You took all the loans for 5 years and chose an annuity payment.  Thus, in a month you pay approximately 16,700 rubles.  Let's calculate what your payment will be after refinancing.  We again turn to the calculator on the official page of the Agricultural Bank: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Consumer loan refinancing" class="if uuid-2636629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2636629.jpg"></div><p>  The screenshot shows that even in the most unfavorable situation, you will receive a loan at 16% per annum.  And your monthly payment will be equal to 15,000 rubles. </p><p>  And you still take 500 thousand rubles, but you already paid some part of this amount - you can manage this money at your own discretion.  Let's say you buy the same TV or go somewhere - relax. </p><p>  And if you meet the additional criteria of the bank, then the difference is even more noticeable - you get a loan at 10%, and pay only 12 500 rubles per month (this is the maximum payment with a differentiated payment system, do not forget that it will be less every next month): </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="How to refinance a consumer loan" class="if uuid-2636628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2636628.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, it is profitable to refinance (transfer old loans into one).  And not only for the bank - it receives a obviously solvent client, but also for the borrower. </p><h2>  What will have to face in practice? </h2><p>  Not everything is as smooth as we would like.  To take advantage of this offer, you will need a perfect credit history.  In addition, in the past there should be no cases of extension of loan agreements or the so-called ‚Äúcredit holidays‚Äù - when the borrower, in agreement with the bank, takes a break due to his difficult financial situation. </p><p>  In this lending program, the main criterion for the bank is your ability to fulfill your obligations without any problems. </p><p>  The second point - you will not receive 3 million rubles if you are not a payroll client of the Agricultural Bank for the past 6 months.  For the rest, the maximum limit remains standard - 750 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Moreover, when determining it, only those incomes that came precisely to the accounts of the Agricultural Bank are taken into account.  And these incomes themselves must be at least 2 times higher than the monthly loan payment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="healthcareinamerica.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="getting a loan" class="if uuid-2637856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2637856.jpg"></div><h2>  Inappropriate consumer loan secured by housing </h2><p>  Rosselkhozbank is ready to provide considerable money secured by housing - up to 10 million rubles (but not more than 50% of the assessed value of the collateral).  Moreover, the interest rate ranges from 12.5 to 17 percent per annum - depending on the category of the borrower.  The minimum amount of such a loan is 100 thousand rubles.  But the term is also increased - up to 10 years. </p><p>  The offer will be beneficial for you if the property has large assets (the only housing cannot serve as a pledge, an exception is a mortgage) and you need a large amount - over 750 thousand rubles for a long period - more than 5 years. </p><p>  Otherwise, a regular consumer loan will cost less - include in the costs and insurance costs for the object transferred as collateral.  For comparison, we again turn to the calculator: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Secured by real estate" class="if uuid-2636630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2636630.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, under ideal conditions, the rate on this loan is still higher - 12.5% ‚Äã‚Äãversus 12% on a regular consumer loan. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  The bank offers the best conditions for consumer credit to its payroll clients working in the public sector and having a positive credit history.  For them - the rate of 12% per annum, the maximum amount - 1.5 million rubles, the loan term - up to 7 years. </p><p>  If you need a larger amount - up to 10 million rubles, you will have to pledge real estate.  Then the loan term can be increased up to 10 years. </p><p>  Under other conditions, the borrower has only one option - to take a consumer loan at the Agricultural Bank on general terms - up to 750 thousand rubles, at 20% per annum, for a period of up to 5 years. </p><p>  Honestly fulfill all obligations during the first 12 months, and you can refinance in a year.  Then the interest rate will be minimal - 10% per annum.  And the amount can be increased to 3 million rubles. </p><p>  Is it possible to take a loan from Russian Agricultural Bank with bad credit history?  It is unlikely that this bank is very sensitive to the solvency of its customers.  Better to try your luck elsewhere. </p>
