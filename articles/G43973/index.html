    <p>  In fact, this hotel complex is popular due to its location.  After all, Simena Hotel 5 is located in a small village called Camyuva, where you can relax and enjoy the peace of nature.  On the other hand, if you suddenly get bored with the silence of the countryside, you can always visit the world famous tourist city of Kemer, the distance to which is ten kilometers.  You can get to the city with its bustling markets, chic restaurants and fun nightclubs by public transport or taxi.  By the way, some tourists prefer to rent scooters or motorbikes in the city - this facilitates movement around the area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the airport, it is located much further - the distance to Antalya is 65 kilometers.  The hotel provides its guests with an airport shuttle.  It will take about 1.5 hours. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the Simena Hotel and Simena Hotel Holiday Village 5 hotels are parts of the same hotel complex.  These hotels have a common restaurant, infrastructure and office building. </p><p>  Simena Hotel 5 (Kemer) was built in 1999.  The last major overhaul on its territory was carried out in 2005 - all rooms are equipped with modern technology, and the design is convenient and stylish.  The area is 45 thousand square meters.  But the Simena Hotel Villas 5 opened its doors to tourists a year earlier, in 1998.  The last thorough restoration of all the premises was carried out in 2006.  By the way, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis hotel is 125 thousand square meters. </p><p>  Do not worry about the vast territory, as you and your things will be delivered by car directly to the room immediately after registration. </p><h2>  Description of the hotel complex and its infrastructure </h2>

    <p>  It is worth noting immediately that both hotels are located next to each other - only the route separates them.  Each of them has a very impressive territory, which through the efforts of designers turned into a picturesque park.  There are swimming pools, sports fields, and long well-groomed walking paths.  And the sea landscape is decorated with palm trees, figured bushes and bright exotic plants. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Hotel Simena Hotel 5 (Kemer, Camyuva) is a large five-story building, in which the main rooms are located.

    <p>  Of course, the hotel complex Simena Hotel 5 (Kemer) has its own section of the beach, which is available exclusively for hotel guests.  The length of the beach strip is about 100 meters.  On the beach you can enjoy the warm waves and soft sand under your feet.  There is also a wooden pier 40 meters long.  Descent into the sea is covered with pebbles. </p><p>  You can walk to the beach from the hotel in 10‚Äì20 minutes, depending on where your room is located.  For example, Simena Hotel Village 5 is located a little further from the coast: in order to get to the water, you will have to cross the transport route (car traffic is not too intense here), and also go through the territory of the neighboring Simena Hotel.  If you don‚Äôt feel like walking, you can always wait for transport - a bus runs between the hotel and the beach at half an hour intervals. </p><p>  The beach itself is always clean, well maintained and equipped to all standards.  Of course, there are comfortable changing cabins.  A little further from the coast, comfortable sun loungers with umbrellas are arranged in even rows.  By the way, sun loungers can be missed only if both hotels are fully populated - in such cases you have to get to the beach early.  The hotel offers clean towels.  There is also a small bar where visitors are offered chilled drinks and light snacks. </p><h2>  Water sports and beach activities </h2><p>  Swimming in the clear waters and enjoying the sunshine is a pleasure in itself.  But the Simena Hotel 5 offers its residents and many other opportunities to have a great time.  To begin with, it is worth mentioning that at least twice a day there are playful competitions in beach volleyball - here one of the animators always works with the players, which helps everyone to get to know each other and acts as a judge.  There are plenty of other entertainments - some of them are included in the price, while others require an additional fee. </p><p>  For example, here you will be offered canoeing and catamarans.  You can also go windsurfing (there is a rental point for boards and other accessories).  In addition, you can go water skiing or take a dizzying parachute ride after the boat. </p><p>  There is also a fully equipped diving center on the beach.  People with experience in underwater walks can rent the necessary equipment here.  Those guests who do not know how to scuba dive can take training courses here and finally enjoy the unique and exciting beauty of the underwater world.  Of course, such services are not too cheap, but a walk in the waters of the Mediterranean Sea is worth every dollar spent. </p><h2>  Entertainment and wellness treatments for tourists </h2>
