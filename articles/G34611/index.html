    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Miraggio Thermal SPA Resort 5 * is located in Halkidiki.  This place is a recognized pearl of Northern Greece.  Halkidiki is famous for its pristine beaches, most of which are awarded the EU Blue Flag.  And there is incredibly beautiful nature.  Halkidiki is an evergreen paradise in Greece. </p><p>  The hotel is located here.  And to be more precise, on the beach in a village called Paliouri.  The place is very successful - after all, in 15-20 minutes you can reach the villages of Hanioti and Pefkohori, where life is in full swing.  True, there is one drawback to this place.  To the airport far - go more than 100 kilometers.  Ho, in principle, this is an insignificant drawback, because guests do not need to go there twice a day.  Moreover, you can always use the transfer. </p><p>  And yet, this complex is completely new.  After all, its opening took place in May 2016, just a couple of months ago.  And it has already become popular in advance, because this hotel belongs to the Med Sea Health group.  Not surprisingly, a few days after the opening of the hotel there were no empty rooms.  Indeed, many people want to relax in Greece in the summer, and then a new hotel has opened, which means an additional option has appeared.  And very good. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  In Miraggio Thermal SPA Resort 5 * you will not get bored.

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Finally, a few words about which Miraggio Thermal SPA Resort 5 * reviews receive.  They are mostly positive.  First of all, guests praise the service.  Here he is really great.  The staff is trying so hard to please its guests that even at times it becomes awkward.  The guests say - you do not have time to bathe in the bathroom yet, and the maids are already knocking on the door with a proposal to change the towel for a fresh one. </p><p>  The hotel is new - it opened in the spring of this year, 2016, so everything in it is modern, clean and working properly, which cannot but rejoice.  In addition, everything is very stylish and beautiful - aesthetics and connoisseurs of beauty will like it. </p><p>  Guests also share their impressions about how well thought out the building itself.  The buildings are built with an amphitheater, so that from the windows of each room offers a view that pleases the eye.  The hotel has few free apartments (the hotel quickly became popular), but there is no feeling of crowding.  This is because the territory is large - everyone is comfortable, and everyone can find a corner of privacy for themselves. </p><p>  Tourists also say that there is a really good SPA-center - half a day in it you can spend unnoticed.  And it is worth doing it, since the pleasure is indescribable. </p><p>  A lot of people with children of different ages come to the hotel, so it is quite noisy because of this.  But if lovers of peace and tranquility want to relax here, then you should go to the hotel in the fall.  Firstly, there may be good discounts out of season.  Secondly, few people come here with children in the fall.  And thirdly, in principle, there are fewer tourists, since everyone has vacations mainly in the summer.  Therefore, if possible, you should go here in the fall.  Pleasant experiences are provided. </p>
