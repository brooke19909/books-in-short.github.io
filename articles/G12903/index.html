Greece beaches for children</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  "Good beach" is a concept, of course, relative and subjective.  Some people like pebbles, others like sand.  Although it is still possible to isolate some parameters by which the beach is considered one of the best.  This is a clear transparent sea, cleaned coastal cover without sharp stones and broken shell rock, beautiful landscapes around, shading and developed tourist infrastructure (dressing booths, fresh shower).  That’s probably all.  Further opinions differ.  Give surfers a high wave, to parents with young children - a gentle entry into the sea, divers - reefs and depths, lovers of noisy entertainment - “bananas”, water scooters and parakiting.  Here we tried to describe the good beaches of Greece.  This state every year falls into the top three of the best countries in the world in terms of resort infrastructure development.  The country has more than 400 good beaches.  Let's look at the best. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nice beaches of Greece" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/462354.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bay "Balos" </h2><p>  In the rating "good <span>beaches of Greece"</span> Balos Beach is confidently leading.  This unique place is located off the west coast of Crete.  The road there is difficult, and at times obstruction resembles a movie about Indiana Jones.  But perhaps because of this, the beach "Balos" and retained its virgin purity.  The uniqueness of this place is that at this point three seas merge.  Amazing combinations of all shades of blue and green are emphasized by cliffs overgrown with pines and cypresses.  Near the coast is an islet of Gramvousa with an ancient pirate fortress.  In addition to breathtaking stories about a treasure buried somewhere here, one can personally observe sea turtles that crawl out to bask on the sand of a beach.  By its beauty, Balos is compared to Santorini.  Here the crowned persons of Great Britain, Charles and Diana spent their <span>honeymoon</span> .  It is best to get here by boat from Kavonisi Kissamos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece photo beaches" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/462355.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Elafonisos Island </h2><p>  Do not confuse this stretch of land off the southern coast of the Peloponnese with the beach of the same name in Crete.  The name "Elafonisos" translates as "Deer Island."  Animals have not been here for a long time, but there are many tourists, especially in the "high" season.  The island has such good beaches in Greece, such as Sarakiniko, Simos and Panagia.  Deer Island is convenient in that it is not so far from the capital, so on weekends the density of vacationers there doubles.  But this Elafonisos is completely unfamiliar to the Russian tourist, unlike his Cretan counterpart. </p><h2>  Navagio </h2><p>  This southern country is usually advertised on postcards, posters and booklets by the beautiful beaches of Greece.  And even if you have never been to this blessed republic of God, you probably already saw the Navagio.  The beach is as popular as Santorini.  It is located on the island of Zakynthos (Russian tourists used to call it Zakynthos).  This is one of the most beautiful beaches in the world.  But to get here, as on the "Balos", you can only in the boat.  Perhaps the beach owes this circumstance to its unclouded beauty.  Therefore, fans of water scooters, rides on the "bananas" and other motor types of water activities, please do not worry.  Navagio does not have all of this, but otherwise the tourism infrastructure is well developed there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Greece" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/462356.jpg" width="499"></div>

The shallow and calm sea, the coast completely devoid of any stones, excellent service - lifeguards, showers, equipment rental make Elafonisos desirable for families with kids.  The sand here is amazing: pink like marshmallows.  They say it brings winds directly from the Sahara.  After all, this large African desert lies exactly opposite the southern coast of Crete.  The only disadvantage of the beach is its distance from noisy resorts and the lack of natural shade.  Be sure to bring a sun umbrella with you.  The road to Elafonisos is long, but very picturesque.  You can have lunch in a neighboring village.  Not far from the "Deer" beach is located and "Balos" - number one in our rating. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful beaches of Greece" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/462357.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Egremni </h2><p>  This is the whitest beach.  Greece has many of them, but in a recent ranking of the most beautiful coasts of the world, Egremni has taken one of the leading positions.  And it was the only one representing the resort area.  This is rather strange: after all, few people know about Egremni.  All the more sophisticated is the audience going to this beach.  All are young and healthy people.  Still - to overcome about a thousand steps down, going down from the chalk cliffs, and then as many up - not everyone can do it.  But the reward for hard physical trials will be the turquoise sea and white as snow and soft sand like velvet.  There is only one small cafe on the beach, but the food there is simply divine.  The beach, due to its inaccessibility, is never crowded.  He is preferred by romantic natures.  This ideal location in all senses is located just thirty kilometers south of Lefkada.  From the hotels of this resort you can recommend The Aigli Hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece beaches for children" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/462358.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Myrtos </h2><p>  Several years ago, Greece itself, whose photos of beaches make up its best reputation, recognized this region as the country's most beautiful coast.  And that means something!  This paradise is located on the west coast of Kefalonia.  Myrtos really captivates the imagination.  Turquoise water is so transparent that even at a depth of 5-7 meters each pebble is visible.  The surrounding landscape with pine trees, the air, drunk with aromas of needles, as if says: <span>"This is the quintessence of the</span> Greek idyll."  This is probably why Mirtos has become an upscale for the filming of Captain Corelli's Choice.  But mines, like in a movie, here, of course, do not explode.  On this embodiment of the dream of Hellas you can relax for all categories of tourists, but most of all here you will like calm or romantic natures. </p><h2>  Finikas </h2><p>  The small island of Pano Koufonisi in the Cyclades archipelago has something to surprise guests.  Good beaches in Greece are associated primarily with parties and discos.  You can recommend "Mykonos", it’s not a rarity there, but a pleasant pattern.  However, everyone gives a head start to "Finikas", or according to the name of a nearby town, Preveli.  Having crossed a narrow road, winding among the rocks, and then walking down a steep slope, you will find yourself in paradise.  If you are not in that physical condition to ride on steep cliffs, you can get to the Phoenix by boat.  In this Eden, a mountain river flows into the <span>Libyan Sea</span> , forming a small bay.  A cliff rises near the shore, outlines resembling a heart.  If you come to Greece to spend your honeymoon, then you are definitely here.  A grove of date palms creates a natural shadow.  The breeze accelerates the summer heat.  And the rastamans, basking under the palm trees of this oasis, only emphasize the relaxing and romantic atmosphere of this place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="White beach greece" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/462370.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Super Paradis </h2><p>  Those who associate <span>holidays in Greece</span> with parties and discos can recommend Mykonos.  This is not an island, but a continuous ongoing party.  There are very few Russian tourists here.  But the rest is going to a very motley audience.  It is believed that "Mykonos" - a place of elite relaxation.  North coasts are preferred by surfers.  And the beach of Super Paradise was chosen by nudists.  The very name "Paradise" suggests that people want to feel like Adam and Eve in the garden of bliss.  Following the nudists, representatives of sexual minorities come to Paradise.  So here you can easily see two Adams or a couple of Eve.  On the narrow paths of the "Mykonos" you can only move on scooters.  And the rest of the tourism infrastructure is well developed.  The little Mykonos is even called Ibiza Greece. </p>
