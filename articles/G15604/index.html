To diversify the interior and not use factory products, you can make a towel yourself.  This option will be ideal for children, as you can recreate any sketch, give the textile any shape, use your favorite color scheme of the crumbs. </p><h2>  Suitable textiles for a good product </h2><p>  According to the standard scheme, mahr is exclusively used for the manufacture of a toilet item, if this is an option for the bathroom, and cotton is used for the kitchen ‚Äúassistant‚Äù.  Ideally, a homemade hand towel can be made from almost any material, it is enough to determine the functional responsibilities of the subject: </p><ul><li>  In any case, it is desirable that the textiles be pleasant to the touch and absorb moisture well.  It is better if the tissue will have a slight hairiness in order to massage the skin. </li><li>  The quality of the fabric should be high so that the finished product does not look like a kitchen rag.  Moreover, an item made of good fabric will last longer. </li><li>  The material should not contain drawings that are made of rubber, textile paints.  An ideal option would be embroidery. </li><li>  It is undesirable to use products that have sequins, pebbles, glass elements, rhinestones, sparkles.  Such jewelry can injure hands during use or carry on the surface of the skin. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="crazylittleprojects.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="one type of towel fabric" class="if uuid-2976449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2976449.jpg"></div><p>  The choice of color and texture can be made in accordance with the preferences or requirements of the needlewoman. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Optimal sizes for a homemade option </h2><p>  Hand towel sizes can be selected according to need.  Lack of or overstepping a few centimeters in the length or width of the product will not affect the appearance or functionality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing towels" class="if uuid-2976443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2976443.jpg"></div><p>  There are certain standards regarding the parameters that are used in the process of sewing towels in factories.  The kitchen version according to the standard has a length of 60 cm and a width of 30 cm. The product intended for the bathroom has the following parameters: 50 cm by 70 cm. </p><p>  A homemade option can have a rectangular, square, triangular or round shape.  Features of the formation of parameters will be the hallmark of a homemade towel with unique data. </p><h2>  How to decorate the towel with which you wipe your hands? </h2><p>  Original and beautiful towels with their own hands are obtained only if many nuances have been taken into account in relation to the decoration of such a product.  Excess can not only spoil the appearance of the towel, but also harm, injuring the skin.  Therefore, it is worth using specific decoration methods: </p><ul><li>  The edges of the finished product can be trimmed with lace from a natural material. </li><li>  Applique and patchwork will also become relevant options for decorating towels. </li><li>  Unique decor will be the original holder, which is fixed on a hanger or hook. </li><li>  Embroidery is the easiest and most standard way of decorating textiles. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="sites.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="original product design" class="if uuid-2976425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2976425.jpg"></div><p>  You can use several decoration options within the same product.  The main thing is not to overdo it with special effects. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of a kitchen towel </h2><p>  When creating kitchen towels with your own hands, you should know several features of this type of product.  In the kitchen, towels made of waffle fabric are usually used to wipe hands.  The fabric itself is a completely natural cotton.  You can not use artificial fibers, as in the kitchen there is a huge probability of ignition of textiles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="creamerchronicles.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="homemade kitchen towels" class="if uuid-2976439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2976439.jpg"></div><p>  The dimensions of the kitchen version of the product can be completely different if the thing is made independently.  The pattern on the waffle fabric is usually formed from natural paints, therefore it does not pose a threat to health and skin of the hands. </p><p>  The best option is a short terry.  It is advisable to use a natural sample material without additional flammable decoration elements.  In the kitchen, simplicity is the key to safety. </p><p>  The principle of manufacturing the product is the same as when creating a towel for the bathroom. </p><h2>  How to make a towel pattern? </h2><p>  Before you make a towel with your own hands, it is worth deciding on the type of material.  Then a pattern is prepared in accordance with the selected shape and size of the product.  The pattern is formed as follows: </p><ol><li>  Unfold the cloth from which the towel will be made. </li><li>  Using chalk, draw a sketch of the future product, taking into account the size and shape. </li><li>  Sharp scissors cut the sketch. </li><li>  Using safety pins, fix the tucked edges. </li></ol><p>  Creating a towel pattern is a simple job for even an inexperienced seamstress. </p><h2>  Manual manufacturing </h2><p>  After the pattern is prepared, it is worth processing the edges of the workpiece.  If you do not perform such a manipulation, then the edges will begin to fray, which will lead to complete damage to things.  Hand towels can be processed according to one of three scenarios: </p><ol><li>  Manually overcast the edges that were rotated during the creation of the pattern. </li><li>  Sew the edges with a sewing machine using a regular or decorative overcast stitch. </li><li>  You can trim the edges with tape or lace.  The principle of fixing a decorative element is determined by the capabilities of the needlewoman: manually or on a sewing machine. </li></ol><p>  When processing one of the corners, you should immediately consider the option of creating an unusual holder.  A volumetric figure can be formed from the towel‚Äôs cloth itself, each detail of which is fixed with a needle and thread.  It is worth considering the option of a loop for a hook. </p><div class="photo" data-original="buttonsgaloreandmore.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="finishes" class="if uuid-2976446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2976446.jpg"></div><p>  If there are no ideas regarding sewing, then you can use the photo of towels with your own hands, which were created by more experienced craftswomen.  In this case, the workshops will help to understand some of the nuances regarding the decoration of the edges of the fabric. </p><h2>  Baby towel to be used for hands </h2><p>  Children often do not like to wash their hands.  But this problem can be easily solved if you provide your baby with a beautiful towel for wiping hands after the procedure.  A baby hand towel should meet several important criteria: </p><ol><li>  The fabric should be of good quality, natural and soft to the touch. </li><li>  Dimensions should match the capabilities and needs of the child. </li><li>  Appearance is of particular importance for the baby, so it is worth considering the design to the smallest detail. </li><li>  The product should be convenient for use by the baby. </li><li>  It is desirable that the fabric was a bright color, but did not fade when interacting with water. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="crazylittleprojects.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="baby hand towel" class="if uuid-2976444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2976444.jpg"></div><p>  All these recommendations are easy to consider if you sew a towel for your child yourself.  The quality of such a product will be a level higher than any production.  A thing can be made unique by considering an original design.  For example, you can decorate a towel with embroidery or applique with the image of your favorite fairy-tale hero. </p>
