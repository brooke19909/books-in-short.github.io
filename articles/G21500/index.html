    <h2>  History of Attraction </h2><p>  In 1716, construction began on a summer residence (intended for the famous commander - Prince Eugene of Savoy) under the name Belvedere.  Vienna was very proud of its hero, who made a huge contribution to the fight against the Turkish troops.  And the construction was to correspond to the high status of the latter.  Translated from the Austrian, "belvedere" means "beautiful view."  The palace owes its name to its location on a hillside, which offers breathtaking views of the city and <span>St. Stephen's Cathedral.</span>  The main architect of this building was Lucas von Hildebrandt. </p><p>  Initially, it was planned to build only one palace, which later became known as the Lower Belvedere.  In this building, as already mentioned, the prince of Savoy was supposed to spend time in the summer.  However, a year later, it was decided to erect a second palace, intended for official receptions.  It was located opposite the first building and was called the Upper Belvedere. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Change of ownership and further history </h2><p>  As you know, Eugene of Savoy had no children.  After the death of the prince, his Belvedere (Vienna) was bought by Anna Victoria.  A few years later, the palace again changed its owner.  This time, Empress <span>Maria Theresa</span> became her mistress <span>,</span> who planned to place a royal collection of art here.  She realized her idea, and in 1779 ordered to open palaces and adjoining gardens for visiting by the general public.  At the end of the 19th century, the collection stored in the Belvedere was moved to the Austrian Museum of Art and History, specially built for this purpose. </p><p>  What is the fate of Belvedere Castle?  Vienna in 1918 received it in municipal ownership, and the complex was given the status of a museum.  The basis for this was the collection of paintings, statues and other masterpieces owned by Prince Eugene of Savoy.  After all, he was not only a talented commander, but also a passionate patron of the arts, who during his life has put together an impressive collection of sculptures and paintings from different parts of Europe. </p><p>  In 1955, the Belvedere (Vienna) played an important role in the life of the whole country.  Indeed, it was within its walls that the Declaration proclaiming the independence of Austria was signed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today, the former residence is visited annually by thousands of tourists from different countries.  In the same palace complex is the Austrian National Gallery. </p>

    <h2>  Lower belvedere </h2><p>  As we have already mentioned, the complex consists of two palaces and a garden.  So, in the Lower Belvedere several centuries ago, the apartments of the Prince of Savoy were located.  Up to now, a luxurious original setting with an impressive collection of paintings and sculptures has been preserved here.  Walking around the palace, you can look into the prince's bedroom, dining room, Mirror Hall and the Golden Cabinet.  The Real Pearl of the Lower Belvedere can be called the Marble Hall, which is decorated with stucco bas-reliefs, statues and frescoes depicting the Prince of Savoy in the image of Apollo.  The Grotesque Hall also deserves attention.  It is decorated in the ancient Roman style, and there you can see amazing sculptures with distorted faces. </p><p>  In general, the Lower Belvedere is a museum of <span>baroque, sculpture</span> and painting in Austria 17-18 centuries.  Nearby are the palace stables, where today is a museum of Austrian art from the Middle Ages.  Also near the Lower Belvedere there is a magnificent greenhouse, which presents a huge variety of alpine flora. </p>

    <h2>  Upper Belvedere </h2><p>  Upper Belvedere Palace majestically rises on the top of a slope in the southern part of the park.  Visitors are greatly impressed by its richly decorated facades with a large number of sculptures that embody the victory over the Turks, a huge contribution to which was made by the first owner of the palace - Prince of Savoy. </p><p>  As for the interior decoration, due to the fact that the halls were actively used until the middle of the last century, the original interior was hardly preserved here.  Today in the Lower Belvedere you can admire the collection of Austrian art of the XIX-XX centuries, represented by the works of Monet, Van Gogh, Schiele, Kokoschka, Renoir, Klimt. </p><h2>  Garden </h2><p>  The area between the palaces is occupied by a magnificent garden.  It has three levels, which are separated from each other by two large cascades, decorated with beautiful sculptures. </p>
