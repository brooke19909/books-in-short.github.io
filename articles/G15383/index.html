Moreover, not only Antalya is in demand, but also other nearby resorts, on which deluxe hotel complexes have been built in the past few years, for example, Marti Myra Hotel Kemer 5 * in the elite village of Tekirova.  It is no coincidence that wealthy people come here to rest, preferring comfort and silence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marti Myra Hotel Kemer 5 *" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2004646.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kemer - the pearl of the Mediterranean </h2><p>  Not all villages of this resort are expensive, like Tekirova, where there is just a giant five-star Marti Myra Hotel.  Its history goes back almost 30 years.  It‚Äôs even hard to believe that these chic shores, designed by God for a beach holiday, were deserted not so long ago.  Today, here and there, among the greenery of gardens and parks, the roofs of hotels are dotted.  The village is not as crowded as in Antalya, but you can enjoy real peace and get relaxation.  From time to time, families of wealthy Russians come here.  Turks are hospitable people, and in order to please guests from the Russian Federation, they accept Russian-speaking as employees for hotels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The village of Tekirova </h2><p>  As already noted, one of the best villages in Kemer is Tekirova.  Marti Myra Hotel 5 * is located in it, it occupies a vast coastal zone.  It has a great climate, not very humid, not asphyxiating and not very hot.  All in moderation.  The swimming season lasts from May to October, although even at the beginning of winter the temperature of the water does not drop below 19 degrees, so that daredevils can swim in the sea, while in other parts of the northern coast of the Mediterranean Sea this definitely will not work. </p><p>  Anyone who has already managed to visit various sections of the Turkish coast will immediately note that Tekirova is a special resort, it is really elite, and therefore attracts wealthier tourists.  Describing it, many use the word paradise.  It is located at the farthest distance from Antalya, which means fuss.  The local landscapes are <span>beautiful</span> : the <span>azure sea</span> adjoins a strip of light sand, then there are hotels, followed by pine forests and orange gardens, which fill the whole district with their aroma. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marti Myra Hotel" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2004647.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The coastal zone of the Marty Mira Hotel is semi-sandy.  On the beach, as already noted, there is a bar that you can use for free.  Sun loungers and umbrellas are provided to tourists free of charge, but VIP zones - tents - they are paid.  A platform adjoins the shore for easier access to the sea, there is also a pier on which pillows and chairs are placed. </p><h2>  Marti Myra Hotel: traveler reviews </h2><p>  This hotel is a great example of five star accommodation.  Getting on its territory, it seems that you are in a paradise.  Among the comments about the Marty Mira Hotel, someone compares its territory with a pioneer camp, in the best sense.  Certainly, such thoughts are evoked by perennial fur pines and cedars, which can be seen on the Crimean peninsula.  There are overwhelmingly positive reviews about Marti Myra Hotel 5, but you can find some negative ones.  For example, tourists from Russia complain about the lack of variety in food, especially breakfast.  However, as you understand, in Turkey, even in hotels of a lower category, there is never a problem with food. </p><p>  Other tourists complain about the poor internet in the rooms.  This is a more plausible "accusation", but as you know, this often happens in coastal areas.  Otherwise, tourists in different ways praise the hospitality of the staff, and the magnificent interiors, and the landscapes that can be found on the vast territory of the hotel, and the gentle sea. </p>
