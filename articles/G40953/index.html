Acer Liquid E700 (Black) Smartphone Reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A stylish 5-inch smartphone with the ability to install three SIM cards is the <span>Acer Liquid E700.</span>  Reviews <strong> </strong>  owners of the device, its technical and software specifications - this is what will be examined in detail in the framework of this material.  Moreover, all of the above mostly relates to the black version of this device.  There is also a red modification, which in practice is not so often seen.  Therefore, it makes little sense to focus on it.  Moreover, its filling is identical, but the color of the case itself leads to the fact that the phone quickly loses its original appearance.  And this is his main drawback.  The only case when the red color of the case is preferable is when such a device is purchased for a woman or girl.  As a result, the most often found version of this smartphone in a black case. </p>

    <h2>  What segment is the smartphone focused on? </h2><p>  The key feature of this device is the ability to install three SIM cards at once.  That is, it allows you to work simultaneously with three mobile networks.  And both the second and third generation.  The need for such a number of SIM cards can arise when a subscriber seeks to minimize his expenses for mobile communications, for example, or when one of them is used for conversations, the second for connecting to the Internet, and the third for travel sim.  It is in such cases that the Acer Liquid E700 black will be indispensable.  Reviews this nuance and highlight in the hardware specifications of the device.  If you need a smartphone with just two SIM cards, then you can find a cheaper device with similar technical parameters.  Therefore, this Acer phone is aimed specifically at those who need a gadget with three slots for installing "SIM cards."  In all other cases, the purchase of this device is not justified. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Delivery list </h2><p>  The phone at the time of its release belonged to the middle class of devices, but at the moment it belongs to the initial segment of mobile phones.  All due to the fact that more advanced models appeared on the market, which are built on the basis of more efficient processor solutions.  Well, the E700 has moved to budget gadgets.  As a result, he cannot boast of something unusual in terms of configuration.  The list of accessories and components that are available in the box with the Acer Liquid E700 E39 Triple SIM is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Cable "USB". </li><li>  Stereo headset. </li><li>  AC adapter to charge the built-in battery. </li><li>  Manual for configuration and operation.

    </li></ul><p>  In the list above, there is clearly not enough <span>protective film</span> for the front panel and cover.  The case of the device is completely made of plastic and additional protection for it will obviously not be superfluous.  Moreover, getting such accessories is not so simple.  Another component that is not in the box is a memory card.  And his absence is not so critical.  The capacity of the built-in drive is 16 GB, and this is enough for comfortable work.  That is, you can do without an external drive, which in this case is a microSD memory card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The standard all-in-one with touch input is the Acer Liquid E700 Black.  Reviews indicate that in terms of design, this smart phone certainly cannot boast of anything unusual.  On the other hand, you can‚Äôt expect anything more from the entry-level gadget.  On its front panel is a display with a diagonal of 5 inches.  A 2MP front camera is displayed above the screen.  There is also a speaker and LED backlight for the <span>front camera.</span>  So the "selfie" on this gadget can be done at any time of the day or night.  Near the backlight, the holes of the light and proximity sensors are displayed.  At the bottom, under the display, there is a typical control panel of three touch buttons and an additional speaker for loud conversations.  The conversation microphone is displayed on the lower edge of the device, and on the upper side there is an audio port and a lock button.  A swing to control the volume of the smart phone is on the right edge.  There is also a microUSB format port.  On the back cover, in addition to the manufacturer‚Äôs logo, you can find the main camera with a single LED backlight, a noise reduction microphone and the Acer Rapid function key.  It can be programmed to run any application or perform various operations.  Moreover, short-term pressing it can perform one action, and prolonged - the second. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Acer Liquid E700 is built on a very modest central processor.  Reviews indicate its low level of performance.  We are talking about the MT6582 chip.  It consists of four ‚ÄúA7‚Äù computing modules, each of which is capable of overclocking to 1.3 GHz in peak computing mode.  This CPU has been on the market for a long time and has managed to prove itself from the best side.  But until recently, devices based on it belonged to the middle class, but now, after the release of a number of new processor devices, they already belong to entry-level gadgets.  On the other hand, its performance is quite enough to solve a wide range of tasks.  This is watching videos, reading books, surfing Internet resources using a browser, listening to radio and music.  And even such resource-intensive 3D toys as Real Racing 3 or Asphalt 8 will go on this smart phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The only thing that needs to be noted regarding them is that their settings will be far from maximum.  Well, you don‚Äôt have to expect more from a budget smartphone. </p><h2>  Graphics and its features </h2><p>  As noted earlier, the diagonal of the display is in the Acer Liquid E700 5 ‚Äù.  Reviews highlight this feature of this device.  It is based on a high-quality IPS matrix with a resolution of 720x1280.  There is no air gap between the <span>touch panel</span> and the screen surface.  Due to this, the viewing angles of the display of this device are as close as possible to 180 degrees and the image quality is almost perfect.  Also, there are no comments regarding contrast, color reproduction and brightness.  Everything is perfectly tuned and balanced.  Well, the central link in the graphics subsystem in this case is Mali-400MP2.  The performance level of this video accelerator corresponds to the MT6582 CPU, and it is precisely its presence that allows you to run such demanding toys on this smartphone as Real Racing 3 or Asphalt 8. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The main camera is based on an 8 megapixel sensor in the Acer Liquid E700.  Customer reviews highlight this technical specification.  The developers of the device did not forget about the LED backlight system and autofocus.  This allows you to get panoramic photos of acceptable quality even with a minimum level of illumination.  But when shooting text, especially small ones, it is quite difficult to achieve that the image was legible.  Video with its help can be recorded in Full HD quality with a refresh rate of 30 frames per second.  There is also a front camera in this model of mobile phone.  She has a more modest sensor - at 2 megapixels.  Another important feature of the front camera is the presence of LED backlight.  That is, with its help you can take pictures even in low light conditions.  And this is quite a rarity among entry-level devices.  Otherwise, the capabilities of this camera are quite enough for "selfie" and communication using video calls. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  2 GB of RAM is equipped with a smartphone Acer Liquid E700.  Reviews highlight this important feature.  It is the presence of such a quantity of RAM that allows gadget owners, without fear, to launch various applications.  Most of its competitors with two SIM cards can boast of having only 1 GB, that is, having 2 GB of RAM at once in this case is an indisputable advantage of the device.  Another plus - the capacity of the internal drive in this device is 16 GB.  At the same time, its direct competitors with fewer SIM cards can at best boast only 8 GB, and with a less favorable scenario, there may be even less - 4 GB. </p>

    <p>  Well, the developers did not forget about the microSD format memory card slot.  In this case, you can install an external drive with a maximum capacity of 32 GB.  The presence of 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal flash memory is a serious advantage of this device compared to competitors, because even without a memory card on this device it will be quite comfortable to work. </p><h2>  Smart phone autonomy </h2><p>  An interesting situation was with the battery of the Acer Liquid E700.  Reviews highlight this feature.  The capacity of the built-in battery is 3500 mAh.  On the one hand, this is a pretty good number.  And now, taking into account all the parameters of this gadget, it turns out that with the autonomy of this device, everything is not so good.  He has a processor, albeit energy-efficient, but consists of 4 computing modules.  In addition, it is worth considering the screen with a diagonal of 5 inches and three SIM cards (that is, the device works simultaneously in standby mode with three cellular networks at once).  Therefore, the owners of this smart phone can count on a maximum of 2 days of battery life, and then in the strictest saving mode, in which the device turns into just a "dialer".  If the load is increased, then the indicated time will be reduced to 12 hours (maximum load).  That is, on average, a smartphone on one charge can last 1 day.  The second important nuance associated with autonomy is that the battery is built into the smartphone.  It is difficult to say what the developers were guided by in such a constructive choice, but in the event of a breakdown or ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù of the device, it will be possible to return it to working condition only in the service center.  Well, if the gadget is under warranty and you solve this problem for free.  But after the warranty period ends, each such repair will result in additional costs for the maintenance of the device. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  Smartphone Acer Liquid E700 E39 Triple SIM Black is equipped with all the necessary transmitters to exchange information with the outside world.  The main two of them are Wai-Fai and 3Zh.  They provide high speed information and allow you to upload files of any size.  There is also support for 2nd generation cellular networks, but in this case the speed is significantly reduced - you can only chat on social networks or view simple Internet resources.  Another important wireless interface is the Bluetooth.  The radius of its action is relatively small, but it is indispensable in cases where you need to connect a wireless stereo headset to the gadget or exchange small files with a similar device.  But the presence of GPS and A-GPS allows you to turn this smartphone with a diagonal of 5 inches into a full-fledged ZHPS navigator.  Wired <span>information transfer</span> methods in this device are represented by microUSB ports and a 3.5-mm audio port. </p>

    <h2>  Owners opinion </h2><p>  A good entry-level phone with support for three SIM cards turned out Acer Liquid E700 E39 Triple SIM Black.  Reviews of its hardware and software parameters confirm this.  Certain complaints were caused by the firmware of the gadget and the main camera.  In the first case, updates have already been released that completely corrected this drawback.  But to solve the problem with the camera so easily does not work.  But this minus is offset by a modest price of $ 240. </p>

    <p>  But the advantages of this device are much greater: a large screen size, 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage capacity, a large battery for 3500 mAh. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Initially, this smartphone manufacturer was estimated at 440 dollars.  But now its price has dropped to $ 250.  Given the configuration, hardware characteristics and software component, this is more than a democratic cost.  Moreover, the device has a well-organized memory subsystem, a large display diagonal and is equipped with three SIM cards slots at once.  The rest of the famous smartphone manufacturers simply do not have analogues of the Acer Liquid E700 Black.  Reviews of this indicate that famous brands do not yet have smart phones with similar functionality. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  If you need a smartphone with support for three SIM cards, then there is no alternative to the Acer Liquid E700.  Reviews confirm this once again.  And this gadget essentially has no competitors to date.  But in all other cases, you can find a cheaper analogue, but with fewer card slots. </p>
