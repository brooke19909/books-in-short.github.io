  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The second signaling system in human life</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p><strong></strong>  The second signaling system is inherent in man and is a system of speech signals, a form of <span>higher nervous activity.</span>  Even I.P. Pavlov put forward the concept of differences in the functioning of the <span>brain of humans</span> and animals.  So, the development of the first signaling system is inherent in animals, since their brain responds only to sound, visual and other stimuli.  In addition to this, a person has the ability to generalize the signals of the first system in a word.  This ability provides a person with the opportunity to navigate in the world around him.  The process of generalization arises as a result of the <span>formation of a system of</span> conditional relationships, and depends on their quantity and nature. </p><p>  Second alarm system <strong> </strong>  formed in the process of evolution under the influence of communication with other people, therefore, the social factor plays an important role here.  So, in human behavior a huge role is played by social reactions. </p><p>  It should be noted that three sections of the cerebral cortex are involved in the formation of speech - the motor analyzer, the auditory and the visual. </p><p>  The <span>auditory analyzer</span> begins to form first <span>,</span> it is located on the back of the left temporal gyrus.  If this department is violated by any pathology, the possibility of perceiving the meanings of words is lost, but the ability to perceive sounds in the form of separate words is preserved.  Since this analyzer is connected with the other two departments by analyzers, the ability to read and write is also lost. </p><p>  The motor analyzer is located in the lower part of the central gyrus.  With its defeat, paralysis of the motor speech muscles occurs, which leads to the loss of the ability to pronounce words. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p><strong></strong>  The second human signaling system is the result of the activity of the cerebral cortex.  Her work is connected with the activity of the <span>first signaling system</span> and receives reinforcement in it, therefore it regulates a person‚Äôs life, controlling his emotions. </p><p>  A speech reproducing device is associated with the formation of links between speech centers and motor zones.  Here <span>motor activity</span> plays <span>an</span> important role <span>,</span> for example, coordinated movements of the fingers.  That is why, developing such coordinated actions, it is possible to accelerate the process of speech formation and development. </p><p>  Can say that <strong></strong>  the second signaling system shows the first signs of its development already in the first year of a person‚Äôs life.  First of all, sensory speech mechanisms are formed that contribute to the perception of words, then motor mechanisms that are associated with the ability to speak develop.  As the cerebral hemispheres mature, the mobility and strength of the nervous processes improve, which contributes to the formation of conditional connections associated with the maturation of associative pathways that connect the cortical centers of the brain.  Also, for the formation of speech, a mature peripheral apparatus is needed - the tongue, the muscles of the lips and larynx, the soft palate and their joint activity.  These organs provide the ability to pronounce articulate sounds, i.e. articulation. </p><p>  Thus, <strong></strong>  the second signaling system does not develop without a developed peripheral apparatus. </p><p>  It is customary to distinguish between external speech, written and internal.  External speech acts as a means of communication between people, it is built in such a way that it is understandable to the listener.  Internal speech is directed at itself; it plays a role in the development of thinking.  Self-awareness and consciousness.  Written speech is expressed in the ability to write and read, it is closely related to internal speech. </p><p>  Thus, <strong></strong>  the first and second signal systems allow the person to perceive the surrounding world through the senses and words.  The development and functioning of the second signaling system is the result of the work of the cerebral cortex, in particular, of its large hemispheres. </p>
