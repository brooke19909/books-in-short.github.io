It turns out that an amazing country can offer not only numerous goods, but also holidays on the sea coast.  According to reviews, rest in China is very interesting.  A stunning country is a mixture of glass monsters of skyscrapers and small houses with sloping roofs. </p><h2>  About Hainan Resort </h2><p>  Hainan is a tropical that belongs to China.  It is also the province of the same name.  The resort island is located on the coastline of 1,500 km.  Its central part is covered with dense forests, there are also plantations of mangoes, coffee, pineapples, coconuts and bananas. </p><p>  The climate of the island is truly unique, due to which the swimming season lasts all year.  In addition, the resort area is very clean.  Local authorities take care of this.  Local laws prohibit the placement of any production within a radius of one hundred kilometers from the resort area.  Currently, China has a good tourism infrastructure.  At local resorts you can not only have a great rest, but also get better.  Local mineral and radon sources have an effective effect on the human body. </p><h2>  Hainan island </h2><p>  The beautiful island of Hainan is a real gem of the country.  Reviews about holidays in China indicate that the country has a lot of interesting things for tourists - beautiful beaches, interesting excursions, entertainment and wellness treatments.  Hainan Island has recently become very popular as a beach and sea resort.  In many ways, the cost of tours depends on what conditions you want to receive, and on the level of the hotel.  The island has built many hotels for every taste.  If you choose a tour, you will probably notice that their cost also depends on which bay the hotel is in, and also on the season.  Tourists can pick up a five-star hotel complex located directly on the sea, or opt for economy class housing. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ssl.c.photoshelter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hainan Resort" class="if uuid-2273254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2273254.jpg"></div><p>  On average, a ticket from Moscow to Hainan, taking into account accommodation in a three-star hotel, will cost from 65 to 100 thousand rubles.  According to reviews about holidays in China, we can conclude that hotels of this level offer a fairly high level of service.  Most of the complexes are equipped with swimming pools and have a beautiful territory with tropical vegetation. </p><p>  If you prefer to relax in a four-star hotel, the cost of the tour ranges from 70 to 140 thousand rubles (for a double room).  On the island, you can also find five-star complexes operating on the All Inclusive system.  Rest in such a hotel costs tourists from 80 to 180 thousand rubles. </p><p>  According to reviews of holidays on the island of Hainan (China), it can be said that travelers, if they have the money, prefer five-star hotels, because in such places they are guaranteed to get a high level of relaxation. </p><h2>  Private apartments </h2><p>  It is worth noting that in Chinese resorts you can rent private apartments.  If tourists plan to spend a long time by the sea, then this is ideal.  A good level apartment per week costs about 30-60 thousand rubles.  Such accommodation is very beneficial for both large companies and families with children.  For a reasonable price you get good conditions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Do I need a visa to stay in Hainan? </h2><p>  According to reviews, a vacation on Hainan has several advantages.  Among them is the ease of obtaining a visa.  Since the island is a special area in which inbound tourism is being developed, a visa can be obtained after arrival directly at the airport.  By the way, for Russians arriving for a period of no more than 15 days, entry without a visa is generally possible. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  According to tourists, vacation in China is always beautiful due to the amazing climate.  The average annual temperature of the region is +24 degrees, and the sea - +26 degrees.  Clear and sunny weather at the resort is observed more than 300 days a year.  The island stretched from south to north for 308 kilometers.  Probably for this reason, the climatic conditions of the northern and southern parts differ from each other.  Sanya has a tropical climate on the south coast of the resort, centered on Sanya.  Throughout the year there is no choking heat and cold.  Cold air masses do not penetrate here because of the mountains.  The open sea is always warm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hindustantimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya Beach" class="if uuid-2273259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2273259.jpg"></div><p>  In the north of the island the climate is subtropical, therefore it is rather hot in summer and cooler in winter (temperature indicators never drop below +18 degrees).  And in February and January fogs are observed.  According to reviews, a vacation in Sanya is always successful.  The southern region of the island is the best place to stay.  The unique climate makes the resort very favorable. </p><h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  According to tourists, vacation in China is remembered for its magnificent beaches.  And there are a lot of them.  Hainan Island is washed by the waters of the South China Sea.  There are numerous bays on its coast.  The largest of them are Yaluvan, Dadonghai and Sanya Bay. </p><p>  It is worth noting that absolutely all the beaches of the resort are public.  But because they are not divided into any types.  So, for example, Yaluvan is a huge single beach, the length of which is more than two kilometers. </p><p>  In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSanya Bay, Europeans and the Chinese themselves rest.  But our compatriots are very few.  According to reviews, a beach holiday in China is incredibly comfortable.  Huge beaches are created for a relaxing holiday. </p><p>  The longest beach on the island is Sanya Bay.  Its length is about 11 kilometers.  It starts from a park called "End of the World", and then passes by hotels, residential buildings, the airport.  It ends at the Phoenix Island. </p><p>  The beach has a sand cover both in water and on land.  The sand is almost white and clean, which pleases the children.  You can cycle around the beach.  Wheels in local sand do not get stuck.  Very small crabs run on the coast.  The coastline is very wide.  There is a lot of space for relaxation and active games.  The beach is equipped with free showers and toilets.  If you want to settle down not in the zone of your hotel, then this is not a problem, however, sometimes they charge a fee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mafengwo.cn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Hotels" class="if uuid-2273274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2273274.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews of sea vacations in China, it can be concluded that the water in Sanya Bay is not very clear due to sand.  The sea is dark blue.  In color, it is very reminiscent of our Black.  The entire coast is covered with palm thickets, near which there are benches for holidaymakers.  After sunset, many summer cafes offering Chinese food begin on the beach.  In the daytime, all establishments are closed.  Holidays in <span>China (Sanya)</span> (reviews are given in the article) families with children will surely like it.  A spacious beach and clear sea - this is the main thing that you need in the resort. </p><h2>  Dadonghai </h2><p>  Dadonghai is one of the bays of the island.  Her beach was very fond of our compatriots.  Its length is not so large and is only four kilometers.  The beach is located between the mountains, and therefore in winter the sea is warmer here than in other bays. </p><p>  But the sand on the beach, although light, but not crumbly.  You can no longer ride a bicycle on it.  Sunset at sea is sandy and gentle.  Sometimes near the shore there are holes washed out by water, but there are not so many of them.  The sea in the bay area is very clean, transparent and has a beautiful blue tint.  Periodically, waves are thrown on the coast of shells and small pebbles. </p><p>  The beach is equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas (free of charge), lifeguards are always on duty at the main entrance.  The only drawback of the coast is the complete absence of palm trees, in the shade of which it is convenient to hide.  But a lot of cafes were built on the coast, and many of them have Russian names ("USSR", "Lena", "Kievan Rus").  Here guests are offered a wide range of Russian and European dishes, but Chinese food can also be ordered. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunnysanya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dadonghai Beach" class="if uuid-2273266" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2273266.jpg"></div><p>  In the afternoon, the beach is very noisy and busy.  Traders offering fruit, souvenirs, pearls and more constantly scurry about it.  This beach is loved by the Chinese themselves.  There are always a lot of them. </p><p>  Tourists leave the best reviews about holidays in China in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãDedenhai Bay.  This beach is most loved by our tourists.  And there are no problems in communication, almost all local staff speaks or understands Russian fairly well. </p><h2>  Yaluvan </h2><p>  If you dream of a luxurious vacation on the island of Hainan (China) (reviews and photos are given in the article), then you should choose Yaluvan Bay.  Its coast is considered the most expensive and luxurious on the whole island.  Those tourists who value a serene and quiet vacation at sea prefer to relax here. </p><p>  The water in the bay is clean and transparent.  The sea is always calm.  The bottom is visible even at a depth of 7-10 meters.  The length of the beach line is approximately seven kilometers.  At the same time, the width of the beach is at least 50 meters.  The coast is covered with soft and light sand. </p><p>  On the beach, literally everything has for a relaxing holiday.  There are no cafes or obsessive merchants.  And the locals don‚Äôt come here.  Near the Lan Resort Hotel is a scuba diving equipment rental center.  Also on the beach you can ride on rides or on a banana, scooter and other water devices. </p><p>  On the first coastline are five-star chain hotels.  Each of them has its own beach with sun loungers and umbrellas.  But such a territorial division is very conditional. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flocations.co.id" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stunning island" class="if uuid-2273272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2273272.jpg"></div><p>  Photos, reviews about holidays on Hainan Island in Yaluvan Bay testify to the high status of this part of the resort.
