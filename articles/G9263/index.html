Millions of tourists from all over the world come here every year to see magnificent landscapes.  There are sea, mountains, as well as wonderful sights.  This area is definitely worth a visit. </p><h2>  History </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Northern greece" class="if uuid-2652022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2652022.jpg"></div><p>  The history of this territory has more than four thousand years.  This fact is known from archaeologists and researchers who have long studied all parts of this country.  Once upon a time there lived Neanderthals in the cave of Petralon. </p><p>  In cities in northern Greece, history literally comes to life at almost every turn.  This is what attracts tourists.  For example, the heritage of ancient northern Greece can be seen in the monuments of the Roman as well as the Byzantine period.  In addition, in many cities there are unique buildings of the Neoclassical time.  Of course, historical and cultural significance is very great for the state. </p><p>  As you know, the northern part of Greece has repeatedly stood out among other regions of the state.  For example, it was here that the legendary ruler Philip II began his reign and subjugated the entire territory.  It is also worth noting that he was the father of the famous Alexander the Great. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The main attractions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="manessistraveldmc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nature of Northern Greece" class="if uuid-2652051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2652051.jpg"></div><p>  As mentioned above, there are a lot of attractions in this part of the country and you can talk about them endlessly.  In this article we will try to tell you about the most famous of them. </p><h2>  City Pella </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ancientgreecereloaded.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The antique city of Pella" class="if uuid-2652003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2652003.jpg"></div><p>  The legendary archaeological site.  It is an important part of <span>Macedonian history.</span>  Once this settlement was the capital of ancient Macedonia.  The city was founded at the end of the fifth century BC by King Archelaus.  But fame to the village came only only during the reign of Philip II, as well as Alexander the Great, which were discussed above.  It is worth noting that Alexander the Great managed to significantly expand the territory of the country. </p><p>  But there were also negative points.  In the second century BC, the Macedonians had a hard time due to the advance of the Romans.  The army was defeated, and the city itself was completely looted.  And our time, tourists come here to see what remains of former greatness.  Something is left here, and there is definitely something to get to know.  There are wonderful mosaics here, they still adorn the buildings of the city of Pella. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, it is worth exploring the local museums, which contain a large number of sculptures and ceramics. </p><h2>  Archaeological complex in Vergina </h2><p>  Vergina was glorified all over the world due to the fact that in the second half of the twentieth century there were rare royal tombs with the remains of Philip the Second.  This discovery is very much spread all over the world and made a lot of noise.  The city is listed as an exclusive tourist destination worldwide.  In addition, many items of that time period were found in the tomb of the king.  Almost all of them are exhibited at the Thessaloniki Museum today.  It has archaeological significance.  Of course, it‚Äôs worth a trip here. </p><p>  Here is also located not only the tomb of Philip II, but also the tombs that belong to the royal house of the Macedonian rulers.  In addition, near the tomb is the palace of Palatasia.  It was erected later than the appearance of these tombs and served the kings as a summer residence.  The most frequent guest here was Antigonus Gonat.  Near the palace is also a theater.  It is believed that it was here in the fourth century BC that Philip the Second was killed. </p><h2>  Mount Athos </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Athos" class="if uuid-2652012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2652012.jpg"></div><p>  This mountain is considered a truly unique phenomenon.  Briefly describing this place, Mount Athos is a theocratic republic within the Greek state.  Athos is a whole peninsula with its own rules, orders, and foundations.  This place is considered holy, and it was recognized by the Byzantine emperors. </p><p>  In 1060, by decree of Konstantin Monomakh, a law was passed that prohibited female persons from entering the peninsula.  The exception is the Virgin Mary.  It is interesting that this law is valid in modern times.  It applies not only to people, but also to representatives of the animal world. </p><p>  Now there are about twenty monasteries in Athos and about two thousand monks live in them.  But in history some forty monasteries were recorded some time ago, and forty thousand people lived on the territory. </p><p>  If someone decides to visit Mount Athos, you must immediately understand that this is not so simple.  First you will need to consult on this issue at the consulate of your country.  Then it is necessary to observe all the formalities at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the capital of Greece or at the Ministry of Macedonia.  Only after that it will be possible to obtain a document that will give the right to visit Mount Athos.  But still, not every ship will decide to take a person with such permission to this sacred place, so you just have to take a walk around the peninsula.  <span>Of course, this is</span> also interesting. </p><h2>  Edessa Waterfalls </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.escapegreece.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Edessa Waterfalls" class="if uuid-2652046" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2652046.jpg"></div><p>  These waterfalls are not in vain called the City of Waters.  After all, this is the only city on the whole planet where waterfalls are located almost near the center of the village.  The vast park covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãone hundred thousand square meters, and is located on the edge of a cliff, from which a total of eleven waterfalls flow.  The most attractive of them are Karanos and the so-called Double Waterfall. </p><p>  In addition, there is a picturesque park.  Streams and channels murmur around him.  And between the brooks trees of completely different species grow.  Above the waterfalls there is a wonderful cafe where you can enjoy a cheap cup of coffee. </p><p>  According to scientists, these waterfalls appeared on this site in the fourteenth century, after a powerful earthquake or some other natural disaster occurred on the territory.  Until that moment, all the waters were collected in the lake, which was located in the western part of the village.  But at one point the streams began to erupt so that they formed a certain number of separate waterfalls. </p><h2>  Resorts of Northern Greece </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.secret-greece.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resorts of Northern Greece" class="if uuid-2652054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2652054.jpg"></div><p>  In this part of the article, we will talk about a topic that excites many tourists.  Great pride of the island in northern Greece is the resort area in Halkidiki.  It is located on three long narrow peninsulas.  It is here that the endless beaches are; they are also well equipped and picturesque.  In the season they attract more and more people from different points of the planet.  It is about these famous three peninsulas that we will tell you in this part of the article. </p><h2>  Kassandra </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sail-la-vie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kassandra in Northern Greece" class="if uuid-2652058" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2652058.jpg"></div><p>  It is the most picturesque of all peninsulas.  It is at this place that history goes back centuries.  Coastal villages, snow-white beaches, as well as excellent hotels have made this place the most favorite among tourists. </p><h2>  Sithonia </h2><p>  Translated, this word means "middle finger."  The territory is a mountainous region, which is almost completely covered with trees.  Here, just like in Kassandra, sandy beaches.  In addition, there are picturesque bays.  Many tourists like to come to Sithonia for extreme water activities, as well as for the many legends told by locals. </p><h2>  Athos </h2><p>  This place was mentioned above.  But some important information is still worth adding.  Saint Athos rises at an altitude of 2033 meters in the southeastern part.  In addition, Athos is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p><p>  A few kilometers northeast of Mount Athos is the largest abyss of the Aegean.  It is here that a sharp drop in depth - from eighty meters to almost a thousand hundred.  It is also worth noting that the peninsula has about twenty capes.  The climate on Mount Athos is subtropical.  It has mild, rainy winters and hot summers. </p><h2>  Hotels in Northern Greece </h2><p>  Most hotels are located along the coast and, as you know, the main part is not in the resort towns themselves, but at a certain distance from them.  And for this very reason, getting to shops and restaurants is not so easy.  It is necessary to travel by transport.  Only a fraction of the hotels can be reached on foot. </p>
