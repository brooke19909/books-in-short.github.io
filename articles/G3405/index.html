The principle of integrity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In our world, there are a number of concepts that at first glance have a fairly simple interpretation.  Moreover, they are used in completely different fields of activity.  Depending on the context in which we use them, and their meaning is explained.  One such complex and multifaceted term is ‚Äúintegrity‚Äù.  This word is often found in everyday life, but few can give it a clear definition.  Well, let‚Äôs try now to cope with this difficult task. </p><h2>  Generalized short interpretation </h2><p>  So, according to the explanatory dictionary, integrity is a general characteristic of objects or objects that have a complex internal structure.  This concept is the personification of autonomy, self-sufficiency, as well as the integration of certain objects.  Additionally, we can say that integrity is a characteristic of quality, uniqueness, originality, which are formed in a certain environment and correspond only to a specific subject.  In other words, the term indicates a combination of a certain number of components in one object that develop and function together, thus forming a closed and complete system.  Such a system can be any biological unit (both a cell and a person), a state or a small society, software, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Science and philosophy </h2><p>  Obviously, the word "integrity" is a derivative of the "whole" or "one."  Often we use them in order to characterize something separate that has fully formed and become self-sufficient.  An example that was provided above is a cell as a biological unit.  It is framed by a special membrane through which the <span>intercellular substance</span> cannot leak, and inside it are all those components that provide the necessary metabolism inside this system.  Such living cells are all living organisms - people, animals, plants.  Cells are part of each internal organ, determining its integrity.  Together, we get a full-fledged living organism, whose work is harmonious and does not depend on others like him.  But it depends on the environment - air, water, light.  These components, consisting of molecules, are also self-sufficient and individual, but in combination with humans, animals and all other inhabitants of our planet, they form biomass.  In turn, biomass is also a single structure, within which all living organisms function smoothly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Psychology </h2><p>  Using the exact sciences as an example, we just looked at <span>what integrity is.</span>  Now let's turn to psychologists and to the terms that they use most often.  One of these is the "principle of the integrity of the individual."  The human person is a spiritual concept.  It can not be felt, inhaled or felt on yourself, like, say, a person or water.  But the personality is built on the basis of the components that shape and improve it.  Among these, we call life experience, mistakes, suffering, joys, friendship and betrayal, love, building a family, career growth, <span>personal preferences</span> and preferences, interests and much more.  The formation of personality is an extremely individual process.  In the history of mankind there are people who became self-sufficient and independent at a very young age.  And in some cases, it happens that a mature person who has spent more than half a century on Earth has still not been able to make his spiritual <span>personality holistic</span> and self-sufficient. </p>

    <h2>  State borders </h2><p>  Political scientists and historians constantly have to deal with such a concept as territorial integrity.  Its essence is no different from everything that has been described above.  The only difference is that in this case we are talking about the specific land borders of a particular country, its national language, flag, anthem and other attributes.  Earlier in the political concept, the principle of state integrity was also built on national principles.  The assimilation of peoples, if any, was insignificant.  Therefore, Latins lived in modern Italy, Celts in France, Goths in Germany, and Slav ancestors on our lands.  Today, the peoples who inhabit a particular state do not affect its integrity. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Informatics and modern technology </h2><p>  Integrity is a concept that has recently become widely used in the field of scientific technology, in programming and conducting Internet activities.  In particular, we are talking about the pristine and unchanged source codes of programs and files.  For example, take the most ordinary site, compiled by a programmer from a number of source codes.  For each individual page, certain ciphers, combinations of characters, numbers and signs were used.  Together, they formed a holistic picture, which became the basis for the Internet resource.  With incorrect handling of the source code, a violation of the activities of the subsidiary product occurs.  Settings get lost, as a result, the overall picture disappears.  It should be noted separately that in this situation verification of the integrity of information will be appropriate.  This can be done by performing a specific set of functions.  You can also perform a rollback operation to restore the original data. </p>

    <h2>  Integrity violation </h2><p>  In biology, psychology, geography and politics, in computer science and high technology - everywhere there is integrity.  But in any of these cases this unity itself can be broken.  With regard to biology, a vivid example of a violation of integrity are diseases, the cessation of the work of certain organs, and amputations.  In psychology, a violation of the integrity of the personality is a variety of mental disorders.  Here we can mention schizophrenia, amnesia, psychosis, neurasthenia, and many other mental illnesses.  An attempt on the territory of the state, the destruction of its symbolism is the collapse of its unity.  Such a phenomenon is observed during war and armed international conflicts.  Well, the question of how the integrity of Internet products can be violated, we have already examined in detail. </p>
