Laser hair removal is very popular.  This is most often a salon procedure.  However, it can be done at home.  For this, the Rio Salon Laser epilator is used.  Reviews about the model and its main qualities will be discussed later.  This will allow us to conclude that you need to purchase such a device for your own use. </p><h2>  What is laser hair removal? </h2><p>  We learned about <span>laser radiation</span> relatively recently - in the last century.  Laser is a device that creates a narrow beam of intense high-power light.  In a short time, such devices have become very widespread in many areas of human activity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imgrum.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Price of laser epilator" class="if uuid-2246782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2246782.jpg"></div><p>  Initially, laser hair removal was performed only in beauty salons.  Everything has changed since the moment when the unique portable Rio Salon Laser epilator appeared on the world market, with which you can carry out hair removal procedures without leaving your home. </p><h2>  Manufacturing company </h2><p>  Home laser epilator Rio Salon Laser was developed by the famous company RIO DEZAC (UK). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Home Laser Epilator" class="if uuid-2246783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2246783.jpg"></div><p>  The manufacturer began its activities about thirty years ago.  Today, it is widely popular in the world market due to its innovative products and respect for the environment. </p><h2>  The principle of operation of the device </h2><p>  Laser epilator "Rio" is a small device.  It emits a narrow and directional stream of light.  Melanin (pigment), which is contained in the hair, absorbs the energy of such radiation.  This causes the heating of its follicle (root).  As a result of such exposure, they are destroyed.  As a result, the procedure helps to slow down or completely stop hair growth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shop4body.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Laser epilator &quot;Rio&quot;" class="if uuid-2246786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2246786.jpg"></div><p>  Such hair removal is used only to remove dark hairs on the skin of a light shade.  They have enough pigment.  For light, gray, red and fluffy hair, this procedure is absolutely ineffective, since the energy from the laser is not concentrated in the follicle.  In this case, the Rio Salon Laser will not produce the expected effect.  Customer reviews whose hair does not have enough melanin are negative. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you have a strong tan or having a dark skin tone from nature, you should also not hope for a high result.  It should be remembered that laser hair removal is a procedure that is carried out in courses consisting of 6-10 sessions.  They need to be carried out once a month.  A single application will not give a result.  Therefore, before using an epilator of this type, it is necessary to carefully study the instructions for the maximum result. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The presented model belongs to the category of laser epilators with a scanning function.  This is a small compact device measuring 25x24x9 cm. It is lightweight and ergonomic, convenient to use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.riobeauty.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Home Laser Epilator Rio Salon Laser" class="if uuid-2246798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2246798.jpg"></div><p>  The device acts on each hair individually, destroying the rod from the very base.  This allows you to achieve a lasting positive effect.  The device has five power levels, which makes it possible to get the best result in accordance with the existing features of the skin type. </p><p>  Unlike <span>waxing</span> and shugaring, laser is pleasant and painless.  True, this process is slower and more laborious.  However, a laser epilator with a scanning function speeds up this process by several times.  The device can find and process up to 60 hairs simultaneously.  Therefore, experts and users recommend that you purchase only those devices in which this mode is provided.  The price in this case will be 2 times higher than the model without the ability to scan.  But the speed of the procedure increases significantly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  According to the instructions, Rio Salon Laser allows you to remove hair in any area except the eyebrows, nose and ears.  This will provide an opportunity to solve the problem of unwanted vegetation.  The device acts on each individual hair without missing a single one.  The result is perfectly clean and smooth skin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.riobeauty.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Epilator Rio Salon Laser" class="if uuid-2246785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2246785.jpg"></div><p>  The model is suitable for sensitive epidermis and can be used with almost no restrictions.  You can customize the device for a specific skin type.  The presented model is economically advantageous, in contrast to expensive devices, which constantly require replacement of consumables. </p><p>  The price of a British brand laser epilator is about 15 thousand rubles.  The design uses a universal semiconductor radiation source in which crystals do not need to be replaced.  Therefore, the price for this epilator is quite affordable. </p><p>  This device is convenient and easy to use.  It does not cause any discomfort.  When using it, the procedure is characterized by a high level of comfort.  When not in use, it goes into energy-saving mode.  The presented model is approved and approved by leading experts in the field of cosmetic medicine.  It is equipped with a multi-stage security control system, which is worth telling more about. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the price of the laser epilator of the presented model is acceptable for buyers.  Moreover, the quality of the device is quite high.  Clinical trials of Rio Salon Laser were conducted at the Harvard University School of Medicine, the Japanese Society of Plastic Surgery and other influential institutions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.riobeauty.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Instructions Rio Salon Laser" class="if uuid-2246796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2246796.jpg"></div><p>  The safety control system of the device includes a number of elements.  One of them is a key for mechanical blocking from inclusion.  When connected to the network, the device requests a code.  There is also an electronic protection system.  The radiation is switched on only under the condition of close contact of the laser module with moisturized skin.  If the epithelium is dry or the module does not fit snugly against the body, the device will not turn on. </p><p>  A special cap covering the laser head eliminates accidental contact of the active element with the eyes.  Flash duration is automatically controlled.  The duration of continuous radiation does not exceed 4 s.  Therefore, you can not be afraid to ‚Äúoverexpose‚Äù the device in one area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe skin. </p><p>  The device is equipped with an optical system that accurately focuses the beam, eliminating the risk of damage to the epithelium. </p><h2>  Features of work </h2><p>  As noted above, the best results for this type of hair removal are achieved on fair skin with dark hair.  Otherwise, the effect may be insufficient or absent altogether.  Hair should be darker than skin.  Therefore, before the procedure, do not discolor them.  This worsens the result. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Laser epilator with scanning function" class="if uuid-2246784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2246784.jpg"></div><p>  Rio Salon Laser, according to experts, is most effective for hair 1-2 mm long.  Before the procedure, the skin should be slightly moistened.  Sometimes during processing you can smell burnt hair.  No need to be scared, this is absolutely normal.  In very rare cases, a slight irritation or redness of the skin was observed, which disappeared during the day. </p><p>  Usually, the effect passes unnoticed.  After the procedure, it is advisable to conduct a small massage of the treated area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe epithelium to enhance the effect, lubricate the skin with a cooling lotion or just moisturize with cool water.  The session should be repeated after 2-4 weeks. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  About the presented device, buyers leave mixed reviews.  Some users note that the procedure for home hair removal with this device takes too much time.  However, such sessions in the salons last quite a long time.  Therefore, you need to choose the moment when no business is expected in the next hour. </p><p>  Carrying out hair removal at home, of course, saves money, since this procedure does not require special costs.  In the cabin, such processing is quite expensive.  Yes, and time at home it takes much less.  Most buyers are satisfied with the quality of the device.  They celebrate its effectiveness, efficiency, safety and recommend it to their friends and acquaintances. </p><p>  Having considered the features of Rio Salon Laser, reviews of customers and specialists about it, it should be noted its worthy quality.  If you fulfill all the requirements of the instructions, you can achieve high results in the fight against unwanted vegetation. </p>
