    <p>  Of course, now it‚Äôs popular to go on holiday abroad: to Turkey, Italy and other countries, but this requires additional efforts and costs: from a passport to a flight, which is also not always safe.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Alushta in history </h2><p>  Alushta is a Ukrainian city full of its remarkable places and memorable events.  Its history began with the emperor Justinian, who built a fortification called Aluston, which is reminiscent of the three Greek towers that have survived to this day, despite the destruction and inexorable time: Alushta went through several wars, the Ottoman conquest and occupation by the Germans. </p><p>  By the way, it was here that they shot the good old film about Shurik's adventures with the participation of Natalia Varley, the film "Three Plus Two" and many other films.  And it was Alushta who served as the muse for the writer <span>Ivan Shmelyov,</span> which was reflected in the epic novel ‚ÄúThe Sun of the Dead‚Äù. </p><h2>  Industry Alushta </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the climate in Alushta is somewhat more severe than in other resort towns, Alushta wine is rightfully recognized as one of the best due to the developed vine plantations from the 19th century and rich crop production.  More than 20 popular wine brands are made at a local winery, which is part of a large concern. </p><p>  Mostly employment in Alushta is related to the service sector, and the main income of residents and those who come to work consists in servicing tourists who prefer to rest in Alushta: renting apartments, private houses, hotel rooms.
