Real sand dunes and <span>clear lakes</span> with warm water give the landscape an unusual look and attract attention.  This amazing place is not a natural anomaly.  It was created by human hands during the extraction of sand and gravel in these parts. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Sychevsky quarry is located less than 100 km from the capital.  The nearest settlement is the village of Sychevo, Volokolamsk district.  In the 1960s, they began to extract sand and gravel, which are used for construction.  The Sychevsky non <span>-</span> metallic <span>mining and processing plant</span> was founded <span>,</span> which is still operating.  Today, the field continues to be developed and is operational. </p><p>  It should be noted that non-metallic materials mined here are of high quality.  They were used for the construction of metropolitan buildings and structures, such as the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, the memorial complex on Poklonnaya Hill, the Moscow Ring Road, as well as many residential buildings. </p>

    <h2>  Career description </h2><p>  Part of the quarries still remain operational, you can see working excavators in them.  The other part - is now fully developed, filled with water and is a lake.  The area has a rather unusual appearance: quarries filled with water of blue or greenish color, old abandoned towers and barges, and around - shores that look like sand dunes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The territory of the quarry in Sychevo is quite extensive, it looks like a square with a side length of about 8 km.  Here you can find dwarf plants, which are very rare for central Russia. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  There are several beaches in Sychevsky quarries.  Tourists who visited these places, counted about 5 zones for recreation on the water.  It is not very crowded, since the road to the quarries is difficult.  It can also be noted that the shores of the lakes are covered with clean sand, which is rarely found even on the famous beaches near Moscow. </p>

    <p>  Water is unclear, as it has a sandy admixture.  The lakes are deep enough and you can swim in them.  To date, the beaches look wild, they have no facilities for recreation.  There are not yet organized locker rooms, cafes, toilets, umbrellas.  In the future, this recreation area is planned to be ennobled. </p><p>  Sometimes diving enthusiasts come here.  Depth allows you to dive, and in some quarries, transparency is quite high.  All diving enthusiasts note that the water in the lakes warms up well on hot days.  Cool currents are observed only at great depths. </p><h2>  Other attractions </h2><p>  Fishermen come to the quarry in Sychevo, Volokolamsk district.  The fauna of the lakes is quite rich and diverse.  It is difficult to count on a large catch, but you can catch a lot of small fish: crucian carp, roach, perch, and undergrowth.  In some quarries, you can catch predatory fish. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Sandboarding lovers love to gather here.  This sport is not snowboarding in the snowy mountains, but in the dunes and sand dunes.  Sychevsky quarry is an ideal place for such entertainment.  And also fans of ATVs and cross-country motorbikes come here to practice riding on a sandy hill. </p><p>  In the village of Sychevo there is a nursery of the Moscow Zoo.  It is located on the site of former quarries and covers a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 200 hectares.  Here rare animals are bred.  Previously, this zoo was completely closed to visitors.  It was believed that silence and peace were necessary for animals, and excessive anxiety would have a bad effect on reproduction.  However, in February 2017, the first excursion to the nursery was held.  Over time, such organized visits to this mini zoo will become permanent. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there by car </h2><p>  At first glance, it seems that driving to quarries in Sychevo is not difficult.  You need to leave the Moscow Ring Road on Novorizhskoye Shosse, drive about 98 km, then turn onto Sychevo and drive another 5 km to the quarries.  But the last section of the road will run along the loose sand, and it is very insidious, the car is easy to land.  In addition, large trucks often drive past, which raise strong sand dust.  You must consider all the features of such a road before you go on a trip.  The path is likely to be difficult, but people come here to see the desert near Moscow. </p>
