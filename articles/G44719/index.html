In short: this is a powerful and stylish new product that entered the smartphone market in September this year.  What did the company's engineers add to this model?  The devices went on sale in a color that later became known as ‚Äúpink gold‚Äù, the context menu was changed to add files and icons.  Now the device can record video in 4K quality.  Well, perhaps this is what the <span>iPhone 6S</span> boasts <span>, the technical specifications of</span> which you will find below. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  The delivery package for such a smartphone is quite modest.  Although, probably, more is not necessary.  So, what can we find in the box by opening it?  In the packaging that protects the "iPhone 6S", the technical characteristics of which will be listed in the article, you can find, of course, the smartphone itself and a wired stereo headset for it.  These, of course, are EarPods.  Also included is a network adapter and a USB cable.  It, except as a charger, can be used as a means to synchronize with a personal computer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  "IPhone 6S", the technical characteristics of which the reader can find in this article, also contains stickers for the device and a special device that allows you to easily remove the SIM card from the smartphone.

    <p>  To begin with, we note one rather interesting point.  "IPhone 6S", the technical characteristics of which were also the subject of discussion in this article, has a letter on the back panel that really shows us what kind of model it is.  The last time this feature was possessed only by iPhone 3Gs.  Subsequently, the labeling "eski" ceased.  <span>Identification marks were</span> absent, and it was possible to guess that in front of our eyes for the device it was possible only by the corresponding technical characteristics. </p><h2>  Software and design </h2>

But this time, the engineers and designers of the company decided to please the audience of fans of the respective devices with a new color scheme.  It has become ‚Äúpink gold."  Representatives of the beautiful half of humanity immediately fell in love with this variation. </p><h2>  Materials </h2>

    <p>  Most of the apparatus is made of aluminum alloy.  This is the 7,000 series. Compared to the previous workmanship, it is as much as 60 percent harder.  Nevertheless, crash tests are best avoided.  It remains only to recommend careful handling of the device.  At the same time, the use of the appropriate alloy provided the weighting of the smartphone.  The case feels more massive than before. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Dimensions </h2>

    <p>  In all three planes, the dimensions of the iPhone 6S are 138.3 by 67.1 by 7.1 millimeters.  The mass of the device is 143 grams.  The device can be ‚Äúdressed‚Äù in different cases.  Almost all models that are currently on the smartphone market and in mobile phone stores are suitable for the dimensions of the device.  At the same time, sometimes some covers fall directly on the same heading, which is not always convenient. </p><p>  There are not so many tips for choosing ‚Äúclothes‚Äù for your phone.  The user must decide everything himself, primarily with an eye to whether he likes the cover at all or not.  But, of course, it is better to carry out the fitting not through the Internet, but personally, having come to the mobile phone salon.  Otherwise, you may be disappointed with the result of your choice. </p><h2>  On the same rake </h2><p>  As owners of iPhone smartphones are well aware, in these devices, the main camera acts on the rear panel.  The engineers of the company have not yet got rid of this in some way flaw.  Why is this exactly a minus?  In this case, the protrusion of the main camera means that the rim will be erased during operation.  Therefore, the presentation of the device will melt almost before our eyes.  And who needs it? </p><p>  Although, perhaps, this is precisely the change in our audience that should be expected in the future, when Apple employees present a new model.  Unless, of course, they decide to do it.  Already there is talk that the iPhone 7 will be a truly revolutionary device.  Although, it would seem, much better? </p><h2>  Tactile contact </h2><p>  In the hands of the device lies securely.  It is unlikely that it will fall out even from wet hands.  By the way, there are no noticeable differences between 6S and the usual ‚Äúsix‚Äù in this regard.  The device is perceived the same way.  The smartphone fits in any pocket.  Probably, the diagonal of the screen was carefully selected, since the device does not protrude beyond the palm of your hand.  You can not say about the "shovels" with large display sizes.  Some, by the way, are inclined to include a follower in this category - ‚ÄúiPhone 6S Plus‚Äù, the characteristics of which differ in some parameters from the subject of our review today.  But in the case of these two devices, we are faced with a choice.  You have to choose either a convenient device case or a large screen diagonal. </p><h2>  "IPhone 6S": specifications, photos, controls </h2><p>  The location of the latter has not changed at all.  There is also a tray in which you need to insert a SIM card.  It must be processed according to the NanoSIM standard. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The screen size is about 4.7 inches.  In this case, 326 pixels per inch.  The full resolution of the display is 1334 by 750 pixels.  Many users tend to think that this is not enough.  Often you can find comments that indicate that HD quality for such a smartphone is almost a shame that fell on the head of the company's engineers.  However, just think for a moment about whether more is needed in this case?  Please note that even on such a display, photos and videos play just fine. </p><p>  Of course, the resolution could be changed for the better.  But Apple has always been distinguished by the fact that it knows how to find a middle ground for its devices between power consumption and performance.  In any case, this also applies to the diagonal of the screen.  The company has been observing equilibrium for a long time, and it has already become more than a tradition - this is a credo. </p><h2>  "IPhone 6S": specifications, instructions, photos.  Conclusion, owner reviews </h2><p>  Currently, the modification under the name 6S is diverging across the globe in millions of copies.  Of course, by far the most intense sales have been seen in the United States of America.  The second place is taken by China.  Those who purchased this gadget are either delighted or extremely disappointed.  However, with "iPhones" usually this always happens.  In our country, devices appeared on official sale only in October. </p><p>  So, what are the main distinguishing characteristics distinguish owners?  Firstly, it is a display that supports 3D Touch technology.  Secondly, this is the presence of a new material = alloy of the 7000 series as the case fabrication material. Now there is less chance of damaging the device.  Thirdly, a new color scheme, which was appreciated by girls and women.  Fourth, this is an improved front camera, which has a flash that allows you to take a selfie even in low light.  Moreover, its role is played by the screen of the device.  Probably, as a conclusion, you can bring the main camera, which shoots as 4K.  There are many more less noticeable features, but we will not talk about them. </p>
