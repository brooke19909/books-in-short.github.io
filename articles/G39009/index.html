  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Decoupage chopping boards - the first stage in the development of technology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Do you like to make original items with your own hands?  Do you have an artistic taste and desire to transform the space with non-standard exclusive gizmos?  Then try to master the ‚Äúdecoupage‚Äù technique.  This is quite simple, fast, and the result can be simply stunning, the main thing is to do everything very carefully, in compliance with the necessary technology.  Moving from simple to more complex things, you will see how versatile this technique is and allows you to create amazing things.  The attractiveness of decoupage is largely due to its long history and the contribution that craftsmen and artists have made to it over the years, improving the technique, introducing something new and unusual. </p><p>  Let's start with the simplest and try to make <span>decoupage cutting boards</span> to decorate the kitchen.  We will need the following materials: wooden board blank, acrylic paint, primer, decoupage glue or PVA diluted with water, soft brush, acrylic colorless varnish, paper napkins with a beautiful decor, foam sponge. </p><p>  1. We begin the decoupage of the board by priming its front surface and covering it with acrylic white paint in several layers to achieve an even, smooth surface.  The paint must be necessarily white so that the picture cut from the napkin appears clearly and brightly on it.  If the board will be used for its intended purpose, we leave the side for cutting products in its original untouched form.  The paint must be allowed to dry well. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. From the napkin we cut out <span>the pattern</span> along the <span>contour,</span> separate the upper colored layer and put it on the front painted surface in the center or moving it to the edge - it all depends on the pattern and desire.  Using a soft brush, coat the tenderloin with decoupage glue or diluted PVA water (1: 1), brushing it directly on top of the picture, carefully, simultaneously expelling all air bubbles.  Creasing and creasing should be avoided.  To do this, the cloth napkin can be pre-moistened with water.  We take a <span>plastic bag,</span> put the drawing face down on it and gently moisten it with water.  We remove excess moisture with a dry cloth.  We turn the bag along with the tenderloin so that the napkin is at the bottom, and put it on the front surface of the board, smoothing it with a cloth or sponge.  After this, the package must be slowly removed, wet the tenderloin again and glue with glue.  Allow the glue to dry well. </p><p>  3. We continue to make decoupage <span>cutting boards.</span>  If the background of the napkin is white, then after drying the decoupage pattern, the product is coated with colorless varnish in two or three layers.  If the napkin was colored, then you need to choose acrylic paint to match the <span>background color</span> and cover the entire surface of the board, not occupied by the pattern, with this paint.  So we will achieve the effect of complete credibility, as if the pattern is not pasted, but drawn on the board.  Only after that we cover the product with varnish.  You should pay attention to the sides of the board.  They also need to be painted either with the same paint or with a contrasting color. </p><p>  One of the most preferred styles of the kitchen interior is Provence.  Paneled wooden furniture, terracotta tiles on the floor, varied decor, reminiscent of rustic, very nice and cozy France houses, create an attractive and comfortable environment.  Making decoupage cutting boards in this style is easy.  Here it is necessary at the end of the work to do artificial aging of the surface with the help of craquelure composition.  It can be two-stage or one-stage (simpler).  After coating with this composition, cracks appear on the surface, creating the effect of antiquity.  If you rub gold or silver powder into them at the last stages of work, the thing will look even more attractive and refined.  But it is worth noting that the main thing in decoupage technique is not to go too far with the decor and stop in time, reaching the necessary ‚Äúgolden mean‚Äù. </p><p>  Decoupage of kitchen boards can be done in any style.  In art salons and online stores they sell a variety of napkins and <span>decoupage cards</span> with drawings made in a variety of styles - from classic realistic paintings and ornaments to avant-garde and constructivist ones.  Having chosen the picture you like, accordingly, you need to choose the background design methods for it in order to avoid dissonance.  In addition, making decoupage of cutting boards to decorate the kitchen, try to make the work look as natural and natural as possible, so as to create the full impression that the board is hand-painted by a talented creative person. </p>
