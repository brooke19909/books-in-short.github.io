    <h2>  Be yourself </h2><p>  Everyone knows that Siberia is a real forge of persistent, beautiful, punchy characters.  Our today's heroine is a confirmation of this.  Veronika Kravchuk - TV presenter of Amazing Life.  Fashion TV, Rich Club.  In addition, she is a fashion blogger, the wife of a famous tennis player and the mother of a wonderful baby. </p><p>  Veronika Kravchuk is a chic, very bright girl with a magnificent appearance, a representative of the Fresh Models modeling agency. </p><p>  She is a very harmonious personality: she is fond of sports, adheres to a healthy lifestyle, eats properly, likes to read books on psychology.  Veronika Kravchuk is an educated man.  She does not stand still, monitors her development, dreams of succeeding in her career and in life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Often, journalists ask her a question: "What is the recipe for your beauty? How do you manage to maintain a flowering appearance?" </p><p>  To which Veronica replies that she, naturally, as a professional, has her own methods.  But she never considered herself a beauty.  Well-groomed girl - yes, she agrees with this.  And as for her beauty - the main beauty of any person, according to Veronica, is not external, but that which is inside.  With this, the girl laughs, she was lucky.  And her main task is to remain herself. </p><h2>  Plans </h2><p>  Having made a good career in the capital, Veronika Kravchuk, whose biography began in Novosibirsk, rightly considers himself a successful person.  The plans are to graduate from university and enter the journalism faculty of Moscow State University. </p><p>  Veronica sees the continuation of her career in this difficult profession.  She wants to create her own program, which will cover serious topics.  Soon Veronica plans to study at the Higher School of Television Journalism in Prague, and in the future to open her own business. </p><h2>  Time management </h2><p>  In one of the interviews, the girl revealed how she manages to lead an active life and keep up with everything.  It's all about the proper organization of their time.  Veronica learned to clearly plan the day, to distribute the affairs that have to be dealt with.  The book ‚ÄúTime Management‚Äù by J. Margenstein helped her in this. </p><p>  It happens that a girl has to paint a day by hours and even minutes, taking into account everything, including brushing her teeth, make a list the next day.  But, of course, she is not subject to any force majeure circumstances. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Going to an important meeting, Veronica scrolls her list in her head.  She always has three occupations that depend solely on herself, and three more that do not depend on her at all.  For example, she will come to a meeting, and the interlocutor is late.  The whole plan is crumbling.  Veronica takes these moments into account and creates backup options so that someone‚Äôs oversight does not unsettle her. </p><h2>  A family </h2><p>  Veronika met her future husband when, having passed documents to Novosibirsk University, she came to visit her Moscow tennis player friend.  At one of the fights, where she went to support her friend, she met with Konstantin.  After long correspondence, they became husband and wife.  Veronica understands that it is a huge responsibility to be a life partner of a professional athlete. </p>

    <p>  But she is trying to cope with difficult situations, she is always in a good mood, doing what she loves.  All this gives her energy, which she tries to give to her beloved. </p><p>  Veronica allows her little daughter to express her feelings the way a child can and wants.  She does not suppress her instincts laid down by nature, certainly explaining to her daughter how to behave. </p><h2>  Believe in the good! </h2><p>  Veronica believes that people will someday come to true values.  She wants everyone to remain honest, kind, decent, learn to give others love, hope, good feelings. </p><p>  One must always be oneself.  Never strive to be like someone.  We are all unique, Veronica recalls.  May everyone be happy as he is. </p>
