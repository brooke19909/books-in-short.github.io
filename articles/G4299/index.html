    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  It is worth noting a number of disadvantages that characterize the hotel Dodeca Sea Resort Ex Fo 5 *.  Traveler reviews speak of the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  unlike most five-star hotels, where the use of the safe in the room is free, you have to pay extra for this service; </li><li>  maids come to clean either early in the morning, when guests are still sleeping, or after dinner, which is very inconvenient; </li><li>  both in the daytime and in the evening, the pool is too noisy and crowded (almost all animation is concentrated here); </li><li>  the waiters in the restaurant are too slow; </li><li>  there are a lot of mosquitoes in the room that even a fumigator cannot handle; </li><li>  smokers everywhere in the hotel, because of which the smell of tobacco smoke is felt in the rooms and on the street (this is despite the fact that smoking is prohibited by the hotel‚Äôs rules); </li><li>  nearby the hotel there are sewage from a nearby establishment, and therefore there is often an unpleasant smell on the territory; </li><li>  in the rooms located on the ground floor the walls are covered with mold; </li><li>  part of the rooms was not renovated (it is worthwhile to clarify this moment in advance to avoid unpleasant surprises); </li><li>  in the dining room there are a lot of flies that the staff does not fight with; </li><li>  in order to take beach towels, you need to make a cash deposit; </li><li>  rooms of improved categories are not very different from standard ones, and therefore overpayment is not always justified; </li><li>  Until June 15 (until the "hot season" has begun), most infrastructure facilities and entertainment do not function. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Many travelers choose this hotel for relaxation, placing high hopes on its five-star status.  However, they are not always justified.  Unfortunately, the service and general atmosphere of this hotel is significantly different from similar establishments in Turkey and Egypt.  Nevertheless, guests are provided with quite comfortable accommodation and quality food.  Also, you can not ignore the convenient location of the hotel.  A luxurious beach, public transport, and the resort's main promenade are all nearby. </p>
