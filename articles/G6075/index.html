From the point of view of the economy, this is the person who receives the main income from the money transferred to the loan or in the form of interest from securities. </p><h2>  Basic definition </h2><p>  The broad meaning of the word "rentier" means a person who has his own capital in the form of cash.  Moreover, he lives on interest.  In addition, the renter may be the owner of highly liquid real estate (business, securities or land) that generates income.  A possible source of such a person‚Äôs existence is rewards for inventions, as well as fees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rentier who is it" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/408785.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <p>  In other words, a person receiving a certain income not from labor activity, this is a rentier.  The type of assets can be different <span>(bills, loans,</span> real estate, etc.). </p><h2>  Role in society </h2><p>  Rentier - who is it?  This is one who lives not on labor, but on legitimate incomes.  The amount of money received for such a person always depends on how efficiently he manages his capital. </p><p>  When asked about the renter - who is this, one can confidently answer that this is the one who receives his money from generating his own capital.  For example, real estate leased to them gives a monthly stable income. <br>  The rentier differs from investors in that he practically does not engage in independent management of his own assets.  He either buys what is capable of generating passive income, or entrusts the management of funds to professionals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meaning of the word rentier" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/408786.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The renter must know where to invest his assets in such a way that they bring the greatest return.  For example, what is better to own - real estate, securities or precious metals?

    <p>  Learn to manage your money wisely.  For example, save on utilities, do not take consumer loans without special need, etc. There are plenty of options in the modern world.  In any of them, you can start with the smallest amounts, not more than 1000 rubles.  There is the possibility of investing in online projects.  Interest in this case will be possible to get super-high. </p><h2>  Sources of income </h2><p>  Recently, many people have appeared in the capital of Russia who have the opportunity to not work anywhere.  They receive their income from renting Moscow real estate.  This happened because the cost per square meter of housing is constantly growing.  In terms of its level, the price of Moscow real estate is equal to the European one.  Those who own two or three apartments in the capital do not need to worry about their future.  On <span>rent</span> alone <span>you</span> can live comfortably.  Real estate is the best guarantee of the future.  At the same time, premises can be rented out both for commercial purposes and for living. </p><p>  Decent income is also received from bank deposits.  However, the amount in the account should be impressive.  Only in this case, the interest received will be enough for a comfortable existence.  It is worth remembering the depreciation of capital, which occurs under the influence of inflationary processes. </p><p>  There are such rentiers who live on dividends from stocks and bonds of large firms.  As a rule, these are companies in the raw material sector of the economy. </p><p>  Some renters have secured a comfortable life due to the investments they made in a profitable business.  Now they simply receive high interest from this contribution. </p>
