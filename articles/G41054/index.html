    <p>  "Arabica" - a 2 * hotel, which quite often is considered, tourists are going to relax by the sea.  What living conditions can he offer?  If you are accustomed to relaxing in the best hotels when planning your trip to Abkhazia, you need to be more demanding when choosing a hotel here.  The resort is quite primitive, for a long time tourism here was in a state of neglect, so most of the potential options differ from their description by no means for the better. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  "Arabica" (2 * hotel, <span>Abkhazia, Pitsunda)</span> opened in 2016, it is a new complex with good living conditions, in any case, this is how it positions itself as a vacationer.  Already from the name it is clear that he is in Pitsunda, just 600 meters from the coast.  Location is called by many a strong point, one of the advantages.  But not everything is as rosy as the representatives of the hotel describe. </p><p>  If you plan to go on vacation in your own car, be sure to contact the hotel and ask in advance how to get here.  "Arabica" (2 * hotel) is located only 4.5 km from the city center, but it does not have a sign, so some difficulties may arise. </p><p>  The windows of the hotel on one side overlook a ditch with a terrible smell, and on the other - onto the federal highway, from where the noise of cars is heard around the clock.  If you are looking for a calm and quiet place to stay, this is definitely not your option.  Even plastic windows do not save the situation.  The presence of a balcony in each room in this case does not allow you to enjoy the beauties of the resort. </p>

    <p>  The rooms are not impressive, many tourists complain about the lack of furniture.  The wardrobe is so small that you have to store many things in your suitcases.  Unfortunately, the room does not have air conditioning, which is a big omission by modern standards.  You can use a fan, but in the season it certainly will not solve the problem of stuffiness and humidity.  The presence of only two outlets in the room eliminates the opportunity to enjoy all the benefits of modernity.  The TV shows only one local channel, but this is not the worst, because tourists spend most of their time on vacation on the beach. </p><p>  Now for the bathroom: there is no interruption in the supply of hot water, but some vacationers complain of poor ventilation, lack of good drainage, as a result of which the bathroom is always wet and damp.  There is nothing surprising in the fact that mold and mildew appear in the room from excess humidity, which is nonsense for a new hotel.  The administration needs to pay attention to this if they want the prosperity of their project. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  "Arabica" is a 2 * hotel (Abkhazia, Pitsunda), which cannot boast of developed infrastructure, but all vacationers will be able to use the 24-hour reception services and free secure parking for cars.  The hotel is located along the roadway, so you can always use public transport.  True, there are no interesting and beautiful places nearby. </p><p>  The only opportunity to recharge with positive energy is to go on an excursion.  By the way, vacationers do not recommend taking them at the hotel - at local travel agencies, excursion programs are more vibrant, rich and affordable at their cost.  And there are really many beautiful places. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are available in the hotel restaurant.  The food is not the most varied: there are not enough fresh vegetables and fruits, so it is better to cook it yourself by choosing a room with a kitchen, or eat in local cafes and restaurants.  At the market you can always buy fresh seasonal fruits, take them with you to the sea.  Ice cream, soft drinks, boiled corn are sold on the beach - no one will be left hungry. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Service is not the hotel‚Äôs greatest strength.  Many vacationers complain about the disgusting work of the maintenance staff, quite often the reception desk simply does not have an administrator to be able to quickly resolve various issues. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned at best once every few days, bed linen and towels are changed only upon request, so you will have to monitor the cleanliness of the room yourself, which you certainly do not want to do on vacation. </p><p>  All vacationers, if you believe the description, will receive round-the-clock access to wireless Internet if they are attracted to "Arabica" (2 * hotel, Abkhazia, <span>Pitsunda).</span>  <span>Reviews by</span> tourists on this subject are mixed.  Some complain that the signal is only available on the street, it is almost impossible to catch it in the room. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  In Abkhazia there are few good hotels and hotels that would offer good entertainment on site.  Can not offer this and <span>Pitsunda (Picunda).</span>  "Arabica" (hotel 2 *) is a completely different matter.  Here, every vacationer will be able to use the sauna and massage room.  All sports enthusiasts can not interrupt their workouts thanks to the excellent gym. </p><p>  For children, a children's playground is organized on the territory - a favorite place of leisure for children of different ages.  That is why the hotel "Arabica" is suitable for families with children. </p><h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  If you want to live near the coast, you will like the "Arabica" (2 * hotel, Pitsunda).  Reviews of tourists note that the sea is really only 600 meters, but the path does not lie in the most picturesque place of the resort: along a busy road and along a narrow path, which is not at all safe.  The hotel does not have its own beach, so you have to take advantage of the conditions that nature gave. </p><p>  You can take a walk to the beach of the Litfond boarding house.  Vacationers note its cleanliness and amenities.  The beach is pebble, with a gentle entry into the water, and well equipped. </p>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  In general, "Arabica" (2 * hotel), although it opened this year, has quite a few drawbacks.  This is not the worst option in Pitsunda, but you can find something more decent for the same money.  On the whole, rest here will appeal only to uninhabited modern services for tourists who are ready to put up with some inconveniences and deprivations. </p>
