Most accepted dogmas after half a millennium remain relevant.  The High Assembly of Spiritual Leaders of the Catholic Church gathered in the midst of the Reformation, when the inhabitants of northern Europe, dissatisfied with the abuses and luxurious lives of churchmen, refused to recognize the authority of the Pope.  The Council of Trent and the most important results of its work became a decisive "attack" on the reformers, marking the milestone of the Counter-Reformation of the 16th century. </p>

    <h2>  Spiritual background of the conflict </h2><p>  The Catholic Church at the end of the 15th century concentrated many lands in its hands and accumulated great wealth.  Church tithe was common in Europe - collecting a tenth of the profit from the harvest or cash income.  The church lived magnificently, while a significant part of the faithful was poor.  This circumstance undermined the foundations of faith, the authority of the church.  In addition, the <span>popes</span> widely launched the trade in indulgences - special letters "for the remission of sins."  For a certain amount of indulgence of a person, regardless of the severity of misconduct, they were freed from any sin.  Such a sale caused discontent among believers.  The Reformation Center was Germany, which was then fragmented and resembled a patchwork quilt.  Against such an unfavorable background, it was decided to convene the Council of Trent. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Significant damage to the authority of the <span>Catholic Church</span> caused humanism.  Its leader was <span>Erasmus of Rotterdam.</span>  In the praise of stupidity pamphlet, the humanist sharply condemned the shortcomings and ignorance of the clergy.  Another leader of German humanism was Ulrich von Gutten, who considered papal Rome an opponent <span>of German unification.</span>  It should be added that the irritation among the believers was also caused by the fact that the language of worship was Latin, which ordinary parishioners did not understand. </p>

    <h2>  Reformation </h2><p>  The Reformation has become a global challenge to the foundations of the Catholic Church.  For the most part, it was against the Reformation that the decisions of the Council of Trent were directed.  The initial idea was to hold a joint meeting of the Council, chaired by the pope and the leaders of the Reformation.  However, dialogue, rather, a scholastic dispute, did not work out. </p><p>  On October 31, 1517, Martin Luther nailed ‚Äú95 theses‚Äù to the doors of his church in Wittenberg, sharply condemning the trade in indulgences.  In a short time, tens of thousands of people became supporters of Luther's ideas.  In 1520, the Pope issued a bull on the excommunication of a monk from the church.  Luther burned her publicly, which meant a final break with Rome.  Martin Luther did not mind the church; he wanted it to be easier.  The postulates of the reformers were clear to everyone: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Priests could marry, wear ordinary clothes, must obey laws common to all. </li><li>  <span>The Lutheran Church</span> abandoned the icons and sculptural images of Christ and Our Lady. </li><li>  The Bible is the only source of Christian faith. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral of Trent main decisions" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20957/548256.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The origin of Protestantism </h2><p>  Emperor <span>Charles V</span> decided to intervene.  In 1521, Luther arrived on the Reichstag in the city of Worms.  There he was offered to renounce his views, but Luther refused.  Indignant, the emperor left the meeting.  On the way home, Luther was attacked, but the Saxon elector Frederick the Wise saved him by hiding in his castle.  The absence of Martin Luther did not stop the Reformation. </p><p>  In 1529, Emperor Charles V demanded from apostates to observe exclusively the Catholic religion in the territory of the <span>Holy Roman Empire</span> (essentially Germany).  But 5 principalities supported by 14 cities expressed their protest.  From that moment on, Catholics began to call supporters of the Reformation Protestants. </p><h2>  The Reformation Offensive </h2><p>  Throughout its long history, the Catholic Church did not know the deep shock that the Reformation became for it.  With the support of the rulers of the Catholic countries, papal Rome began an active struggle against the "Protestant heresy."  The system of measures aimed at ending and eradicating reformist ideas and movements was called the Counter-Reformation.  The trigger of these events was the Council of Trent of 1545. </p><p>  The beginning of the attack on the Reformation was marked by the revival of the medieval Inquisition, in the centers of which hundreds of "Protestant heretics" died.  Inquisitors took control of book publishing.  Without their permission it was impossible to print a single work, and "harmful" literature was entered in a special "index of forbidden books" and was subject to burning. </p>

    <h2>  Catholic reform </h2><p>  The Reformation split the Catholic world in half, but in the middle of the 16th century the Europeans hoped that the situation could still be rectified.  It is only necessary that in search of reconciliation both sides take a step towards each other.  So thought not only ordinary believers, but also part of the cardinals and bishops.  From their midst the voices of those who called the Holy See to reform the church sounded more and more insistently. </p><p>  The popes hesitated for a long time before agreeing to a transformation.  Finally, in 1545, Pope Paul III convened the Ecumenical Council.  The venue of the Council of Trent is related to the city of Trento (Italy).  It took place intermittently until 1563, that is, as many as 18 years. </p>

    <h2>  The victory of the reformers of the Catholic Church </h2><p>  From the very beginning, the participants in the cathedral split into two groups - supporters of Catholic reform and its opponents.  In fierce discussions, the latter won.  Under their pressure, the main decisions of the Council of Trent were adopted, consolidating the position of the Catholic faith for centuries. </p><p>  The papacy had to cancel the sale of indulgences, and to create a network of theological seminaries to secure the future of the Catholic Church.  Within their walls, <span>Catholic priests of a</span> new type should be trained, who by their education were not inferior to Protestant preachers. </p>

    <h2>  Council of Trent: its meanings and consequences </h2><p>  The cathedral was the response of Catholicism to Protestantism.  It was convened by Pope Paul III in 1542, however, due to the Franco-German war, the first meeting took place only in 1945.  The cathedral was held by three popes.  There were a total of 25 meetings, but fateful decisions were made only at 13 sessions that concerned faith, customs, or disciplinary rules. </p><p>  The Council of Trent is one of the most significant in the history of the Catholic Church.  The dogmas adopted at the meetings relate to many fundamental issues.  For example, sources of faith were identified, the canon of the books of Holy Scripture was approved.  The Council discussed individual dogmas that were rejected by the Protestants.  Based on discussions, the attitude towards indulgences was revised. </p><p>  The questions of the sacrament of baptism and anointing, Eucharist and repentance, communion, and the sacrifice of St.  Liturgy, matrimony.  This dogmatic series was completed by a decision on purgatory, on veneration of saints, etc. </p><p>  Pope Pius IX approved the cathedral decrees of 1564.  After his death, Pope St.  Pius V published the catechism reaffirmed by the Council, an updated compendium and an updated clergyman. </p><h2>  Cathedral of Trent: Key Decisions </h2><ul><li>  The inviolability of the <span>church hierarchy,</span> mass and confession. </li><li>  Preservation of the seven sacraments, worship of holy icons. </li><li>  Confirmation of the mediating role of the church and the supreme authority of the Pope within it. </li></ul><p>  The Council of Trent laid the foundation for the renewal of Catholicism and the strengthening of church discipline.  He showed that the break with Protestantism was final. </p>

    <h2>  Teachings of the Council of Trent on the Eucharist </h2><p>  The Council of Trent (1545-1563) dealt with the question of the Eucharist throughout its entire duration.  He passed three important decrees. </p><ul><li>  "Decree of the Holy Eucharist" (1551). </li><li>  ‚ÄúDecree on the Communion of Two Species and the Communion of Young Children‚Äù (16.VII.1562). </li><li>  "Decree on the Blessed Sacrifice of the Holy Mass" (17. X.1562). </li></ul><p>  The Council of Trent protects, first of all, the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist and the way in which this presence appears under the images of wine and bread during the consecration - ‚Äútransubstantiatio‚Äù.  Of course, this was a general clarification of the method, because around the detailed explanation of how exactly this ‚Äútransubstantiatio‚Äù occurs, there was debate among theologians. </p><p>  It was previously assumed that Christ is present in the Eucharist after the Liturgy, if the consecrated Body and Blood remain.  Council of Trent confirmed <span>this</span> .  The essential identity between the sacrifice of the Holy Service and the sacrifice of Christ on the cross was also confirmed. </p><p>  After the Council of Trent, theologians again focused on the narrow vision of the Eucharist: on the presence of Christ and on the sacrificial character of the Mass.  This approach convinced the Protestants of their innocence.  Especially much was said about the sacrifice of the Mass, and although it was never denied that this was the only sacrifice of Jesus Christ, an excessive emphasis on the sacrifice of the Service in itself could give the impression that this sacrifice was divorced from the historical one.  In addition, over-emphasizing that the priest is ‚Äúthe second Christ‚Äù during the service of the Eucharist has greatly reduced the role of the loyal people during the liturgy. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The dogmas approved by the Council of Trent for the most part have survived to the present day.  The Catholic Church lives by laws passed 500 years ago.  That is why many consider the Council of Trent the most important since the division of the united church into Catholic and Protestant. </p>
