Someone's secret desires and thoughts, still restless and not quite clear, gradually take shape, then place, and now it is a new scene!  And the acting troupe gives the premiere performance ... </p><p>  Perhaps this would be true for a small town, but in St. Petersburg, where cultural life is in full swing, where a supernova actor star is born daily in its horizon, such an event could have gone unnoticed (think, one more theater).  Only if it is not the Theater Center on Kolomenskaya. </p><h2>  Private theater </h2><p>  It is always difficult to be the first, and it doesn‚Äôt matter which sphere it concerns - space flight, declaration of love or the creation of a private theater.  The theater center on Kolomenskaya (St. Petersburg) initially took shape in the form of the cast and three performances.  That was in 2005. </p><p>  For three years, the center‚Äôs employees did not have their ‚Äúhome‚Äù and performed at the theater venues in the country and abroad, creating a name for themselves and winning the hearts of the audience.  At this time, construction was underway for the first private stage, which was completed in 2008 - it was then that the Theater Center on Kolomenskaya found its place. </p>

    <p>  Thus began the life of a new miracle, and the actors' dream to have their own, with only 100 seats, the theater came true.  Today, in this homely comfortable hall, not only performances are held, but also spectacular shows, musicals and mini-circus performances. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cast </h2><p>  43 Kolomenskaya Street (Theater Center) is the historical part of St. Petersburg.  The street was laid in the 40s of the XVIII century.  At one time, L. Gumilev lived on it (his house-museum is located nearby) and the head of the famous musical group ‚ÄúThe Mighty Handful‚Äù M. Balakirev, as evidenced by the plaque on house number 7. </p><p>  The theater center on Kolomenskaya is a continuation of the cultural traditions of the street, as Petersburgers and city guests paved the route here in search of new experiences.  This was facilitated by the cast of the theater, which includes: </p><ul><li>  <span>Honored artists of the</span> country: Alexander Blok, Olga Kabo, <span>Anna Terekhova,</span> Vladimir Dolinsky, Larisa Dmitrieva, Natalya Nesterova. </li><li>  People's artists: Irina Alferova, <span>Tatyana Tkach,</span> Semyon Spivak, <span>Sergey Migitsko,</span> Valery Kukhareshin. </li><li>  Artists: Andrei Noskov, Yana Radion, Vladimir Voinov, Alexander Samokhin, <span>Vladimir Zaitsev</span> and others. </li><li>  Theater Director Honored Artist of Russia <span>Andrei Zhitinkin.</span> </li></ul><p>  As guests of the theater note in their reviews, there reigns a spiritual atmosphere that cannot be created if the actors are not a family for each other.  The St. Petersburg Theater Center on Kolomenskaya Street is an example of how on a small stage honored and folk artists create side by side with a galaxy of new talents. </p><h2>  The audience craves spectacles </h2><p>  Since the appearance of the first theatrical productions in ancient times, a completely amazing community of people - spectators - has arisen.  They judge and admire, boo and become fans.  Each theater has its own (albeit small) number of fans. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On Kolomenskaya often you can become not only a spectator of the performance, but also its participant.  For example, the Show Dance program is not only dances combined with humor, but also master classes for the audience. </p>

    <p>  The production ‚ÄúFrom Seville to Granada‚Äù takes guests to the hot Spanish sun to the sounds of passionate flamenco. </p><p>  ‚Äú100% Hit‚Äù is a musical review that has no analogues in the country.  It is dedicated to the love that the actors sing about, representing the domestic hits of the last decade.  Like everything in this theater, these shows are unforgettable productions that leave a sense of celebration and tenderness in the soul for a long time.  So say those who saw them. </p><h2>  The audience craves bread </h2><p>  It turns out that the days have not passed when the audience came to huge arenas for the sake of bread and circuses.  The theater on Kolomenskaya street, 43 is designed so that just in front of the stage is its restaurant.  It is small, with only eleven tables, but this already makes this place not quite ordinary. </p>

    <p>  The offer of a delicious dinner to the game of talented actors is very popular with the public, which suggests that since the days of ancient Rome and gladiatorial fights, not the audience, but the menu has changed.  The choice of dishes is quite large, and the wine list is a match for them. </p><p>  What could be more tempting than a delicious dinner within walking distance of a scene where new, sometimes funny, or sad events unfold every minute?  It looks more like a gourmet dish with a spicy gourmet sauce than just a theatrical performance. </p><h2>  Cabaret </h2><p>  There are no analogues to the cabaret ballet Bizet Lizu in the country.  This amazingly talented dance troupe has won viewers in Europe, the USA, Israel, China and Mexico.  Every Friday, the group gives a concert for citizens and visitors of St. Petersburg. </p>

    <p>  Pajamas for Six is ‚Äã‚Äãa sparkling comedy about a love triangle in the French style.  The main roles in the play are performed by Andrei Sokolov and Irina Alferova.  For a little more than two hours, viewers get acquainted with the life of an ordinary French family, full of passions, showdowns and love troubles.  Only the French are able to find so much laughter in solving the main problem between married people - who cheated on whom?  As the audience noted in the reviews, the production is distinguished by the brilliant play of actors who managed to convey the flavor of the French adultery on the Russian stage. </p><h2>  Love in french </h2><p>  ‚ÄúHold me tight, love‚Äù is another comedy that the Theater Center on Kolomenskaya presents to the audience.  The reviews are the most positive, as the reporter (Andrei Noskov) is in the center of the plot, who has fallen into an old castle where three interesting and deprived of male attention women live alone.  One can only guess about the events and passions that took place there ... Or you can buy a ticket and watch a bright and cheerful first-line performance. </p><h2>  Passion for love </h2><p>  ‚ÄúA bath of rose petals‚Äù is a detective story about love and betrayal with a happy end.  One of the heroes of the performance is flamenco dance, as the plot is twisted around the production of "Carmen".  All passions and intrigues, broken hearts and love found - all this happens against the backdrop of temperamental Spanish music.  Who saw this play live, speaks of its amazing energy. </p>

    <p>  Theater actors presented these performances to the audience even when they did not have their own stage.  Now you can freely visit St. Petersburg: the Theater Center on Kolomenskaya will plunge you into the abyss of eternal human passions raging on a small stage. </p><p>  They talk and write about this theater center, scolded and praised him, admired him and did not accept him.  They don‚Äôt understand how you can have dinner during the performance or become a participant in it.  But, probably, this is what delights his fans.  Young people do not aspire to classical theater; modern people prefer to go beyond the usual framework for the sake of new experiences. </p><p>  The charm in the novelty - this can be said about the theater on Kolomenskaya Street, which knows how to surprise and present surprises to fans. </p>
