    <h2>  Trips to Cuba: what you need to know about them </h2><p>  Despite the closeness in ideology, Russian tourists discovered Cuba relatively recently: five to ten years ago.  And so far, only the richest of our compatriots have stepped on the Island that defeated the revolution.  Yes, trips to Cuba can not be called budget.  But this is solely due to the high cost of the transatlantic flight.  Therefore, if you have a dream to see the mausoleum of Commander Che Guevara, smoke a self-rolled cigar, lie down on the white beaches of Varadero and drink coffee in the bar where Hemingway himself has been, you need to know some tricks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Firstly, when to go to Cuba.  The climate on Liberty Island has only two seasons: high and the so-called wet.  But daily rains do not yet mean round-the-clock showers.  Precipitation lasts a maximum of two hours, and they do not in any way affect the temperature of air and water. </p><p>  Secondly, you need to constantly monitor stocks of airlines.  It is during the rainy season that you can most often catch attractive offers. </p><p>  And thirdly, travel with children.  Often hotels lodge and feed for free small guests who are not yet twelve.  And it is very economical.  A regular <span>tour to Cuba:</span> seven days in a three-, four- or five-star All Inclusive hotel, together with air travel and transfer to the hotel - starts from forty thousand rubles per person. </p>

    <h2>  Resort Features </h2><p>  Bellevue Puntarena Playa Caleta Resort 4 * hotel is located a thirty-minute walk from the center of Varadero.  By the way, water surrounds the hotel on two sides: on the one hand, the ocean, and on the other, the Paso de Malo canal. </p><p>  What is famous for Varadero?  First of all, with its beaches.  The sand in this part of the <span>island is white,</span> like flour of the highest quality and grinding.  Plus, palm trees and other exotic plants on the shore.  Another "trick" Varadero - coral reefs.  They protect the coast from the waves and like a magnet pull divers towards themselves.  Therefore, the main contingent of tourists at the resort are young athletic guys.  In order for divers to have something to do after sunset, Varadero has many discos and nightclubs.  Snow-white beaches and a gentle approach to a calm sea like a lake attract families with small children.  Many hotels in Varadero are on the first line and offer all-inclusive meals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Puntarena Playa Caleta Resort 4 * is a seven-story building.  It was built a long time ago, but in 2005 it was completely renovated in accordance with modern standards.  Then the hotel was called simply ‚ÄúPlaya Caleta‚Äù.  Now the hotel has acquired a second twin building, which is called Puntarena.  Between them is a huge swimming pool, tropical garden paths, a bar.  The territory at the hotel, according to reviews, is large, like a country hotel.  The buildings themselves have a lot of greenery.  The feeling that you live in the jungle, and not in a seven-story building.  In addition, the hotel has a good location.  For all excursions, tourists are taken from him last, and brought first.  A free shuttle bus runs to the center of Varadero from the hotel.  There is a lighthouse near the hotel.  Pelicans like to gather there in the evenings.  Birds are almost tamed by tourists who feed them fish. </p><h2>  Guest rooms </h2><p>  For a surcharge at the reception in the buildings of Bellevue Puntarena Playa Caleta Resort 4 * you will be given a room with a view of the ocean.  But this is not necessary, assure reviews, since the second half of the rooms also overlook the water, only the bay.  The rooms may seem cramped (especially triple), but this is the style of Cuba.  Each room has its own balcony. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The bathroom is equipped with a shower and has a hairdryer.  The technical facilities include satellite TV, air conditioning, a safety deposit box and a minibar.  If you leave a tip, then they will be cleaned very diligently and weave all kinds of figures from towels.  But even without financial encouragement, linen and towels are changed every day.  There are no subdivisions into the categories of rooms in the hotel.  The soundproofing in the rooms is good. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Those tourists who booked "All Inclusive" claim that this program operates around the clock.  This means that you can hardly leave the bars and restaurants.  Alcohol is very good, especially dark rum and various cocktails ‚ÄúPina Colada‚Äù, ‚ÄúCuba Libre‚Äù and others. </p><p>  The cafe serves delicious ice cream and serves natural coffee and fresh fruit for breakfast.  As for food in the main restaurant, which serves customers in buffet style, it corresponds to the declared four stars.  There are always several meat, fish and vegetable dishes.  In addition to the main ‚ÄúVista al Mar‚Äù, the Bellevue Puntarena Playa Caleta Resort 4 * hotel has three a la carte restaurants with Creole, Italian and Chinese cuisines. </p><p>  Some tourists only ordered breakfast, given the fact that food prices in Cuba are quite low.  Most guests were satisfied with the morning meal.  They serve everything that Europeans are used to eating for breakfast: sausages, toasts, granola, yogurt.  Reviews mention that they give a lot of fruits, including exotic ones. </p>

    <h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  The canal from the city once served as a pier for small ships.  Now there are no boats there, but no beach either.  Everyone bathes in the ocean.  The beach in the Bellevue Puntarena Playa Caleta Resort 4 * hotel complex is beyond praise.  Even those reviews that described the hotel in dark colors sing praise on its coast: white sand and crystal clear turquoise water. </p><p>  In the resort of Varadero, the hotel has its own diving school.  There are plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas on the hotel's own beach.  The hotel complex has a huge swimming pool stretching windingly throughout.  On its square there is also no shortage of beach equipment. </p>

    <h2>  Bellevue Puntarena Playa Caleta Resort 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists liked the Puntarena Playa Caleta Resort Hotel.  Some say that the hotel is fully consistent with its four stars, while others even believe that it is worth five.  The rooms, although small, are equipped with new furniture, and the view from the window is such that you forget about all the minor flaws.  The staff is very helpful and friendly, many speak Russian. </p><p>  Tourists are advised not to stay at the hotel, but to travel actively, because the prices in Cuba are low.  To get started, you can ride on Varadero on an open top bus (5 cookies).  Then go to Havana - this is a "mast-si" in Cuba.  Tourists recommend paying only the transfer (60 cookies in both directions) without a guide.  In Varadero itself, you should visit the Varajikakos Park, where there is a cave with bats. </p>
