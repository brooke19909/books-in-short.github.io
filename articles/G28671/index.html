People most often prefer well-known destinations and artificially promoted travel brands.  And completely in vain.  Sometimes it is useful to turn off the main directions, you can see a lot of interesting things.  Sights of Sudak deserve attention.  And life in this town is calmer and cheaper.  There is less fuss and more comfort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of zander" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/280236.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Sudak, <span>Crimea.</span></strong>  <strong><span>Attractions</span> and features</strong> </p><p>  It would already be possible to go to Sudak only because there are comfortable clean beaches and relatively inexpensive housing.  There is less crush characteristic of other Crimean cities.  But besides a high-level beach holiday, the sights of Sudak undoubtedly deserve attention.  The city is located in one of the most beautiful places of the <span>Crimean coast,</span> between wooded mountain slopes, approaching the coastline.  And besides the mountain cliffs, majestic ruins of the ancient <span>Genoese fortress</span> rise above it <span>.</span>  Of course, the "ruins" of this ancient <span>fortification</span> can be called very conditionally.  Throughout the world, not so many medieval fortresses have been preserved in such a degree of integrity.  The building was erected in the fourteenth century by Italians, immigrants from Genoa, from building materials taken from defensive structures that already existed on this site.  Over the centuries of its history, the fortress withstood many sieges and repeatedly passed from hand to hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zander sights" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/280237.jpg" width="498"></div>  Today, the object was restored, as well as other sights of Sudak.  It is maintained in good condition and is actively used in a variety of ways.  Festivals of medieval exotic lovers are held here and films about this era are made.  More expressive historical scenery for this is simply impossible to imagine.  In the fortress you can safely spend the whole day.  There are twelve battle towers and several rows of walls.  The consular castle on top and the museum in the building of the ancient mosque of Padishah Jami.  The top offers a beautiful view of the city and the surrounding area.  Those who like to take pictures should come here in the evening.  The views of the shadows from the walls and towers against the backdrop of the setting sun on the sea, allow you to make expressive shots.  Listing other sights of Sudak, it should first be noted the Musk Jami mosque.  Noteworthy is the Choban-Kule tower. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sudak Crimea Attractions" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/280238.jpg" width="491"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Zander.</strong>  <strong>Attractions Beyond</strong> </p><p>  In an inaccessible place, at the foot of <span>Mount Sokol,</span> are the remains of an ancient monastery of the Byzantine era.  He was busted during the conquest of Crimea by the Ottoman Turks.  From Sudak to it about four kilometers.  You can get here only on foot along the narrow and winding mountain paths.  In general, the surroundings of the city are rich in expressive natural objects.  A little higher in the mountains is the Grand Crimean Canyon - one of the most beautiful places on the entire southern coast of the peninsula.  It is quite possible to devote a campaign there all day. </p>
