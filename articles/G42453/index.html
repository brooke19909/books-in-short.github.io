This company dictates its brands, introduces new products and is a leader in sales and net profit.  The presence of an iPhone does not surprise anyone, many choose this particular phone for their design, uniqueness and popularity.  Indeed, the interface is very clear for everyone, the increased data security and other advantages of the iPhone among its competitors make it a symbol of the 21st century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iphone5pricesinpakistan.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black and White iPhone" class="if uuid-2663510" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99369/2663510.jpg"></div><p>  Today, the line of this phone has become much more affordable than before.  This is due to the fact that last year's iPhones are falling in price, and it is not difficult to guess that the earlier the smartphone was released, the cheaper it is at the moment.  Since last years, the immortal classic of black / white iPhone palettes has been diluted with new intermediate and additional shades.  Next, we will consider which <span>iPhone is better</span> - black or white.  Let us track how the colors changed and how they harmonized with the design. </p><h2>  What to choose - a white or black iPhone? </h2><p>  The priority of choice must certainly fall to your taste, for example, if the user does not like the white color at all, then it is impossible to force him to use a white iPhone.  Of course, there are a number of subtleties that will directly affect the choice of device - your profession, wardrobe, lifestyle, and so on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New iPhone 10" class="if uuid-2667173" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99369/2667173.jpg"></div><h2>  The advantages of white coloring </h2><p>  If you do not take into account the fact that, according to statistics, girls buy white colors a little more often, then such a coloring will interest everyone who wants to stand out against the background of their environment.  The white color of the flagship marks its brightness and attracts the attention of people.  In practice, it is noted that on a white iPhone does not appear highly noticeable fingerprints.  One of the main advantages of this palette is its excellent combination with any iPhone cases.  That is why the light gamut is the most suitable choice for girls who have more than a dozen covers in stock. </p><div class="photo" data-original="easyskinz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="White iPhone on background" class="if uuid-2663521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99369/2663521.jpg"></div><h2>  The disadvantages of white coloring </h2><p>  Users who actively use their device know that for the first time a black screen bezel against the white front panel hurts the eye.  The same situation with the Home button - on many versions it is also framed.  According to most people, white is less practical than black.  Defects in the form of scratches and scuffs on the back of the case are visible.  In addition to this, the smartphone quickly loses its unique appearance if worn casually without a protective case. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.cgtrader.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="White iPhone 10" class="if uuid-2667183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99369/2667183.jpg"></div><h2>  The benefits of black.  disadvantages </h2><p>  A classic color that will never go out of fashion and hearts of those who value style and rigor.  It suits absolutely everyone, without exception, but enjoys special demand among business personalities.  It goes well with a wardrobe of any complexity, taste and even nationality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black iPhone Case" class="if uuid-2663540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99369/2663540.jpg"></div><p>  The phone of this color has exceptional practicality - it is barely noticeable scuffs and dirt.  Basically, the owners of such an iPhone like to wear it in black, transparent cases or without a case.  Great value for perfectionists is the monotony of color.  Sometimes there are fingerprints on the back of the case, color incompatibility with many bright iPhone cases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Two black iPhones" class="if uuid-2663630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99369/2663630.jpg"></div><h2>  Alternative colors and their features </h2><ul><li>  iPhone 4 / 4S.  This series had two iPhone colors - black and white.  The rustproof metal edging of the phone goes well with both colors. </li><li>  iPhone 5C.  Added new iPhone case colors - white, yellow, green, blue, pink.  The case is made of durable plastic, it does not bend during bumps and drops, the paint does not peel off.  However, against the background of bright colors, scratches are visible, which are often clogged with dust and dirt. </li><li>  iPhone 5S  One of the most popular models of past years.  Decent value for money + style.  Colors - silver, gold, "gray space".  Users of Apple technology really liked these types of colors, therefore, the following models began to be released not in monotonous colors (black, white), but with the addition of a gray iPhone gradient - white and black, which tend to a gray shade. </li><li>  iPhone SE  A good attempt by developers and technologists to return to their beloved many proportions of the iPhone 5S, only with improved internal characteristics.  Available colors - "space gray", "pink gold", silver, gold. </li><li>  iPhone 6/6 Plus.  The design of the case has been updated - the rear of the case has been changed.  In general, the phone has become thinner and larger, which allowed us to create a new trend for the new Iphone models.  Available silver, gold colors and the color "space gray." </li><li>  iPhone 6S / 6S Plus.  Improved model of the "six" + the new color of the <span>iPhone "pink</span> gold". </li><li>  iPhone 7/7 Plus.  Preservation of proportions of past models, however, the structure of the back of the case has been changed.  The 7 Plus has revolutionized the design of the camera.  An expanded line of colors has appeared - gold, silver, red, black, "black onyx", "pink gold". </li><li>  iPhone 8/8 Plus.  Changed the back of the case.  The company decided to reduce the color choice by two positions.  Now the owners have colors - gold, silver, red, space gray. </li><li>  iPhone X. A complete redesign of the phone.  The lack of a front panel, the Home button, as well as a total change in the appearance of the camera captivated the hearts of millions of owners of previous versions.  Apple provided a choice of only two colors - silver and gray space. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.macworld.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black iphone screen" class="if uuid-2667190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99369/2667190.jpg"></div><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Deciding on and choosing any color of the phone is quite difficult.  The future owner should build on his preferences, but do not forget about the nuances of a particular color, its compatibility with covers and other accessories.  To date, the choice of a white or black iPhone is slightly incorrect in relation to models newer than the iPhone 5S.  In this case, the question is whether to choose a light or dark shade, or another color. </p>
