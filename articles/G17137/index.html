    <p>  In this article we will look at how to crochet a sheep.  The diagram and description will help us with this.  And also, in addition to toys, we will figure out how to tie a lamb-tack. </p><h2>  Preparation of materials for lamb tack </h2><p>  To understand how to crochet a sheep, the scheme and description of which will be proposed below, you should first select the threads of the desired colors.  Also, for each sheep, four beads, a pair of eyes, thread and a needle will be needed.  Do not forget about the scissors.  Some parts need glue to hold together.  Best in such cases is ‚ÄúCrystal Moment‚Äù </p><h2>  How to crochet a sheep (diagram and description): tack </h2><p>  First, we take that yarn, the color of which will be the main color in the sheep, and we knit a circle of suitable diameter from it.  We use single crochet columns.  For this, any scheme that allows you to connect a circle is suitable.  For example, such. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a sheep a diagram and description potholder" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/805777.jpg" width="394"></div>  The number of rows that you will get based on the results of the work will depend on the desired size of the future tack, as well as on the thickness of the yarn used.  If your yarn is not thick enough, then fold it in half, or maybe three times.  After all, the purpose of the tack is to protect your hands from the heat of heated dish handles.  And this is impossible if the thickness of the material is insufficient for these purposes.  After the last circle is created, we begin to tie it with ‚Äúfans‚Äù.  A fan should consist of five columns, each of which has one double crochet.  The wavy edge will imitate sheep curls.  You can leave it in this form, or you can tie the finished part with contrasting threads, using columns without a crochet for this.  In the process of tying, you must not forget that any tack should have a loop for hanging it.  To create it, simply tie in the middle of the work a chain consisting of air loops in the amount of, for example, fifteen pieces.  That's all.  Our main item is ready.

Now we knit a circle as large as the face should be.  These are approximately three or four rows.  As soon as the work is completed without breaking the threads, we create ears from the air loops, and carefully hide the ends of the threads on the wrong side. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a sheep a diagram and description of a photo" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/805779.jpg" width="400"></div>  This is the easiest way.  But you can tie the oval ears separately, using columns without a crochet, and then sew them to the muzzle of a lamb.  The hairstyle can be made in the form of a cloud from a contrasting thread, and to attach this hairstyle to the head.  In knitting, use the same technique as when tying the main part.

    <h2>  Create the legs </h2><p>  Now it was the turn of the legs.  They can be made very simple.  Tie chains of air stitches of the required length, one chain for two legs.  From both edges we attach a bead.  Just put it on a chain and tie a knot.  And now it remains to simply attach these legs to the bottom.  Pull them into any hole and tie.  Each sheep should end up with four legs.  It remains only to glue the eyes. </p><p>  That's all.  We studied one of the options for crocheting a sheep.  The scheme and description of creating a tack will certainly help even beginner needlewomen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Preparation of materials for knitting a toy sheep </h2><p>  Let us consider below how to crochet a sheep (scheme and description for beginners) in a dress.  This option will appeal to any girl.  And not only the baby, but also quite an adult lady.  This toy will not only be able to become a friend in games for the little princess, but will also decorate the interior.  How <span>to crochet a sheep?</span>  The master class requires the following materials and tools.  First, you need yarn.  Choose the color according to your taste.  It is better if the yarn is soft and pleasant to the touch.  This is especially important if the toy is intended for children.  Secondly, you need a hook, which is selected accordingly yarn.  Usually, the number of the suitable hook is indicated on the label.  A filler is certainly necessary, as a synthetic winterizer or synthetic winterizer is best suited.  You will also need scissors, a needle and threads to match the yarn. </p><h2>  How to crochet a sheep (diagram and description): toy (head) </h2><p>  Knitting should begin with the muzzle and end in the back.  Its stuffing is made in the process of knitting.  The head consists of 40 rows.  In the 1st circle we perform six single crochet.  In the 2nd, we knit 2 single crochet into each column of the previous circle.  In total, 12 columns must be completed.  In the 3rd circle, we knit 1 single crochet column, then 2 single crochet columns in the next column of the first circle.  And repeat this combination 6 times.  In total, 18 columns should be knitted. </p><p>  In the 4th circle - 2 single crochet and 2 single crochet in the subsequent column of the 30th circle.  Repeat all 6 times.  A total of 24. In the 5th circle - 3 single crochet and 2 single crochet in one loop (also 6 times) - 30 columns.  Sixth circle - 4 single crochet columns and 2 in one loop (6 times) - 36 columns.  In the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th circles, respectively, 5, 6, 7 and 8 columns between the two in one loop.  Everywhere combinations are repeated 6 times, resulting in 42, 48, 54 and 60 columns, respectively, in each circle. </p><p>  Then, from the 11th to the 14th circle, just single crochet columns fit into each column in front of the running circle.  Next, the 15th, 17th, 19th and 21st circles are knitted with the following combination: 8, 7, 6 and 5 columns, respectively, and one decrease.  This combination in each circle is repeated 6 times.  And in the 16th, 18th and 20th rows, ordinary single crochet columns fit into each column in front of the running circle.  Total in the 21st circle you get 36 columns.  In the 22nd and 23rd are also ordinary single crochet columns.  In the 24th circle there are 16 single crochet columns, 2 single crochet columns, then 2, 2 single crochet columns, 16 single crochet columns.  In the 25th circle - 17 columns, 2 in one, 3 columns, 2 in one, 16 columns without a crochet.  In the 26th circle - 18 single crochets, two in one, 4 columns, 2 single columns, 16 single crochets.  Circle 27 - 16 single crochet columns, 2 single, 2, 2 single columns, then 5, 2 single, 2 columns, 2 single columns, 13 single crochets.  Only 46 columns. </p><p>  Circle 28 - 17 single crochet, 2 single, 3 single column, 2 single, 6 single column, 3 single column, 2 single, 13 single crochet.  A total of 50 columns.  And the 29th and 30th circles are just single crochet columns.  In the 31st circle, the combination of ‚Äú8 columns plus 1 decrease‚Äù is repeated five times.  The result should be 45 columns.  In the 32nd circle we knit columns without a crochet.  In the 33rd, 34th, 35th, 36th, 37th, 38th and 39th circles we knit this combination: 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 column, respectively, plus one decrease.  This combination should be repeated five times in each circle.  As a result, the 39th row should have 10 columns.  In the fortieth circle, five decreases are made and the thread is fixed.  For hairstyles, you can use grass yarn. </p><h2>  Knitting torso </h2><p>  To tie a torso for a sheep, which will also be a dress, you will need yarn of two colors.  One of them is the color of the body of the sheep, or simply white, and the second is the color of the dress.  The body fits in according to the same principle as the head, only of a larger size.  Start knitting from the bottom, with the thread that will denote the body.  Having knitted somewhere one fourth of the whole body, attach a thread of a different color and knit to the end.  Stuff your torso as you knit.  As soon as the work is completed, attach a thread of <span>contrasting color</span> at the place of transition from one color to another and tie a pair of rows.  After that, knit an openwork skirt according to the scheme. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a sheep a master class for beginners" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/806449.jpg" width="458"></div>  It was described above how to <span>crochet a sheep (diagram and description).</span>  The photos presented here will probably be able to help you with this.
