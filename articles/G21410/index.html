    <h2>  Alexey Mikhailovich </h2><p>  After the death of Mikhail Fedorovich in 1645, Alexei Mikhailovich took the throne.  During his life he carried out military and monetary reforms, and also united Russia with Ukraine in 1654. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main point in the military reform was the massive creation of regiments of the newest system: soldiers, dragoons, and raites.  They formed the backbone of the new army of the king.  For this, a large number of European military specialists were hired. </p>

    <p>  The monetary <span>reform of Aleksei Mikhailovich</span> is considered a failure, and only under Peter I began minting coins, which were not inferior in quality to European ones. </p><h2>  Fedor III </h2><p>  The reins of power from Alexei Mikhailovich passed to the son of Fedor III.  The young tsar was ill a lot, and the power was actually in the hands of Patriarch Joachim, as well as I. Miloslavsky and A. Matveev for some time. </p><p>  However, six months later the throne was completely in the hands of <span>Fyodor Alekseevich.</span>  Despite a short reign, he managed to initiate important reforms and actions: courtyard direct taxes, the introduction of genealogy books and the abolition of promotion for the merits of ancestors. </p>

    <h2>  Dmitry Pavlovich </h2><p>  After the death of his mother during childbirth and the exile of his father, he lived in the house of his uncle, Sergei Alexandrovich, and his wife Elizaveta Fedorovna.  After the tragic death of the prince and the departure of his wife to the monastery, Dmitry Romanov moved to the Alexander Palace to the emperor and stayed there until 1913.  Later, he inherited the palace of Beloselsky-Belozersky in St. Petersburg from his uncle. </p><p>  As you know, Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich Romanov was implicated in the death of Rasputin.  Grigory Efimovich was killed on December 17, 1916.  The conspirators were Vladimir Purishkevich, <span>Felix Yusupov</span> and Dmitry Romanov.  The evidence about the crime was confused and at odds with the evidence found.  According to the French diplomat Moris Paleolog, Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich Romanov - an elegant young man, but quite impulsive and frivolous - got involved in this incident with grief. </p><p>  First he wrote and swore to the emperor that he was not involved in the atrocities, later admitted in a letter to Yusupov: ‚ÄúFor me, this fact will always remain a dark spot on conscience ... Murder is always murder and will remain, no matter how you try to attach mystical significance to it!‚Äù  He was sent to exile in Persia by Nicholas II.  There, Grand Duke Dmitry Romanov joined the British, after which he emigrated first to the capital of Great Britain, and then to Paris. </p><p>  In 1925, in the French city of Biarritz, married Audrey Emery, who changed his religion and name for his sake.  In 1928 she gave birth to a prince heir.  Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich Romanov divorced his wife shortly after the birth of his son. </p><p>  In the 1930s, he joined the Young Russians party, which imitated the fascists of Italy.  After some time, he became disillusioned with the prospects of <span>restoring the monarchy in Russia</span> and left public life. </p><p>  In 1939, <span>Grand Duke</span> Dmitry Pavlovich Romanov fell ill with tuberculosis and went to Switzerland for treatment.  Having recovered from his illness, he again fell ill, this time from uremia.  And he has not recovered. </p><p>  But on it the Romanov family did not end.  The descendants of this great dynasty are still alive today and are scattered all over the world.  Many of them continue their social and charitable activities. </p>
