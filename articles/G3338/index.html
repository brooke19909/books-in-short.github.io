  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choosing a combi steamer</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Well-known company Rayional, in 1976 made an explosion in the industrial market.  They released a versatile machine that combined several functions: a double boiler and a convection oven.  The machine allowed to save time, water, electricity.  The final product in the process of preparation retained trace elements and vitamins.  Products were processed under low-temperature steam, which made it possible to prepare dishes for people who were on a diet.  Over time, the combi steamers improved, the operation of automatic preparation of the product appeared.  The first stoves were quite expensive, not every catering establishment could use them.  Now it‚Äôs hard to meet a cooking point wherever a combi steamer is used. </p><p>  Cars of various companies are produced.  For example, Apach (Italy), Rational, CONVOTHERM (Germany).  German-made cars enjoy success; they are considered the most economical and functional.  The equipment manufactured here is steadily improving.  There is one drawback - the high cost.  The equipment of Italian manufacturers is distinguished by a large number of manufactured machines.  They are simpler in technology.  The quality, unfortunately, is much inferior to the German manufacturer.  The USA, Denmark, Sweden, Czech Republic, France, Spain also offer a large assortment of machines, but in the industrial market they have established themselves as mid-level manufacturers. <noindex>  <span>Buy combi steamer</span> </noindex>  or you can order via the Internet, where an excellent catalog is attached.  But the question immediately arises, what kind of car to buy?  The choice is very large, although they are universal. <br>  There are electric and gas combi steamers.  Since the equipment will be used quite often, a gas machine will be more economical, if there are conditions for this. <br>  There is another division of machines into confectionery and gastronomic.  In the first, baking sheets are used, in others, gastronome containers.  Suppose a cafe is based on baking confectionery, then the choice should fall on the combi oven. <br>  Machines, as already mentioned multifunctional.  Consequently, the price will depend on this.  Suppose a small cafe will use it to warm up the pies, which means that you have to choose, you need a little functional device. <br>  Size also plays a role in choosing a combi steamer.  It should be determined for how many people the food will be prepared.  Perhaps the acquisition of several cars, if the restaurant serves up to 3000 people. <br>  The companies that offer the product guarantee that it is reliable in use.  This is not always the case, so you should pay attention to the appearance.  If we talk about the reliability of the case, which plays one of the main functions, you should know that it must be massive.  This is when thick metal hinges, a heavy door, powerful legs, a heavy control panel.  The frame of the apparatus should be selected welded.  The fasteners should, not made with screws, but with bolts, the working chamber is sealed and durable.  Tena need to choose with thick tubes. <br>  It will be correct if you choose equipment in the store, when you can review and test it at work, and not from pictures on the Internet. </p></div></article>
