People who have been here once leave this place in their hearts.  The main feature of the hotel is its location.  It is located in the palazzo, and its age is more than 200 years.  Designers were able to surprisingly competently and beautifully combine delicate classics and modern design forms.  This style is felt starting from the hotel lobby.  Milan is a rather noisy and crowded city in itself, and this tires even the most seasoned people.  This hotel is like an island of peace and comfort, where you can simply hide from the hustle and bustle of the day.  The complex is located behind one of the central banks.  It would seem, a strange neighborhood, the center of the city, what kind of peace can we talk about?  But apparently this is magic, since the rooms do not hear the noise and bustle of the city.  The staff here is just a miracle.  Russian will feel at home, because at the reception they speak Russian, abroad this is a pleasant surprise.
