Where is Strasbourg</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When you get into this two-faced city, at first it‚Äôs hard to figure out where Strasbourg is.  It seems that on the map it belongs to France.  Only half-timbered <span>houses, the German</span> language on the streets, and the name itself testifies: the city is replenished with an endless series of ‚Äúburgs‚Äù of Germany.  And this duality is not surprising.  After all, the entire province of Alsace, whose capital is Strasbourg, repeatedly passed from Germany to France and vice versa, was the subject of numerous disputes and even wars.  But the location in the border zone only enriched this amazing city.  Here you can feel the atmosphere of both countries - reconciled among themselves in a united Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Strasbourg" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/395789.jpg" width="584"></div>

    <h2>  How to come here </h2><p>  Numerous travel agencies offer tours to Strasbourg, but it is much better to go to this mystical city on your own.  Slowly walking along the narrow streets, stopping on the bridges, you are more imbued with the atmosphere of this place than running around it with a noisy crowd of unfamiliar people.  How to get to Strasbourg?  Unfortunately, there is no direct flight from Russia, but there are convenient connecting routes via Paris, Prague or <span>Amsterdam.</span>  <span>The airport</span> is located a few kilometers from the city, and you can get there by navette train, which runs every quarter of an hour.  Based on the proximity to the German border, you can consider this option: by plane to Frankfurt or Karlsruhe, and from there by train or bus to Strasbourg.  On the TGV high-speed train, the journey from Paris to the capital of Alsace will take only two and a half hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to settle </h2><p>  All sights of Strasbourg, with few exceptions, are concentrated in the center.  The historical part of the city is declared by UNESCO a world heritage of mankind.  Therefore, it is natural that hotels located in ancient half-timbered houses are not cheap.  You will find more democratic housing in new areas, fortunately, since the XIV century the city has grown.  With public transport in Strasbourg, everything is in order.  On a tram that looks like a spaceship, it's worth a ride out of purely tourist interest.  And in order to make their stay in Strasbourg completely budgetary, many experienced travelers prefer to live ... in neighboring Germany.  Having crossed the bridge over the Rhine by bus, you find yourself in the German town of Kehl, where prices - and not just housing - will pleasantly surprise you.  By the way, many French go there just to have lunch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="River in strasbourg" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/395790.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  We start exploring the city </h2><p>  Our goal is the ‚ÄúBig Island‚Äù, on which the ancient Strasbourg is located.  The map shows that this piece of land, washed by the Ile River from all sides, is not as huge as its name says, and you can get around it in one day.  What do we do first?  Before setting off to explore the sights of the city, we will go to the tourist information service center.  There you can buy the Strasbourg Pass.  This ticket will give you the opportunity to visit some museums for free, as well as ride a river bus at a discount.  There are several tourist information centers in the city, one of them is available at the railway station.  The city center is almost the entire pedestrian, but you can drive to the Big Island by tram. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours in Strasbourg" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/395791.jpg" width="423"></div>

To get outside the walls, it was necessary to cross the bridge, which was guarded.  It was covered, made of wood.  Over the centuries, this material has deteriorated, and the roof of most bridges has disappeared.  Now the river Ile is ringed by transitions from stone.  Having examined the church of St. John, we enter the city and get to the embankment of Paris.  Further it is possible to advance as you like, without moving away, however, from the river.  Each bridge has its own history and is beautiful in its own way.  Along the way, you can visit the church of St. Peter-Youth, the palace of the archbishop and, finally, approach the main attraction of Strasbourg - the cathedral.  Do not rush to go inside.  Go around the majestic building from the outside, admire the statues on the portal, known from history books as classic art of the Middle Ages.  Now leave the cathedral square, go around the Rogan Palace and leave on the pier of tourist water trams.  An exciting walk through the canals and locks of Strasbourg awaits you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral in Strasbourg" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/395792.jpg" width="225"></div>

    <h2>  A short history of the city </h2><p>  These nice boats in the cold weather glaze with <span>panoramic windows,</span> so that on board you can take great pictures.  You will be transported through all channels, and an audio guide will familiarize you with the fascinating history of the city.  Indeed, without it, one cannot understand the many of its sights.  To begin with, the name itself - Strasbourg - means "city at the crossroads."  Perhaps the unique position in the heart of Western Europe led to the fact that important EU institutions are located here?  After all, Strasbourg is not only the capital of the department of the Lower Rhine and the province of Alsace.  It houses the Parliament and the Council of Europe.  But in order to look at these modern and interesting buildings from the point of view of architectural thought, one should leave the Big Island.  A place for settlement in the early Middle Ages was chosen very successful.  There is so much water in the city that it is not even clear which river flows in Strasbourg.  Is that all - Ile?  Yes, its very lower reaches.  Another kilometer or two - and the river flows into a mighty water artery, the Rhine, which in combination is also the state border.  But the city also has many man-made canals, gateways and dams.  From the Rhone through the Rhine you can sail to the Marne.  The abundance of water also determined the main branch of the city‚Äôs economy - leather. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Strasbourg map" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/395795.jpg" width="409"></div>

    <h2>  Little france </h2><p>  A water bus will certainly take you to the interesting sights of Strasbourg.  This ‚ÄúPetit France‚Äù is a whole area dotted with locks and nice bridges.  Why such an interesting name?  It‚Äôs not because the French community lived here among the German burghers, as it might seem at first glance.  Previously, a house of tolerance was located here and girls of easy virtue worked.  Unbridled manners respectable German matrons attributed only to French women.  In addition, a military hospital was located here.  It often treated syphilis, which was formerly called the "French disease."  What really happened?  One way or another, and Petit France now conquers with its idyllic beauty and tranquility.  He deserves to come here again and take a walk along the bridges, along the narrow streets in colors between the half-timbered houses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is Strasbourg" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/398124.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Cathedral in Strasbourg </h2><p>  The ship approaches the same pier, from where it departed, and therefore we return to the cathedral.  The Notre Dame Church began to be erected in 1015, and finished in 1439.  One of the towers remained unfinished.  But this did not prevent the building until the XIX century to lead in height among all the <span>Gothic cathedrals.</span>  It is worth overcoming laziness and climb through 300 steps to the observation deck of a single tower.  From there, from a 142-meter height, the whole of Strasbourg is at a glance.  Have you already admired openwork arcades, a Gothic facade, stone carvings and sculptures of the exterior?  Then let's go inside.  An ancient organ, stained-glass windows, paintings and frescoes, unique in beauty, will surely attract your attention.  Guess your coming to the temple by 12.30.  At this time, the <span>astronomical clock</span> begins to beat <span>.</span>  This mechanism of the 18th century gives a ‚Äúpuppet show‚Äù every day: sculptures of <span>12 apostles</span> come out and worship Christ, who conquers Death. </p><h2>  Other sights of Strasbourg </h2><p>  What else to visit in the city?  Museum of Alsatian Culture, Rogan Palace, Botanical Garden, old Cammerzel House, Vauban Dam, European Bridge.  What to try in Strasbourg?  Alsace's young <span>green wine</span> , <span>onion pie,</span> German sausages.  You can also look into the beer museum and walk through the street of tanners.  By the way, the Christmas market in Strasbourg is the largest in France. </p>
