The valley of the ski resort of <span>Courchevel (1850</span> - 2374 m) is located in the Alps in France, the French referred to as the "Three Valleys" (Les Trois Valles).  This fabulously beautiful place has long been considered the most prestigious tourist destination for winter holidays.  The resort of Courchevel has more than 600 snow cannons that provide snow cover for the entire winter period (from December to April) and more than 600 km of ski slopes at four different heights (1300, 1550, 1650 and 1850 m above sea level). </p><p>  An unforgettable vacation in Courchevel is also provided by numerous hotels in the resort, which provide a full range of services so that you feel comfortable and receive a lot of positive emotions.  However, getting these very emotions will cost you a certain amount of money.  It should be remembered that in Courchevel the higher the hotels are located above sea level, the higher the <span>price policy.</span>  But, once at an altitude of 1850 m above sea level, you can take in your eyes the boundless valley of snowy alpine mountains! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Courchevel hotels </p><p>  Looking through endless lists of names, photos and reviews of Courchevel hotels, I got the following results: the resort has hotels of various classes from standard family type to elegant apartments and completely crazy chalets. </p><p>  According to its "stardom", the most prestigious and only five-star hotel today is Le Strato 5 * (Le Strato 5 *).  This is the newest modern family-run hotel, designed and styled by French designers P. Dubois and A. C√©cyl.  Unfortunately, I did not find reviews about the rest in this wonderful hotel. </p><p>  The following hotels were recognized as the most popular among Europeans and vacationers from around the world and the most visited hotels according to statistics on international sites: </p><p>  1. Hotel Le Portetta 3 * (Courchevel 1650 hotels) </p><p>  2. Courcheneige 2 * (Cournesene 2 *) </p><p>  3. Hotel Des Neiges 4 * </p><p>  All hotels correspond to their level of "stardom", and most importantly, the level of requests of vacationers. </p><p>  I will begin the description with the cheapest affordable vacation spot among the Courchevel Courcheneige 2 * hotels, located at an altitude of 1900 m above sea level near the Belcot highway.  Beautiful views from the windows of the rooms, terraces located in the fresh air, from which, sitting on a folding chair, you can watch the skiers, tasty food and relatively inexpensive service: all this makes this modest two-star hotel one of the most visited places in Courchevel.  Many tourists, having rested there once, subsequently repeatedly return there. </p>

    <p>  Hotel Le Portetta 3 * (Courchevel 1650 hotels) </p><p>  The hotel is located at an altitude of 1650 m above sea level, provides all the amenities in choosing a route.  People who have repeatedly rested in this place recommend taking a room with a view of the West, because from there you can see a beautiful sunset in the Alps.  Very good service, friendly staff who speaks excellent English, good food (especially French wines and cheeses). </p>

    <p>  Hotel Des Neiges 4 * </p><p>  The hotel is also located near the Belcot Highway, surrounded by the fabulous Jardin Alpin Forest.  The view from the room is fantastic, the rooms are very comfortable, clean, furnished with antique furniture, the interior of the hotel itself is stylized in a Savoyard style.  Service at the highest level.  The hotel has two restaurants serving not only traditional Mediterranean dishes, but you can also try exotic <span>Arabic cuisine</span> and more. </p><p>  The list of places where you can relax in the winter resort of Courchevel hotels here is far from all.  But, I think that this article will help you understand a little about your desires and capabilities. </p>
