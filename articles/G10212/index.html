There are unique attractions that are definitely worth a look.  Cultural monuments, nature reserves, historical buildings.  But the temple structures are most attractive.  One of them is the Belogorsk Resurrection Monastery.  In the Voronezh region there are only three active cave monasteries.  And this is one of them.  Caves are located near the village of Belogorye (Voronezh region).  The monastery took its place at the very top of the chalk hill. </p>

    <h2>  Mystery of origin </h2><p>  The surroundings of the village of Belogorye have long been famous for their caves.  But the reason for their formation is still unknown.  There are many legends about this place.  One of them tells of robbers attacking merchants and merchants sailing along the Don.  They hid looted treasures in caves. </p><h2>  How was everything?  Both truth and legend </h2><p>  And yet there are more believable stories that tell how exactly the Belogorsk caves were formed.  Since 1796, they began to be excavated by local residents under the leadership of Maria Sherstyukova.  They were firmly convinced that they were doing a good deed.  Gradually, people began to come into the caves.  They repented of their sins there.  Some of them even remained to live there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the end of the 18th century, the length of all caves was 1 km, and after a hundred years it increased to 2.2 km. </p><h2>  Who is Maria Sherstyukova </h2><p>  As already mentioned earlier, Maria Sherstyukova laid the foundation for the foundation of Belogorsk caves.  She was different from her brothers and sisters not only in appearance, but also in spirit.  From childhood, Maria dreamed of becoming a nun.  But parents were against it.  At 25, she married a military man who constantly drank and walked.  Leaving Mary three children, her husband passed away.  The woman was widowed early and went headlong into a wild life.  She drank soundly and engaged in debauchery, sometimes earning bread by witchcraft.  Relatives, neighbors, villagers - all blasphemed Mary.  She lived in extreme poverty.  But one amazing incident completely changed her life.  At 55, she visited the Kiev Pechersk Lavra.  There she was blessed to go home and find a quiet place on the mountain, dig a cave of repentance there.  When Maria arrived in her native village, she immediately set to work.  On the part of local residents, she met with extreme indignation.  Persecution persecuted Mary until the authorities intervened in the construction of the temple, providing the woman with financial assistance. </p><p>  For 30 fruitful years, Maria was engaged in ascetic activities.  Over time, a whole team of helpers and followers formed. </p><h2>  The foundation of the monastery </h2><p>  For conducting excavations, Mary was persecuted by the local authorities.  They stopped only after Alexander I himself ordered to award Maria with a monetary reward. </p><p>  Thanking the emperor, the healer dedicated the first cave temple to Alexander Nevsky, the patron saint of the king.  The opening of the monastery took place three years before the death of the healer Mary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Throughout the 19th century, the territory around the monastery began to be built up with various ground structures.  They erected the Trinity and Preobrazhenskaya churches, built a stone bell tower.  Over time, the monastery was awarded the status of a monastery.  Holy Assumption <span>Divnogorsky Monastery</span> took it under its wing. </p><p>  The end of the 19th century was marked by the completion of the construction of the Resurrection Church, which is the main one.  It was erected by the architect Afanasyev.  The <span>Byzantine style</span> was chosen for the temple <span>.</span>  The construction was painted by master Schukin in 1916. </p><h2>  Rectors of the cloister </h2><p>  In 1882, the monastery was transformed into an independent Belogorsky Resurrection Monastery.  Hieromonk Peter, who had previously served at the Mitrofanov Monastery in Voronezh, became rector, and in 1875 he was transferred to the monastery.  He did a lot for the monastery.  Under him, a school was established - a shelter for boys.  Until his death, Peter himself taught children, since he himself was a highly educated person.  <span>Father Peter</span> was an incredibly energetic person.  He was distinguished by rigor, but at the same time, sincere and caring.  In 1896, he began the construction of a new cathedral, but did not wait for its completion.  In 1916, the cathedral was consecrated.  He stood high above the open spaces of the Don.  Everyone who sought to enter the monastery immediately noticed him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Excursions in the Voronezh region will certainly lead to the Resurrection Monastery, the last abbot of which was Abbot Polycarp.  He served in the monastery until its closure in 1922. </p><h2>  The further fate of the monastery </h2>

    <p>  After the closure, all the buildings were dismantled for building materials.  In 1931, the Pavlovsky district executive committee decided to blow up the Resurrection Monastery.  There is practically nothing left of the picturesque place.  The vaults of the caves were painted with silly inscriptions. </p><p>  However, after some time, the Lord nevertheless shed mercy on these holy places.  Metropolitan of Voronezh and Borisoglebsky Sergius gave a blessing to clear the caves of Belogorye.  Archpriest Alexander Dolgushev led the project. </p><p>  The first Divine Liturgy was held in honor of Prince Alexander Nevsky on September 12, 2004.  Since 2005, the monastery has been replenished with life. </p><h2>  The revival of the monastery </h2>

    <p>  All ground structures, buildings and temples were completely destroyed.  Before the brethren, it would seem, an impossible task to restore everything.  First, it was necessary to clear and restore the caves of Belogorye themselves, which carried the spirit of the brave ministry of ordinary people.  After all, these people were so eager to ensure that the will of the Lord was fulfilled and, in addition to everyday prayer, people could serve God in these unique cave temples, chapels and cells, which are filled with the purity and reverence so necessary for a full spiritual life.  Their labors were not in vain.  Indeed, until today, everyone who visits Belogorye (Voronezh region), the monastery, will be filled with incredible spiritual strength.  Belogorsk shrines are an indestructible monument of the national spirit. </p><p>  July 29 is a special day for the monastery.  Every year on this day, a large procession is held.  All pilgrims travel 40 km along the banks of the Don.  The first night is in the village of Upper Karabut, the second is in Kolodezhnoye.  On July 31, all participants gather in Kostomarovo in order to celebrate the acquisition of the relics of St. Seraphim of Sarov on the next day (August 1). </p><p>  The monastery was officially opened recently, in 2013. </p><p>  If there is such an opportunity, you should definitely visit Belogorye (Voronezh region).  The monastery is open almost around the clock. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2>

    <ol><li>  Some time before the monastery was closed in 1922, a criminal case was opened.  During the trial, the investigator, who constantly mocked the remains of the saints, fell ill with a serious skin disease and died.  Many were struck by the mysterious illness of investigator Boris Usatov.  He was extremely dismissive of this holy place, especially the relics of Mary (founder of the monastery).  Some parts of his body began to become covered with scales.  Even the most experienced doctors could not cure the disease, and after some time the investigator died a painful death. </li><li>  During the war, the monastery was completely destroyed, but its caves served as a reliable refuge for local residents.  Partisan groups also gathered there. </li><li>  Caves are of particular importance for the village of Belogorye.  The monastery is located on them.  Caves of Belogorye are considered the largest monastery underground in Russia, created artificially.  Today, most of the caves are abandoned.  Their length from 2 km was reduced to 985 meters. </li></ol>
