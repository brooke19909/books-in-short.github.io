  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Income details: hide or be proud?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Russia, according to tradition, questions about material well-being, about wages and cash bonuses in society are considered uncultured.  Information about income is the same personal information as information about the family, about feelings or about health.  Meanwhile, in <span>Western Europe,</span> people are quietly interested in each other about the amount of income, considering this topic to be quite decent and subject to discussion.  High salaries are considered by Europeans as a reason for pride: people who receive a lot of money and have achieved everything themselves, cause respect. </p><p>  Information about the <span>income of civil servants</span> for most citizens of Russia today is a mystery, shrouded in darkness.  Everyone knows that officials earn a lot, but only the officials themselves can tell the exact numbers.  Nevertheless, to consider a Russian state or municipal employee to be rich seems to be wrong: in comparison with foreign colleagues, Russian employees of the state apparatus have very modest salaries.  This is evidenced by the increase in the number of official crimes, including bribery, recently.  The British, when asked why it is impossible to bribe an English court, proudly answer: "Because the English court has long been bribed by the state."  Roughly the same thing can be applied with confidence to the executive authorities of <span>Misty Albion.</span> </p><p>  Meanwhile, information about the income of civil servants and information about the income of <span>municipal employees</span> are not hidden information.  Moreover, the procedure for determining the amount of payments, bonuses and allowances for public employees is regulated by law.  Information about income is entered into special automated systems.  These systems are necessary for both tax authorities and politicians who develop programs for managerial personnel.  The salary of a state or municipal employee directly depends on the class rank of an employee.  The rank of an employee of the management apparatus is determined by the number of years in service and the qualification exams.  Russian managers have not only ranks, but also positions.  First, the employee receives a position, and then on the basis of the position held by him, he is assigned a class rank within the limits defined by law.  In Russia there are five types of posts.  These are the positions of the highest group, the main group, the leading group, the senior group and the younger group.  Only persons holding positions from the highest group can receive the rank of a real state adviser to Russia or a subject of the federation.  The qualification of the employee of the bureaucratic apparatus determines not only the basic salary of the employee, but also all kinds of bonuses and allowances. </p><p>  Information on the income of employees of state and municipal bodies, according to the <span>Decree of the President,</span> is made publicly available on the Internet.  To do this, just go to the website of the body of interest and see the data not only about the citizen‚Äôs income directly from the service, but also about his <span>total income</span> (employees can simultaneously participate in scientific, teaching, research and other creative activities), about his right of ownership residential and other real estate. </p><p>  To be elected to <span>the legislative body at</span> any level, from federal to municipal, the candidate must provide information on income.  But for members of the executive branch when entering the service, such requirements are not provided.  In other words, it doesn‚Äôt matter to the Russian state what material resources a person received at his former place of work, what wages he got used to. </p><p>  Today there has been a tendency to increase the material support of the administration.  The main goal of raising the salaries of officials is to eradicate official crimes.  Statistics show that the developed policy already shows the proper results and lives up to expectations. </p>
