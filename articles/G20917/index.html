Social networks, mail, services for work, not to mention entertainment - all this is available to us anytime anywhere.  What is most pleasant is the free nature of all these benefits.  With the Internet, we can develop, learn, have fun and learn something interesting easily and simply, especially if it is always at hand.  Such mobility can provide only access to the network from a tablet computer or phone. </p><h2>  Ways to connect the Internet to a tablet (smartphone) </h2><p>  There are two ways to connect an Internet connection to your gadget.  The first is mobile wireless access using a SIM card.  The second is a connection using a WiFi router.  Each of the methods has a number of its disadvantages and advantages. </p>

    <p>  So, wireless connection through mobile operators is more flexible and portable, because it allows you to access the Internet from gadgets anywhere.  The role here is played only by the signal strength of the <span>mobile network,</span> which, in general, throughout the country is quite acceptable for a stable connection.  In this regard, the WiFi network loses, because its effect extends to only a few tens of meters maximum around the router.  True, even despite the close distance to the router, there are situations when interruptions occur and the user does not know why the phone does not connect to WiFi.  The chances that this can happen with a regular mobile network are much less. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the other hand, connection through a mobile service provider is carried out within a small data packet (for example, 5 gigabyte traffic is available).  If you connect unlimited tariffs for 3G or LTE-connection, then it will cost quite expensive.  As for connecting via WiFi router, it has the same features as fixed access to the network.  It is about this type of connection that we will speak in the framework of the article. </p><h2>  WiFi Benefits </h2>

    <p>  So, as already mentioned, the Internet in the format of WiFi access is unlimited in terms of the amount of data that can be transferred.  This is due to the fact that the router distributes, in fact, the stationary Internet, which in our country is already provided mainly without restrictions.  In addition to the lack of a limit, another important indicator of this transmission format is the connection speed.  Compared to the mobile Internet, in the case of a WiFi router, it is ten times faster (up to 100 Mbps), which makes it possible to download movies in the best quality and have fun in online games on the tablet without delay. </p><h2>  How to connect to the created WiFi network? </h2><p>  So, setting up WiFi is an important, but one-time procedure, having successfully completed which, you can use the Internet connection for a long time without interruption.  If you are wondering why the phone does not connect to WiFi, then you have completed the wrong setup.  That is why in the article we will address this issue. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  So, for starters, you should understand how the connection is arranged in this format as a whole.  The stationary Internet, which is transmitted using wires connected to the router, is distributed via WiFi, while becoming available to your tablet and phone.  In fact, the router creates a network in which the Internet is distributed ‚Äúfrom the wire‚Äù.  To access the network, you need to know its name and, of course, in the case of setting up a protection, also an access key (in other words, a password).  This is very important, because if the phone and tablet do not connect to Wi Fi, this most likely means that this data was entered incorrectly. </p><p>  So, speaking of WiFi connection, it should be described as a two-level.  The first is the connection of the router to the cable both at the hardware and software levels.  If your ISP also sets up protection at the level of computer access to the network, then it should also be included in the <span>settings of the router.</span>  Roughly speaking, if you connect using the username and password from the provider, then these parameters must be provided for in the settings of the router.  You can do this by running the installation wizard, which is available in most modern routers.  Errors that occurred at this stage will look like this: There is a Wi-Fi connection, and your tablet or phone does not go online. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The second level of connection is a connection to the network, which occurs at the router level.  This is where your Internet access point is protected from third-party devices.  To connect to a network, you should ideally know its name and, as already noted above, an access key.  Of course, a situation may arise that the smartphone does not connect to home WiFi, even despite the correct password.  In this case, you can do otherwise. </p><p>  Most routers have a special button that removes <span>network protection</span> for a certain time.  It is designed so that your devices can be connected without asking for a password. </p><h2>  How to set up WiFi? </h2><p>  Setting up a wireless home connection is a simple procedure, but for many, it may not work out the first time for several reasons.  Firstly, the user does not always understand where to start and what sequence of actions as a whole.  Secondly, a person does not always know what type of connection his provider has.  Thirdly, not everyone can find the data provided by their service provider. </p>

    <p>  So, let's try to briefly describe the setup process so that you do not have situations when you do not know why the phone does not connect to the WiFi router.  First you need to connect the cord of the stationary Internet and the router itself, then connect the device to the network, wait until the base system lights indicating the signal light up.  Next, you need to connect the computer and the router with the same cord.  The connection diagram is most often shown when starting the installation disk, which is included in the kit.  If there is no disk - do not worry, the whole procedure can be carried out manually.  You need to go to the address of the router (in the browser, enter the numbers 192.168.0.1), where you will see the <span>device control panel</span> .  To login, use the username and password admin.  Select the item responsible for activating the settings wizard - this way the program will allow you to enter the necessary data step by step.  This information is such as the type of connection, data for connection, network protection, its type.  After that, the router will reboot and, in theory, will begin to function. </p><h2>  <span>Why doesn‚Äôt my tablet,</span> phone and laptop <span>connect to WiFi</span> ? </h2><p>  If after configuring you were unable to access the Internet using your gadget, this indicates that there is some kind of error.  It can consist in incorrect actions at one of two levels, which were discussed above.  So, the answers to the question ‚Äúwhy the phone does not connect via Wi-Fi‚Äù can be two options: an incorrect Internet connection of the router itself, or lack of the ability to connect to a Wi-Fi network. </p>

    <p>  It‚Äôs not difficult to find out the true reason - try entering the control panel of the router by driving the address 192.168.0.1 into the browser above.  If the settings menu opens, the problem is "at the first level", that is, in the very connection of the router to the network.  If the page loads, but nothing happens, it means that you cannot enter the network and you have errors with the key. </p><h2>  Password Problem Solving </h2>

    <p>  Connecting to a router, if it is working, is easy enough.  To do this, you need to do one of two things - either press the unprotect button and try to connect directly, or try to find out the password, because, due to its incorrect entry, the smartphone may not connect to home WiFi.  You can see which key is installed on the network in the settings of the router.  To do this, it will be enough to go to the address 192.168.0.1 in the "Wireless Protection" menu (at least this is the name in the TP-Link router).  You can log in from your computer to later see the password and enter it on your smartphone or tablet. </p><p>  If the network key turned out to be correct, but you still don‚Äôt know why the phone does not connect to WiFi, maybe it‚Äôs all about establishing a network connection.  To do this, go to the next paragraph of our article.  There we describe in more detail what should be done in such cases.  Remember that only general recommendations will be given here, while the decision on how to act in your situation is yours. </p><h2>  Connection errors </h2><p>  If there is a Wi-Fi connection, but does not go to the Internet, then the whole thing is in the connection between the router and the service provider.  You can check the status of this connection, again, in the network control panel.  There should be a <span>status bar</span> showing the connection mode.  From it you can understand what is wrong and why the phone does not connect to WiFi. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why does not connect to wifi tablet phone and laptop" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29714/669455.jpg" width="225"></div></h2><p>  If the status indicated there does not tell you anything (for example, there are cases when the error message is simply indicated), we recommend that you contact your provider and ask for help with setting up the network.  As a rule, they already have tried and tested templates, according to which the client is explained the algorithm of actions for tuning. </p><h2>  Nothing helps </h2><p>  There are situations when none of the settings recommended above to set up the Internet helps, and anyway there are some errors that prevent access to the network.  There are only 2 reasons that can lead to this - it is either a software malfunction in the router itself, or the inability to connect from the provider, dictated by some restrictions or errors.  All that can be done is to call a specialist from a company that provides you Internet services, so that he will set everything up for you. </p>
