    <p>  When the saw cuts dry, you can make crafts from them.  We put a circle from the blanks and glue the parts together with a hot gun or super glue.  When the first ring is ready, you can begin to manufacture the second layer.  You need to create a circle that will be slightly smaller in diameter than the workpiece that is available.  Dry twigs need to be glued to the lower right needle.  From a burlap we tie a bow and decorate it with cones.  The composition can include fresh or dried flowers, physalis, pine or Christmas tree branches, as well as soft pompons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Wreath of cones </h2>

Making a wreath on a door with your own hands is very simple.  To make it, you will need balloons, threads and glue.  We inflate the balls, but not so much that they just take on a round shape.  We take a ball, we stick its end in a needle and we pierce a bubble with glue.  We stretch the thread and wrap the ball around it.  You need to wind in different directions and in different directions.  When this stage of work is completed, cut the thread and hang the ball to dry.  Thus, from different yarns, it is necessary to make blanks of different colors and sizes.  While the balls are dry, make snowflakes.  You can either buy them in a store or make them yourself from liquid silicone.  Making them is very simple: you should warm up the gun and draw a snowflake on a piece of paper.  Until the silicone has dried, you need to sprinkle it with white powder or sparkles.  Now we take the blanks, burst the balloons that are inside, and spread the circle from the made balls.  Moreover, we form it not in an even geometric figure, but in an arbitrary, slightly asymmetric.  We decorate the resulting wreath with snowflakes.

A round shape is made of willow branches.  And spikelets stick to it obliquely.  You can use threads as a fastener.  Nevertheless, it is more reliable to attach to the glue gun.  When the wreath is ready, it can be decorated with natural material.  It can be cones, leaves or bulrushes.  If you want to tie a bow, then it should be made from burlap.

    <p>  How to create a wreath of wine corks?  In order to fold an even circle, you need a round pattern.  It can be made from newspaper or paper.  We circle a large dish and lay out corks along the pencil outline.  We fasten them together with a glue gun.  The right side of the wreath should be decorated with branches of spruce or thuja.  You can stick colorful balls on top.  And we sprinkle colored beads in clusters in traffic jams. </p><h2>  Spring wreath </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself wreath on the door" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2213374.jpg"></div>  We will create such an ornament from the newspaper.  We divide the printed publication into pages and twist them into bundles.  We attach these tubes to each other using a stapler.  Now you need to form a circle from the newspaper.  When the base is ready, it should be filled with glue.  This is done so that the wreath keeps its shape well.  When the workpiece dries, it must be wrapped with willow branches or a vine.  On the lower inner part of the wreath, stick figures of birds and nests, and live branches will help to complement the composition.
