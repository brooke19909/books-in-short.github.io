The main problem to be solved today is the scientific and technological revolution of the 20th century and its impact on the modern world.  The answer to this question will help society understand how it is possible to solve the problems it faces and develop principles for its future development. </p><p>  Scientific and technical development and society </p><p>  The <span>scientific and technological revolution</span> that began more than a quarter century ago brought profound qualitative changes in science and technology, in particular in physics.  Fundamental physics and the <span>scientific and technological revolution</span> contributed to the appearance in the human life of things and phenomena that no one could even think of several centuries ago.  Ultrasound, radioactivity, reactive motion, <span>electromagnetic waves</span> - a list of not all discoveries that fundamentally changed a person‚Äôs life.  It became possible to transmit over long distances not only sound but also images.  Man conquered space, landed on the moon.  The atom was split, which contributed to the emergence of <span>quantum physics</span> - the latest physical theory.  Thus, physics and the scientific and technological revolution contributed to the deepening of the study of the material world. </p>

    <p>  The importance of physics and scientific and technological research in the development of science and technology </p><p>  In the development of scientific and technical thought, physics and the <span>scientific and technological revolution</span> are of great importance.  Thanks to them, science began to fulfill the role of direct productive force.  Applied electronics, physical chemistry, astrophysics, biophysics, solid state physics, and geophysics began to function as independent fields of science.  Achievements of X-ray crystallography, spectroscopy, as well as an electron microscope made it possible to decipher the structure of DNA, synthesize complex protein molecules, and make new scientific discoveries in the field of genetic engineering. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, physics and the scientific and technological revolution contributed to the use of ultrasound in various fields of production, medicine, exploration, oil production, fishing, and the military industry.  Big changes in the field of electronics made the scientific and technological revolution of the 20th century.  A transistor was invented, thanks to which a new direction in science was developed - microelectronics, which made it possible to create semiconductor electronic computers. </p><p>  Today, the development of technical and scientific thought does not stand still and its movement cannot be stopped.  Indeed, thanks to discoveries in physics, not only ideas about the material world have changed, but also <span>social relations</span> and society itself. </p>

    <p>  What are the features of STR </p><p>  Like every process taking place in society, scientific and technological progress has its own characteristics.  Therefore, the scientific and technological revolution is characterized by a close relationship and even the fusion of technology with science, a successful but far from always useful conquest of nature and even man as its integral part.  What humanity has been able to achieve thanks to scientific and technological progress is impressive. </p><p>  In addition, the scientific and technological revolution is characterized by such features as: </p><p>  - a decrease in resource and energy intensity per unit of output; </p><p>  - reducing the complexity, which is achieved by improving the physico-chemical parameters of the technology and automation of production; </p><p>  - increase in the number of products per unit of time; </p><p>  - increasing <span>economic security,</span> reducing the negative impact on natural resources, improving working conditions; </p><p>  - the opening of new opportunities for the release of products of better quality and with improved characteristics. </p><p>  NTR led to qualitative transformations in the technical field, relying on the latest achievements of science, as well as the laws of nature discovered with its help.  The processes occurring thanks to scientific and technological progress contribute to social transformations in all areas of public life.  In particular, the division of labor ‚Äî professional and social ‚Äî takes place in a new way, new branches of activity appear, scientific knowledge and information come to the fore.  NTR is characterized by a transition to intensive production growth, accelerated economic development. </p>
