It was at this time that the government of the Russian Empire decided to begin the construction of postal stations, which were called pits in those days, along the road from Ufa to Orenburg.  One of these was organized on the site of a Tatar village near the Sterl River.  The merchant Savva Tetyushev did a lot for the development of this settlement.  It was here that he proposed to lay the salt pier.  So the town became not only one of the main settlements for the extraction and sending of salt, but also an important communication center, which began to develop due to the commissioning of metallurgical plants in this region of Bashkiria. </p>

    <h2>  Museum of Local History </h2><p>  What sights of Sterlitamak should tourists start with?  The history museum of local lore will tell about the history of this region.  It is located in a solid, beautiful, solid building.  About a hundred years ago, it belonged to one of the branches of the Siberian Merchant Bank.  A two-story red building with large, almost close to each other, windows framed by white molding, looks simply fabulously beautiful.  The museum has collected several tens of thousands of the rarest exhibits. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The geological exposition is especially impressive for visitors.  And this is not surprising, since the Ural land is a kind of jewelry box.  Jasper, rock crystal, agate and many other types of semiprecious stones are represented here.  The famous Sterlitamak meteorite is also on display.  Exhibitions dedicated to the culture, history and everyday life of the local population, as well as the years of World War II, are also interesting. </p><h2>  Russian Drama Theater </h2><p>  The building of an old merchant‚Äôs mansion houses the <span>Russian Drama Theater.</span>  In its architectural style, the house is very similar to a museum.  This building is blue, also having a generous snow-white finish of windows and doors.  The theater has been operating since 1946.  It was then that the Beloretsky Drama Theater troupe, which was on tour in the city, was assigned to the newly opened Russian theater. </p><h2>  Tatiana Church </h2><p>  An interesting attraction of the city is the Tatyana Church.  Sterlitamak can be proud of this beautiful temple. </p>

    <p>  It is located on the courtyard of the Mother of God-Tabyn Convent.  At the very end of the XIX century, the church was founded by Tatyana Dyakova.  An almshouse named after Fedorovs was opened with her.  Like many Orthodox churches of other faiths, the Tatiana Church was closed in the thirties of the last century.  However, in the forties, it was returned to believers.  Moreover, for the help in raising funds for the front, the shrine was thanked in 1945 from the Commander-in-Chief. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  This, however, did not prevent the communist government from closing the Orthodox church in 1959.  This time a medical school was placed in the church building.  Of course, the unique wall paintings during the redevelopment of the building were barbarously destroyed.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the building, thoroughly mutilated, was returned to the Orthodox Church.  Now you can visit the temple and admire the interior decoration and the beautiful appearance of a light pink structure with a three-stage spacious bell tower, shiny domes. </p><h2>  Cathedral of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker </h2><p>  What is worth seeing for those who are interested in attractions?  Sterlitamak is the city in which the Cathedral of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker is located.  The temple was built at about the same time as the Tatianian Church.  Unfortunately, during the years of Soviet power, he suffered an even more sad fate - he was destroyed.  Now work is underway to restore the shrine. </p>

    <h2>  Nur Al Iman Mosque </h2><p>  What are the tourist attractions worth seeing (Sterlitamak)?  About twelve years ago, the Nur al-Iman mosque was erected in the city.  Translated into Russian, the name means "ray of light."  The beautiful building, surrounded by green minarets looking up, looks majestic.  And climbing to its upper platform, you can see the panorama of the city. </p>

    <h2>  Theatre of Drama </h2><p>  In 1991, the city opened the Sterlitamak Bashkir Drama Theater.  Twelve years later, he was housed in a building of one of the palaces of culture.  Now it is one of the best theaters in the Republic of Bashkortostan.  The troupe toured in Europe and Asia.  The language barrier is not an obstacle for the Russian-speaking audience, since the performances are duplicated in Russian. </p><h2>  Philharmonic and "Dance Theater" </h2><p>  In the same year, the Sterlitamak Philharmonic was established.  Among her groups, the ‚ÄúDance Theater‚Äù stands out.  His productions are distinguished by a bright distinctive style.  Moreover, the emphasis is on the dance traditions of the Bashkir people.  The actors of this choreographic collective successfully perform with tours throughout the country and abroad. </p><h2>  Merchants houses </h2><p>  The city has preserved many houses, which are architectural monuments of the XIX-XX centuries.  These buildings once belonged to merchants and philistines.  These include the houses of Dokuchaev, Salikhov, Budaev, Bayazitov, Usmanov, Evdokia Nikitina, Milovanov, Vtorigin, Patrikeev, Mikhail Mochinov, Zvezdin, as well as the estate of the merchant Kuznetsov.  Unfortunately, many of the listed buildings are in terrible condition.  They need overhaul and restoration work. </p><h2>  Monuments and natural attractions </h2><p>  In the fifties of the last century in Sterlitamak a monument to the first teacher was opened near school number 8.  The monument was decided to put the head of the administration of the urban district.  Also, near the school number 31 was installed another monument to the first teacher.  What is this monument?  On the pedestal is a woman teacher in a formal suit, next to her is a girl with bows and a bag on her shoulder. </p>

You should definitely see the magnificent Lake Tugarsalgan for tourists. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In our article, we examined the most basic attractions.  Sterlitamak is rich in other interesting places.  But to see everything, you need to come to this city. </p>
