However, more and more people are wondering how to knit a men's cardigan with knitting needles.  Indeed, a do-it-yourself product is, by many criteria, better than purchased.  And in the current article we will talk about how to do the desired thing yourself. </p><h2>  Matching yarn </h2><p>  Professional knitters advise first of all to determine the model of your ideas, as well as decide for what time of the year a jumper fits.  After that, go to the store to buy knitting threads.  They should be purchased taking into account the pattern.  Experts advise you to choose unusual yarn for calm and restrained options.  And vice versa, for complex patterns - monophonic.  If this is the first time you are knitting a men's cardigan, it is better to purchase special yarn, which independently folds into a pattern.  And tie the product with the front surface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailys.ir" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit sweater" class="if uuid-2914325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2914325.jpg"></div><h2>  Convenient tool </h2><p>  To fulfill your idea, you need to prepare two types of knitting needles - hosiery and ring.  The first are required for knitting sleeves and gates (if provided).  Using the second form the main part of the product.  Professionals recommend buying metal knitting needles, the diameter of which is one and a half times the thickness of the thread.  Especially if you want to knit a patterned men's cardigan.  However, now there are models made by garter stitching.  They allow the work of large-sized knitting needles.  The finished product is "perforated" due to elongated loops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Necessary measurements </h2><p>  To connect a quality product, it is necessary to measure the person to whom the thing being studied is being prepared.  But it is important to know what parameters are required: </p><ul><li>  length of the main part; </li><li>  armhole level; </li><li>  neck circumference; </li><li>  sleeve length; </li><li>  chest circumference; </li><li>  girth of the widest part of the forearm; </li><li>  if necessary - the level of the gate. </li></ul><h2>  Building patterns </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mensxp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted sweater" class="if uuid-2914927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2914927.jpg"></div><p>  Another important part of the preparatory phase is a schematic sketch of a conceived men's sweater.  To do this, take a notebook sheet and a simple pencil.  We draw the style of our idea.  Nearby, we fix each parameter taken from the model.  Next, we need to calculate the number of loops and rows in order to further ease the knitting process. </p><h2>  Centimeter translation </h2><p>  The next step of our instructions involves simple steps.  On it we will knit a sample of the selected pattern.  Therefore, we prepare knitting needles and yarn, we study the scheme.  Then we knit twenty loops on the knitting needles and knit thirty rows.  Then, using a centimeter, measure the length and width of the resulting fragment.  After we divide the loops in width, and the rows in length.  As a result, we find out how many units of measurement necessary for knitting are contained in one centimeter.  Having figured out these parameters, it is easy to calculate the size of the conceived male sweater.  Knitting according to their calculations is much more convenient. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thus, further we multiply the number of loops in one centimeter by all horizontal parameters, and the number of rows by all vertical ones.  We indicate each new value on our pattern.  Then we start knitting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting for men" class="if uuid-2914962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2914962.jpg"></div><h2>  How to tie the back </h2><p>  Having completed the preparatory phase, we proceed to the creative part of our instructions.  We draw on the needles the number of loops equal to half the circumference of the chest.  Professionals recommend knitting several rows at the beginning with any gum option, so that the edge is more accurate.  Then proceed to the patterned part.  We knit with an even cloth to the very end.  As a result, we get an even rectangle - the back of our product. </p><h2>  How to perform before </h2><p>  In fact, this stage of the description of the men's sweater is similar to the previous one.  However, there is still a significant difference.  We will talk about him further.  Depending on the style of the model, the cutout of the gate may be provided for different.  Round is considered a classic.  But also found and v-shaped.  We will consider the technology of both options a bit later.  But you need to choose your option at the preparatory stage.  Because the base of the gate is formed when performing the transfer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted sweater for men" class="if uuid-2914919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2914919.jpg"></div><p>  So, having typed the right number of loops on the knitting needles, we knit with an even cloth to the level of the gate.  Then we begin to gradually reduce the loop, tying out its line.  However, it is important to note that in this case you will have to perform the right and left parts separately.  For this we need hosiery knitting needles. </p><h2>  How to form a gate </h2><p>  If you wish, you can knit a men's cardigan with knitting needles without the details noted in the title of the current item.  Under this condition, the front of the product is knitted with an even cloth from beginning to end.  As a result, we get two rectangles - the back and the front.  Which are then sewn together, excluding the zone of the armhole and gate.  Such a jumper is now in great demand.  Therefore, it is knitted not only by beginners, but also by many experienced needlewomen.  It must be admitted that this fashion trend greatly simplifies the knitting process. </p><p>  If you still want to tie a full neckline, you need to study the material presented below.  To complete the round collar, you must: </p><ol><li>  Mark the width of the gate. </li><li>  And highlight the first and last loop of those that are reserved for this part, with colored threads. </li><li>  Calculate the number of rows from the edge of the gate to the end of the product. </li><li>  Exactly in the middle, close twelve loops. </li><li>  Distribute the rest into the remaining rows to further reduce them evenly. </li><li>  After that, we complete the jumper, relying on our calculations. </li></ol><p>  Making a v-shaped gate is even easier: </p><ol><li>  The first three steps are similar to the previous instructions. </li><li>  Then you should divide the loops into rows.  And thereby find out how to reduce them throughout the remainder of the product. </li></ol><h2>  How to knit sleeves </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingmatters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting for men" class="if uuid-2914953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2914953.jpg"></div><p>  When the front and back are ready, they must be sewn.  To do this, note the level of the armhole and gate (if it is not tied initially).  Then, on the edge of the armhole, we collect loops and distribute them on the hosiery knitting needles.  The description of the men's sweater ends as follows: </p><ol><li>  We knit the sleeves, moving in a circle. </li><li>  We form a ‚Äúpipe‚Äù of the required length, and then go to the smaller needles or knit several rows with an elastic band to make a beautiful cuff. </li><li>  Finally, close the loops, by analogy, perform the second sleeve and try on the finished product. </li></ol><h2>  Interesting patterns </h2><p>  It is not easy to choose the right pattern for a men's sweater.  Schemes of popular options are quite difficult to implement, and therefore inaccessible to beginners.  Therefore, we offer our readers to explore three interesting patterns that are connected by front and back loops.  Without complex decreases, additions and weaves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yutuhao519.lofter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted sweater pattern" class="if uuid-2914327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2914327.jpg"></div><p>  That's the whole instruction for knitting a men's sweater.  As you can see, implementing your idea is much easier than it seems at first glance.  Professional knitters joke that it is harder for beginners to pack up.  But if the decision is made, the work will go as if by itself. </p>
