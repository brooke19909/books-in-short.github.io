    <p>  In Spain there is a world famous European resort and entertainment center under the same name.  It consists of two institutions at once: the Caribe Aquatic Park water park and the Port Aventura amusement park. </p><p>  In addition to having fun in huge pools, you can get acquainted with the culture and characteristics of various parts of the globe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to the project of architects “Port Aventura” (Spain) was originally divided into several characteristic ethnic zones: </p><ul><li>  Mediterranean </li><li>  Imperial China; </li><li>  Aztec Mexico; </li><li>  Exotic Polynesia; </li><li>  Wild West. </li></ul><p>  <span>Barcelona parks,</span> or rather, most of them, are still located within the city.  That is why it is easy to reach them even if the summer heat does not contribute to long walks in the fresh air. </p><p>  Unlike everyone else, Port Aventura (Spain) had to be built outside of Barcelona.  Why?  This is explained quite simply - the city could not afford to allocate such a huge territory for an entertainment zone.  Therefore, the traveler will have to spend about an hour to get to his destination. </p><p>  Every year, not even thousands, but millions of tourists are attracted to Barcelona.  The amusement park, for example, is visited by more than 3.5 million people every year. </p><p>  Perhaps it can be safely noted that this is the largest resort in southern Europe, and by popularity and attendance it is the first park in Spain and the sixth among all theme parks in Europe. </p><p>  There are two airports in the radius of Port Aventura Park, one of which is Reus International Airport, and the second is an air gate of local importance.  In addition, he is connected with Barcelona and Salou by a railway station. </p><h2>  History of Creation and Management </h2>

Did architects and designers know how popular their brainchild would be after a few years?  Most likely, they did not even guess. </p><p>  Let's delve into the story.  As it became known, it was designed and built by two British companies - Anheuser-Busch and Tussauds Group. </p><p>  In 1995, the American corporation Universal Studios took part in the creation of the park, which in 1997 bought back the controlling part of the park.  After that, the name changed a little, and it became known as Universal's PortAventura. </p><p>  Later, in 2000, the Costa Caribe water park and two hotels were built here, and the park again changed its name to Universal Mediterranea. </p><p>  Universal Studios NBC Universal began distributing shares of the park in 2004, and after their full sale in 2005, a controlling stake was received by La Caixa, a well-known company at that time, which returned the park to its more familiar name. </p><p>  By the way, not everyone is aware that another sale of the object’s shares took place in 2013, after which they were distributed as follows: Investindustrial has 51.1%, and the KKR investment fund - 49.9%. </p><p>  From its inception to today, Port Aventura, like other parks in Barcelona, ​​has been constantly expanding and improving.  At the moment, several objects are located on its territory at once: </p><ul><li>  Port Aventura <span>Theme Park</span> </li><li>  Costa Caribe Water Park </li><li>  four themed hotels and a golf course. </li></ul><h2>  How to get to your destination </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Spain, Port Aventura Park is perhaps just the place that everyone can show the way to, so it’s impossible to get lost, even for the most inattentive travelers, and it doesn’t matter exactly how they go on a trip: by bus own car or plane. </p><p>  Nevertheless, we note that in the city of Reus there is a rather large airport where the aircraft of many international airlines arrive.  You can get to the park from the airport by taxi or minibus in just 15 minutes.  Also nearby are air gates such as Tarragona and Barcelona. </p><p>  I would like to note that, no matter how huge Port Aventura is used, its attractions are designed for tourists with different income levels.  There, in principle, even on foot can be reached.  If you follow from Salou a leisurely walk, the road is unlikely to take more than 20 minutes.  This distance a special brightly colored and very noticeable train overcomes in 5 minutes.  The way from Barcelona by rail is about an hour, from Tarragona it takes 3 minutes along with one stop along the way.  The local highway AR-7 will also lead to the park. </p><h2>  Ticket purchase rules for visiting </h2>

    <p>  Tickets can be purchased individually for each park or purchased the so-called common subscription, valid for several days.  Entrance tickets to the park are divided into two main price categories.  Unsurprisingly, they will cost more to adults, for children under 10 years of age and for pensioners there is a discount.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that children under 3 years old are not allowed in the park. </p><p>  Speaking of <span>cost, ticket</span> prices, as they say, bite.  Especially for Russian tourists or representatives of the CIS countries.  Agree, not everyone is willing to pay about 50 euros for one day of stay.  Although buying a ticket for two days is more profitable, the cost in this case is unlikely to exceed 70 euros. </p><p>  Sometimes it happens that the traveler is only interested in a certain part of the park, so he seeks to purchase tickets only for visiting it.  It’s cheaper, for example, a day at the Costa Caribe water park will cost about 30 euros. </p><p>  The official website of the park, in addition to selling tickets, offers a lot of information about promotions and discounts on tickets and accommodation in local hotels.  Those who do not want to spend too much should pay attention that in this way many manage to save up to 15%. </p><h2>  Description of the park structure </h2>

The map of the park is located almost everywhere and is a characteristic painted stand.  If you wish, you can navigate at any time.  In addition, each separate zone has its own cafes, restaurants, souvenir shops, playgrounds for children are equipped, and according to the schedule, various entertainment shows and shows are held there. </p><p>  The park has a separate area for children "Sesamo Aventura", which is decorated in the style of the fabulous Sesame Street.  Today it has many small copies of extreme and simply fun attractions: carousels, roller coasters, children's <span>free fall</span> , etc. Near the amusement park there is a water park and many hotels designed for different material wealth. </p><h2>  "Mediterranean" </h2>

There are a lot of cafes with fresh pastries and Italian pizzas, exclusive souvenir shops and restaurants with a huge assortment of both local and overseas wines.  That's where you can first taste the Mediterranean cuisine and Spanish snacks, after a hearty tasting of wine and finally buy souvenirs for all friends and relatives. </p><p>  The park hosts Fiesta Aventura and Sesame Parade performances, and separately, like in other areas, there are many more exciting and interesting performances for Halloween and Christmas. </p><p>  The highlight of this thematic zone is considered to be one of the fastest attractions in Europe, opened in 2007, “Furius Beiko”.  He is in 3.5 seconds.  speeds up to 135 km / h.  In order to ride it, you must have a height of not less than 140 cm and not more than 195 cm.

    <p>  Walking along this thematic zone of the park, you can feel like a true cowboy, since, according to the name, this zone is stylized as the era of the development of the Wild West.  "Wild West.  Port Aventura Park is a photo that always becomes a worthy decoration of a family photo album. </p><p>  Once here, you should definitely visit the shooting range located inside the cowboy's saloon.  There really is something to do!  The attraction of the "Wild West" is considered to be the only wooden attraction train in the world moving along the wooden rails of Stampid, making breathtaking ups, downs and coups.  It consists of two compounds - blue, moving very fast, and red, which travels more slowly, but along a mysterious route.  People above 1.20 m tall can ride the attraction. There is also a children's copy of this attraction - Tomahawk.  Minors with a height of not less than 1 m are allowed here. For the rest, the presence of adults is required. </p><p>  In addition to the above, in this zone you can meet: </p><ul><li>  regular carousel; </li><li>  Volpaiute; </li><li>  rodeo; </li><li>  wild buffalo. </li></ul><p>  Among the water, I would like to especially note the "Silver River" and "Rafting along the Grand Canyon."  In this area there is a train station with trains leaving for the Mediterranean.  On the territory of the "Wild West" there is a restaurant that can offer real "cowboy" dishes.  The traditional performances of Roxy Salon and Wild Wild West are held here with enviable regularity. </p><h2>  "Mexico" </h2>
