For the manufacture of crafts, as a basis, they usually take thick or corrugated cardboard, craft paper with prints.  Hats are decorated depending on their purpose and gender.  For boys, they are performed in a more strict style, and in the manufacture of crafts for girls they fantasize at full power.  They are decorated with flowers made of satin ribbons or fabric, sisal threads or sheathed the entire paper hat with tulle or tulle.  The hats with colorful feathers or bright <span>pom-poms made of corrugated paper</span> look original <span>.</span> </p><p>  The shape of hats is very diverse.  These are conical hats, like wizards, cylinders, products assembled according to origami schemes.  Some craftsmen glue the whole headdress from colored stripes of quilling, twisted into dense or openwork hanks. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider several options for making hats out of paper with our own hands, what material is better to make such crafts from than decorating, how to fix it on a child‚Äôs head.  Step-by-step instructions will help you do the job without errors, so that the child is comfortable wearing such a hat.  Be sure to involve the future owner in the manufacture, so that the child feels his involvement in the creative process. </p><h2>  Cone hats </h2><p>  How to make a cone-shaped paper hat?  Pretty simple.  First, a large circle is cut, the radius of which is equal to the height of the headgear.  Then cut the excess sector, as in the drawing below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="poradu.pp.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cone hat pattern" class="if uuid-3064069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3064069.jpg"></div><p>  The measured sector must be cut, but so that there is a strip of paper for spreading with glue.  Make a preliminary fitting on the child‚Äôs head.  If the hat falls on his eyes, then increase the size of the neckline.  The fastest and most reliable way is to use a glue gun, but you can also fasten the edges with paper clips. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tipjunkie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cone hats" class="if uuid-3061682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3061682.jpg"></div><p>  Slightly stepping away from the bottom edge, make two holes on opposite sides.  A ribbon or rubber band is subsequently stretched through them to hold the child on the head. </p><p>  It remains only to decorate the paper hat with a frill on the bottom edge or make a large fluffy pompom from corrugated paper.  The craft can be made both from plain solid paper, and from multi-colored, with a bright print. </p><h2>  Stripe Headpiece </h2><p>  Strips of the same width were used to create the next version of the hat, although the pattern and color can be selected alternately.  First of all, try on a long strip around the child‚Äôs head and cut off the excess, leaving a couple of centimeters to attach the edges to each other.  If you use paper clips, try to keep their sharp ends on the outside to avoid injuries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="tipjunkie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hat of stripes" class="if uuid-3061683" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3061683.jpg"></div><p>  The first rounded part is also glued after fitting, stretching it through the crown to the opposite side.  The rest can already be measured by the first pattern.  All parts are connected in the center of the crown in any way.  They can be sewn with thread or, having made a hole, stretch the ribbon and tie a bow at the top.  If desired, you can supplement the paper hat with a visor in front. </p><h2>  Origami hat </h2><p>  The art of origami consists of folding paper in a consistent pattern.  As a result of careful work, a figure is obtained, whether it be an animal or a vehicle.  According to the scheme below, you can fold a military hat.  You need to act gradually, step by step, bending a sheet of paper according to the scheme numbers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.origami-club.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami military hat pattern" class="if uuid-3064127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3064127.jpg"></div><p>  A sheet of paper in A-4 format is folded in half, first vertically (flattened back), and then horizontally.  The upper corners fall to the center line.  Thin rectangular details remain below.  Fold it in half first, and then lift it up to get a straight line. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.origami-club.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a hat out of paper" class="if uuid-3064139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3064139.jpg"></div><p>  Then flip the workpiece to the back and fold the sides to the center joint.  Fold the bottom triangles up, as shown in the figure under No. 9. Now you need to raise the bottom edge up and insert the extra corner inward, under a strip of paper.  All that remains is to put your hands inside the craft and spread your hat in different directions. </p><h2>  Cylinder for boy </h2><p>  From a thick or corrugated cardboard, a circle is cut to the size of the future circumference of the rim.  This is the sum of the radius of the head girth plus 5 cm. Inside, draw a smaller circle (the bottom of the hat), the radius of which is less than 5 cm. That is, leave a ringlet for the hat margins.  Next, you need to draw a drawing of the tulle.  This is a rectangle, the height of which is taken according to the plan (the standard size is 20 cm), and the length is equal to the circumference of the head plus 2 cm to fix the edges.  On two long sides, add 4 cm to cut corners, which will later be smeared with glue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.momtastic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="top hat for boy" class="if uuid-3061697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3061697.jpg"></div><p>  All connections are made from the inside of the hat so that no joints are visible.  Decorating a hat for a boy is easy; just glue the bottom of the tulle with a strip of contrasting color paper.  A paper buckle will look beautiful, as in the sample photo above.  You can use a satin ribbon in black or any other bright color. </p><h2>  Cylinder for girls </h2><p>  You already know how to make a paper hat with your own hands.  However, not only boys wear such a hat.  You can decorate the finished craft in a more original way, implementing the craziest creative ideas so that any girl can effectively look both at the beauty contest and at any holiday. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="top hat for girls" class="if uuid-3061768" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3061768.jpg"></div><p>  Ready-made headgear can be glued from a beautiful multi-colored paper with a printed print - floral, in a check or strip.  It is interesting to wrap the blank with bright fabric to match the dress or accessories, adding tulle or tulle for airiness.  Tula is usually wrapped in a wide satin or brocade ribbon, and organza is also suitable. </p><p>  On the one hand, you can reinforce a large bow or flowers using the kanzashi technique with a glue gun, roll balls from sisal threads or make a magnificent pompom from corrugated paper.  Bright long feathers will attract attention.  So that the hat does not fall off the head, it is strengthened with a thin elastic band.  If you make a hat in the form of a small cylinder, then this accessory can be cut out of felt and attached to a hoop. </p><h2>  Corrugated Paper Hat </h2><p>  A hat in the form of a lush flower, collected on the basis of separate large petals, will look unusual.  It can be in the form of a small cone or collected from strips. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pl.tutkrabov.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hat - flower" class="if uuid-3064073" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3064073.jpg"></div><p>  A wide green ribbon complements the natural colors of cloves or peonies.  Such a beautiful craft can be made for a flower costume for a matinee in a kindergarten dedicated to March 8. </p><p>  As you can see, you can create many beautiful hats with your own hands.  Try it and you make a hat for your baby for the holiday.  Have a good start! </p>
