    <p>  Vourvourou is removed from the village of Agios Nikolaos, which is quite often visited by tourists, ten kilometers and one hundred and twenty kilometers from <span>Thessaloniki Airport.</span>  This area is known to travel enthusiasts for its quaintly located islands.  The largest of them - Diaporos is surrounded by eight smaller ones. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The Vourvourou region in Greece got its current name thanks to the Byzantines, who in the distant past called this territory the Land of the Barbarians.  In the X century, in the Byzantine era, on the site where the Mother of God Chapel is now located, there was Jeromemnimon Monastery, which later became the courtyard of the Xenophon monastery in Athos. </p>

    <p>  Excavations around the chapel revealed many valuable artifacts that once belonged to the monastery.  In ancient times, the city of Singos was located here.  From the name of the city came the name of the bay, washing its coast.  This city was first mentioned in the manuscripts of Herodotus.  It was inhabited by the Chalkideans, and in the 5th century BC it was part of the Athenian Union.  During the Peloponnesian War, the city left the union, but again became part of it in 421 BC, when the Spartans and Athenians signed a peace agreement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Vourvourou (Halkidiki) is characterized by relatively hot and dry summers and rainy cool winters.  The hottest time at the resort is July and August.  During this period, the air temperature averages from +25 to +28 ¬∞ C, but quite often the air warms up to + 40 ¬∞ C.  However, this temperature is quite easily tolerated, thanks to the sea breezes. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The main feature of Vourvourou in Greece is the unique nature of this area.  The picturesque village on the sea is conveniently located among the hills covered with dense forests.  Picturesque rocky coves and islets delight vacationers.  Near the coast rises the Itamos massif.  The fire tower located on its top offers a magnificent view of the Aegean Sea and Halkidiki. </p><h2>  The village of teachers </h2><p>  The modern building is located in the southern part of the resort of Vourvourou in Greece.  The complex of buildings fits perfectly into the atmosphere of the area, since it was built with respect to the history, nature and traditions of the ancient settlement. </p><h2>  Places of worship </h2><p>  The village has the most beautiful Orthodox churches: St. Theon, the Church of the Virgin, in which the inhabitants of the village annually celebrate the birthday of the Virgin (September 8), the Church of the Prophet Elijah. </p>

    <p>  Admission to the mountain of strangers is very difficult, but even from a short distance travelers will be able to appreciate the beauty of the local nature, surprisingly harmoniously combined with the grandeur of the walls of the monasteries. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  The village of Vourvourou attracts tourists from different countries with its stunning nature, the opportunity to relax comfortably with young children on low-populated and well-groomed beaches.  History buffs will be interested in exploring local attractions.  The undoubted advantage of this resort is the absence of problems with housing, even if you come to rest as a ‚Äúsavage‚Äù. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Nature endowed Vourvourou very generously: picturesque bays with crystal clear sea water, golden sandy beaches.  Probably, this resort may seem more boring to young and active people than those located on the nearby vibrant Cape Kassandra.  However, due to its unusual nature, calm atmosphere, and favorable location, Vourvourou is an ideal place for a measured and quiet family vacation. </p>
