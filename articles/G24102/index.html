    <p>  Peter the 1st is one of the most odious figures in Russian history.  Having ascended the throne at a young age, he most severely changed the whole further course of the historical significance of the Russian state.  Some historians call him the ‚Äúgreat reformer,‚Äù while others call him a revolutionary. </p><p>  Tsar <span>Peter the 1st,</span> who later became emperor, is, without a doubt, a talented and outstanding person.  He was a typical choleric, unrestrained and rude, completely subjugating power.  All the transformations of Peter the Great were forcibly and cruelly planted throughout the territory of the Russian State, most of them were never completed. </p><p>  Reforms, or the so-called transformations of Peter the Great, include an impressive list, these are: </p><ul><li>  military; </li><li>  economic; </li><li>  church; </li><li>  political; </li><li>  administrative </li><li>  cultural; </li><li>  social. </li></ul><p>  To put them into practice, the Russian Empire laid one third of its population on the altar.  But we will not be so categorical, try to look deeper. </p><p>  Transformation of Peter the Great in military reform consists in the fact that he managed to create a combat-ready, well-armed army, able to successfully deal with both external and internal enemies.  He is also the initiator of the creation of the Russian fleet, although historians state the fact that most of the ships safely rotted at the shipyards, and the guns did not always hit the target. </p><p>  Economic transformations of Peter the 1st </p><p>  To conduct the Northern War, enormous funds and human resources were required, therefore manufactories, steel and copper smelters, and blast furnaces began to be intensively built.  Uncontrolled <span>deforestation</span> and <span>mining</span> also began <span>.</span>  The transformation of Peter the Great, which significantly influenced the Russian economy, is, first of all, the development of the Urals, as it allowed to be less dependent on foreign imports.  Such serious economic changes, of course, gave the country an impetus in industrial production, but due to the use of forced and slave labor, these enterprises were inefficient.  The economic transformations of Peter the Great made poor people poor and turned them into actually slaves. </p><p>  State administrative reforms </p><p>  In this process, complete subordination to the supreme power is noted, which occurred after the reorganization of the administrative apparatus. </p><p>  The transformation of Peter the Great across the Russian Orthodox Church was very painfully hit.  Thanks to his reform work, she was forced to completely come under state control, which led to the <span>Church schism.</span>  He abolished the patriarchy and replaced it with the Holy Synod, which lasted until 1917. </p><p>  The cultural transformations of Peter the Great have proven themselves in urban planning and architecture and are fully borrowed from Western examples.  During the construction of St. Petersburg, only foreign architects took part, for whom the a la rus style was wild and not worthy of attention.  Along with this, we must pay tribute to Peter for opening a navigational, engineering and medical school in which noble children received a decent education.  In 1719, the Kunstkamera opened its doors.  Up to this point, Russian people did not know museums.  The cultural transformations of Peter the Great contributed to a more powerful development of typography.  True, the translations of Western publications left much to be desired. </p><p>  Under this ruler, Russia switched to a new reckoning from the <span>Nativity of Christ.</span>  Up to this point, our ancestors led him from Creation.  Of great importance was the introduction of the civil alphabet and the creation of libraries.  In general, this period can be characterized by the time of incredible progress. </p>
