    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Territory, location </h2><p>  Almost all of its guests were quite satisfied with the location of Beach Boutique House.  So, according to them, you can walk to <span>Kata</span> Beach from it in just five minutes with an unhurried step.  In addition, in the vicinity of the hotel there are two markets, several shops and supermarkets, massage parlors and tour agencies, cafes and bars, car rental and souvenir shops, as well as exchange offices and other infrastructure.  Therefore, you do not have to go far for the necessary things. </p><p>  As for the territory of The Beach Boutique House 3 * (Phuket, Thailand), it is shared with another hotel of the same chain called Beach Heights Resort 4 *.  Beach Boutique guests can use the entire infrastructure (pools, restaurant, playground, games room, etc.) of the neighboring hotel, with the exception of the housing stock.  In general, the territory of the hotel is especially spacious, according to tourists, can not be called.  However, there is a lot of greenery and several pools of different sizes are equipped.  Next to them you will find sun loungers and parasols.  Also near one pool there is a bar where you can order your favorite drinks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beach boutique house 3 phuket" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1239759.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  As for the apartments, as our compatriots note in their reviews, they are in this hotel for every taste - from simple standards to spacious rooms with a kitchen.  For families with young children, experienced travelers are advised to dwell on the latter option.  Also note that full balconies are not available in all apartments.  If this item is important to you, then it makes sense to clarify it when booking.  In general, all the rooms in the hotel, according to the guests, are clean, comfortable, well equipped.  Fresh repair is noticeable here.  The beds in the apartments are comfortable, large, and the bedding is quality and clean.  Also, tourists were pleased with the fact that the rooms have free Wi-Fi.  True, the signal quality sometimes leaves much to be desired (usually in the midst of the holiday season), but this does not cause any particular difficulties to the guests.  As for the minuses, some tourists complained about how the wardrobe in the rooms is equipped.  So, according to them, there are no doors and shelves in it, so it is not very convenient to arrange your things.  Also, some vacationers did not like that in the shower there was only a stationary fixed watering can.  This creates some difficulties, especially when it comes to bathing young children.  Otherwise, no complaints about the apartments were noted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the beach boutique house reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1239758.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service, staff </h2><p>  As for the employees of The Beach Boutique House 3 * (Phuket), there were no special complaints about them from travelers.  So, according to the guests, the hotel staff is very pleasant in communication, friendly and attentive.  Employees are always ready to help you in resolving any issue.  True, be prepared for the fact that few here understand the Russian language.  However, almost all employees can easily speak English at the hotel. </p><p>  As for cleaning, it is done every day.  True, some tourists complained that the maids came to them in the afternoon, when some of the hotel guests are in the rooms for afternoon relaxation.  However, this did not become a serious problem.  As for the change of towels and bed linen, it is carried out every day. </p><h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  In accordance with the hotel‚Äôs internal rules, accommodation for new arrivals at Beach Boutique House begins after two in the afternoon.  However, judging by the reviews of travelers who have been here, in most cases, those who arrive at the hotel in the morning are trying to accommodate as soon as possible.  After all, the hotel administration understands that travelers want to quickly relax from the road.  Also note that upon check-in you will be asked to make a deposit.  Its amount is about $ 100.  Upon delivery, the deposit will be returned to you.  If you spoil some property of the hotel (for example, a towel or bedding), then its value will be deducted from the amount you left as a deposit. </p><p>  As for the last day of your stay at the hotel, you must hand over the keys to the apartment before noon.

However, many travelers prefer to eat in cafes and restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel.  Moreover, there is no shortage of such institutions here.  In addition, experienced tourists are advised to visit local markets, where you can buy the freshest fish and seafood, which you will immediately cook, and also not bypass mobile food stalls (macaques). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel beach boutique house" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1239756.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Kata Beach, the closest to the hotel, can be reached in just five minutes.  Along the way, you can buy drinks and something to eat.  The beach itself, according to many tourists, is too crowded, and therefore not very clean.  However, vacationers are happy to spend time on Kata Beach.  Also, many travelers were not lazy from time to time to stroll then Karon Beach.  You can reach it in 20-25 minutes.  In general, experienced tourists recommend that all vacationers in Phuket rent a motorbike.  Then you can easily not only see all the sights of interest on the island, but also visit all the beaches.  Of course, such trips can be made by taxi or tuk-tuk, but this type of movement will cost you several times more than renting a scooter. </p>
