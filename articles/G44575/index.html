Not everyone knows that the most comfortable resorts are located here, with a superbly developed infrastructure, striking tranquility, cleanliness, pristine nature, which is inherent in new tourist routes.  Many travelers consider this country the capital of ecotourism. </p><p>  If you plan to visit the capital of Malaysia - Kuala Lumpur - do not miss the amazing attraction located in its vicinity.  It contrasts with multi-story buildings and the wonders of modern technology.  Today we will talk about Batu caves in Kuala Lumpur.  We invite everyone who was lucky to visit here to take part in our conversation and in the comments to the article to supplement their description if you find it incomplete. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital of malaysia" class="if uuid-3214533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3214533.jpg"></div><h2>  Malaysia on a world map </h2><p>  In Asia, an area of ‚Äã‚Äãover 300 thousand square meters.  km is an amazing country - Malaysia.  Kalimantan Island is its eastern part, and the Malacca Peninsula is the western part of the country.  The eastern regions are washed by the waters of several seas: Sulawesi, South China and Sulu.  Indonesia is adjacent to the eastern part from the south and Brunei to the north. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Western Malaysia in the east is also washed by the South China Sea.  In the west of this part of the country is the Strait of Malacca.  Western Malaysia borders two countries: in the north with Thailand and with Singapore in the south.  Look at the map of Malaysia.  The country has another neighbor - the Philippines, from which it is separated by the waters of two straits (Alice, Balabak). </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="4.210483999999999" data-lng="101.97576600000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="5"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/3/3/9/17339.png"></div><p>  The continental part of the country is famous for its mountainous terrain, formed by several ridges that cross the country from north to south.  A small coastal zone belongs to the lowlands of Malaysia.  Putrajaya became the administrative center of the country in 2005, where the government was transferred.  The capital of Malaysia is only 20 km away. </p><h2>  Batu Caves: historical background </h2><p>  We suggest you leave the capital and go to its suburbs to see one of the most visited attractions of the country, which is visited by over one and a half million people every year.  Batu Caves in Malaysia are 13 km from the capital.  They were formed in a natural way and have undergone major changes over 400 million years of their existence. </p><p>  Once upon a time in ancient times they were inhabited by representatives of the demon tribe, and caves in those days were high cliffs.  Gradually, under the influence of water currents and various natural factors, rocks were washed away and through voids appeared in the mountains. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sumfinity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Batu Caves" class="if uuid-3214536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3214536.jpg"></div><p>  Until the XVII century, the forest reliably hid the caves from the eyes of man.  They were accidentally discovered by a merchant from India, Tambus Pillai, who traveled around the country.  Here he founded a temple in honor of the god Murugan.  The Batu caves (Malaysia) became known to the general public thanks to the naturalist Gornedey (USA), who described them in 1878.  After 14 years, the Tamil festival began to be held here regularly, with pilgrims from all over the world participating in it. </p><p>  In 1920, tourists got access to the highest cave.  A long staircase consisting of 272 steps was attached to her entrance.  As in the distant past, caves are still affected by natural factors.  That is why some caves are closed, as they become unsafe for visiting. </p><h2>  Structure </h2><p>  Batu Caves in Kuala Lumpur occupy an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 2.5 square meters.  km  This is a large complex consisting of thirty hills of various sizes with deep internal formations. </p><h2>  Underground temple </h2><p>  This is one of the most famous cave temples in Malaysia and, undoubtedly, one of the main attractions of the country.  According to some versions, it is the largest Hindu temple located outside of India.  However, this is not true.  The temple was one of the most popular: numerous pilgrims and tourists from all over the world always visit it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The temple occupies the largest in the complex Light Cave.  Tourists are faced with religious paraphernalia on the site, which is arranged in front of the main staircase at the foot of the mountain.  Several simple structures and sculptures are located at the entrance to this Batu cave.  The statue of the god Murugan is impressive: its height is 43 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallpapersprinted.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Statue of god Murugan" class="if uuid-3214546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3214546.jpg"></div><h2>  Main cave </h2><p>  Many tourists are limited to visiting only this cave, if time is limited.  All believers and pilgrims are eager to get here, and the rest of the complex are more likely tourist sites. </p><p>  The temple cave is the most spacious, with a high arch.  It is open in one place, and natural light penetrates from the hole inward.  The interior is quite modest: a dozen altars - small and large.  To get into the cave, you need to overcome 272 steps.  But do not worry: there is nothing complicated in the climb.  Even the elderly are up to the challenge.  Hindu shrines are kept inside, which look mysteriously against the background of picturesque stalactites. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.snappguides.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Underground temple" class="if uuid-3214540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3214540.jpg"></div><p>  For a very modest fee in the form of a donation, if you wish, you can take part in one of the rites or observe it from the side.  The flow of believers almost never runs dry.  It is important to know that entrance to this Batu cave in Kuala Lumpur is allowed only in strict clothes - with shoulders and legs closed above the knee. </p><h2>  Dark cave </h2><p>  The next largest in size is this cave, which is located at an altitude of 204 steps.  It fully justifies its name, since the sun's rays never penetrate into it.  Sometimes the excursion in the Dark Cave is interrupted by the rustle of the wings of bats or tourists who did not see one of the many bizarre partitions and columns behind the light of a flashlight.  To avoid accidents, all travelers are given helmets. </p><p>  The length of this cave is more than two kilometers.  There are seven vast cavities, each of which has stalactites, stalagmites, partitions, cave pearls, columns.  But man-made temples are not here, because the Malaysians want to keep this place in its original form.  The dark cave has not yet been fully explored, work on its study continues in our days.  It is in no way connected with religion, so inside you can only admire the stalagmites and stalactites with unusual beauty.  Groups for visiting this Batu cave in Kuala Lumpur are formed at the entrance.  Tours are conducted in English. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.videoblocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dark cave" class="if uuid-3214550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3214550.jpg"></div><h2>  Ramayana </h2><p>  Another large Batu cave in Kuala Lumpur, which is also a temple.  She is the youngest in the complex, was opened for tourists relatively recently.  Quite rarely in popular publications there are references to this cave.  More often, its description can be found in reference books for cavers. </p><p>  Inside you can see statues and sculptural compositions telling stories from the Indian epic Ramayana.  The halls are equipped with colored lighting, which effectively emphasizes the beauty of stalagmites and stalactites.  A detailed biography of Rama is inscribed on the walls, including a description of the principles of his life and exploits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="terraoko.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ramayana Cave" class="if uuid-3214555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3214555.jpg"></div><h2>  Gallery </h2><p>  Another Batu cave located in Kuala Lumpur, which locals rarely enter.  Here you can see several old frescoes telling about the life of the god Murugan, bas-reliefs and statues.  In front of the cave entrance there is a fish pond and a stage where local artists show historical performances several times a day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.en10bu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Batu Caves in Malaysia" class="if uuid-3214575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3214575.jpg"></div><h2>  Wallurwal Cottam </h2><p>  Above, we presented you a description of Batu caves, created by nature itself.  Unlike them, Wallurwal Cottam is a real art gallery with unique works of art.  Here are several statues of Hindu deities, the walls are decorated with quotes from the famous collection of aphorisms "Tirukkurala" - one of the main books of Malaysians. </p><h2>  Batu Caves in Kuala Lumpur: how to get there </h2><p>  A popular attraction of the country is located in the vicinity of the capital of Malaysia, so to get here from other cities, you will have to do one change - this is at least.  Directly from the capital to Batu caves you can get to: </p><ul><li>  The bus.  It leaves from the Puduraya Bus terminal every half hour starting at 07:30.  The last bus leaves at 18:30.  The journey takes about 45 minutes. </li><li>  KTM electric train.  The cheapest and most convenient way.  The train leaves from the central transport hub of the capital, from the KL Sentral station. </li><li>  Taxi.  It is better to arrange a trip back with the driver in advance: prices are three times higher in Batu. </li></ul><p>  According to tourists, even if you know how to get to Batu caves, you can still encounter certain problems, for example, on the way back.  Therefore, experienced travelers recommend preparing coins in advance, since at the station the machines in which you can purchase tickets do not accept cards or banknotes. </p><p>  You will need to be patient to stand in line, consisting of tourists who are not easy to deal with this complex mechanism and buy a token.  The most enterprising people get to Kuala Lumpur by taxi.  You can walk to the next station and there you can easily get on a bus or train. </p><h2>  Reviews and travel tips </h2><p>  Surprisingly, we were not able to find negative reviews.  Batu Caves are popular with everyone.  According to tourists, excursions to them leave a lot of vivid impressions.  The Temple or Light Cave is especially striking.  The disadvantages of visiting the complex include the fact that the tours are conducted in English.  There are other minor flaws.  They should be considered so as not to overshadow your trip.  Therefore, experienced travelers advise: </p><ul><li>  It is better to visit the complex in the early morning after opening.  In the afternoon they are very hot and crowded. </li><li>  Visit the temples at the foot of the hills.  Quite often there you can see the Indians in beautiful national clothes, who hold unusual rites. </li><li>  If you arrived in Kuala Lumpur in January, it is better to refuse a trip to the caves: at this time the Taipusam festival takes place, after the celebration of which huge piles of garbage remain. </li><li>  For such a trip, choose open shoes that fit tightly on your foot.  Choose clothes according to the weather, but keep in mind that at a temperature of +30 ¬∞ C it is much colder in the caves outside. </li><li>  Going on an excursion to the caves, take water and sandwiches or cookies with you: there are no shops nearby, and in a few cafes the menu does not differ in variety. </li></ul><p>  And a few more tips.  Malaysia is a Muslim country, so strict rules apply here even in public transport.  For example, most electric trains, as well as the Kuala Lumpur metro, have pink wagons that are designed only for Muslim women.  In addition, it is forbidden to smoke, eat, drink, or transport animals in vehicles. </p>
