  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crocheted shawls: schemes, description and recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A great addition to a women's wardrobe are knitted shawls.  They not only retain warmth, but also, thanks to openwork drawings, decorate the girl‚Äôs appearance, give her femininity and elegance.  The modern fashionistas once forgotten and seemingly out of fashion shawl is very popular.  Moreover, most girls want to create it with their own hands.  There are several ways to crochet a shawl, which will be discussed in detail in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.maschenzaehler.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Schemes and description of a knitted shawl" class="if uuid-2483319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2483319.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of Shawls </h2><p>  The standard size of the scarf is determined by the distance from one to the other hands in the position of arms extended to the sides.  This parameter is approximately 150 - 160 cm. Often, knitted shawls have a triangular shape with a length equal to half the width of the product.  The manufacture of such scarves begins either from the top, increasing the product along the edges, or from the middle of the base. </p><p>  There is a kind of shawl knitting in a semicircle.  To create a product in this way, needlewomen recommend using <span>crochet</span> patterns of round lace napkins.  Usually they contain several rapports of a pattern located round-off.  For a knitted shawl, it is enough to use the number of patterns that is half the circumference. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the easiest ways to knit scarves is to combine the same crochet motifs.  They can have a round, square or triangular shape.  Also can be both monophonic, and different shades. </p><p>  Another method, less common, is a set of chains of loops with a length equal to the widest side of the canvas.  Then, by reducing the columns and reducing the pattern at the edges, they reach the bottom corner of the scarf. </p><p>  Shawls are decorated with strapping edges around the entire perimeter with ordinary columns or crustacean steps.  Also, a beautiful edge can be laid in the pattern itself or knitted separately, and then sewn to the base.  Often crocheted shawls are decorated with fringe or long tassels from the same yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.blogyourwaytoantarctica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted shawls" class="if uuid-2483316" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2483316.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitting from the corner </h2><p>  A triangular-shaped shawl is knitted with a single piece of fabric from the bottom corner formed of several loops and a double crochet knit in the first link.  In the process of knitting, the product expands on both sides to the required size.  It is recommended to ensure that the pattern lies exactly from one as well as from the other edge, avoiding distortions.  According to the <span>scheme, crocheted knitted</span> shawls are formed by turning rows, in which the lifting loops at the beginning assume an ordinary column or a double crochet or two.  In most schemes, circles indicate air loops.  If several circles or dots are shown in a row, this means that you need to knit a chain of links in an amount corresponding to the pattern.  Crosses or pluses are ordinary double crochet posts.  The edges of the finished knitted shawl can be decorated with an openwork border or long tassels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Kneading from the middle of the long side </h2><p>  Knitting with this method involves the formation of a perpendicular strip dividing the triangular shape of the scarf in half.  The picture fits on both sides in a mirror image.  Following the description and pattern of a knitted shawl, the fabric is formed from columns with 1 double crochet and air loops, and to stretch the scarf in length, the middle of the row is knitted with a double crochet column.  Knitters recommend the use of cotton wool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crochetemoda.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crocheted Shawl Patterns" class="if uuid-2483338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2483338.jpg"></div><h2>  Semicircular Shawl </h2><p>  When knitting a scarf of this form, various patterns with an expanding pattern are used.  Such motifs as flakes, pineapples, shells form a semicircle well.  When crocheting shawls, it is necessary to adhere to the sequence of rows and a detailed description of the process.  You also need to familiarize yourself with the conventions and their implementation.  Following the scheme below crocheted shawls, draw a cord of 6 loops, close into a ring, connecting the first and last links.  Then make 4 loops to raise the next row and knit 15 double crochet into the formed ring.  Distribute the columns so that they occupy one half of the circle.  Next, follow the pattern, increasing the fan in every third row by one column.  Having tied the canvas to the required length, shape the edges with one row of simple columns.  This method of knitting shawls involves an openwork pattern and does not need additional wide strapping. </p><h2>  Fillet knitting </h2><p>  This type of knitting is a fine mesh of the same square holes.  Yarn is chosen mainly from cotton threads.  The fabric is knitted in successive rows in one direction, then, turning around, in the other.  The pattern is formed by filling the cells with double crochets.  Empty holes form due to the air loop between the columns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crochetkingdom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted shawls" class="if uuid-2483317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2483317.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting starts from the central corner of the shawl by dialing a chain of 10 links.  Then, in the 7th loop, one crochet column is knitted, then 3 loops are typed and 2 crochet columns are knitted in the last link, 3 loops between them again.  When turning the web, always dial 7 air loops.  In each empty arch of the last row, knit 3 columns with one crochet, and type three loops over the columns.  At the end of each knitted strip, dial 3 loops and form a single crochet column into a chain of lower row links.  Thus, the shawl will increase.  In the canvas, you can include filet patterns, for example, spiders or rhombuses. </p><h2>  Description of crocheted shawls of motifs. </h2><p>  Elements for a crocheted scarf can have a different shape, as well as knit in the technique of "grandmother's square" or "openwork".  Fragments of the future shawl are executed separately according to the scheme, then are connected in the manner corresponding to the general pattern.  After stitching the elements, the edges of the finished fabric are tied and decorated with brushes or fringes at will. </p><p>  When knitting square motifs, it is necessary to understand how half of this fragment fits in the form of a triangle, since incomplete elements of the square will be needed to form the wide side. </p><p>  When creating a shawl from fragments of a round shape, it is also necessary to study the knitting of the half of the element.  It should be noted that the gaps between large motifs are filled with small fragments.  You can use yarn in different colors that match each other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="description of crocheted shawls" class="if uuid-2483318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2483318.jpg"></div><p>  Women with magnificent forms are recommended to knit shawls of large sizes that do not contain a small pattern.  Large fragments look more elegant and do not burden the figure.  And most importantly, do not overdo it with various shades in which the basic structure of the pattern is lost. </p>
