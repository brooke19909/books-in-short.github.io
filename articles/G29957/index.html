The excellent Imeretinsky Hotel was not an exception, its rich infrastructure will turn any vacation into an unforgettable adventure.  Here guests of any income can have a great time, which makes the hotel even more attractive. </p><h2>  When did the hotel appear </h2><p>  The Imeretinsky Hotel (Adler) opened its doors for all comers a few months before the Olympics in September 2013.  Even then, the hotel was ready to receive guests in comfortable and beautifully furnished rooms with designer furniture. </p><h2>  Old name </h2><p>  At the time of its opening, the Imeretinsky 4 * hotel (Sochi) had a different name - Aivazovsky.  The modern name appeared a little later.  The creator of the entire infrastructure of the Imereti Lowland, the Basic Element company, decided to change the original name of the hotel, but at the same time retained its style and decoration. </p>
