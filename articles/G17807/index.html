  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We knit a hat with knitting needles: models, photos, job description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Everyone wants to look beautiful and stylish.  But in order to achieve this, it is necessary to select clothes and accessories, taking into account the features of their own appearance.  For example, starting from the type of figure or shade of the skin and eyes.  And everything seems to be nothing, because knowing your own strengths and weaknesses, it is very easy to choose one or another thing that will make the image perfect.  But only if such a thing is not in the assortment of the store, it remains only to choose from what is offered. </p><p>  Although not all people do just that.  There is nothing in the world that a man could not do with his own hands.  And garments are no exception to this rule.  Clothes can be sewn by hand or on a sewing machine, can be knitted or crocheted.  It all depends on preferences and skills.  In this article, we will pay attention to how to knit a hat. </p><h2>  What is important for a beginner to know? </h2><p>  If our reader is just learning the basics of knitting, then most likely he has no idea where to start.  Therefore, in the current paragraph, we will explain in detail which preparatory steps precede knitting a hat: </p><ol><li>  The first step is to determine which season requires the accessory. </li><li>  Then select the appropriate thread.  That is, for the winter it is better to take those that are thicker and woolen, and for spring - thin and light. </li><li>  Then pick up the knitting needles.  Experts advise focusing on the thickness of the thread.  If you want to get a clear pattern ‚Äúwithout holes‚Äù, you should pick up the needles of the same thickness as the thread itself.  If the knitting is planned to be loose or the person starting to knit tightens the loops very strongly, then the knitting needles can be two, or even three times thicker than the thread. </li><li>  Next, you should decide on the model of the header.  For example, brighter, lacy options or those that consist of plaits or braids are suitable for women.  Men, on the other hand, are calmer, rather, of dark colors, which are based on a simple elastic band.  If we knit a children's hat with knitting needles, the fantasy has no boundaries, because in this case you can use any color combinations and patterns. </li><li>  Finally, it is very important to calculate the correct number of loops for a product that will look perfect on your head.  How to do this, find out in the next paragraph. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="tems.gallery.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself knitted hat" class="if uuid-2367758" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2367758.jpg"></div><h2>  How to determine how many loops to dial? </h2><p>  We figured out the model, threads, tools and decided which hat to knit.  But just how do you know how many loops are required for a suitable-sized product?  Actually very simple.  And then our reader will be able to verify this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To determine the correct number of loops, you must: </p><ol><li>  Knit ten stitches. </li><li>  Knit ten rows with the selected pattern. </li><li>  Then, using a centimeter, measure the width of the resulting piece. </li><li>  Measure the width of the head. </li><li>  Divide the larger number into the smaller one. </li><li>  As a result, we get a certain figure. </li><li>  We multiply this figure by ten. </li><li>  And we get the number of loops for the perfect headgear. </li></ol><p>  Having solved this question, we proceed to the next step of the instruction "How to knit a hat with knitting needles for beginners." </p><div class="photo" data-original="keywordsuggest.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted hat" class="if uuid-2367764" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2367764.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make loops on knitting needles? </h2><p>  For a beginner who has just started learning the basics of knitting, it can be difficult to even dial loops.  Therefore, we simply cannot ignore this issue. </p><p>  To dial loops, you must: </p><ol><li>  Unwind a small "tail" from the ball. </li><li>  Roll the thread into a loop. </li><li>  Then it should be put on the thumb and forefinger of the left hand. </li><li>  Now we take both knitting needles in the right hand. </li><li>  We put them under the thread that stretches between the fingers. </li><li>  We hook the thread lying on the thumb. </li><li>  We draw through the resulting loop the one on the index finger. </li><li>  As a result, two loops are immediately on the knitting needles. </li><li>  Then again we pick up the thread from the thumb. </li><li>  And we stretch the thread through it from the index finger. </li><li>  The two previous steps are repeated as many times as necessary.  Until the right number of stitches appear on the knitting needles. </li></ol><p>  For beginners, the described process may seem too complicated, but this impression is misleading.  After all, if you understand the technology, over time it will be performed automatically.  Therefore, just in case, we will also provide step-by-step photo instructions.  Thanks to her, the technology "how to knit a hat with knitting needles for beginners" will be fully understood. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.cl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a hat" class="if uuid-2367741" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2367741.jpg"></div><h2>  What are the loops and how to knit them? </h2><p>  Before you start knitting the original hat, you need to figure out how to make different loops.  After all, alternating them with different options, it will be possible to "depict" a lot of drawings. </p><p>  There are only two types of main loops: purl and facial.  To tie the first, you should throw a thread from which new loops are knitted from the front side of the fabric.  Then, hook the first loop with the needle in the right hand and pull a new loop through it, as if ‚Äúdragging‚Äù it onto the right needle.  Front loops fit in the same way.  The only difference is that the main thread is behind the knitting needle in the left hand. </p><p>  And also beginners should be aware that the first and last loops in the canvas are called edge.  The first one just needs to be removed - transferred to the spoke in the right hand.  And we knit the last loop as the wrong one. </p><p>  When the loops are finished, we knit a hat with knitting needles.  To do this, we understand the most beautiful, original and lightweight patterns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="skidki73.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting hat" class="if uuid-2367769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2367769.jpg"></div><h2>  Gum ordinary </h2><p>  This pattern is considered the most popular, because a product made in such technology knits very quickly and simply.  But let's not get ahead of ourselves.  Let us explain that the elastic and front loops alternate in an elastic band.  The most advantageous options are: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  1 x 1; </li><li>  1 x 2; </li><li>  2 x 2; </li><li>  3 x 3. </li></ul><p>  However, it is not enough to choose the gum option.  It is very important to correctly calculate the number of loops so that the pattern on the canvas looks finished.  For example, if a reader chooses a 1 x 2 elastic, the total number of loops of a repeating pattern called rapport is three.  This means that the total number of loops should consist of the following mathematical calculations: multiply the number of loops in the rapport by the number obtained during the calculations in the second paragraph of the current article, plus two edge loops. </p><p>  Having figured out the counts, pattern and technology, we knit a hat with knitting needles. </p><h2>  Chess Pattern </h2><p>  The following option is very simple to perform if our reader understands the principle of knitting ordinary gum.  After all, it can be said to be based on it.  But his main secret is that the number of alternating loops and rows is equal.  For example, a ‚Äúchess‚Äù pattern consists of a series of two wrong and two front loops.  So, you need to knit the first row as follows: </p><ol><li>  Remove the first loop. </li><li>  Knit the second and third, as facial. </li><li>  The third and fourth, as purl. </li><li>  Thus, the pattern repeat is two facial and two wrong loops. </li><li>  It should be repeated until the end. </li><li>  If the number of loops is calculated correctly, then at the end of the row there will be one "extra" loop. </li><li>  It should be knitted, like a wrong side. </li><li>  The second row fits in the pattern.  Edge is removed, and then again follows a series of facial and wrong loops.  The latter is the wrong side. </li></ol><p>  The hat connected, according to this instruction, is quite voluminous and very original. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bride.wannabemagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hat to the girl" class="if uuid-2367771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2367771.jpg"></div><h2>  Dots Pattern </h2><p>  Another interesting pattern is obtained by observing the following technology: </p><ol><li>  The number of loops in the rapport is two.  So, the total number of loops in a row must be even. </li><li>  Having typed the loop, we proceed to the execution of the pattern.  To do this, remove the first loop. </li><li>  We knit the second, as a front one. </li><li>  The third, as the wrong side. </li><li>  Then alternate them. </li><li>  We knit the last loop, regardless of the pattern, as if it were the wrong one. </li><li>  We pass to the second row. </li><li>  We remove the edge loop. </li><li>  And then we knit according to the drawing.  However, we do not repeat it, but, on the contrary, ‚Äúconfuse‚Äù it.  That is, where the front knit purl and vice versa. </li><li>  In the third row, repeat the steps described for the first row. </li></ol><p>  Using this technology, we knit a children's hat or an adult.  The pattern is suitable for both options.  However, it looks best on female representatives.  No matter how old they are. </p><h2>  Vertical Dash Pattern </h2><p>  This picture is very original, but it is very easy to connect.  It is only necessary: </p><ol><li>  Repeat the steps described in paragraphs 1-6 of the previous instruction. </li><li>  Then go to the second row. </li><li>  And we knit the loops as the figure ‚Äúindicates‚Äù. </li><li>  Then we go to the third row. </li><li>  And in it we change the seamy and front loops in places. </li><li>  In the next row we knit again, observing the pattern. </li><li>  Then we alternate the loops again. </li></ol><p>  The result is an unusual canvas.  In addition, knitting such a hat for girls or women is a pleasure.  Indeed, after a couple of rows, the pattern comes out, as if by itself. </p><h2>  Horizontal "dash" pattern </h2><p>  The following figure presented in this article is also very easy to do on your own.  After all, it is almost similar to the previous one.  The only difference is that in it the rapport will be equal to four loops.  That is, consist of two seamy and two facial loops. </p><p>  The technology is as follows: </p><ol><li>  We remove the first loop, after which we knit a 2 x 2 elastic band. </li><li>  We knit the last one as the wrong one. </li><li>  We pass to the second row. </li><li>  We remove the first loop. </li><li>  And then again we begin to "confuse" the pattern.  Over the front we knit purl and vice versa. </li></ol><p>  Knitting such a hat is also very simple.  And the finished product will certainly look interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="muscao.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="women's hat" class="if uuid-2367761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2367761.jpg"></div><h2>  Pattern "rhombuses" </h2><p>  Another rather unusual pattern will turn out if you follow the instructions below.  The pattern repeat in this case is equal to four loops.  Therefore, the total number of loops should consist of a multiple of four and two edge loops. </p><p>  Thus, knitting a hat with knitting needles for a girl is very simple.  You only need to understand its technology: </p><ol><li>  The first loop should be removed. </li><li>  The next knit as the wrong one. </li><li>  Then one facial. </li><li>  And behind her are three wrong ones. </li><li>  Then again, one facial, and then three purl. </li><li>  If the number of loops is calculated correctly, there will be two wrong loops at the end. </li><li>  In the second and subsequent rows, repeat steps 1-6. </li></ol><p>  If you want to decorate with rhombuses, you can also wear a women's hat - we knit it with knitting needles according to the above pattern. </p><h2>  Lace pattern number 1 </h2><p>  The patterns described above are more suitable for winter or autumn hats.  In the spring, when everything around is so bright and colorful, I also want to decorate myself with something openwork and airy.  For this reason, further we bring to the reader's attention lace patterns.  Let's start by exploring technology for the simplest of them.  The rapport in this case is two loops.  Typing, focusing on this indicator, the desired number of loops.  We proceed to knitting the pattern, on the basis of which we knit the hat with knitting needles (with the description below): </p><ol><li>  We remove the edge loop. </li><li>  We knit the next two as one face. </li><li>  Then we make a crochet.  Just hook the main thread to the knitting needle in the right hand. </li><li>  Repeat steps 2-3 until one loop remains at the end of the row. </li><li>  We knit it as if it were seamy. </li><li>  We knit all the other rows of the women's hat in the same way. </li></ol><h2>  Lace pattern number 2 </h2><p>  The following pattern is a bit more complicated.  But it will surely turn out if you follow the scheme presented in the picture below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bride.wannabemagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cap pattern" class="if uuid-2367794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2367794.jpg"></div><h2>  How to "pull off" a hat? </h2><p>  Many beginners encounter difficulties when reducing loops, finishing knitting hats.  As a result, in some cases the product is small, while in others it is too bristling right on the top of the head.  To prevent this, we will explain in detail how to reduce loops correctly: </p><ol><li>  We determine the height of the headdress on our own and knit the hat with knitting needles for a woman, man or child, focusing on any of the patterns described above. </li><li>  Then, when the height is sufficient, that is, the cap covers the ears, and on the top of the head there is a small circle whose diameter is about eight to ten centimeters, you can begin to gradually remove the loops. </li><li>  Moreover, you can continue to knit a pattern, or you can go to knit facial loops. </li><li>  In the first row, remove the first loop, knit the next four according to the drawing, and then two together.  So we move to the end.  The last loop is the wrong one. </li><li>  In the second row and subsequent even, you should knit a hat with knitting needles, observing the pattern. </li><li>  In the third row, we also remove the first loop, knit the next three according to the drawing, after them two together.  We continue until one edge loop remains. </li><li>  In the fifth row, we decrease one loop every two. </li><li>  In the seventh - through one. </li><li>  In the ninth and subsequent - every two loops, not counting the edge. </li><li>  When ten loops remain, we break off the main thread, stretch through them and tie. </li><li>  Then we sew the product and decorate it with a pompom. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.thehunt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a hat" class="if uuid-2367752" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2367752.jpg"></div><p>  We hope this instruction "Women's hats with knitting needles - we knit ourselves" will help our reader to please himself with a new thing. </p>
