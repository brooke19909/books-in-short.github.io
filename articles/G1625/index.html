This extraordinary and even fabulous tropical kingdom destroys all archaic ideas about beach holidays.  The main feature of Thai tourism is its diversity and non-triviality.  Only in Thailand, centuries-old Buddhist traditions, authentic temples and grandiose "red light streets", national parks, corners of unspoiled nature and noisy, overpopulated megacities are somehow combined.  Only in Thai resorts can you afford total tropical relaxation and beyond shopping, enjoy the beauties of coral reefs, secluded islands, cliffs that have appeared in many Hollywood films, taste the strangest fruits, try Thai massage and dishes from one of the most spicy cuisines in the world. </p><p>  In Thailand, lovers of yoga, a healthy lifestyle and desperate drinkers and party-goers, radical pilgrims and courageous sex tourists, beach lovers and extreme sports enthusiasts, active city tourists, shopping lovers and travelers who crave to spend time in an atmosphere of tropical nature enjoying the beautiful scenery . </p><p>  It‚Äôs hard to come up with entertainment that you can‚Äôt try while traveling in Thailand.  You can talk about rest in this wondrous, grandiose, hypertrophied country in many respects forever.  And talking about it, it is almost impossible to exaggerate its advantages and even disadvantages (and this elephant cannot be hidden anywhere). </p><h2>  Phuket - the most pathos resort of Thailand </h2><p>  The islands of Phuket and Samui attract tourists mainly with high-quality, beautiful beaches, a rich spa.  Phuket is the largest <span>island in Thailand,</span> but at the same time the most developed tourist destination.  Phuket has a very beautiful nature, a lot of beaches in the Bounty style, beautiful coral reefs, and well-developed infrastructure.  On the west coast there are many pathos hotels, quite expensive, which belong to the most famous world hotel chains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The most popular form of transport in Phuket among tourists is motorcycle taxi.  On it you can travel inexpensively (40-50 THB) for short distances.  A classic taxi costs ~ 600 THB per hour.  For independent trips for short distances, tourists often rent scooters.  They are inexpensive, do not consume a lot of gasoline and, in conditions of heavy traffic on the roads of crowded resort towns, behave better than other modes of transport.  Also, rental of boats and boats for cruises and trips to small picturesque islands and cliffs, which managed to light up in more than a dozen box office films, is in demand on the islands. </p><h2>  How to choose a hotel in Phuket? </h2><p>  When choosing a resort hotel in Phuket, you should pay attention to your own trip goals.  The fact is that Phuket is a rather diverse resort.  Family travelers and leisurely travelers should avoid the Patong area whenever possible.  This is a very active and noisy corner, it is also called "Little Pattaya."  This is a paradise for shoppers and party-goers.  Fans of a relaxing and quality holiday should pay attention to hotels on the west coast of Phuket.  Also in the south of the island there is a mountain range, and in general the area in Phuket is quite hilly.  Add to this the precarious state of some highways, the generally bad internet and the ridiculously tragic situation with driving rules and traditions.  All these factors do not greatly contribute to the popularization of the island among fans of visiting attractions and traveling on rented cars.  So it is advisable for such tourists to settle close to the sights they seek to visit.  Given the size of the island, this is not at all difficult. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Baumanburi 3 *, Phuket.

    <p>  Fans of visiting the sights will also not be bored in Patong.  Just 20 min.  drive from the Baumanburi Hotel 3 * (Phuket) is the world famous statue of the Big Buddha, the temple of the same name.  You can also visit the botanical garden, a huge park of orchids, crocodile or pearl farms. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In Thailand, in low-cost hotels it is very rare to work on ol inclusive.  The thing is that they are mainly occupied by young, dynamic tourists who travel around the islands, visit various interesting places, therefore, they do not want their daily regime to depend on the schedule of breakfasts, lunches and dinners in hotels.  In addition, the catering industry in Phuket is very well developed.  On the street along Patong Beach there are a lot of cafes and restaurants for every taste and budget. </p><p>  The most common food option among the guests of the Baumanburi 3 * hotel is BB (breakfast only).  At the hotel, breakfast is served in the main buffet restaurant from 6:30 to 10:30. </p><p>  Nevertheless, Baumanburi 3 * is more like the Turkish version of a budget resort hotel than the average inexpensive guesthouse in Thailand.  The complex has an <span>a la carte</span> restaurant and several bars, so that guests have the opportunity to have a tasty meal without having to go to the beach or Bangle Road. </p>

    <p>  Lunches and dinners can be ordered at an <span>√† la carte</span> Lobby Caf√© Restaurant for an additional fee.  He specializes in international and Thai cuisine. </p><p>  The hotel also has a poolside bar, which is open from 11:00 until midnight.  It can order cool drinks, alcohol, snacks.  And a lobby bar that is open until 19:00. </p><p>  Many people consider relaxing in Thailand and not tasting the most unimaginable tropical fruits sacrilege.  This applies not only to extremely exotic fruits such as rambutan, jusifruit or passionflower.  Russian tourists also note that in Thailand, one should also taste the bananas, mangoes, papaya, and melons that are familiar to many.  Ripe and fresh, they have a completely different, wonderful taste.  It is impossible to advise in advance where it is more profitable to buy fresh fruit: in markets or in supermarkets.  However, the markets must be careful and pre-negotiate the price and currency.  Some merchants do not disdain to weigh and deceive tourists. </p>

The south coast of Patong is a very popular place among young, cheerful and unassuming tourists.  It is definitely not suitable for lovers of a secluded and quality sea holiday.  <span>This is the patrimony of</span> lovers of active pastime, beach sports, fun.  Patong Beach is very well equipped, has a developed infrastructure (cafes, supermarkets, cabins, toilets, parking lots, lifeguard stations, water ski rental, boards and scooters).  But on the other hand, the beach line is almost always crowded, the sea near the coast is unclear, the coast is not very clean, but very noisy.  In addition, the entire infrastructure on the beach is paid: sunbeds, umbrellas, mattresses need to be rented additionally. </p>

    <p>  For those who want more serene sea holidays, you should spend 15 minutes on a trip from the Baumanburi Hotel 3 * (Phuket) to Karon Beach.  On the banks of the Karon there are many expensive chain hotels.  This is the most luxurious and pathos beach in Phuket, it is flat, comfortable and very picturesque.  The coast is covered with quartz sand; it differs in structure from usual.  Such sand does not heat up much even in direct sunlight, but crunches underfoot like fresh snow.  Karon Beach is also municipal, everyone can relax on it for free, but sun loungers, umbrellas and other amenities need to be rented for an additional fee. </p><h2>  Hotel service </h2><p>  It should be noted that in Phuket among budget hotels it is not customary to provide a wide range of services for vacationers.  Many guesthouses provide only the possibility of accommodation and food.  Diverse service is more the prerogative of inexpensive resort hotels in Tunisia or Egypt.  But the Baumanburi 3 * hotel compares favorably with other democratic institutions in Thailand.  The set of free and paid services provided on the territory of the hotel complex is quite large. </p><p>  So, from free services, the following options are available to guests: </p><ul><li>  free housekeeping; </li><li>  currency exchange services; </li><li>  safe at the reception; </li><li>  gym; </li><li>  luggage room; </li><li>  24 hour reception. </li></ul>

The restaurant provides high chairs upon request, and a cot (free of charge) is brought to the room.  Babysitting services are available at an additional cost. </p><p>  In principle, Patong Beach is very suitable for families with children.  Its shore is sandy, the sand is shallow, the entrance to the sea is gentle.  Hotel Baumanburi 3 * (Thailand, Patong, Phuket) is located almost near the beach.  Such a good location deprives parents of the need to get to the beach in the heat.  But the public at this resort is very mottled.  It is undeniable that many young tourists come to Patong for new intimate experiences.  Therefore, only very courageous travel agents are able to recommend this area as an ideal resort for families with kids.  Nevertheless, not all places in Patong are teeming with depraved institutions and tipsy students.  There are also suitable places for families to relax in the resort.  And some hotels also provide the necessary services for young tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Baumanburi Hotel 3 *.  Reviews </h2><p>  Hotel reviews by tourists are an important source of information, especially for travelers who have never been to Thai resorts.  However, it should be understood that the reviews of tourists are often implicated in personal experience and very subjective impressions.  It is not necessary to require bureaucratic accuracy, sobriety and objectivity from the information in the reviews.  This is especially true for such a controversial tourist area like Phuket.  As practice shows, tourists mostly trust the feedback of previous travelers even more than the opinion of managers in travel agencies.  Almost all profile sites and booking systems can find many different opinions about the rest at the Baumanburi 3 * hotel.  Reviews about him, as one would expect, are not always unambiguous. </p>

    <p>  In positive reviews, tourists note the hotel‚Äôs good location, spacious, comfortable rooms, quality cleaning, a wide range of services, including car rental, scooters, currency exchange, good, prompt service, friendly staff, delicious breakfasts. </p><p>  The authors of negative reviews say that the hotel is more suitable for young, active people.  Some have justified claims that the hotel is very noisy, the music in the hotel and in neighboring establishments interferes with a relaxing night's rest.  Also, tourists did not appreciate the lack of normal knowledge of English (and, of course, Russian) of the staff, slow paid Internet, old, poorly functioning equipment in the rooms. </p>

    <p>  But overall the hotel has a good rating based on reviews from tourists.  This is a decent resort hotel.  Yes, it really suits more for young budget tourists.  Family travelers, lovers of high-quality unobtrusive service, all inclusive and bird-humming under the windows, instead of city noise, should pay attention to hotels closer to Karon or Kata beach. </p>
