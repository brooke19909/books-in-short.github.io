In the 13th century, the Knights of the Livonian Order built Mebelburg Castle.  At the end of the 14th century, the city passed to the Teutons.  Memel has long served as a stronghold.  In the Middle Ages it was destroyed more than once. </p><p>  Thanks to the Germans, the city turned into a large trading port, with which only Danzig and Koenigsberg, that is, Kaliningrad, competed.  Klaipeda was the northernmost settlement in Germany.  There were about 80 ports.  In the middle of the XIX century, the development of typography began. </p><p>  In the twenties of the last century, the Memel region was under the control of the Entente.  Here was the French garrison.  Until a major rebellion broke out.  In 1924, Memel became part of Lithuania.  Then he got the modern name - Klaipeda. </p><p>  Buses run regularly from Kaliningrad to this Lithuanian city.  There is something to see here.

There is also a dolphinarium where performances are regularly held that are interesting to both adults and children.  You can get to the museum by ferry.  From the pier you need to turn right, then go towards the sea. </p><p>  Klaipeda is also worth a visit to the Historical Museum, which is located in the Old Town.  Of interest are not only the exhibits, but also the building itself, inside resembling the decoration of an old ship. </p><p>  The center of the historical district is Theater Square.  Here is the <span>Drama Theater.</span>  The square was a witness to events that played an important role in the history of the city.  The theater, which is located here, was once conducted by Richard Wagner himself. </p><p>  The sad events in the history of Lithuania are narrated by an exhibition in the KGB Memorial Chamber.  However, there are few exhibits.  This is a kind of memory for the victims of the totalitarian regime. </p><p>  Anhen von Tarau - the so-called sculpture, which is located near the Drama Theater and is the name of the heroine of the song of the poet of the 17th century.  A monument to a stranger girl has been standing here for a long time.  However, during the years of Nazi occupation, it was destroyed.  In 1989, an exact copy of the old sculpture was installed on Theater Square. </p>
