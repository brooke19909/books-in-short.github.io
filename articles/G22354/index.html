In Calella there is everything that a modern tourist may need: a warm sea, a large number of night clubs, hotels and restaurants for any wallet and, of course, parks where you can rent water transport.  It is believed that it is from the sea distance that Spain appears in a completely different light to the human eye. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain calella" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/275808.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Calella, like most coastal cities in Spain, was previously only a fishing village.  Seafood, olive oil and other natural products that the region is rich in were exported from this place.  Calella became a city only in the twentieth century, and its popularity as a resort began to grow in the second half of the century.  Today, tourists from all over the world come to this cozy town.  And this very place is another proof of how rich and diverse Spain is. </p><p>  Calella, as mentioned above, is located in close proximity to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãso they get there through <span>this metropolis.</span>  You can get from the airport directly to the resort by a comfortable commuter train or by renting a car.  The road will take in both cases no more than an hour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calella spain map" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/275806.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We can say that the holiday season is standard here, but it begins in April and ends in October - this is how all of Spain lives.  Calella falls into the subtropical climate zone, so in summer it is quite hot, the temperature exceeds 30 degrees.  And in winter it becomes cool on the streets of the town, naturally, the sea itself cools down. </p><p>  Nature in this region is a typical embodiment of Catalonia - rocky shores, golden beaches and the blue sea, which sometimes worries, but on warm days pleases tourists with its transparent surface.  Fans of variety and excursions most often go to conquer the peaks of the local hills, at the foot of which the city itself is located.  Well, most vacationers sunbathe on the beaches, which are well equipped with everything you need.  Along the coastline there is a picturesque promenade with restaurants and beach cafes.  Also in this place there are a lot of souvenir shops where you can buy yourself something to remember about the rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãcalella spain" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/275807.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Despite its small area, the museum city is also Calella (Spain).  A map of this region will come to the aid of anyone who wants to see the sights of the city.  The main historical monument among them is the Iglesia de Santa Maria Church.  In the center of the city there are also many palaces built in the styles of neo-classic and modern.  But the symbol of the city is by no means considered the creation of human hands, but the natural heritage, namely lilac acacia.  There are a lot of such plants here, and they are incredibly highly valued by local residents and authorities. </p><p>  Here is such an unforgettable, albeit small, Catalan city of Calella.  Spain is full of secrets, and one of them can be solved here, if you climb small rocks or stroll under the shady branches of lilac trees. </p>
