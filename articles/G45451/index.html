The Fly FF301 model is intended for people who need calls primarily in a mobile device, and then everything else.

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  In the box with the device, in addition to the device itself, a headset is supplied, which is also an antenna for the FM receiver installed in the gadget.  Here are the other accessories the Fly FF301 phone contains: instructions, certificate and charger. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The case of the device is made of plastic and has a strict and attractive appearance.  The user will be able to choose one of two color options: black or white.  Build Fly FF301 is very high quality, the design does not play and does not stagger, it is also worth noting the minimum gaps. </p>

    <p>  On the front panel there is a display, a speaker for conversations and keys.  The buttons came out large enough, so the risk of mistakes when typing is minimal.  The navigation joystick and keys responsible for the main control turned out to be quite convenient. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the back of the device is a camera, flash, also playing the role of a flashlight, and a music speaker.  Side keys in the gadget are missing. </p><p>  The upper part of the device is empty like sidewalls, at the bottom there is a <span>micro-USB jack, a microphone</span> and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. </p><p>  The overall dimensions of the device are 56.8x129x11.8 mm, weight - 104 g. The Fly FF301 cell phone lies comfortably in the hand and does not slip out, and there are no fingerprints on the matte surface of the case. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The size of the Fly FF301 TFT-display is 3 inches, the resolution is ‚Äì240x320 pixels.  With so many pixels, you should not expect any miracles in terms of color reproduction.  Settings allow you to adjust the backlight level - this is useful when the brightness needs to be lowered to extend battery life. </p><p>  The viewing angles turned out to be very bad: when you look at the screen from the side, it is almost impossible to parse the contents.  The colors are very pale and nondescript, so you will not be able to fully enjoy the video or picture. </p><p>  As for the proportions of the screen, then for such a phone they are selected almost perfectly.  The display looks quite large, it contains a large amount of information.  This will be a plus when browsing the Internet or any document. </p>

    <h2>  Fly FF301: specifications and technical capabilities </h2><p>  Since the Fly FF301 mobile phone is not specially designed for any other tasks, except for calls and SMS messages, the processor is installed very modest here: its clock frequency is only 312 MHz.  However, traveling through menu items and using certain standard options is quite simple and convenient: the system does not slow down or freeze.  The processor quickly processes the photos taken by the camera.  If the user still decides to use the device to access the Internet, he will have problems downloading heavy, resource-intensive web pages. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the memory for storing data, by default the device has only 32 MB installed.  With such a hard drive you can‚Äôt even take a photo with a resolution of 1.3 megapixels.  To fix the situation, a memory card will help, the connector for which is located inside the phone under the battery.  The gadget is capable of recognizing flash drives up to 32 GB in size.  To transfer data, the Fly FF301 phone has Bluetooth. </p><p>  A nice feature is the ability to connect two SIM-cards at once.  Their connectors are located next to the memory card slot.  This will allow you to use the phone for communication even more efficiently by installing, say, two cards of different operators or different tariffs. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  One can‚Äôt rely on the quality of optics: what is 1.3 MP in our time?  If the developers endowed the device with autofocus, then in the street in good light it would not be possible to take the worst pictures, but due to its absence, the image quality looks terrible.  Only portraits and panoramas are tolerant, and even for viewing only on a small screen. </p><p>  The flash will fit, rather, as a flashlight, since this LED is not able to properly illuminate the territory on which the survey is being performed.  The image always turns out to be dark and of poor quality, therefore, if you take photographs using such a camera, then it is best to carry it out in the open on a clear sunny day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also, the phone is capable of shooting videos with a resolution of 320x240, but their quality clearly leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  Other functions of the camera include brightness, contrast and various filters: black and white, sepia, and others. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Fly FF301 is capable of boasting a very loud and clear speaker.  Thanks to this, it is almost impossible to miss an important call or to oversleep at work without hearing an alarm.  The audio system functions solidly and produces quite decent sound quality for a budget category device. </p><p>  The audio player plays MP3, but to download tracks, the user needs to purchase a memory card, which, unfortunately, is not included.  Musical compositions listened through the headset have standard sound. </p><p>  For those who like to spend time enjoying the radio stations, the developers have installed an FM receiver.  The antenna for him is a headset, so without connecting it, radio activation is impossible. </p><h2>  Applications </h2><p>  A set of pre-installed applications is very scarce: we only have a calculator, a flashlight and a converter.  The flash, although unsuitable for lighting images, copes well with the role of a flashlight that can illuminate a small area.  So in those cases when you need to find the keys to the apartment in a bag, being in a dark entrance, you can count on the phone. </p>

    <p>  In the "Services" section there is an option to access the Internet.  It is not possible to fully access the worldwide network on such an apparatus, but it is quite possible to look through some simple pages that do not require a large amount of system resources. </p><p>  The Fly FF301 black mobile phone has three alarms for which you can set your own tunes, there is also a timer, world clock and other unimportant options. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  One of the gadget's strengths is the 1450 mAh lithium-ion battery.  In talk mode, he can work up to 5 hours, and in standby mode - up to 400 hours.  Music lovers will be pleased with the fact that it is possible to listen to songs in the device‚Äôs player for up to 35 hours without additional recharging.  A modest screen ‚Äúeats‚Äù the battery very slowly, so it is extremely unlikely that at the most unexpected moment you will be with zero charge. </p>

    <h2>  Model and firmware price </h2><p>  The average cost of a phone starts from 1990 and reaches approximately 2390 rubles.  If there were any problems with the device‚Äôs system (it began to work unstably, fail, or the device completely refused), then in special workshops the firmware for Fly FF301 will cost about 1000 rubles.  The time of work in each service depends on the degree of employment of specialists.  Another question: does it make sense to pay almost half the cost of a new device for firmware?  It‚Äôs not a fact that after it the phone will work like new.  In such cases, it is easiest to purchase another device. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Another <span>budget device</span> with modest characteristics.  Of the advantages, it is worth highlighting an attractive design, high-quality assembly, a capacious battery, a low price, a loud speaker and the ability to work with two SIM cards at once.  The disadvantages include a frankly weak camera, a faded screen with poor viewing angles, low resolution and a negligible amount of ‚Äúnative‚Äù device memory, which is why, in addition to the device, the user is immediately forced to purchase a memory card. </p><h2>  Fly FF301: customer reviews </h2><p>  Almost all users praise the case of the device: they consider it quite attractive, thin and comfortable.  There are no complaints about the design of the device. </p><p>  Concerning the screen, the opinions are mixed: some believe that the display is quite tolerable for that kind of money, while others scold a small poor-quality font and poor viewing angles. </p><p>  The sound of the device impressed many owners.  Users admit that they did not expect such a qualitative dynamics from the budget category model.  A good conversational speaker is also noted: it does not wheeze and produces a loud sound, so the interlocutor is heard clearly and clearly. </p><p>  The lack of T9 and support for Java confused some customers, but if they consider this a drawback, then it‚Äôs not a big one. </p>

    <p>  Almost everyone criticizes the camera.  There are not enough pixels to take a decent shot, and the poor quality of the photo is due to the lack of autofocus.  However, there are those who believe that for 2000 rubles you should not expect more from the camera at all, and attributing it to a clear flaw does not make sense. </p><p>  Many are satisfied with the set of pre-installed applications that allow them to cope with the simplest tasks.  The browser seemed too slow for the owners.  In isolated cases, the incorrect operation of the alarm clock was noted: in some cases it rings, in others it does not. </p><p>  Battery life users unanimously consider the indisputable advantage of the model.  You can listen to the radio and player constantly, without fear of losing charge at the most inopportune moment.  In standby mode, the phone lives up to 400 hours. </p><p>  Users praise the ability to work with two SIM cards at once.  Some rearrange cards from two <span>old phones</span> to this model and claim that making calls this way is much easier and more convenient. </p><p>  There is a good interaction between the phone and the PC: it connects quickly, data is transmitted without problems, - Bluetooth also works properly. </p><p>  There were also those owners who do not mind souls in Fly FF301.  Their reviews say that the price-quality criterion not only justified itself, but also exceeded all expectations.  The amount of the phone suits, the necessary set of functions is present, the battery lives for a long time, the speaker is loud - what else is required from an ordinary dialer? </p><p>  Owners are advised to immediately purchase a protective film for the screen when buying a phone, since it is very scratched and the marks remain very noticeable.  But as for the case, the matte surface virtually eliminates the appearance of fingerprints and is badly scratched. </p><p>  They criticize the small capacity of the telephone card: only 100 numbers, each of which will be possible to bind only one number.  In addition, users are confused by the lack of MMS. </p>
