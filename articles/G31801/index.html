Each driver should know that he must have an insurance policy, which may be necessary in various situations, including during a traffic accident.

If for a certain period of time driving a vehicle the driver does not get into an accident, then his insurance class will increase.  This gives the motorist the opportunity to significantly save on insurance. </p>

    <p>  In some cases, the discount may reach 50 percent of the cost of the policy.  Therefore, the loss of KBM on a motor citizen can be an unpleasant surprise for any driver.  However, as practice shows, it is not uncommon for a motorist, when extending the validity of the insurance, to discover that its cost has not only not decreased, but, on the contrary, has increased significantly.  Why do such situations arise and what should motorists do at the same time?  How to recover KBM for compulsory motor third party liability insurance?  Rosgosstrakh is a great solution.  This and much more will be discussed later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why is there a change in the size of the MTPL discount? </h2><p>  All information about insurance periods and the driver, on the basis of which the cost of car insurance services is calculated, is entered into a single electronic database.  However, as a result of a system malfunction or a human factor, a mistake can be made that will affect the size of the discount when renewing car insurance.  There are a number of other reasons that depend solely on the driver and lead to a reset of the KBM.  Before figuring out how to recover KBM by compulsory motor liability insurance, you must first find out what reasons may be behind the change in the bonus-malus coefficient. </p><h2>  Replacing a driver‚Äôs license or personal data </h2><p>  Most often, the burning of accumulated bonuses is caused by this reason.  When replacing a driver‚Äôs license, the document number changes, therefore, in order to restore the KBM, it is necessary to make the appropriate changes to the single PCA registry.  This also applies to changes in personal data.  If the driver changed his surname, then when the policy is extended, its insurance rating is automatically reset. </p>

    <p>  <span>How to recover the CBM coefficient</span> for compulsory motor liability insurance in this case?  To take advantage of the insurance points accumulated over many years, you need to contact your insurer.  This can be done via the Internet or come directly to the office of the company. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The insurer did not transmit driver data to RSA </h2><p>  Everyone can make a mistake because of their negligence, forgetfulness or tiredness.  Employees of insurance companies are no exception.  In addition, the insurance company may go bankrupt or cease operations.  Information in a single electronic database is updated every year.  If, for any reason, the insurer did not do this, then the driver's insurance experience will be reset, and he will lose his discount.  About how to restore MSC in compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in this case, it will be described further. </p><h2>  Invalid Insurance Contract </h2><p>  If at the time of signing the insurance contract any mistakes were made, then deliberately incorrect information will be entered into the electronic database.  This will lead to the fact that the AIS will perceive one driver as a completely different person and when calculating the cost of OSAGO it will issue the full cost of the policy without taking into account the size of the accumulated discount. </p><h2>  Multi-person Driving Permit </h2><p>  If two drivers are entered in the insurance policy when applying for insurance, then a coefficient with a lower face value is taken into account.  How to recover the CBM discount on compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in this case?  Alas, nothing can be done here, since everything is clearly spelled out in the legislation and is standard practice. </p><h2>  Making changes to the insurance policy or interruption of the accident-free experience </h2><p>  The size of the CBM is affected by the length of service that accrues for a full year of continuous driving, if no traffic accidents were recorded.  If the driver takes a break of more than 12 months, then all his accumulated points, which are taken into account when <span>calculating the KBM,</span> completely burn out.  In addition, points are not awarded to the driver when applying for an insurance policy with a validity period of less than 12 months, as well as when amendments are made to it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  In what cases is MSC not taken into account? </h2><p>  So, we examined the main errors that can affect the size of the KBM during the registration of OSAGO.  Next, we find out how to recover the <span>coefficient of KBM</span> for CTP.  Rosgosstrakh will be a great solution.  First, consider the main cases in which the discount may not be taken into account.  At the same time, up-to-date information about the driver can be entered into a single electronic database, but when applying for a policy, he will have to pay its full cost. </p>

    <p>  The most common cause of this problem is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Break of the insurance period or making adjustments to the insurance policy.  The discount increases as the driver continuously drives the car without getting into an accident.  If the break in the insurance period exceeds 12 months, then all accumulated points are automatically reset.  This also applies to cases when insurance was issued for less than a year or any changes were made to the policy.  For example, another person authorized to drive a car was entered.  In this case, there is not a single way of how to restore MSC in compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, since the legislation does not provide for such an opportunity. </li><li>  Making insurance, involving driving an unlimited number of people.  In this case, the discount indicated in the last insurance contract is taken into account.  In addition, it is valid only if the policy is issued on the same machine. </li></ul><p>  To make it clearer, let's give a small example.  A citizen bought a new car and when applying for insurance, he wanted to indicate an unlimited number of people in the policy.  In this case, he is not entitled to a discount, and the cost of compulsory motor liability insurance will be full.  However, if the insurance was issued for an old vehicle, then KBM would be taken into account by the insurer when concluding the MTPL agreement.  How to restore KBM in previous years in this case?  This will be discussed further. </p><h2>  Is it necessary to restore the KBM? </h2><p>  The procedure for restoring the KBM is quite troublesome, so the driver will have to face paperwork and also make a lot of effort if he wants to return his previous discount. </p><p>  However, it is worth it for several reasons: </p><ul><li>  significant savings on car insurance; </li><li>  accumulation of accident-free experience and insurance points; </li><li>  Using online services, you can solve the problem in just a few days; </li><li>  after restoration of the bonus-malus coefficient, the driver will receive a refund of the entire overpayment for previous policies. </li></ul><p>  Thus, the facts in favor of the restoration of MSC are indisputable.  However, how to restore the MTPL CTP in VSK? </p><h2>  What documents will be required? </h2><p>  In order to maximize the speed of the discount recovery process, it is recommended that you first identify the cause of the problem and prepare the necessary package of documents.  You will have to tinker a lot with the first one, but as for the second, you need to make photocopies and scans of the following documents: </p><ul><li>  passports of a citizen of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  driver's license; </li><li>  all the policies that you have in your hands. </li></ul>

    <p>  At the same time, it is very important that you have both photocopies and electronic versions of the documents listed above, since you will not only have to personally contact various authorities, but also submit a lot of requests by e-mail.  If you have not saved the old policies, then do not despair, because they can be restored.  Each insurance company stores contracts with its customers.  You just need to contact the company office and request an extract stating that you do not have insurance payments.  It will take no more than five business days, so you won‚Äôt have to wait long. </p><p>  So, now you know the reason for resetting the KBM and have already prepared all the necessary documents.  But how to recover <span>the CBM coefficient</span> for compulsory motor liability insurance? </p><h2>  Car Insurance Discount Recovery </h2><p>  There are three main ways to restore the discount rate for vehicle insurance services.  To do this, you need to contact one of the following organizations: </p><ul><li>  Insurance Company. </li><li>  Central Bank of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  <span>Russian Union of Auto Insurers.</span> </li></ul><p>  Organizations are arranged in order of increasing level of influence, so you should first contact your insurer.  If this does not bring any positive results, then you need to use the help of higher authorities.  To understand the process of rebuilding discounts, let's take a closer look at how to restore MTP in OSA through PCA through each organization. </p><h2>  Contact the office of the insurance company </h2><p>  According to the current legislation of the Russian Federation, the insurance company is obliged to consider complaints of all drivers and help in resolving any issues of citizens related to insurance.  In this regard, on the website of most insurers a special section has been implemented through which you can submit an online application.  When filling out the electronic form, it will be necessary to describe the essence of the problem and attach scanned copies of previous policies. </p>

    <p>  How to recover MSC in OSAGO if there is no access to the Internet?  In this case, you can send the application by registered mail to the director of the company.  Photocopies of previous policies should also be included in the letter.  Each appeal of citizens is recorded.  An individual number is assigned to him, and also it is entered in a special journal.  It is worth noting that the application must be written in two copies, on one of which a number and a stamp are put, after which you get it in your hands by registered mail. </p><p>  I would like to note that the application can also be sent by regular letter, however, insurers are very reluctant to consider the requests of their clients, and so you will not only be able to speed up the process, but you will be 100 percent sure that your problem will be solved.  The insurer has 10 days to consider the application and recount KBM.  In most cases, during this time the problem will be solved.  If the appeal was ignored, then you can start using heavy artillery.  About how to restore the MTPL OSB on the basis of the SAR through the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, and will be discussed further. </p><h2>  MTPL rebate recovery through the Central Bank of the Russian Federation </h2><p>  The Central Bank of the Russian Federation is a very effective tool with which, in almost 100 percent of cases, drivers manage to get their discount on insurance policy back.  However, he considers applications only for those policies whose statute of limitations does not exceed one year. </p>

    <p>  How to recover MSC in compulsory motor third-party liability insurance through this organization?  The website of the Central Bank has a special section in which complaints related to automobile insurance are drawn up.  To do this, go to the "File a Complaint" section, then go to the "Insurance Organizations" subsection and indicate the reason for the appeal.  After that, you will need to fill out an online form, to which you will need to attach scans of previous policies.  After filling in all the required fields and confirming the registration of the complaint, an email will be sent to the email indicated on the form. </p><p>  The Central Bank will submit a request to confirm your information and identify the problems of the insurance company, after which it will deal with your case.  The whole procedure takes no more than one month, and you will constantly receive information by e-mail about the progress of the review.  Now you know how to restore KBM in compulsory motor third-party liability insurance through the Central Bank.  If for some reason this organization cannot decide anything, which happens extremely rarely, then you can always file a complaint with the PCA. </p><h2>  PCA appeal </h2><p>  RSA is a self-regulatory organization that has many levers of influence on insurance companies, up to and including deprivation of their license.  As a rule, you have to turn to it in very rare cases, since insurers are afraid of this organization and try to solve all the problems of their clients on their own.  How to recover MTPL OSB through SAR, if such a need nevertheless arose?  It is important to understand here that, despite the fact that the unified electronic database, which stores all information about OSAGO policies, is under the jurisdiction of the PCA, nevertheless, this organization is deprived of the right to make any amendments to it.  However, it can affect insurers. </p>
