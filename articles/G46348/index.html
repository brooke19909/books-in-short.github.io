Someone more diplomatically literate, someone the best commander of his time.  Monomakh, perhaps, combines these two best qualities.  Vladimir Monomakh, whose <span>historical portrait</span> can be briefly considered in this article, has forever remained in the history of Kievan Rus as a great ruler. </p><h2>  Childhood and the beginning of the reign of Vladimir Monomakh </h2><p>  From childhood, Monomakh was introduced to the affairs of his father Vsevolod Yaroslavich.  He led a part of the army, carried out campaigns with him and fought along with other military men.  Vladimir Monomakh briefly, accurately and deftly coped with the assignments that his father entrusted to him. </p>

    <p>  In 1076, he participated in a campaign against the Czechs.  This trip was successful.  The activities of his personally and his father were so successful that in 1078 his father became Prince of Kiev.  Vladimir Monomakh sits at this time in Chernihiv.  He had to repeatedly repel the Polovtsian raids and guard the borders of his patrimony.  When Vladimir Monomakh is recalled in history books, his historical portrait is supplemented precisely by his ability to resist external aggression. </p><p>  After the death of his father, he could take the throne of Kiev, but voluntarily ceded it to his brother Svyatopolk.  He said that if he would sit on the throne of Kiev, he would have to fight with his brother.  Vladimir Monomakh did not want this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Monomakh - Grand Duke of Kiev </h2><p>  In <span>1113,</span> an event occurred that changed the political component of the internal structure of Kievan Rus.  <span>The Grand Duke of</span> Kiev Svyatopolk, brother of Monomakh, died.  When Vladimir Monomakh is recalled in school textbooks, his historical portrait during this period is described in color.  Authors often say that it was such a prince that Kiev needed in this difficult time.  And Monomakh goes to Kiev. </p><p>  In Kiev, at this moment, a popular uprising begins, the boyar nobility does not know what to do next.  They turned their eyes towards Vladimir Monomakh, who at that moment ruled in Chernigov.  They invited him to reign and he agreed. </p>

    <p>  First of all, Vladimir Monomakh put down the rebellion and established peace in Kiev. </p><p>  He created the ‚ÄúStatute of Vladimir Monomakh‚Äù, in which he mitigated punishments for various offenses of the population.  The ‚ÄúCharter‚Äù partially became part of the ‚ÄúRussian Truth‚Äù by Yaroslav the Wise. </p><p>  The period of Monomakh‚Äôs reign is an increase in the power of Kievan Rus.  Vladimir, like his distant predecessor Svyatoslav Igorevich, put on the specific lands to rule his sons, whom he fully trusted.  This allowed him to control more than 75% of the lands of Kievan Rus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1117, during the <span>reign of Vladimir Monomakh</span> , the second edition of The Tale of Bygone Years was created.  It was she who survived to this day. </p><h2>  War against False Genius 2 </h2><p>  In the XII century, during the reign of Monomakh, a clash with Byzantium occurred. </p><p>  In 1114, an impostor appeared in Byzantium, who posed as the murdered son of the Byzantine emperor.  His name was Falseogen 2. Initially, Vladimir Monomakh pretended to ‚Äúacknowledge‚Äù and believe that he was the real son of Roman 4. He even married his daughter Maria, for the purpose of peace, between Byzantium and Kievan Rus. </p>

    <p>  However, in 1116, Vladimir Monomakh marched against Byzantium.  The reason is to return the throne to the rightful prince.  Vladimir Monomakh did not act independently, but with the Polovtsy, who were interested in the wealth of Byzantium, which was fabulous at that time. </p><p>  Vladimir Monomakh easily managed to seize the cities that were controlled by Byzantium.  He did not stop there and walked inland.  False Genius 2 was killed, and a truce was signed between Byzantium and Kievan Rus in 1123.  The result - a dynastic marriage of the granddaughter of Vladimir Monomakh with the new Byzantine emperor.  He became emperor precisely because Vladimir Monomakh and the Polovtsy were able to defeat and kill Lzhediogen 2. </p><h2>  "Teaching children" </h2><p>  We remember Vladimir Monomakh not only as a legislator, diplomat and military officer, but also as a writer. </p><p>  He has 4 works in his literary heritage: ‚ÄúThe Instruction of Vladimir Monomakh‚Äù, ‚ÄúWays and Traps‚Äù, ‚ÄúLetter to Brother Oleg‚Äù, ‚ÄúCharter of Vladimir Vsevolodovich‚Äù. </p><p>  The most vivid and memorable work of Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh is ‚ÄúTeaching to Children‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  The name speaks for itself.  The Grand Duke of Kiev understood that his time was coming to an end.  He cannot rule forever, even if he wanted to.  He decides that he needs to leave his ‚Äúlast word‚Äù to his heirs, in which he talks about the principles of government and the benefits of living in a world without war. </p><p>  He asked his children not to go against each other, not to arrange wars and to live in understanding.  These were the faithful and wise words of a man who saw war and peace.  Peace and understanding in the family and the state seemed to him much preferable to war. </p><p>  However, his ‚ÄúInstruction‚Äù was not realized.  After the death of Vladimir, his sons began a fierce war for the Kiev throne.  But Vladimir Monomakh, whose historical portrait became completely different at this moment, is leaving for eternal rest. </p><h2>  Board Results </h2><p>  Vladimir Monomakh in the history of Kievan Rus is a significant figure, which has repeatedly been set as an example to other successor princes. </p><p>  He managed to combine the ability to fight, to stop in time and appreciate peace in the state.  Despite his belligerence and external campaigns, Vladimir Monomakh most of all wished that the borders of Kievan Rus remain untouched. </p><p>  When Vladimir Monomakh is mentioned in history textbooks, a historical portrait and his name are recalled solely as a glorification of wisdom in Russia. </p>
