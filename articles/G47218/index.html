Any operations on it are completely free, including a printout of the movement of money in the account.  Despite all the ease of use, not everyone liked the social card of a pensioner. </p><h2>  Passbook or plastic card </h2><p>  The use of a plastic card is not mandatory when transferring a pension to an account with Sberbank - nevertheless, most pensioners prefer a verified passbook for decades.  To evaluate the advantages of the card over the paper custodian of the treasured figures can be far away for each of the elderly.  To start something new, even to master a few simple and convenient gadgets, many consider it superfluous - just a mobile phone.  Therefore, the Sberbank card for pensioners is not very popular among the representatives of the older generation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Senior citizen social card" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19290/691172.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But for those who decided to have a stylish ‚Äúplastic‚Äù in their pocket or purse instead of the usual banknotes, you need to fill out only two applications to receive a card, both at the Sberbank office: the first - to issue the card itself, and the second - to the pension fund to change your personal bank account , to which it will be necessary to transfer all due payments.  The bank must deliver the second application to the FIU on its own.  But here it should be remembered that the terms of issuing a social card may not coincide with those announced by Sberbank.  Instead of the prescribed 7 days, the card in most cases falls into the hands of a pensioner after 2-3 weeks.  It is necessary to make time for the next transfer of money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Difficult but comfortable </h2><p>  Only by personally experiencing all the conveniences of using a card, you can evaluate its advantages over a passbook or receiving a pension at the post office.  In addition to the fact that ‚Äúplastic‚Äù saves its users from the need to lose time and energy in long lines, in which it is difficult and tired for pensioners to stand, it has a lot of other advantages.  There is no need to carry ‚Äúlive‚Äù banknotes with you to stores, pharmacies, and clinics, which each of us may lose if we are distracted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank social card of a senior citizen" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19290/691148.jpg" width="370"></div>  The Sberbank card for seniors is endowed with the same functions as that issued for a wide group of users: it can be paid at points of sale designated by the Maestro brand, pay for utilities, transfer money to the accounts of relatives and friends as a gift or loan.  And for this it is necessary to master several simple operations at an ATM, which is affordable for almost any elderly person.

    <h2>  Reliable cash protection </h2><p>  A sufficient number of notes in your pocket is undoubtedly a pleasant circumstance, but at the same time frightening.  More or less thieves in public transport became - it doesn‚Äôt matter, one is enough.  Having met such a dodger, instead of the joy of feeling in the hands of a bundle of money, you can get a blow from their sudden disappearance.  And with a card, everything is not so hopeless: protected by a personal pin code, it is not given to everyone - only an experienced hacker can crack it in a few hours, and while he can do it, you can always block access to the card by going to the nearest Sberbank office , or by calling the service center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank card for senior citizens" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19290/691156.jpg" width="580"></div>  For those who do not have enough information, a call from a mobile phone to an emergency number is completely free throughout Russia from the phone of any telecom operator.  Guessing how and where to get a social card, pensioners <strong> </strong>  there is no need - they will do everything in any of the branches of Sberbank. <strong></strong>

Sberbank‚Äôs website is quite mobile, and in terms of ease of use it is significantly superior to similar online systems of other banks.  Perhaps there are some statistics on how often a social card of a Muscovite pensioner is used to make payments via the Internet, but it is not necessary to know it to suggest that more frequent use of plastic cards is typical for residents of big cities.  Of course, one cannot deny the special cases of communication with the ‚Äúplastic‚Äù of pensioners from the rural hinterland - all of this is there, but so far they are more familiar with the advantages of cards precisely in megacities, where automation has densely entered all spheres of life several decades ago.  Naturally, during this time, many current retirees were able to master both computers and Internet access.  The social card of a pensioner in the Moscow Region, accustomed to progress, was hardly scared or surprised by its functions.  You can even assume that only pleased.

If one of the pensioners may be frightened by the fact that when transferring and storing money by book, they had the opportunity to receive interest from the bank, which they could lose by receiving a card, then everything is done right - the accrued accruals on the account are also made when holding the card : Sberbank charges 3.5% per annum on the balance of the amount stored on it.  In addition, retail outlets: shops, pharmacies, which are included in the list specially compiled and posted on the Sberbank website, provide their customers who pay with cards with pleasant discounts.  For pensioners, they make up 2-15% of the purchase price. </p><p>  Another important advantage is that the pensioner's social card <strong> </strong>  implies its round-the-clock use.  In each village, including in the villages, there are Sberbank offices with installed ATMs, access to which is open all 24 hours. </p><h2>  Map, and not one </h2>

It can be grandchildren, children and even neighbors who, in the interests of a pensioner, will pay for his <span>utility bills,</span> withdraw cash and make other payments on it.  In a word, it can be made on those people to whom it is safe to entrust your savings.  Owing to their physical condition, it is difficult for some elderly people to go shopping on their own, and some may not always go for retirement.  That's what Sberbank took care of them.  Senior citizen social card <strong> </strong>  and it allows them to simplify relations with payments and those who care for them.  Quite often, additional cards are issued for financial assistance to grandchildren - a certain part of the pension is transferred to them.  To get additional plastic cards, you should contact the branch of the bank that conducts the cash flow in the account, where you can write the corresponding application.  The amounts that will be transferred to other people can be strictly fixed, for greater reliability.  This should also be reflected in the statement.

Issuing social cards to pensioners <strong> </strong>  it is carried out with the obligatory notification that if you attach a mobile bank to it, then for all operations that will be carried out by card, a text message will be sent to the mobile phone, the number of which should be indicated in the application, indicating the amount of operations.  The phone in this case serves as an additional monitoring device, the data from which can be checked at any time.  A mobile bank is a paid service, but it‚Äôs very convenient, and the fee is very miserable: only 30 rubles a month.  By the way, operations on the movement of money and on additional cards, which upon application are issued to the main ones, can also be attached to the phone.  Then the pensioner will be able to see how all his pension is spent.

    <h2>  Communication with cards.  Training </h2><p>  It‚Äôs quite difficult for people who have long had a certain attitude to innovations to accept what can fundamentally change the ordinary course of their lives, even if they are pleasant and life-making changes.  Senior citizen social card <strong> </strong>  refers precisely to such innovations.  The main thing here is to make sure that all this is reliable.  And after a pensioner overcomes his first doubts and personally appreciates the convenience of owning a card, you can teach him how to use it more widely, including paying for purchases and services via the Internet.  Sberbank also took on the role of the trainer, organizing the School of the Modern Retiree, in which anyone who wants to attend a social card can attend classes.  Training is carried out in the bank's branches, and when and where exactly, you can find out at its nearest branch both in person and by calling.  In addition, the army of Sberbank consultants is called upon to help carry out all the necessary card transactions; there are several of them in each operating room, and any client of the institution, if necessary, can contact them for assistance. </p><h2>  To Sberbank for a card </h2><p>  To find out where and how to get <span>a pensioner's</span> social <span>card, you</span> don‚Äôt need to make special efforts - just go to any of Sberbank‚Äôs offices with a passport and a pension certificate.  Of course, it‚Äôs best to choose the one closest to your place of residence, as you will have to go there from time to time.  A social card is issued only to those elderly people who have already issued their pension in accordance with all the rules and can confirm it with the relevant documents - for Sberbank a normal pensioner certificate is sufficient. </p><p>  By filling out and signing in the office only two documents: an application form for a card and an application for transferring a pension to it, older people thereby carry out all the actions that are required of them for the purchase of ‚Äúplastic‚Äù.  Everything else, including resolving the issue of the pension fund, is the responsibility of the bank's employees. </p><h2>  Replacement upon expiration or loss </h2>

The date of the expiration of its use, if desired, can always be resurrected in memory - on the front side of the ‚Äúplastic‚Äù it is indicated with the year and month of the end period.  It is important to remember that the card is valid until the last (inclusive) calendar day of the month.  Then it, if desired, can be reissued.  In order to carry out all the renewal actions correctly and on time, it is better at the beginning of the month when the term of use expires, go to the Sberbank branch where the plastic was issued and learn in advance how to extend the social card to pensioners. <strong> </strong>  The bank can independently initiate automatic re-issuance of the card, but if the client did not want to use it in the future, he needs to notify the employees of the financial institution at least 60 calendar days before the expiration of the valid card.  In case of loss of ‚Äúplastic‚Äù, you should inform the bank as soon as possible.

These points, after enough money has accumulated, can be used to purchase the goods you like at one of the outlets, which is a partner of Sberbank.  And, of course, the social card of the pensioner "Maestro" will be indispensable for long trips, for example, on a trip.  There are branches of the Savings Bank of Russia in any settlement of our country and in almost every big city abroad, and in some cities there is more than one where you can cash out the amount on the account from the card, pay for it with purchases, accommodation and other services.  And at the same time - no worries about losing money!

The younger generation of Russians understood and accepted this a long time ago, it was their grandparents' turn.

People willingly take her pension from her, pay utility bills, transfer money to children and grandchildren.  Of course, there is always a consultant nearby, but many older people are able to carry out simple operations themselves. </p><p>  Some admit that with the advent of a mobile phone, the Internet with its convenient options, a bank card, they got rid of the need to queue on the day the pension is paid, whatever their state of health, or sit by the window waiting for the postman.
