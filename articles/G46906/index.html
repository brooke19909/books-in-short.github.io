    <p>  Living in a city saturated with coal air is not very attractive to people.  Therefore, the population of the city seeks to move to areas with a more favorable environmental situation.  This can be done by very high salaries of mine workers.  One of such places, attractive for its climate, is the 12th microdistrict, in which the new building of Kemerovo - LCD Serebryany Bor is located.  This residential complex is surrounded on almost all sides by forest.  On the one hand - a huge Silver Forest.  On the other - the Park of Friendship of Peoples. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location of the residential complex </h2><p>  The place where the Serebryany Bor is being built, in Kemerovo, the most promising was highlighted.  Nearby is the largest transport artery of the city - Shakhtarov Avenue.  There is a tram line on it.  Just a few kilometers separates the complex from the city center.  It can be reached in about a few minutes by private car.  A lot of public transport also goes to the complex: shuttle vans, trams. </p>

    <p>  As for the negative opinion, it mainly develops due to dissatisfaction with the underdeveloped social infrastructure.  For example, they complain about the lack of a sports complex, a cinema.  The quality of the roads leading to the complex and their construction itself, that is, the absence of bypass routes, are not satisfied with the inhabitants.  This fact creates additional traffic jams in the mornings and evenings, which, accordingly, does not add enthusiasm.  Many express their wishes to build more places for recreation and games for children. </p>
