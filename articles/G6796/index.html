Russian history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of our Fatherland is so deeply left in the past that many of our contemporaries do not even think about the question of why Moscow has become a center for the unification of Russian lands. </p><p>  There were many reasons for this, some of which we will try to consider in this article. </p><h2>  How and when did Moscow come about? </h2><p>  The state of Kievan Rus, created by the descendants of Rurik, his son, grandson and great-grandson Vladimir, was located on the lands of modern Ukraine, Belarus and southern Russia.  Its center was the city of Kiev. </p><p>  Its northern outskirts was the land of the Eastern Slavs-Vyatichi and Ugro-Finns - the future land of the settlement of Moscow.  Impenetrable <span>forests</span> and swamps reigned here, and there was no talk of any capital. </p><p>  Meanwhile, it was here that the foundation of the unification of Russian lands was laid, the history of Russia confirms this fact. </p><p>  According to the most common version, Prince Yuri founded Moscow, nicknamed Dolgoruky, who was famous for the skills of a diplomat and commander, in the 12th century. </p><p>  By the way, for Prince Yuri, the question of why Moscow became the center of the unification of Russian lands was not raised at all, because at that time feudal fragmentation made itself felt, when each prince was for himself. </p>

    <p>  This fragmentation led to a terrible disaster for the young state - the invasion of the horde of <span>Khan Batu,</span> which wiped out many Russian glorious cities, including the old Ryazan, from which it was a stone's throw from the small town of Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  <span>Reasons for the rise of Moscow</span> during the Tatar-Mongol yoke </h2><p>  Igo brought many disasters to Russia: it was a tribute to goods, products, gold and people, which every principality was forced to pay;  constant raids from the Horde;  the destruction of buildings. </p><p>  Little Moscow was lucky: it was in impenetrable forests (the word "Moscow" is translated from the Finno-Ugric language as "a swampy place"), which partly reduced the likelihood of raids by foreigners. </p><p>  On the other hand, people reigned in Moscow whose diplomatic qualities made it possible to negotiate with the formidable Horde khans. </p><p>  The most prominent of these people was Prince Ivan, nicknamed Kalita.  He was able to negotiate with the Horde and get for himself and his descendants a label for a great reign (giving his bearers the opportunity to rule all the other princes of Russia on behalf of the khan). </p><p>  In a difficult struggle, Kalita defeated another Russian prince, who also claimed this label, Mikhail Tversky.  According to the denunciation, Prince Mikhail and his son Alexander, as well as the grandson of Fedor, were captured and brutally executed. </p><p>  However, not only cunning and intelligence helped the Moscow princes in the struggle for the princely throne, their military achievements also played a significant role in this. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Kulikovo battle of</span> Dmitry Donskoy </h2><p>  Why did Moscow become a center for the unification of Russian lands?  This question is easy to answer if we turn to the events of Russian history in 1380.  Then the young Moscow Prince Dmitry called on the inhabitants of Russia to fight the Horde invaders.  The battle took place on the <span>Kulikovo field</span> and ended with the complete victory of the Russian troops. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  True, two years later, the Horde troops again led by Khan Tokhtamysh again attacked our Fatherland, but the victory on the Kulikovo field and the unification of Russian lands under the leadership of Moscow are links in one chain.  It turns out that without Dmitry Donskoy, his city would never have become the capital of Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Why Moscow became the center of the unification of Russian lands: judgments of historians </h2><p>  <span>Russian historians</span> agree that Moscow became the center of Russia, most likely not because of its geographical location or other factors, but because for about 200 years princes, who were prominent politicians, diplomats and military figures, ruled in this city. </p><p>  It was thanks to the activities of these princes that the unification of Russian lands took place. </p><p>  After the victory in the Kulikovo field, the <span>Moscow principality</span> grew very intensively, absorbing the lands of its neighbors.  Already the grandfather of Ivan the Terrible, Prince Ivan was able to overcome the resistance of the northern Russian lands - Pskov and Novgorod, after which he appropriated most of their territories. </p>

    <p>  It was Prince Ivan Vasilievich who was able to finally get rid of the Horde yoke, which further strengthened the authority of Moscow.  Therefore, the contemporaries of the prince did not have a question about why Moscow became the center of Russia.  She deserved it. </p>
