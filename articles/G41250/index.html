Due to careless handling of this equipment, it may fail.  If you drop the tablet, spill water on it, or just handle it carelessly, then very soon you will need to change the screen.  <span>Replacing a touchscreen</span> on a tablet is a rather complicated procedure that requires certain skills and knowledge.  If you decide to repair your device yourself, then you need to very painstakingly relate to this.  Before starting the replacement, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with some rules in order to prevent other breakdowns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="replacing the touchscreen on the tablet" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1360138.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Start </h2><p>  As a rule, a touchscreen replacement on a tablet may be needed due to a broken screen.  If you encounter such a problem, do not be upset, because this problem can be solved.  The easiest option is to take the tablet to a service center, where specialists will eliminate all defects in a fairly short period of time. </p><p>  But what if you cannot go to the workshop with professionals for any reason?  In this case, you can try changing the screen and touchscreen yourself.  Of course, this is a rather painstaking work.  But if you can repair your device yourself, this will save. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What do we need?  To replace the screen, you need to take the following tools: </p><ul><li>  The most common hair dryer. </li><li>  To open the cover, we need a plastic card.  It can be replaced with a drawing pattern or pick.  Try not to use metal aids so as not to scratch the body of the device. </li><li>  <span>Stationery knife.</span> </li><li>  Tweezers. </li><li>  A small piece of cloth. </li><li>  Phillips screwdriver. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself touchscreen replacement on a tablet" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1360139.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Screen and touchscreen selection </h2><p>  So, the next step will be the selection of the screen and touchscreen.  This must be taken seriously, since all tablets have different screens.  To make the right choice, you need to consult with the seller.  It doesn't matter where you buy.  In an ordinary specialized store you can go to the seller and ask all your questions.  In the online store you can also call consultants and find out which glass is right for you. </p><p>  For the seller to choose a high-quality screen and touchscreen, you need to see the full name of <span>the tablet model.</span>  Selected items must be checked for damage. </p><h2>  Screen parsing </h2><p>  Replacing the touchscreen on the tablet is carried out after removing the cracked screen.  How to disassemble?  For everything to go well, you must follow the rules and, if possible, comply with them.  Let's look at repairs using an example of a device like an Asus tablet.  Replacing the touchscreen in this case is carried out according to the following algorithm: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus tablet touchscreen replacement" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1360137.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  If your tablet cover is held by bolts, then you need to unscrew them.  As a rule, they are on the edges of the device. </li><li>  Next we need to remove the cover.  To do this, take a plastic card and pry the cover.  After that, swipe it around the perimeter of the device. </li><li>  On some tablets, the lid connects to the case with a cable, which must be carefully disconnected.  How to do it?  On the side of the loop there is a special latch that must be pressed.  After that, you can carefully disconnect it. </li></ol><h2>  Complete disassembly of the device </h2><ol><li>  Replacing the touchscreen on the tablet with your own hands is quite difficult.  You must start by removing the damaged screen.  To do this, you need to take a hairdryer and warm the device case with it. </li><li>  At the second stage, you need to gently pry the screen with a clerical knife and draw along the perimeter.  If you do everything right, you can easily get the screen. </li><li>  When you take off the screen, you need to get rid of the remnants of tape.  You can use a knife or tweezers for this. </li><li>  If the screen has been badly damaged, it is necessary to remove the glass with a cloth or napkin. </li><li>  So, we removed the damaged part.  What to do next?  Before installing the screen, you need to remove all the protective films and various stickers. </li><li>  A new touchscreen must be put on your device where there was a damaged screen.  Gently press it and slide your fingers around the perimeter so that it evenly goes into the case. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  It remains only to assemble the lid and secure the cable.  After such manipulations, it is recommended to stick a protective film in order to protect the touchscreen from damage.  As a rule, this film is enough for a year of use.  If you have a quality screen replacement, you can turn on the gadget and use it in the previous mode.  Replacing the touchscreen on the <span>tablet "Asus",</span> "Samsung" and other popular devices is made according to this principle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="replacement touchscreen on samsung tablet" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1360141.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  If you replace the touchscreen on the tablet yourself, you need to spend money only on a new screen.  Glass prices now range from 500 rubles to 1,500 rubles.  It depends on the model and year of manufacture. </p><p>  Now there are new devices in which, if the touchscreen is damaged, you will have to change the screen along with the matrix.  Of course, the price of such glass will start at 1000 rubles. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><ol><li>  If you have broken the tablet, you need not to postpone the repair, but start it as soon as possible.  Everyone knows that the screen consists of a matrix and a touchscreen (the screen itself).  If your glass cracked, the matrix will still work, but the more you use it, the faster the device will fail.  Therefore, in order to prevent unnecessary expenses, you need to immediately contact the service or replace the screen yourself. </li><li>  Replacing the touchscreen on the tablet "Samsung", "Asus" or another popular company is the same.  Therefore, you can fix any device yourself. </li><li>  Before replacing the touchscreen, make sure that it is in good condition. </li><li>  Perform all steps carefully so as not to cause the device to other failures. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Replacing the touchscreen on the asus tablet" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1360140.jpg" width="410"></div></li></ol><h2>  How to protect your tablet from damage </h2><ul><li>  Do not drop the device. </li><li>  Make sure that the tablet does not stay on a chair or sofa, as you can accidentally sit on it. </li><li>  Buy a protective film and stick it. </li><li>  Get a case. </li><li>  Watch the conditions in which the device is located, since the screen does not tolerate temperature differences. </li></ul><p>  If you follow all the guidelines, you can extend the life of your tablet.  Remember that the life of the device depends on you. </p>
