The history of the word</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The meaning of the word "autodafe", unfortunately, is often interpreted in different ways.  This process means, first of all, the solemn announcement of the <span>sentence by the court of the</span> Inquisition, and only then its enforcement.  Autodafe is also called solely the execution of the prescribed.  Moreover, this process is also confused with the so-called vanity bonfire, on which, for example, mirrors or sacred books were burned (the same Talmud). </p><p>  Autodafe - <span>what is it?</span>  <span>This is the</span> so-called holy execution of heretics - sorcerers, witches, apostates and all people who are objectionable to the Inquisition.  It was carried out through the burning of the perpetrator at the stake.  Often, all the accusations were not true, but only proved the ignorance of the people of that time.  There is even an opinion that thanks to the holy Inquisition, which stubbornly fought with witches, in Europe there were practically no beautiful women.  Since attractiveness in itself could already serve as a reason for accusation of witchcraft. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="autodafe what is it" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/634633.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  Autodafe (emphasis on the last syllable) literally means “an act of faith” (lat. Actus fidei).  This solemn ceremony appeared almost at the same time as the <span>Holy Inquisition,</span> in the 13th century.  However, it gained distribution a little later - at the end of the XV century. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Spain, the start of the auto-da-fe was given by Bulla Sixta IV in 1480, in Portugal - by a similar decree of Clement VII in 1531.  The first mass burning dates back to 1481; it took place in Spanish Seville.  For several centuries, the burning of heretics was successfully practiced in Spain and Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Peru), Italy, Portugal and its colonies (India, Goa).  In particular, the greatest devastation was in Spain - almost 32 thousand burnt alive. </p><p>  An interesting fact about autodaph is that this phenomenon has not passed and Russia.  Thus, the Sofia Chronicle of 1480 speaks of the burning of advisers to Ivan III Vasilievich, who dared to annoy the tsar with failed "magic." </p><h2>  Cancellation of solemn announcement of sentences </h2><p>  In Portugal, the Inquisition did not reach such a scale as in Spain, and was canceled already in 1794.  In Spain, the auto-dauph was finally banned only in 1834, although the last process took place back in 1826, however, it was execution by hanging, not burning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meaning of the word autodafe" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/634631.jpg" width="567"></div>

    <h2>  How did it go </h2><p>  The first Sunday of the fast before Christmas, in which the Gospel of Luke about the Last Judgment is to be read, was often reserved for the solemn announcement of the sentence.  Although it should be noted that not all Church fathers agreed with this date, since many verdicts were directly related to death. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To the question about autodaf - what is it, we have already answered, now we will proceed to the process itself.  A platform was erected on the city square so that what was happening could see the maximum number of comers.  A peculiar picture of the Last Judgment in miniature, designed only to instill pious awe to believers.  In addition, the upcoming auto-dauph was usually announced in advance, and there was a ceremony, usually on a day off.  Immediately on the night before the trial, a special commission also met, the purpose of which was to listen to the abdication of the criminals and to accompany their reconciliation with the church.  However, admission of guilt did not mitigate the fate too much. </p><h2>  Types of Auto-Dafe </h2><p>  There were several varieties of the “act of faith”, in particular: </p><ul><li>  Auto singular - for one criminal. </li><li>  Autillo, or the small autodafe, was held within the Inquisition Palace.  There were some invited and actually the judges themselves. </li><li>  Auto particular is a private process where only criminal judges and inquisitors are allowed to attend. </li><li>  Auto public general is a general public auto-da-fe that was solemnly arranged with a large crowd of people in the presence of city magistrates and often timed to some events.  For example, information about the autodaf in Madrid in 1680 has been preserved.  The young wife of Charles II was executed, and the king personally lit the first torch. </li></ul>

    <p>  Those sentenced were taken out to the people in special “shameful” clothes with various shoulder pads (depending on crimes), with bare feet and yellow wax candles in their hands.  In addition, a paper cap in the shape of a sugar head was additionally put on the accused of witchcraft. </p><p>  Now the reader knows the answer to the question of whether autodaph is what it is.  This is a ceremonial <span>burning of heretics</span> and people objectionable to the church.  Curious fact: anyone could be accused of witchcraft in those days.  It was enough to say that he had seen a neighbor’s wife flying out of a pipe on a broomstick at night.  Then the Holy Fathers undertook it, which forced them to confess torture to admit cohabitation with the devil and other "sinful acts." </p>
