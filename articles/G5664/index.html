Negative <span>reviews</span> relate to the unprepared road, due to which many cannot move to already completed houses. </p><p>  In addition, the social infrastructure leaves much to be desired.  All the promised kindergartens and schools really exist, but large queues are built in them, since the number of people who want to get into them greatly exceeds the capacity. </p><p>  Because of this, there is a lot of dissatisfaction in the <span>reviews.</span> </p><h2>  Alternative residential complex </h2><p>  An alternative is Peterhof Park.

The buildings are interconnected by arches, and from the fourth and fifth floors there is a beautiful view from the panoramic loggias.  Stained glass and modern architectural style form a modern attractive image. </p><p>  Spacious layouts have been designed here - from small studios to large three-room apartments with fine finishes made of modern materials. </p><p>  Thanks to the opinions of the residents about the residential complex ‚ÄúNew Peterhof‚Äù and other information provided, you will be able to form an opinion about the object under study. </p>
