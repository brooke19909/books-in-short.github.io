    <p>  The largest population in Ples was recorded in the 60-80s of the last century.  After which there was a gradual decline.  Currently, the town has only about 2,000 permanent residents.  There are no industrial enterprises here, it is a purely resort town, in which the greatest revival is observed in the summer months. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pages of the history of the Pless settlement </h2><p>  The city of Ples has its official reckoning since 1410.  It was then that one of the sons of Dmitry Donskoy - Vasily, who reigned in Muscovy - founded on the banks of the Volga, on the site of the current resort town, a wooden military fortress, the purpose of which was to protect the approaches to Moscow and the Volga cities. </p><p>  But the history of the settlement began much earlier than the specified date.  Folk legends tell that long before the construction of the fortress there was an ancient settlement called Chuvil, destroyed by the hordes of <span>Batu Khan</span> in the XIII century.  <span>Archaeological excavations</span> confirm this data. </p><p>  For many years, the city of Ples was in the center of numerous military events.  Closer to the XVIII century.  the situation became calmer, and this place ceased to function as a fortified military facility.  The ruined wooden fortresses were not restored, and in their place a magnificent stone Orthodox cathedral and several stone buildings were erected. </p><p>  Due to the convenient economic location of the city, trade and production began to actively develop here.  The population was engaged in fishing, weaving, rafting on the river forest.  Prior to the opening of the Ivanovo-Kineshma railway in 1871, Ples served as the main port on the Volga for the entire region.  Gradually, the development of production and trade in these places subsided, and the town turned into a country-resort zone for wealthy gentlemen. </p><h2>  The origin of the name of the city </h2><p>  There is no consensus on why the place was called Ples.  Some historians and local historians are inclined to believe that the city owes its name to its geographical position: in this place, the Volga flows straight for many kilometers and does not make turns.  Since ancient times, such river sections were called reaches.  Another version says that the word "reach" means a sandbank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Plessa resort area </h2><p>  What is the first thing I want to say about the city of Ples?  The Ivanovo region can be proud that such a reserved resort area is located on its territory.  Tourists have the opportunity to come here not only in the summer months, but also in winter.  In the summer you can swim, sunbathe, pick mushrooms and berries, enjoy the beautiful Volga landscapes, and in winter, skiing enthusiasts come here.  In recent years, much attention has been paid to the construction of ski slopes in Ples. </p>
