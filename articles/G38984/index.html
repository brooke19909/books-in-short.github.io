  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to build a roof with your own hands without the help of specialists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After acquiring a land plot, it is justifiable that a new and serious task arises - to build your own fortress called "House".  Its construction can be entrusted to professionals by contacting one of the construction companies.  In this case, having spent on materials, you will have to pay a whole team for the work done.  This option is suitable for those who agree to pay more, but do not want to spend their time and energy on building a house, preferring to shift these difficulties onto someone else's shoulders.  If the owner of the future home is not going to trust such a responsible process to completely strangers, it is quite realistic to build the house yourself.  In this case, of course, it will take a lot more time and effort, and possibly help from friends or relatives. </p><p>  Touching on the topic of self-construction of a house, it is worth paying special attention to the question: "How to build a roof with your own hands?" </p><p>  First you need to understand the types of roofs.  Being acquainted with their diversity, you will need to choose a roof that is suitable specifically for your future home.  Today, roofs for houses are: single-pitched, double-pitched, four-pitched, tent, mansard, conical and pyramidal.  However, this list is not exhaustive. </p><p>  In the construction of residential houses, the most common gable roof, which is two planes (slopes), resting on the walls of the house, and thus forming a triangular space.  A clear advantage of such a roof is that its construction is quite light, the design is reliable and durable, it allows you to choose almost any material for the roof. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Despite the fact that you will have to install it yourself, a <span>gable roof</span> with your own hands is not at all difficult to build.  Before proceeding directly to the process itself, it is necessary to pay attention to the region where the house will be built, as well as the amount and frequency of precipitation, in particular snow.  Such important nuances must be taken into account, since the choice of the design and details of the roof depends on them. </p><p>  How to build a roof with your own hands, so that it is strong, reliable, durable, protects from rain and heat?  The most important thing is to correctly install the <span>floor beams</span> (translations).  As a rule, wooden beams are used as translations.  They are only installed on wall posts.  The distance between them should be about 1.5-2 meters.  When laying floor beams, it is also necessary to take into account the distance from the wall from the outside of the building.  It should be at least 40-50 cm. This solution will ensure the safety of the walls of the house from water, which will drain on the roof.  In order to make the roof with your own hands for many years, it is also necessary to process all the wooden parts, including the floor beams with a special mortar, which will ensure their safety and protect against decay. </p><p>  After the beams around the perimeter are installed and fixed, it's time to start installing the rafters.  It is very important to pay special attention to them, since they are a supporting element in the entire roof structure.  In addition, the rafters are also inclined.  Next, you need to make their crate, while choosing reliable fasteners.  They may well serve as bolts and staples.  Do not forget that it is on the crate that the roof will be coated.  After that, you can start the process of installing the roof itself.  If by this moment there were still doubts about how to build a roof with your own hands and make it a hope, then perhaps the time has come to seek the advice of professionals.  In the event that everything turns out and the results of your work do not cause any concern, you can continue.  When work with roofing materials is completed, it's time to isolate all the supporting structures.  A layer of materials with the property of thermal insulation can perfectly help with this.  Such insulation will provide not only the desired temperature in the house itself, but also extend the durability of all parts of the roof. </p><p>  After we managed to build the roof with our own hands at 100%, and the result is good, you can put a tick in the list of your building victories and feel free to take up the next job. </p>
