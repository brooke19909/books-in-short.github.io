Destroyed cities were rebuilt, and in the least affected, the real symbols of the great victory over fascism were erected.  Fanciful buildings with rich decor of facades, made in the style of the Stalinist Empire style, are still found in many settlements of Russia today.  There are especially many of them in Moscow, and the most famous among them are the ‚Äúseven sisters‚Äù - the first Soviet skyscrapers.  These include the administrative and residential skyscraper at the Red Gate. </p><h2>  Skyscrapers of Comrade Stalin </h2>

Stalin.  According to one of them, the skyscrapers should have been not 7, but 8. Solemn ceremonies of laying the first stone were held simultaneously for all designed buildings.  The date and even the exact time for these events was not chosen by chance - on that day Moscow celebrated its 800th birthday.

    <p>  Some mystics argue that the laying of the first stones of the structures was carried out on the basis of astrological calculations.  Be that as it may, the skyscraper on the Red Gate and another 6 similar buildings were laid on September 7, 1947.  For the construction of a skyscraper, the highest point of the Garden Ring was chosen.  Thanks to this ingenious solution, the building visually looks even larger and more magnificent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description and architectural features </h2>

Dushkin and B.S.  Mezentsev.  The house was commissioned in 1953.  The skyscraper at the Red Gate consists of three buildings isolated from each other.  The central tower has 24 floors and is crowned with a spire.  Two symmetrical wings 10 to 15 floors high are adjacent to it on the sides.  You can get from one building to another only through a common basement.  The skyscraper, like other buildings of the "seven sisters", has a pronounced step layout.

    <p>  The greatness of geometric shapes is emphasized by vertical pilasters running through the entire lower tier of the building.  The facade is decorated with a large emblem of the USSR and other bas-reliefs with Soviet symbols.  According to one version, in the original project, the skyscraper did not have a spire with a star.  This element appeared exclusively at the request of Comrade Stalin himself.  Perhaps this is only a beautiful myth, but today it is difficult to imagine the legendary Stalinist skyscrapers without bright stars. </p><p>  The total height of the building is 138 meters.  The Ministry of Transport Construction of the USSR was located in the central tower.  Residential apartments were occupied by outstanding employees of this and other organizations, as well as honored doctors and teachers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The mystery of building a house on Sadovaya-Spasskaya </h2><p>  In the left wing of the legendary building is the exit from the metro station "Red Gate".  This feature required sophisticated engineering calculations and the use of innovative technologies in construction.  Part of the <span>high-rise building</span> was erected directly above the pit of the metro station.  In order to avoid the collapse of the building during its construction, part of the soil was artificially frozen.  But even this bold decision would not prevent the subsequent shrinkage of the building. </p><p>  The skyscraper at the Red Gate was built with a slope.  And after the natural shrinkage of the soil, the building deviated and took the right position.  This technology was very bold and risky for its time.  Subsequently, it was no longer used. </p><h2>  What is the difference between a skyscraper at the Red Gate and its "sisters"? </h2><p>  Sadovaya-Spasskaya 21/1 is the address of one of the Stalinist skyscrapers, more commonly known as the house at the Red Gate.  It is worth noting that this skyscraper differs in many respects from the other six buildings.  This skyscraper is the lowest among 7 "sisters".  But due to the favorable location of the house, this difference is not visually noticeable. </p><p>  The Stalinist skyscraper at the Red Gate cannot boast of rich interior decoration.  There are no theater chandeliers and mosaics in her vestibules.  Everything is simple enough for a house of this magnitude, but with a taste and moderate gloss.  The apartments are mainly two- and three-room, characterized by a small number of square meters and an uncomfortable layout.  But happy new settlers could enjoy high ceilings, wooden parquet and typical furniture, ideal for the size of the room. </p><p>  What is noteworthy, in most apartments there was a special room for the housemaid.  There is a small number of chic five-room apartments in the famous skyscraper.  Once they were occupied by ministers and other high officials. </p><h2>  High-rise at the Red Gate: history and our days </h2><p>  For its time, the house on Sadovo-Spasskaya was distinguished by a perfectly thought-out infrastructure.  In one of the residential buildings of the skyscraper was a kindergarten.  The building has underground parking.  In the basements of the skyscraper, bomb shelters are equipped with everything necessary in case of emergency evacuation. </p>

    <p>  According to the legends, there is even a swimming pool under the Stalinist skyscraper with a large supply of clean water.  The address Sadovaya-Spasskaya 21/1 today can be found in many tourist booklets. </p><p>  What is the modern fate of the legendary building?  Today, the Ministry of Transport Engineering, Transstroy Corporation, the Moscow Currency Exchange, a bank, and a number of other organizations are still located in the central tower.  The side buildings are occupied by residential apartments, and on the first floors various shops and offices are open. </p><h2>  How to get there and can I get on a tour inside? </h2>

The address of the legendary house: Sadovaya-Spasskaya Street, 21. The easiest way to get here is by metro.  You need to go to the station "Red Gate", the northern exit from which is located directly in the building of interest to you.  To get into the central building is quite difficult - the building has a serious security and access control regime.  But guests are allowed into residential buildings, and sometimes some of the old residents even organize private excursions.
