The Yandex.Money system in this regard is no different except that it is still necessary to create a payment password.  It is intended to confirm the operations performed.  And remembering this bunch of information is not so simple.  Of course, if you have the same password for each account on the Internet, you don‚Äôt have to memorize a lot, but it can turn out badly.  Passwords should not be the same everywhere.  The best solution in this case is to write information on paper.  We‚Äôll talk about how to find out the Yandex.Money payment password. </p><p>  If this question is relevant to you, then the information provided will be useful. </p><h2>  What are the recovery methods? </h2>

This method is relevant if the phone is tied to an existing wallet.  Therefore, during registration, you should definitely do this.  To do this, you need to indicate your phone number, receive SMS, and enter the code from it on the site.  As you can see, there is nothing complicated in this, and this helps to avoid problems in the future, at least with password recovery.  The service is provided completely free, so do not neglect it. </p><p>  If you already tied the phone before, you must perform the following actions: </p><ol><li>  Through the site you need to send a request for password recovery. </li><li>  The request is processed for some time, and after the check is completed, you will be sent a password with a one-time code.  As a rule, the operation is performed within a day. </li></ol><p>  A code is required to reset an old forgotten password so that a new one can be set. </p><h2>  <span>Password recovery</span> using code </h2>

    <p>  There are situations when the phone is not tied to an account.  How to find out the Yandex.Money payment password in this case?  To do this, select the option ‚ÄúRemember payment password‚Äù on the login page and confirm the operation.  After a while, an instruction will come to the mail.  If you didn‚Äôt wait for the letter, try checking the Spam folder or make sure that the mail you specified was registered exactly the one you are checking.  If the mail passport contains the address to which you are expecting a letter, then by default all letters from Yandex will come exactly there. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you receive the letter successfully, follow the link provided in it to the page where you will need to write the recovery code and date of birth.  For this, five attempts are given. </p><h2>  What if the above methods do not work? </h2><p>  How to find out the Yandex.Money payment password if no method has helped?  Unfortunately, it also happens that not only the phone, but also the mail is not tied to an account.  Do not panic - another method has been specially created for this.  Of course, this will require more time, but this method is effective.  You can simply <span>link the phone number to the</span> account. </p><p>  If you live in a city where the organization has offices, then there should not be any problems at all.  It is enough to fill out an application to bind the phone in the office.  If the city does not have the necessary office, then you can download the application from the site and fill out.  It is important to remember that you should not sign it right away.  This requires a visit to a notary to verify the signature.  After that, the letter is sent to the company by <span>registered letter.</span>  You can find out exactly where the offices closest to your city are located on the Yandex website or by calling during working hours (8 (495) 739-22-22). </p><p>  After processing the application, a code will be sent to the phone, which will need to be entered in a special field on the site.  After that, the password will be successfully restored via the phone.  Be sure to keep in mind that this method will have to spend not only time, but also money.  That is, if you do not have more than three hundred rubles in your account or you rarely use your wallet, then you should not spend energy on this, since more money will be spent on restoration. </p><h2>  What to do if the payment password is entered incorrectly - the limit of attempts has been reached? </h2><p>  So, we said above that only five attempts are made to recover the password.  But what to do if their limit has been exhausted, and the password has not been restored?  And again, only one way to correct the situation will work here - linking the phone to the account.  How to do this is described above. </p><p>  The conclusion here begs one thing: it‚Äôs best to immediately attach a mobile phone number during the process of issuing an account so as not to get into an awkward situation, the solution of which will require a lot of money, time and effort. </p>
