    <h2>  Innovations </h2><p>  What form of government was the <span>Roman Empire</span> under Constantine?  <span>The absolute monarchy.</span>  He wanted to have absolute power, and for this it was necessary to change self-awareness and, in modern language, think through a new image.  Like his predecessor, the founder of the stylization of the tetrarchy and a supporter of the rise of imperial power, Diocletian, the new emperor continued and significantly strengthened the direction chosen by his predecessor, from this the distance of the principles of the reign of Augustus increased even more. </p><p>  Under the new imperial rule, elements of the symbolism of power underwent changes.  Such a grip can only be envied.  The innovation was the fact that he adopted the ideas from the Eastern, Greek and Christian worlds at once.  The contradictions arising in this case did not bother Konstantin at all.  Naturally, these different components bearing their traditions could not take root in a harmonious synthesis, therefore, in general, they were associated with the new state, founded by Konstantin himself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Outward superiority </h2><p>  These innovations and the success associated with them could not but affect the external features of the emperor, who sought to emphasize his splendor.  Constantine no longer wanted to wear Roman toga, but demanded a richly decorated tunic.  He also wanted to change his uniform: he replaced the simple soldiers' cuirass of emperors with luxurious armor.  When he went camping, he was flaunting a shell of gold and a magnificent helmet.  A little later, noting his twenty-year rule, he began to appear in public in a diadem, which for Rome acquired the meaning of a symbol of absolute imperial power. </p><h2>  Victory Propaganda </h2><p>  External exaltation was expressed in the construction of colossal statues, inscriptions and images on coins.  There is also a combination of various details.  For example, the proximity to the portrait images of the predecessors, Augustus and Alexander the Great, as well as the appearance of a <span>halo above the head</span> in the images <span>.</span>  External claims to the world size of the empire reflected in the numerous symbolism of eternity, in which Konstantin included himself.  The "Ruler of the world" was thereby glorified as the victor of all nations. </p>

    <p>  The Roman Empire under Constantine propagated the victory over the Sarmatians and Goths, Franks and Alamans.  The universal qualities of the winner are also rooted in the minds of people.  Interestingly, the title of Constantine (“Invincible”) was replaced by “Winner” - this one sounds more active.  His rejection of the element of the divine title or attribute is also characteristic, because he united all religions together. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cult of the emperor </h2><p>  The Roman Empire under Constantine faced a choice: whether to continue the traditional views on the form of government or not?  After all, this went into contradiction and would become incompatible with Christian views.  God only knows what it cost the emperor to compromise.  He permits the construction of a temple in honor of the Flavian dynasty, that is, in fact, in his honor.  But with the caveat that the construction should not be tarnished by any criminal and unholy superstitions.  Also, it does not prevent the organization of regular theater and gladiatorial shows. </p>

    <h2>  Justice </h2><p>  The Roman Empire under Constantine began to submit to new laws.  Konstantin’s decisiveness in power affected the interference with legislation and justice.  By a decision that was implemented in 318, he gave the imperial edicts a legal quality that became higher than the accepted norms.  The main provisions of the legislation, focus and style were not uniform.  They coexisted with extreme cruelty with unexpected concessions and humanitarian trends with respect for the traditional concepts of law. </p><p>  The Roman Empire under Constantine was distinguished by extreme measures against those who broke the law.  Grade 5 - it is then that the school studies this topic.  The punishment could be applied, which consisted of sewing in a bag with snakes, after which he was thrown into the abyss or the sea.  But such drastic measures were taken only in relation to the abductors of children and livestock, father-killers and thieves.  The death penalty was also terrifying.  According to the law, violation of marital fidelity, love affair and marriages with unequal oneself (that is, between a free and a slave) were punishable by death. </p>

    <p>  But also in another decree it was said that those sentenced to gladiatorial battles or mines should not get a stigma on their faces, since the face created according to the heavenly likeness should not be spoiled.  From the same series, the law that a prisoner can see sunlight once a day. </p><p>  The Roman Empire under <span>Emperor Constantine</span> remained a <span>slave state, the</span> institution of slavery remained unchanged.  But amendments were introduced, in particular, Konstantin called for moderate treatment of slaves, limiting their punishments.  Also, slaves who created families could not forcibly be separated during the sale.  The social sphere has improved thanks to guardianship laws that have expanded the rights of guardians.  Measures were taken in favor of the children who were planted. </p><h2>  Roman Empire under Constantine </h2><p>  Briefly, his activities can be described as follows: </p><ul><li>  The forced measures to protect the state from the constant invasions of the barbarians became the need to keep large armies at the borders.  Greeks and Romans referred to barbarians as nationalities, whose language and manners they did not recognize and did not understand, considering them rude and uneducated.  Especially the provinces of the western part of the empire were plagued by <span>Germanic tribes.</span>  The Roman generals needed a strong one to fight for the throne. </li><li>  Attaching columns to the ground.  The columns began to live even worse, because now they had to not only give part of the harvest to the land owner, but also pay tax to the imperial treasury.  Therefore, they began to scatter wherever.  The emperor issued a decree in which he forbade the colonies from leaving the areas for which they were assigned.  Their children had to get the same land that their parents cultivated. </li><li>  The Roman Empire under Constantine also created the conditions for the development of the Christian faith (the 5th grade school curriculum gives knowledge about this).  When Constantine ruled, more Christians became.  Believers of each city chose a priest.  Gathered together, the priests determined the chief, regional leader of the Christians, he began to be called the bishop (overseer).  The latter's task was to convince the Roman authorities that Christians are not dangerous and pray for them and their servants.  In the end, Constantine realized that they did not call the people to action against his throne and his empire.  Therefore, he issued a decree allowing Christians to openly pray and build temples. </li></ul>

    <h2>  New capital </h2><p>  What else is history telling us (grade 5)?  The Roman Empire under Constantine was divided into two parts.  The emperor himself did not like Rome, so he lived in other cities.  He transferred the capital from Rome to the Greek city of Byzantium, which was located on the banks of the Bosphorus.  Two paths crossed here, water and land.  The new capital began to transform before our eyes: palaces and houses, water supply systems with bathhouses, theaters with circuses, and Christian churches were being built.  The city was luxuriously decorated - beautiful statues and columns were brought from the empire.  It happened in 330, at which time the capital of the Roman Empire moved to Constantinople. </p>
