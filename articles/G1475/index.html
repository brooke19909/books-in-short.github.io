  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Active client listening in psychoanalytic session</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The interaction of the psychoanalyst and the client is carried out in the form of a conversation, which includes aspects of verbal and non-verbal interaction.  The position of the client can be different: he can sit in a chair diagonally from the analyst or lie on the couch, having visual contact with a specialist or only perceiving his voice.  In psychoanalysis, the main way to study an unconscious person is the method of free association, when the client says everything that comes to his mind, and the analyst, using active listening, helps to later draw conclusions about the causes of the stated problem, about possible ways to solve it specifically for this patient.  <span>The method of free associations</span> actualizes precisely that aspect of the problem that is accessible to impact at this stage of work. </p><p>  With eye contact, active listening to the psychoanalyst is complemented by non-verbal means of interaction.  This may be eye contact, <span>facial expression,</span> intonation of the voice, the creation of spatial conditions for a psychoanalytic session.  First of all, each client should feel comfortable and safe in the specialist‚Äôs office, so the analyst must adhere to the rules of interaction adopted for all types of <span>psychological counseling:</span> maintaining distance in communication, respecting the patient, respecting confidentiality. </p><p>  Active listening technique involves: </p><p>  - Expression of interest in the client‚Äôs messages, which is manifested in the form of short remarks such as ‚Äúaga-reactions‚Äù, clarifying questions, gestures for accepting information (nods, answers to questions, approval); </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - attention to the details of the message, isolation of significant events, fixing them in memory or in the session protocol; </p><p>  - observation of the manifestation of emotions and analysis of their compliance with the material being reported, as well as an analysis of their own emotional reactions, i.e.  involvement in portable relationships significant for the client (child-parent, boss-subordinate, victim-aggressor and others); </p><p>  - invalidity to messages from which the client expects a condemning or, conversely, supportive reaction of the analyst, which makes it possible to understand the strength of the client‚Äôs Super-Ego and its impact on behavior in society; </p><p>  - the use of pauses in the conversation with the aim of understanding and feeling the client what is being discussed, what is the topic of the conversation. </p><p>  Active listening is the basis for further analysis of messages, as  At the same time, the client has the opportunity not only to consciously present the factual material, but also to allow himself to fantasize about the future, make plans to solve the problem, analyze his feelings, live his memories ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù.  The decision is often made by the client independently with the support of the analyst, who only helps him analyze the relationship between past and present events, establish causal relationships, and find new approaches for self-improvement. </p><p>  Active listening takes about 70% of the time of a psychoanalytic session, especially at the first meetings, when the client needs to talk, cry, complain about life, formulate a problem.  The analyst‚Äôs speech in these cases is needed to relieve tension, relax, and provide support to the client.  During psychoanalytic therapy, active listening is required in situations where client‚Äôs dreams are analyzed, when the psychoanalyst only clarifies individual fragments, stimulates introspection, and highlights significant elements, based on which the analysis will be carried out. </p><p>  In psychoanalysis, active listening is used at each session to a greater or lesser extent, because the analyst‚Äôs function is to obtain as much factual and fantasy information as possible for diagnosis and further analysis based on the thoughts and judgments of the client himself. </p>
