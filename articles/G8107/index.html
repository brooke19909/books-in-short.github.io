  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Original corrugated board crafts - ideas, features and recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Crafts <span>made from corrugated cardboard</span> are strong and durable.  Therefore, they are often used in the manufacture of toys for children.  You can take into the work the usual packing material, which remained after the acquisition of some large equipment - a TV, a gas stove, a refrigerator, etc. It is convenient to make large cars, doll houses for such recycled materials. </p><p>  But bright colored sheets of corrugated cardboard are also on sale.  From them you can make a variety of toys or decor items.  Let's look at a few options for making crafts from corrugated cardboard.  In the article we will describe in detail how to make them, what will be needed for this. </p><h2>  Beads for mom on March 8 </h2><p>  From colored cardboard, you can twist beads of different colors and sizes.  Straight cylinders are formed from simple stripes, and if you cut a strip of cardboard with a sharp edge, then the skein will be spiral, as in the photo in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beads for mom" class="if uuid-2371845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2371845.jpg"></div><p>  In the manufacture of beads, strips are fastened with PVA glue.  To twist the hanks, use a base - a wooden skewer or a metal knitting needle.  After complete drying of the crafts from corrugated cardboard, an even hole remains inside, into which a kapron thread or fishing line is inserted.  You can attach a chain that has a clasp.  To make the beads shine beautifully, they can be coated with a layer of acrylic varnish. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  greeting card </h2><p>  When using corrugated cardboard in the creation of postcards, the product is voluminous and embossed.  Take, for example, such a wonderful owl.  On a sheet of cardboard bent in half, a bright strip of printed paper is first glued.  The drawing can be anything - circles, hearts, balls, etc. The body of an owl and two small wings are cut from the corrugated cardboard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="greeting card" class="if uuid-2371875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2371875.jpg"></div><p>  The remaining parts are even, cut out of durable glossy paper.  Large white circles are the eyes of a bird; paws, beak and eye pupils are cut out of black paper.  Using the same print, a heart is cut out.  Such a simple craft from corrugated cardboard looks very stylish and impressive. </p><h2>  Wall panel </h2><p>  From a large piece of corrugated cardboard, you can cut such an autumn tree with a sharp cutter.  Additionally, you can use multi-colored buttons or leaflets cut from colored paper or felt.  Crafts made from corrugated cardboard with their own hands are cut carefully, because you need to remove only a thin part of a three-layer cardboard.  The wavy inner part should not be affected by the tip of the blade, as the picture will be sloppy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wall panel cut out of cardboard" class="if uuid-2372789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2372789.jpg"></div><p>  Before cutting, the contours of the drawing are applied with a thin simple pencil.  Then, along the drawn lines, a sharp cutter is carried out, it is desirable to choose an inclined blade.  You can use a clerical knife.  Then it remains only to decorate the crafts with buttons.  Choose objects of different colors and sizes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Craft "Fish" </h2><p>  For such a craft for children, corrugated cardboard is taken the most ordinary, you can use the old box from the packaging.  First, the shape of the fish is drawn with a simple pencil with a tail and fins.  Then the same scales are cut out.  The head is separated from the body of the fish by long stripes of cardboard bent by an arc.  Stick the scales, starting from the tail.  Circles overlap.  Three strips of a thin part of cardboard are glued on the tail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cardboard-crafts.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cardboard fish" class="if uuid-2371906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2371906.jpg"></div><p>  The eye is made voluminous due to layering.  Three circles of different sizes are cut out and glued in descending order.  First, the largest circle, then medium-sized, at the end - the smallest.  When the work is done, you can make it bright by painting with gouache paints.  They cover the product several times, since corrugated cardboard absorbs water well.  After complete drying, the craft also opens with acrylic varnish.  After that, it will look brilliant, and the colors will become more saturated. </p><h2>  A gift to dad on February 23 </h2><p>  Before you do the craft of the tank from corrugated cardboard, you need to remove an even layer.  For work, we need only the wavy part of the cardboard.  First, four wide strips are cut.  They are twisted into cylinders.  These will be the wheels of the tank.  They are fastened together with PVA glue, and are additionally restrained by the tank‚Äôs tracks.  They are made of thin strips that are wrapped around the wheels several times. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sesco.com.sg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tank on February 23" class="if uuid-2371852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2371852.jpg"></div><p>  The lower part of the crafts is ready!  Now proceed to the tank tower.  A wide strip is cut out of cardboard and the tower curls.  The sides are sealed with even plates cut to the size of the sides.  From a thin strip you need to roll up the hatch.  It remains only to make a hole in the front of the tower and insert a long thin gun.  At the end of it a thickening is done.  After manufacturing, the tank can be painted with bright colors and opened with acrylic varnish. </p><h2>  Funny monkey </h2><p>  Monkeys are made from thinly sliced ‚Äã‚Äãstrips using the quilling twisting technique.  How to do such crafts from corrugated cardboard step by step, read further in the article.  From brown stripes the head and the body of the little animal are curled.  As a basis for winding, you can take a wooden skewer, in which a slot is cut with a knife.  The edge of the paper is inserted into it and rotational movements around the stick begin.  When the required thickness of the part is reached, the edge is trimmed and attached to the last turn with PVA glue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cardboard monkeys" class="if uuid-2371840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2371840.jpg"></div><p>  When the biggest details are done, work begins on the small parts.  For the muzzle use a thin yellow strip from which the circle is curled.  Ears are made up of two colors.  Paws are represented only by long strips folded in half.  Nose, eyes, mouth made of colored paper with applique.  Hair is collected from yellow yarn and glued on top of the head to PVA glue. </p><h2>  Cardboard turkey </h2><p>  To do the work you will need colored corrugated cardboard.  The head and body of the turkey are twisted from strips of red and brown.  The magnificent tail is assembled from rounded wide strips of white, red and brown colors.  They are glued on the back of the body at one point.  The stripes themselves diverge in the direction of the rays of the sun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated turkey" class="if uuid-2371841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2371841.jpg"></div><p>  A strip of orange paper curled into an oval is attached to the front of the head.  Eyes can be cut out of colored paper, or you can take purchased ones, as in the photo above.  At the end, paws and a hat are created. </p><p>  The article gives several options for crafts made of corrugated cardboard, made with children and for children.  Try to create your own masterpiece.  Good luck </p>
