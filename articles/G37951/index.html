    <p>  An integral part of economic state planning is investment policy.  Moreover, it has a significant impact on both the micro and the macro level.  The investment policy is drawn up with the aim of revitalizing investment activity, that is, creating conditions that will be as attractive as possible for investors. </p><p>  The specialist regularly develops measures to attract <span>additional capital.</span>  In this matter, the main criterion is the size of the invested funds and the level of riskiness of the operation.  At the macro level, the state investment policy is being considered, which should ultimately improve the country's economic situation, and, consequently, significantly improve the <span>standard of living of</span> citizens. </p><p>  The government also affects the degree of investment of capital of economic entities.  The instruments of such an impact are depreciation and scientific and technical policies.  For example, government agencies establish a <span>depreciation rate</span> , which is mandatory for each economic entity to comply with.  With this simple measure, the government is able to control the speed of the <span>reproduction process</span> in each industry.  The state is no less interested in the development of scientific and technological progress, therefore, it allocates allocations for enterprises in those industries that most need them. </p><p>  If we talk about our country, the investment policy of Russia requires careful study.  After all, the economy needs an influx of foreign capital, the state budget funds have long been insufficient to finance all the needs of business entities.  This is clearly reflected in the depreciation of equipment and other equipment in production, in insufficient technological training, which was especially evident during the years of crisis.  At the same time, investment policy should be balanced, since the influx of foreign capital in large quantities creates a strong dependence of the country at the international level.  And for this it is necessary, first of all, to learn how to correctly use the available resources.  And only after organizing a rational production process, one can resort to the help of foreign sponsors. </p><p>  At present, it is very profitable to invest in Russian industry, since the level of competition is low, the cost of raw materials and labor is much lower than in the west.  Despite such attractiveness, investors are wary of such bright prospects.  This is due to many reasons, for example, the variability of the economic situation of the country, especially in times of crisis, political confusion.  In addition, in our legislative system you can find too many inaccuracies and shortcomings, so in some cases it can be difficult to resolve the issue of the right to property.  The state does not work in the field of attracting foreign capital, as it does not develop a system of benefits for foreign entrepreneurs.  And, of course, the constant jumps in the national currency exchange rate do not allow operations on the domestic market. </p><p>  It can be concluded that investment policy should be developed in the direction of minimizing the level of risk for foreigners, as well as in the direction of drawing up preferential taxation of investors. </p><p>  The investment policy of enterprises is aimed at investing in other industries in order to increase equity.  And in order for the main goal of this policy to be achieved, it is necessary to draw up a clear business plan, based on which the specialist proceeds in the future.  Proper organization of the investment process will allow you to get a larger profit and significantly expand the core business. </p>
