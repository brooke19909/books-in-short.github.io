But the pace of modern life does not always make it possible to break into the forest or to the river: cottages, gardens, repairs ... Vacation flies by unnoticed.  But you can always find a way out!  One option is to visit Izmailovsky Park. </p><p>  This is an oasis among the concrete desert, which is hidden in a forested area.  In addition to the beautiful nature, he has something to brag about - convenient location, clean air, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãentertainment for children and adults.  Just a couple of years ago, an ice rink opened in <span>Izmailovsky Park.</span> </p><h2>  The story of an amazing park </h2><p>  This area was originally far from something that would resemble a park.  From 1571 to 1585, the territory was in the possession of the boyar N.R. Zakharin-Yuryev.  A little less than a century he was occupied by the descendants of the Romanovs, and then the estate was occupied by Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich.  In this estate, he made a suburban residence. </p>

A pond in the form of a ring was built on the Serebryanka river, on which there is a round island with a palace in the middle.  The remains of the building remained until 1855.

    <p>  The year 1676 was marked by the construction of the Nativity Church, and in 1679 the Cathedral of the same name.  For protection, two gates and a fence were erected. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The estate was surrounded by gardens: Mulberry, Grape, Pharmaceutical.  Luxurious berry plants grew, gardens made it possible to deliver the freshest produce to the table, and beer was brewed from hops, which were bred in the courtyard.  In addition to fruit trees, decorative ones were also brought in, specially hired foreign gardeners came to look after them.  <span>Linden alleys</span> survived until the mid-19th century <span>.</span>  There were also many office buildings that provided the vital functions of the family and servants. </p><p>  Peter I came to Izmailov to spend leisure time in fun games and fun.  The hills or dams that our contemporaries know were formerly the Zhukovsky dam, which was built by the tsar. </p>

The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãIzmailovsky Park during the period of Stalin‚Äôs rule amounted to 1200 hectares.  On its territory was a cinema, theater, parachute tower.  By right, he was considered the best park in the country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Children's attraction is not the only idea that has not been realized.  Fortunately, the park remained, because according to the architect‚Äôs plan, they had to uproot it, dig an <span>artificial pond,</span> and build a Central Stadium named after the General Secretary on one of the banks. </p><p>  The plans were disrupted by the death of Joseph Stalin.  No <span>sports facility was</span> erected, the pond remained a project on paper.  However, to the great joy of the locals, they managed to stretch a subway line here.  Now it is the Partizanskaya metro station.  Since then, Izmailovsky Park has become more accessible; every Muscovite knew how to get to it. </p><p>  Another event - the installation of the Ferris wheel in 1957. </p><h2>  Modern stage </h2><p>  In 1998, Izmailovsky Park received the title of a specially protected natural area.  In connection with this, the name also changed - it became natural-historical. </p>

    <p>  Walking alleys were reconstructed, and their network was conveniently spread across the park.  Not so long ago, an ice rink in Izmailovsky Park was flooded, which immediately caused a storm of positive emotions among citizens and guests of the capital. </p><h2>  What to watch </h2><p>  Walking along the alleys is a pleasure, but it can also be enhanced by cognitive journeys through history.  So, one of the attractions is the Apiary, which has been around for a century and a half.  Today, an ecocenter is located on its territory. </p><p>  Piglet will certainly be appreciated by people of advanced age.  Since the 60s, at this place near the metro station, pensioners are constantly going to dances and conversations.  You can see them on weekends, but Piglet himself is very easy to recognize - this is a big meadow in the center of the park. </p>
