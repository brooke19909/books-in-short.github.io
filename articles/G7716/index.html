Sometimes money in an account runs out almost instantly, although in fact no expensive operations have been carried out.  Why is this so?  What should be done in this situation?  For what reasons can money be debited from a SIM card? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out why the money was paid" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1302521.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Reflect on the tariff </h2><p>  Want to know why they withdraw money from MTS?  Then, first of all, think about which tariff plan you have connected.  Sometimes this action will help to deal with the problem. </p><p>  The thing is that in some tariff plans there is a <span>monthly fee.</span>  Both daily and monthly.  Depending on this, money will be debited from your balance either every day or once a month (on a certain date).  In payment of the tariff plan.  If you remember the name thereof, but do not recall the terms of use, see the tariff information on the operator‚Äôs official website. </p><h2>  Paid services </h2><p>  In some cases, the balance of MTS suffers from a constant write-off of funds due to the paid services connected to you.  Sometimes at clients they are automatically activated as part of a bonus program, but they are not automatically turned off automatically.  Subscribers simply forget about the existence of a connected option.  And at the end of the month it turns out that a certain amount of money "flew" from the account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, you can check for paid services in many ways.  About them a little later.  To begin with, it is worth considering all possible options why MTS withdraws money every day (or month).  After all, there are not many reasons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="balance pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1302519.jpg"></div>

So, for example, some infection contributes to the constant debiting of money from a number.  Regardless of your mobile operator.  This will have to be taken into account. </p><p>  It is recommended to consider this option as the reason that the MTS balance suffers if you previously entered your mobile phone number on some services.  In particular, suspicious ones, often they activate viruses that charge money from a SIM card.  By the way, to detect this infection is not so difficult.  But you have to try.  So how can you find the reason for debiting funds from your balance sheet? </p><h2>  Call operator </h2><p>  The first and most obvious solution is to call the operator.  How to find out <span>why the money was withdrawn (MTS)?</span>  To do this, dial 0890 on your mobile phone and wait until a call center employee answers you.  Then tell him about your situation, ask him to check what is the matter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You will be asked for a phone number, as well as your passport data (usually only a name, surname and middle name are asked to confirm the fact of owning a SIM card).  A few minutes of waiting - and the employee will report on the reasons for debiting funds from the balance of your mobile phone.  Nothing difficult!  Only not everyone likes this technique.  There are some analogues thereof, but more popular and successful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why do they withdraw money from mts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1302522.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Visit to the salon </h2><p>  Do you use MTS?  What is the money withdrawn for?  How to check what became the real cause of this phenomenon?  In fact, everything is not as difficult as it seems.  If the call to the operator does not suit you, you can use the more successful scenario. </p><p>  For example, come to the nearest MTS mobile phone salon and ask them for a printout of your balance.  That is, you will be given an extract with all the expenses for a certain period.  Say for the past six months.  This document will also write numbers and teams responsible for certain functions. </p><p>  If there are paid services, office staff will need to tell you about it.  Moreover, many indicate which codes in the statement are responsible for a particular operation.  But when the virus becomes the reason for writing off money, often the process will be displayed as a transfer to one or another third-party number.  In any case, as soon as the extract is in your hands, check with MTS employees why it is withdrawn from your account.  They will definitely help you. </p><p>  Perhaps this is the best case scenario.  For it, you will need a passport or any other confirmation that you are the owner of the named phone number.  The main thing is that the statement helps to really see your spending on mobile communications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay removes money every day" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1302523.jpg"></div>
