Consider its location.  We decide how best to get to it using public transport, namely: the subway.  So which station are you talking about?  Introducing our theme: <span>"Moscow: Leningradsky Station".</span>  So, we begin to study the material. </p><h2>  Where is? </h2><p>  At the very beginning of its existence, this station was called "North".  Why does he have such a name?  Because all trains go north.  But here is his location in the city center, on Komsomolskaya Square.  To be more precise, we will write the exact coordinates.  Address of the Leningradsky railway station in Moscow: Komsomolskaya square, house 3. </p>

    <p>  As we mentioned earlier, it is located in the center.  And to be more precise, it‚Äôs closer to the Northern District (Basmanny district).  Nearby is the Kalanchevskaya platform, which is a denouement for many railway lines.  And also in the vicinity of the Leningrad station is Yaroslavsky.  Opposite across the road is Kazan. </p><p>  It‚Äôs very easy to navigate, because all 3 stations are visible from Krasnoprudnaya Street and Komsomolskaya Square, as well as from the Kalanchevskaya platform.  Later we will talk about when it is best to visit the city of Moscow.  The Leningradsky station, like the others, is overloaded in the early morning.  And we will discuss this below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What does the station look like? </h2><p>  When you arrive at Komsomolskaya Square, your landmark should be the yellow station building: a two-story building with a clock tower in the middle on the roof. </p><p>  In <span>St. Petersburg, Moscow Station</span> is a copy of Leningradsky in Moscow.  Both stations were created by the same architect.  Therefore, let it not be a fright for you if it seems to you that you arrived where you started your journey from.  True, inside the stations are distinguished by the presence of kiosks, long-distance ticket offices, and a waiting room. </p><p>  Leningradsky Station in <span>Moscow: the</span> Komsomolskaya <span>metro station</span> , and in St. Petersburg the Moscow Station - Ploshchad Vosstaniya and Mayakovskaya. </p><h2>  How to get on the subway? </h2><p>  And now we‚Äôll decide how to get to the Leningradsky railway station.  You can use land transport, but it is undesirable in view of congestion on roads, parking lots on the territory.  It should also be borne in mind that everything is paid in the center, including where the Leningradsky railway station (Moscow) is.  Which metro station is nearby?  Let's immediately note that you need to go along the Koltsevaya line, and you can also go along Sokolnicheskaya.  As we said above, the Komsomolskaya metro station.  On both lines the station is called the same.  Only now you need to know in advance where to go, so as not to get to the Kazan station. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Address of the Leningrad station in Moscow" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1224084.jpg" width="600"></div>

Undoubtedly, you can come to Veliky Novgorod, located between megacities.  Trains continue to the distant city of Murmansk, where you can admire such a bewitching phenomenon as the northern lights in winter. </p>

    <p>  Suburban communication on the October Railway (this is the name of this direction): Zelenograd, Klin, Kanakovo, Tver.  The final destination for electric trains is Tver.  To go further, you need to either take a train or buy a ticket for a local train that goes towards Bologoe. </p><p>  From the Leningrad station go the famous "Red Arrow", high-speed trains "Sapsan". </p><h2>  Tips for all travelers as well as meeting / mourners </h2><p>  We remind everyone that the Leningradsky railway station in Moscow is the Komsomolskaya metro station.  And no other.  Even train informants talk about this in the subway when the train arrives at one of the Komsomolskaya stations.  In modern metro schemes in Moscow, it is noted where and which stations are located. </p><p>  It is advisable to take tickets in your village so that you arrive in Moscow no earlier than 5.30.  Because at this time, a huge number of passengers arriving at night expect a subway to open.  It is not recommended to arrive at rush hour from 8.30 to 10.00, as well as at 18.00.  Try to arrive from 6.00 to 8.00, from 10.30 to 15.00, as well as in the evening from 19.30 to 22.00. </p>

    <p>  Why until 22.00?  Agree, it is better to arrive early to catch the metro in time.  Especially if you still need to change to ground transport, which serves passengers until midnight. </p><p>  Try to arrive at the Leningradsky station in advance.  It‚Äôs better to arrive an hour earlier than to be late for the train.  After all, many force majeure circumstances can prepare Moscow.  Leningradsky Station, like any other, will not be able to compensate you for the trip due to failures and accidents in the subway, traffic jams on the tracks and so on. </p><p>  So we and you have examined the topic of the Leningrad Station.  May your trips be pleasant and happy. </p>
