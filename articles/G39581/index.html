The organizers promise that guests weighing less than two kilograms will simply let go back to the lake. </p><p>  The peculiarity of these fishing tours to Karelia is that fishing is organized on the shores of the inaccessible lakes Shombozero and Kkukua.  You can get there only with all-wheel drive jeeps, the use of which is included in the price of the tour.  And the last part of the route will have to wade on foot.  But fishing in these abandoned places is worth such an effort! </p><p>  You can catch from the shore or use the motor boat provided by the organizers and anchor in the ore.  An experienced fishing guide will tell you cool places and help beginners deal with equipment. </p><h2>  Round "Winter fishing on Kola" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kareliavillage.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter fishing in Karelia" class="if uuid-2933806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2933806.jpg"></div><p>  Those who love the abundance of fish and the extreme sensations of being close to the wild, will enjoy such fishing tours in Karelia.

Less than 25 cm trout does not happen, and in large lakes this fish grows to a meter.  Instances weighing 8 kilograms are quite common, so gambling is guaranteed for guests. </p><p>  The price of the tour includes renting a snowmobile, meals and accommodation, and a real Russian bathhouse. </p><p>  To get on this fishing tour to Karelia from Moscow, it is better to get to Murmansk by plane, and from there get to Olenegorsk. </p><h2>  Fishing in the winter in the forest huts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fehrplay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter fishing in Karelia" class="if uuid-2933826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2933826.jpg"></div><p>  A very interesting type of recreation and fishing in Karelia at the base will be the time spent on lakes and rivers in the Kalevala national region.
