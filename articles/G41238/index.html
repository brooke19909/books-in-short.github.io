Definition, concept, appearance with a photo, fabric structure and its application</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Lightweight, like a cloud, a translucent fabric for dresses of princesses from fairy tales, from which it is easy to collect magnificent folds and tails, as it keeps its shape incredibly well and has great elasticity.  What is this wonderful stuff?  Of course, tulle!  Many immediately presented the bride in a beautiful wedding dress.  That's right, before only wedding dresses were sewn from this fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="modseleystore.storenvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="outfits for the wedding ceremony" class="if uuid-2591440" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2591440.jpg"></div><h2>  The history of the first mesh material </h2><p>  Fatin is a fabric created almost 200 years ago in the USA: in the 30s of the XIX century, costumes for ballet were sewn from it.  The production of tulle from nylon was launched.  The first fabric samples were white, only lower skirts and ballet tutus were sewed from them.  The first in such a tutu in front of the general public was the famous ballerina of the time, Maria Taglioni. </p><p>  Later, when the technology was complicated and many shades of tulle appeared, the designers took it into service and created a huge number of new styles of clothing. </p><h2>  Types of tulle </h2><p>  Fabric tulle is matte or gloss, sprayed or embroidered, of varying degrees of stiffness.  The palette of shades is very rich. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zengslace.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tulle with a picture" class="if uuid-2592158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2592158.jpg"></div><p>  The peculiarity of the material that distinguishes it from others is that it has a mesh structure resembling a fishing net.  Cell sizes determine stiffness.  Fatin is a very durable fabric due to the nylon content, but the thicker the mesh, the harder it is.  Sometimes spandex is added to the composition, then the result is knitwear with remarkable stretchability. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are 3 main degrees of rigidity: </p><ol><li>  Hard - matte.  It is used for decoration, creating flowers, fluffy pompoms.  Also used in the design of gift wrapping and bouquets.  Not suitable for clothes due to stiffness. </li><li>  Medium-hard - has a slight sheen.  From it you can sew tutu skirts, tutus, dresses for weddings, parties.  From it make "skirts" for tables and chairs, <span>decorate windows,</span> arches.  It is taken for the decoration of cars of the wedding procession, they are decorated with balloons. </li><li>  Soft tulle is a material that has a gentle matte shine.  Very pleasant to the touch.  It is widely used in the tailoring of children's clothing.  These include common tissue types such as Eurofatin Luxe and Eurofatin Life.  Luxe has less shine, does not stretch.  Life is more "silk", stretches across the entire width of the panel, less slippery. </li></ol><h2>  Scope of use </h2><p>  Since this fabric has almost unique properties, in the modern world it has found wide application. </p><p>  Really wonderful material: very elastic, virtually non-creasing, does not sit down during washing, very durable.  The mesh surface of tulle is difficult to get dirty.  It is practically weightless, therefore it is used for decoration of banquet rooms. </p><p>  It occurs quite often: in clothes, when creating underwear, in the interior, New Year's costumes, jewelry, etc. </p><h2>  Carnival costume for girls </h2><p>  For children's parties, modern mothers are very fond of dressing up their charms in dresses based on tulle. </p><p>  With your own hands, having learned how to make magnificent skirts, you can create an original New Year's outfit for a girl. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="snowflake costume" class="if uuid-2591404" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2591404.jpg"></div><p>  So, for a skirt we will need: fabric (a square section of Eurofatine Luxe with sides of 3 m), a wide elastic band or a rubber band. </p><p>  First, cut the canvas into 3 strips, 1 m wide each.  Next, cut these strips into narrow strips of 20 cm. You will get pieces of tulle with sides 20x100 cm. </p><p>  Now take the elastic and sew it into the ring.  A strip of fabric is folded in half and fixed on the resulting ring.  Decorate with guipure, ribbons, beads, rhinestones to your taste. </p><p>  Thus, you can come up with a lot of ideas for creativity! </p><p>  For example, for a sorceress‚Äôs dress, take a T-shirt, decorate it with beads, sequins, sew on the wing-sleeves and attach a skirt of two layers of tulle to it (form the second layer with folds).  Add a magic wand accessory.  How to make?  Fatin will help you in this case too! </p><p>  It will take a long wooden skewer, a narrow ribbon, mesh, glue.  Make a small pompom from tulle, wrap the skewer with tape.  Glue the pompom to the skewer and decorate with ribbons.  The costume for the joy of the baby is ready! </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="charming sorceress" class="if uuid-2591416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2591416.jpg"></div><p>  The Snowflake outfit is also very simple in execution: a white tutu with glued snowflakes, a tulle boa, shoes decorated with white pompons ... </p><p>  And, of course, Alice from Wonderland is the favorite character of the cartoon of many girls.  A fluffy blue skirt of tulle, a little white apron.  A plush rabbit will complement the magical look. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alice in Wonderland" class="if uuid-2591388" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2591388.jpg"></div><h2>  Banquet room decoration </h2><p>  Often used this material for decorating banquet rooms. </p><p>  Since tulle is very light, it is often used to decorate the ceiling.  He drapes remarkably and perfectly holds the given form.  Often used in combination with a garland - the fabric hides the wires, only the lights are visible. </p><p>  Halls for the celebration are also decorated with balloons.  If they are wrapped in tulle and tied with satin ribbons, it will turn out quite unusual and festive! </p><p>  Indoors must be equipped with a photo zone.  You can make it using this interesting material in half an hour, and such a background will look amazing! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="banquet room design" class="if uuid-2591430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2591430.jpg"></div><p>  Very often, not only brides dress up in tulle skirts, but also tables with chairs.  It looks gorgeous!  The main condition is that the length of the skirts should reach the floor. </p><p>  To decorate the hall, designers use pompons from corrugated paper.  And if they are made of tulle, they will look much more tender! </p><h2>  Photo Shoot Accessories </h2><p>  Many photographers use tulle for original photo shoots.  Photos with such a background and accessories turn out to be insanely bright, interesting, romantic, and the images look stunning! </p><p>  You can make your own decor, which will help to avoid large financial costs.  Prepare wonderful magnificent fluffy weightless skirts for mothers and babies - you are greatly appreciated.  And bouquets of toys made by yourself and wrapped in tulle will not let the kids get bored during the photo shoot. </p><p>  In this case, the low cost of the fabric plays an important role.  Sometimes for sewing one skirt it takes about 11 m of material!  It is very easy to cut, so sewing from tulle is a pleasure! </p><p>  Below you see a photo of tulle - fabric with amazing properties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fr.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bright tulle" class="if uuid-2591976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2591976.jpg"></div><h2>  Care for tulle products </h2><p>  Is it difficult to care for the fabric?  Airy ‚Äúfluffy‚Äù skirts and other tulle products are easily washed in warm water.  For washing (only by hand!) Use a mild gel or a special shampoo.  Rinse the item several times until the water is clear.  At the last rinse, add conditioner-rinse to the water so that the product does not accumulate static electricity, since tulle is a synthetics.  In no case do not squeeze - this can damage the structure of the fabric.  The material dries very quickly, you only need to gently straighten the folds.  You can and should iron, but at the very minimum and using a humidifier. </p>
