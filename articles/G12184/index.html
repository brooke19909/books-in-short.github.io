  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How many people can live without food, water and sleep</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Are we mere mortals able to go against nature and confront the biological needs that underlie our existence?  As practice has shown, we can, however, the question is whether we need to mock our body in such a way and what goal we set ourselves.  Reading about various interesting cases, I was a little surprised how many people can live without food, sleep or water. </p><p>  Firstly, a rather unusual man - Yakov Tsiperovich - got into the story.  According to the data, his own wife tried to poison him, and as a result of the damage caused to the body, he suffered a <span>clinical death,</span> after which he did not sleep for 16 years, never closed his eyes.  Doctors, conducting examinations, confirmed that everything with the body of a man is in order.  Unique, what can I say. </p><p>  But still, the average person can not sleep without causing visible health damage for no more than two days, after which various deviations begin to appear.  So, after three days, many experimenters had hallucinations, irritability, apathy, and the first signs of psychosis.  By the way, even a day without sleep is harmful, because the level of sugar in the blood rises, the hormone of joy is not produced, hence the ugly mood.  And if you do not sleep for more than three days, then there is a high probability of irreversible consequences - the death of brain cells. </p><p>  A rather interesting question is how many people can live without food.  There are many cases where <span>fasting</span> lasted several months, for example.  However, this should be done only by trained people, because an ordinary person is unlikely to be able to withstand a hunger strike for more than three days. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The beginner's guide says that in the early days, symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, discontent, irritability will prevail, but then, if your body is ready for such a life, these problems will go away.  A second wind will open, after which the body will begin to work with a new force, and you really will feel as healthy as ever.  And to the question how many people can live without food, answer for yourself, based on your own feelings. </p><p>  But there is a certain amendment that states that weight in this way of life, if it is not overweight, should always remain at the same level.  If there is an excess, then gradually it will reach the ideal mark, but should not move further.  Otherwise, you should stop all attempts to join the fasting, because <span>weight loss</span> will only lead to the emergence or exacerbation of diseases. </p><p>  How many days can a person live without food, following all the rules of fasting and at the same time being observed by competent specialists?  Unknown, it all depends on the constitution.  Perhaps a month, perhaps six months. </p><p>  Most often, the question is whether a person can live without food or not, women are asked who want to remove excess weight and get in shape.  Nutritionists acknowledge that a short and proper fasting can lead to a positive result, but not for everyone.  Chronic diseases may worsen, arrhythmia may appear, so no one should starve on their own, without going to the doctor for advice. </p><p>  By the way, during the refusal of food, water should not be neglected, but gradually its amount required by your body can be reduced from a liter to one glass per day.  Remember that food brings us strength.  You can limit it in quantity, you can use only the healthy, make up a varied menu, but refusing food is a very responsible and serious step. </p><p>  So, we figured out how many people can live without food.  There was an important question: how to do without water and is it possible.  The answer is one - without water, a person will last no more than three days, since <span>dehydration of the body</span> will lead to improper functioning of the kidneys, heart and brain. </p><p>  A day, a person needs to drink 1-2 liters of water, not counting juices, tea and other drinks.  Of course, few people follow this schedule, but it's worth a try and see how sometimes a glass of water discourages eating a huge portion of fried potatoes with meat.  Anyway, I want to eat, of course, but only much less.  Here is a way to lose weight, an alternative to fasting. </p><p>  We examined the question of how many people can live without food and other important components of our lives.  We sleep, eat, drink water due to the natural needs of the body, such is our nature.  Perhaps you should not disturb the normal existence of various experiments, which, for the most part, lead to not very good consequences. </p>
