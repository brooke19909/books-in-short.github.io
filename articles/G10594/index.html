And the other eight arches - knit sixteen columns with a crochet.  There are twelve arches left.  In them we knit twenty double crochets.  At the end, the thread should be fastened and cut. </li></ul><p>  Now you need to neatly fasten all layers from the wrong side and sew. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  That's all!

Then we collect a chain of twenty air loops.  They should be connected in a circle.  After you need to knit all the petals in a circle. </li><li>  For a petal, we collect a chain of eighteen air loops.  Then in the second loop of the chain we knit two half columns.  The next thing we do is knit another ten single crochet stitches.  The two stitches that are left need to be knitted as follows: the next is knitted with a half-column, and the second with a single crochet.  The resulting petal is fixed in a circle of ten loops. </li><li>  We knit the rest of the petals in the same way as the first.  After we finished work, we proceed to the middle. </li><li>  In order to make the middle, you need to dial an air loop.  Then we knit four air loops.
