  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Walk on the 20th tram route in Samara</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Almost 400 square kilometers, more than a million people - Samara is one of the largest cities in Russia.  The dynamics of public transport - significantly more than 300 million passenger-kilometers per month.  All this fantastic mass of people daily moves from one end of the city to the other.  Someone goes to work, another urgently needs to visit a store, hospital, school and thousands of other reasons.  The city tram in all this diversity plays a key role. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  In Samara, trams began to be used in early 1915.  This type of transport is no less popular today. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotki.yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Historic tram car" class="if uuid-2488395" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2488395.jpg"></div><p>  A talented engineer Pavel Sutkevich worked for 4 years on a project that provided for the laying of infrastructure for urban electric transport in Samara.  Almost immediately, the tram gained popularity among urban residents.  For many workers from the outskirts of the city at that time (for example, the underground gully of the underground) - this was the only opportunity to get to work. </p><p>  Today, the city network has 25 routes with a fleet of more than 400 wagons.  The tram is one of the most reliable forms of public transport connecting various parts of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The network of lines laid at the beginning of the last century for more than a hundred years is successfully developing and improving.  The heyday of transportation fell on the 80s of the last century.  Even then, the new buildings of the <span>Samara region, a</span> tram 20 of the Samara route connected with the city center and industrial areas. </p><h2>  Street Novo-Sadovaya </h2><p>  Visiting a large city, you can just ride out of curiosity, drive all the tram stops of the 20th route.  There are 31 in total - from the Northern Tram Depot to Chapaevskaya Street. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Street Novo-Sadovaya Samara" class="if uuid-2488394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2488394.jpg"></div><p>  On the street Novo-Sadovaya runs the first part of the 20th route of the Samara tram.  The name of the street itself indicates that suburban dachas extended in this direction.  Renamed at the end of the 19th century from Lebyazhinskaya and Novaya, it has not changed its name to date.  It was here that the famous revolutionary Valerian Vladimirovich Kuibyshev lived, whose name the city bore for 56 years. </p><p>  More than 3 kilometers of the road, starting with the New buildings of the XXI century, passes by the beautiful buildings of wooden architecture of the past centuries.  You can stop and relax, walk around Central Park.  Closer to the city center there are architectural monuments built in 1908 - Samara Choral Synagogue, apartment building A.S.  Filimonova.  It is worth paying attention to a historical attraction - the building of the Embassy of the Kingdom of Belgium, during the Second World War. </p><p>  Gradually opens the center of Samara.  Route 20 of the tram runs through the historical zone.  Here you can tell a lot about each building.  For centuries, the city has kept its history. </p><h2>  Cross the center </h2><p>  In Samara, 20 tram routes cross almost the entire historical center of the city - Lenin Avenue, Polevaya, Galaktionovskaya, Krasnoarmeyskaya, Frunze streets.  Here you can talk about each building separately. </p><div class="photo" data-original="transit.parovoz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The historical center of Samara" class="if uuid-2488393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2488393.jpg"></div><p>  The 20th tram route ends in Samara, near the famous Khlebnaya Square, on Pionerskaya Street.  Forty minutes of the journey and you can already walk along the quiet streets of Strelka.  Here you can see the mansion where the young V.I.  Ulyanov, who became the genius of the October Revolution - Lenin.  It is worth looking at the premises of the Noble Assembly, a residential building of the constructivism model, DK im.  Dzerzhinsky, detail of the facade of the Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank of the late XIX century. </p><p>  Almost all stops on the Samara 20 tram route are associated with wonderful places.  A leisurely walk on this type of transport is sometimes worth it. </p>
