However, there are those who are little known, but from this no less attractive and interesting.  One of such places in Krasnoyarsk is the Torgashinsky ridge.  These mountains, stretching from the Black Hill to the famous Pillars Nature Reserve, are visible from almost anywhere in the city. </p><h2>  Beautiful places of Krasnoyarsk </h2><p>  The most beautiful and largest city in Siberia is undoubtedly Krasnoyarsk.  The Yenisei divides it into two parts, which radically differ both in the architecture of the local buildings and in the mentality of local residents.  Krasnoyarsk is very rich in beautiful places.  It is one of the greenest cities in the country.  From all sides it is surrounded by mountains and rocks, overgrown with giant trees, and in the city itself there are many parks and squares.  The air here is surprisingly clean and fresh all year round. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Torgashinsky ridge" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/1426139.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Famous Pillars in Krasnoyarsk </h2><p>  The beautiful places of Krasnoyarsk are, first of all, all the bizarre cliffs of the Krasnoyarsk nature reserve "Pillars", which constantly attract here lovers to enjoy the beauty of unspoiled nature.  Their unusual names speak for themselves: Monk, Turtle, Golden Eagle, Sparrows ... Rocks overgrown with giant trees took shape of people and animals gradually, under the influence of winds and heavy rains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This place, remote from the bustle of the city and prying eyes, was long ago chosen by radically-minded youth.  Until 1907, they regularly held meetings here. </p><p>  To date, Krasnoyarsk "Pillars" have chosen rock climbing enthusiasts.  It is here that there is a school of mountaineering, which has long been considered one of the best in Russia and is not going to lose its status.  The <span>basis of the Krasnoyarsk</span> climbing school was the tradition of columnism - conquering the peaks mainly without insurance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Torgashinsky ridge.

    <h2>  Not the "Pillars" united city is famous ... </h2><p>  Torgashinsky ridge (Krasnoyarsk) is something unimaginable.  A whole ridge of stone, almost completely encircling the city.  Rocks rise literally immediately behind residential areas.  Their proud grandeur can be seen from almost anywhere.  The slopes of the ridge are covered with lush vegetation, and at the foot of the river flows the Bazaikha River.  Throughout the ridge, a number of mountains with unusual names and diverse vegetation.  The Torgashinsky Range does not belong to the conservation area, which means that you can set up a camp here, light a fire and have a good time with the whole company.  And after rest, take an unforgettable walk along the rocks of Torgash, as the locals call it.  If you find yourself in Krasnoyarsk, be sure to visit the Torgashinsky ridge.  How to get there, any resident of the city will tell you.  This can be done both on your own car and on public transport.  Both the first and second methods will take you to a steep metal staircase, which will lead you to the Torgashinsky ridge. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rock Red Crest </h2><p>  The Torgashinsky ridge (Krasnoyarsk) is famous for the Red Ridge rock.  This is one of the favorite places in Krasnoyarsk.  It offers a beautiful view of the city and the Bazaikha River Valley.  The Red Ridge Rock is the best observation point of the Torgashinsky Range, covered in legends and legends.  It has long been believed that before this place was the waters of the ocean.  Over time, the ocean dried up, and the <span>underwater cliffs</span> remained.  To prove this theory, one can cite the fact that the rocks consist of keratinized remains of marine animals and silt. </p><p>  Rumor has it that the most real gravitational miracles are happening on the Red Ridge.  True, only one person has been talking about these miracles so far ... If you believe his story, then there is a certain force that can lift a person into the air and even carry him above the surface of the earth.  Allegedly, this is exactly what happened to him.  In 1977, he climbed to the top of the cliff in order to enjoy the surroundings.  At some point, an unknown force lifted him up and carried him some distance.  The incident frightened both the participant and the eyewitnesses of this event, and they hastened to leave this strange place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful places of Krasnoyarsk" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/1426137.jpg" width="500"></div>

In one of these teeth there is a through grotto, thanks to which the rock got its name.  Many legends are also associated with this rock.  According to one of them, the Arch destroys the bad karma of people who have risen here and heals diseases.  In other words, when climbing to the Torgashinsky ridge, the Arch must necessarily become part of your route. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Torgashinsky ridge.

    <h2>  The most famous caves </h2><p>  The Torgashinsky ridge is famous not only for its picturesque cliffs, but also for caves.  In the mid-20th century, they began to attract the attention of fans of this sport.  At that time, these visits were single, and people descending into the caves had neither special equipment nor specific skills.  However, it was they who laid the foundation for the development of speleology in the Krasnoyarsk Territory.  Since about the 60s, a cavers section has appeared, which today has more than 50 people.  Along with regular sports, section members explore the caves of the Torgashinsky ridge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caves of the Torgashinsky ridge" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/1426135.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Torgashinskaya cave </h2><p>  In the Krasnoyarsk Territory, this is one of the deepest caves - a favorite place for cavers.  Local residents have long come up with other, more picturesque names - the bottomless cave, Torgashinsky failure.  The names speak for themselves.  The descent into the cave is really very difficult and dangerous, therefore there is always equipment here, the integrity of which is regularly checked by the Ministry of Emergency Situations.  Despite the depth of the cave and the danger of its passage, there are always many who wish to descend into it. </p><h2>  Ice Cave </h2><p>  To the west of the Abyssal Cave is Ledyanaya Cave with two funnel-shaped entrances.  It got its name thanks to an ice coil located right at the entrance.  Researchers have discovered many human bones at the bottom.  Presumably, these are the remains of a military detachment.  The Torgashinsky ridge remains to be studied for a long time by both archaeologists and historians. </p><h2>  Fox Cave </h2><p>  On the maps of cavers, this cave first appeared in the 80s, but until 2007 nothing was known about it, except for information on its location.  The caver I. Orlovsky carried out excavations in 2007, but was soon forced to stop them, as he discovered a lot of bone material.  The cave became interested in archaeologists.  Among the bones found in the cave, the remains of both animals and birds were found.  In addition, the bones of a man who lived here long before our appearance were also found here.  In other words, the Fox cave is still subject to deeper and more detailed study. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Torgashinsky ridge.

    <p>  The Torgashinsky Range is gaining more and more popularity every day not only among local residents, but also among city guests.  Given that there is no infrastructure on the slopes of the ridge, quite a lot of people come here.  Someone goes for a walk with a backpack behind him, someone drives a car, carrying in the trunk the necessary equipment for downhill (downhill mountain biking) or freeriding (mountain biking on difficult tracks).  Quite often here you can meet ATV enthusiasts.  This is summer.  And in winter, skiers and snowboarders conquer the slopes. </p>
