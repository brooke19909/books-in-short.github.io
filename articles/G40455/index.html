  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A good microphone for the stream: a review of manufacturers and models, specifications, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Now more and more people learn about streams.  If a couple of years ago this was alien to many, now there are more streamers and those who know about this work. </p><p>  Thanks to live broadcasts, everyone can find friends around the world, creatively realize and earn money.  But first you need to get a good microphone for the stream. </p><h2>  What are streams? </h2><p>  So, it‚Äôs worth starting with acquaintance with such a concept as ‚Äústreaming‚Äù.  He became popular not so long ago.  In particular, thanks to the Twitch platform, which at one time was engaged only in game content. </p><p>  Now this is a resource that everyone is allowed to start their broadcast.  Stream is a live broadcast.  Thanks to him, you can show yourself, your creativity and skills. </p><p>  Twitch now has many thematic sections.  On the site you can find music broadcasts, streams of artists, dancers and even athletes.  But mainly this resource is aimed at gaming broadcasts.  Especially popular are broadcasts from e-sports tournaments and streams of new games. </p><h2>  The importance of the microphone </h2><p>  Not many people know which microphone to stream.  Most novice streamers believe that you can opt for the cheapest model.  It will be enough and simple headphones with a microphone. </p><p>  But if you take the matter seriously, you will have to accumulate a certain amount.  Of course, it is not necessary to immediately purchase an expensive microphone for 15-20 thousand rubles, if it does not concern musical streams.  In this case, you will have to immediately invest in a good device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.psynapticmedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stream Microphone" class="if uuid-3026122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3026122.jpg"></div><p>  By the way, the same applies to webcams.  Beginner streamers can use the simplest models or smartphone camera for this.  But it‚Äôs worth understanding that this option is definitely not suitable for broadcasts that are carried out in full resolution. </p><h2>  How to choose a microphone </h2><p>  There is a budget microphone for the stream.  There are several models that will cost 2-3 thousand rubles.  At the same time, the sound quality will be enough for the broadcast. </p><p>  In the future, when streams will generate revenue, it will be possible to gradually improve equipment.  In this case, it will be possible to purchase an external sound card, which will significantly affect the sound quality, and after that pay attention to an expensive microphone. </p><p>  Before choosing a device, you should understand what broadcasts you will conduct, as well as what amount you have.  At the initial stage, it is worth separating conversational, gaming and music streams.  For each of them, you may need different budget models. </p><p>  The cheapest device will cost you 2-3 thousand rubles.  Later, you can look at the models, the cost of which exceeds 20 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Help from other streamers </h2><p>  When choosing a <span>good microphone for a stream,</span> you can turn to other streamers for help.  Very often they indicate in the channel descriptions all the equipment that is used for broadcasting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you have a favorite streamer, the sound quality on the broadcast also suits you, you can spy on which microphone it uses and purchase the same one. </p><p>  But there is a catch: many popular streamers have already acquired more expensive equipment.  Some models may not be affordable for you.  Therefore, it is worth taking a closer look at less popular streamers, but with good air quality. </p><h2>  Model Options </h2><p>  Of course, each individual can determine which microphone is best for the stream.  One may be important functionality, the other - only the sound quality, and still others may even pay attention to the design.  Yes, and a lot depends on the purpose of the microphone. </p><p>  But for the entire existence of streams, certain leaders are already distinguished among the models that are used for streams: </p><ul><li>  Blue Yeti; </li><li>  Audio-Technica AT2020 USB Plus; </li><li>  Rode NT1A; </li><li>  Razer Seiren X; </li><li>  <span>Shure SM7B</span> ; </li><li>  sE Electronics X1A; </li><li>  BEHRINGER C-1; </li><li>  Samson C01U PRO; </li><li>  AntLion ModMic; </li><li>  Zalman ZM-Mic1. </li></ul><p>  The top ten included very expensive models, universal, vocal, budget, and even a pair of headsets. </p><h2>  Blue yeti </h2><p>  Undoubtedly this is one of the best microphones for streaming.  Perhaps 30% of streamers have it.  What caused this popularity? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Streamer Microphone" class="if uuid-3026124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3026124.jpg"></div><p>  The fact is that it was one of the first microphones that was positioned for such purposes.  It has really excellent sound quality, with a rather modest price tag of 13 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Of course, for a beginner streamer, this amount may turn out to be large, but if you still manage to collect this money, you can be sure that you no longer have to choose a microphone for broadcasts. </p><h2>  Blue Yeti Reviews </h2><p>  The fact that this is one of the most popular microphones already indicates a lot of advantages.  This is a universal model, so many take it to record podcasts, broadcasts and music broadcasts.  The only thing users complain about is too sensitive a mechanism.  For example, he picks up the sounds of the keyboard and mouse strongly, so this is not a good option for gamers. </p><h2>  Audio-Technica AT2020 USB Plus </h2><p>  Another great USB microphone.  For 14 thousand rubles, the streamer receives excellent sound and stable operation.  Complete with a microphone is a tripod, a bag for transportation and a long cord.  The model also looks good, there are control buttons on the case. </p><p>  The feature of this device is its simple connection.  It does not require additional configuration.  The case also has an output for connecting headphones.  You can immediately adjust the volume of voice and sounds. </p><h2>  Audio-Technica AT2020 USB Plus reviews </h2><p>  This is a very sensitive model.  It is worth considering and understanding that if the device is standing on a table, on a tripod, then all sounds will be audible to viewers.  Therefore, it is better for him to purchase a rack. </p><div class="photo" data-original="unlocked.newegg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Budget microphone" class="if uuid-3026126" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3026126.jpg"></div><p>  There are almost no negative reviews on the Internet.  Someone did not like the excessive sensitivity, which, by the way, is compensated by the excellent sound.  Someone was unhappy with the bright blue indicator on the case. </p><h2>  Rode nt1a </h2><p>  A good but cheap microphone for stream and studio recording.  Will cost 14 thousand rubles.  It is considered one of the best for recording vocals. </p><p>  Rode has long been known for quality.  Therefore, the model does not face physical damage to the case.  The materials are durable and high quality.  Even after several years of active use, the microphone looks like a new one. </p><p>  The kit includes a ‚Äúspider‚Äù, a pop filter, a removable cable and a case.  This package will appeal to everyone, given the cost of the device. </p><h2>  Rode NT1A Reviews </h2><p>  Clear sound with virtually no distortion is what every customer is looking for.  Therefore, this model is ideal for connoisseurs of sound.  Users noted a sturdy case made of shockproof materials.  Also, many liked the fact that nothing had to be bought. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, some users highlighted an unremarkable design.  The microphone is the most ordinary, without decorations and unusual colors.  But appearance is everyone‚Äôs business. </p><h2>  Razer seiren x </h2><p>  Razer is a company that is famous not only for its excellent gaming accessories, but also for its good microphone for streaming.  This model is less common than the rest.  Nevertheless, it looks very impressive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rez.store" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Live Microphone" class="if uuid-3026127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3026127.jpg"></div><p>  There is a microphone of 8 thousand rubles.  The model is connected via a USB cable.  Immediately comes on a swivel stand, which is equipped with a soft backing.  You can adjust the position of the device.  On the body there is a volume control and a power button. </p><h2>  Razer Seiren X Reviews </h2><p>  The most important advantage of the model is its cost.  Of course, not every cheap microphone records good sound.  But this is not about the Razer Seiren X. The device is praised by everyone who has ever worked with it. </p><p>  Also a lot of positive feedback received a cushioned stand.  Thanks to its soft backing, it blocks any vibration.  Therefore, the knock on the keyboard keys also becomes noticeably quieter. </p><h2>  Shure SM7B </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular microphones.  Despite the cost of 33 thousand rubles, it is still often used on streams.  Naturally, the most popular presenters have it.  By the way, this model can also be found on radio stations. </p><p>  This is a dynamic studio microphone.  He perfectly records voice, vocals and instruments.  There are mechanical buttons on the case that help set up the recording. </p><h2>  Shure SM7B Reviews </h2><p>  Of course, the main drawback of the model is its cost.  This is a very expensive microphone for beginners.  But at the same time he produces an excellent sound of voice and vocals.  It does not distort the volume and works well with acoustics. </p><p>  Users almost did not find any flaws in it.  Everything is so good that it allowed the model to become a bestseller. </p><h2>  sE Electronics X1A </h2><p>  A good budget microphone for the stream exists.  For 6 thousand rubles, you can purchase this model.  It refers to condenser microphones.  It does an excellent job recording voice and vocals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.seelectronics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vocal microphone" class="if uuid-3026129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3026129.jpg"></div><p>  The microphone practically does not pick up noise, so if you configure it correctly, you can completely remove them.  Has a high sensitivity.  It does a good job with acoustics.  One of the best studio microphones. </p><h2>  SE Electronics X1A Reviews </h2><p>  Users leave good reviews about this model.  The device copes with vocals and acoustics.  The buyers were especially pleased with the equipment.  Together with the stand in the box you can find a pop filter. </p><p>  Deficiencies at the microphone could not be found.  Apparently all because value for money is the most profitable here. </p><h2>  BEHRINGER C-1 </h2><p>  For 4 thousand rubles you can find another good microphone.  This is the cheapest version of the studio model.  It looks very simple, but it works great.  Of course, the sound quality can not be compared with models more expensive, but it corresponds to its price. </p><h2>  BEHRINGER C-1 Reviews </h2><p>  Users note that the device copes with speech better than with vocals.  May slightly distort the sound of musical instruments.  The quality of the case made of metal was also praised.  In the kit there is a holder for the case and a case, which many buyers also liked. </p><h2>  Samson C01U PRO </h2><p>  Another leader in the budget segment, which costs 8 thousand rubles.  Refers to studio models.  Powered by Plug and Play.  No additional sound card or amplifier required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sweetwater.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap Stream Microphone" class="if uuid-3026132" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3026132.jpg"></div><h2>  Samson C01U PRO reviews </h2><p>  Users noted that the sound is not bad, but a bit blurry.  If you use a guitar and record vocals, you will notice fuzziness.  Nevertheless, for the initial streams, this option can be considered ideal. </p><p>  I was pleased with the equipment with a tripod and a long cable.  The housing has a headphone output. </p><h2>  Lapel models </h2><p>  AntLion ModMic and Zalman ZM-Mic1 are good stream microphones.  Lapel models are used less often, but they are underestimated in vain. </p><p>  AntLion ModMic records sound well.  The voice quality is not the same as that of studio microphones, but this will be enough for a game stream.  Usually this option is chosen by those who have expensive headphones, but the microphone in them is broken. </p><p>  Zalman ZM-Mic1 costs only 700 rubles.  This lapel microphone can be purchased even if the headset is fully operational, if only because the sound will be much better. </p><div class="photo" data-original="piteras.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lapel microphone" class="if uuid-3026133" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3026133.jpg"></div><h2>  Lapel Microphone Reviews </h2><p>  Stream headphones with a good microphone do not always come across.  They need to be personally tested, and there are not always funds for this.  Lapel models are controversial devices.  Few people talk about them, since everyone in advance believes that nothing good should be expected from them. </p><p>  Of course, they cannot be compared with studio condenser models, which fully implement all the ideas of the streamer.  But the lapel option may turn out to be a lifeline for those who have a broken microphone and there is no way to purchase an analogue. </p><h2>  Headphones </h2><p>  A headset for a stream with a good microphone is rarely found in the Twitch.  This is due to the fact that many get tired of large ear pads and prefer droplets.  Therefore, they acquire full-fledged microphones. </p><p>  But some gamers still use the headset on their streams.  Among the most profitable options you can find: </p><ul><li>  Sennheiser GSP 350 is a premium model with surround sound and excellent microphone quality. </li><li>  Philips SHG7980 - affordable model for streaming with good sound in the headphones and good voice recording. </li><li>  Razer Kraken Pro - classic gaming headphones.  They are very convenient, so they do not cause discomfort during prolonged use. </li></ul><p>  Each of these models is very expensive, especially when compared to buying a studio budget microphone.  For such a headset you will need from 3 thousand rubles. </p>
