    <h2>  Description of Haiti </h2><p>  In early December 1492, the indefatigable mariner and discoverer <span>Christopher Columbus</span> discovered the uncharted territory of the island of Haiti.  Then he said that "this is the most beautiful land that human eyes have seen."  After this, the arrangement begins in full swing: at first the land was given the Spanish name La Espanion, and then the inhabitants of civilized Europe gradually began to contribute to Indian culture.  The island began to bring good income to the country, life was boiling here, it would seem, carefree, with barbecue and canoe, tobacco and a hammock.  So other states began to learn about these charms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Haiti is divided into two republics today: the first has the same name, and the second - the Dominican.  The latter occupies 2/3 of the entire territory and is considered more developed and well-maintained.  The population is almost equal in both Republics, only Haiti has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã27,750 square kilometers, and the Dominican Republic - 48,730. The first capital is Port-au-Prince, and the second is Santo Domingo. </p>

    <h2>  Dominican Republic </h2><p>  As already known, most of the island of Haiti is the Dominican Republic.  It occupies the southern coast and is divided into 31 regions.  By the way, the capital (Santo Domingo) is the oldest city here. </p><p>  The second most important settlement is Santiago.  Other cities of the Republic: </p><ul><li>  La Vega. </li><li>  San Francisco de Macoris. </li><li>  San Cristobal. </li><li>  San Pedro de Macoris. </li><li>  La Romana. </li><li>  Puerto Plata. </li></ul><p>  Talk about the <span>Dominican Republic</span> is endless.  No wonder they say that it is better to see once than to hear 100 times.  Dominican Republic (Haiti) is an exotic nature, amazingly beautiful coral reefs, several hundred kilometers of white beaches, lakes with emerald water, rivers with crystal clear water and unruly waterfalls.  It has its own history, lifestyle, unique flavor and friendly population.  And by the way, the Dominican Republic is considered the most environmentally friendly place on earth.  Here, steady atmospheric pressure and a tropical climate are more comfortable than humid.  So in this area you can feel great! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Sights of the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  Many believe that, having arrived in the Dominican Republic, they can only enjoy beach vacations and sea activities.  But in fact, there are enough classes, one of which is visiting attractions.  Of course, to find historical places in this part of the island of Haiti will not work, but the nature is such that there is no other place in the world. </p><p>  Interesting to visit is the village of Altos de Chavon, which is located near Punta Cana.  It is thematic and stylized as an early colonial settlement.  The buildings here are built of stone using old technologies.  In the village there is an amphitheater, which is an exact copy of the Greek architectural structure.  The museum presents an exhibition dedicated to the pre-Columbian era.  She will tell tourists how the Arawak Indians lived before the Europeans came here. </p><p>  There is a grand museum in the capital.  It is called the ‚ÄúLighthouse of Columbus‚Äù and represents a huge territory where you can find many interesting things, including memorable places.  This large building was built in the form of a cross and is a kind of reminder that America is a Christian state.  The most important thing here is the ashes of Christopher Columbus. </p><p>  Also in Santo Domingo there is a unique museum of the kind "World of Amber".  It presents a large collection of these stones, among which there are very rare specimens.  For example, with plants and insects inside, or even blue or red. </p><p>  Another city worth visiting in Haiti is Puerta del Conde.  It was built to protect the capital, and here in 1844 proclaimed the independence of the Republic.  It is a fort today open to visitors by tourists.  Behind it is a park, this is a very important place for the patriots of the Republic.  They especially value the Altar of Freedom (a mausoleum with the founders of the Dominican Republic), which, like other elements of the park, is dedicated to the struggle for independence and freedom. </p><p>  In honor of the centenary of the recognition of the independence of the Republic, a palace was built, which today plays the role of the president‚Äôs workplace.  If you look at the photo of this building, you will notice a resemblance to the White House.  And it‚Äôs very big. </p><p>  List of a few more attractions that are recommended to visit: </p><ul><li>  Del Este National Park. </li><li>  Captain's Palace. </li><li>  The ruins of the Franciscan monastery. </li><li>  Ozama Fortress. </li><li>  The ruins of the hospital of St. Nicholas of Bari. </li><li>  Caves of Los Tress Ochos. </li><li>  Church of St. Barbara. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Weather </h2><p>  Speaking about the "behavior" of nature, one cannot but consider the question of why earthquakes often occur on the island of Haiti.  The answer is simple - in this place (that is, in the Caribbean Sea), the earth's crust is displaced and geological faults occur, because today the territory is recognized as a seismically active zone. </p><p>  One of the most powerful earthquakes occurred in 2010.  And more than once.  The first was January 12th.  The epicenter was located 15 km from the capital of the Republic of Haiti, which suffered very much, like its residents.  Then they did not give a definite answer about the number of victims - either tens, or hundreds of thousands.  Magnitude was 7-7.3 points. </p><p>  The second earthquake on the island of Haiti occurred on February 22, and again in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPort-au-Prince.  Then only 3 people were injured (according to official figures), and the magnitude was 4.7 points. </p><p>  Now about the more pleasant.  The climate here is tropical, summers are relatively humid and winters are dry.  The practical temperature of water and air does not change throughout the year.  Moreover, they are also approximately the same.  It is recommended to come to the Dominican Republic in winter, because at this time it is more comfortable here - 26-28 degrees Celsius. </p>
