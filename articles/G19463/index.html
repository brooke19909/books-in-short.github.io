Walkthrough</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This review will sequentially describe how to set up iPhone 7 when you turn it on for the first time.  At first glance, this is a rather complicated operation.  But if you fully comply with the instructions further set forth, then dealing with it will not be difficult. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gadgets.ndtv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to set up the seventh iPhone?" class="if uuid-3050858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3050858.jpg"></div><h2>  Ways to customize.  Execution order </h2><p>  Such an operation, how to configure iPhone 7 when you first turn it on, can be performed in two ways: </p><ol><li>  With help desk for an additional fee. </li><li>  Independently. </li></ol><p>  In the first case, the newly-made owner of the mobile device gives it to the service engineers for configuration, having paid for their services in advance.  He also sets out his wishes and recommendations to them, and their specialists strive to realize them as much as possible.  In the second case, the device is reconfigured without the assistance of the outside user. </p><p>  The general procedure for performing this operation consists of the following stages: </p><ol><li>  SIM card installation. </li><li>  Turn on the device. </li><li>  Setting the initial parameters. </li><li>  Formation of an account. </li><li>  Establish a network connection. </li><li>  Installation of additional application software from the Apple Store. </li></ol><h2>  SIM card.  Turning on </h2><p>  At the first stage, it is necessary to install a SIM card of a mobile operator.  Moreover, its format should be nanoSIM.  If it is large, then it must be replaced, or even a new starter pack. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Next, using a paper clip, we remove a special tray for installing the card.  Then it must be installed in it.  At the same time, we pay attention to the ‚Äúkey‚Äù - the cut-off corner of the SIM card.  It should be in the same place where a similar item is in the tray.  Also, the pads of the SIM card should be turned up.  In the next step, install the tray back into the smartphone. </p><p>  After that, you can start and turn on the iPhone 7. For this, it is enough for 2-3 seconds to hold down the power button of the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.themobileindian.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Launch and power on iPhone 7" class="if uuid-3050861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3050861.jpg"></div><h2>  The initial parameters.  Account </h2><p>  After the smartphone has finished loading, you need to enter the SIM card PIN.  The next step is to set the current values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the date, time zone, time and country of the device.  Moreover, you must specify the current data.  If this condition is not met, then some functions may not be available. </p><p>  Then you need to connect the device to the Internet.  Moreover, this operation can be implemented using cellular communications or using a Wi-Fi transmitter.  In the first case, it is enough to activate data transfer.  And in the second, you need to scan the frequency spectrum and select the one you need from the list of available connections.  After that, you will need to enter the password for the wireless network. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next, you need to create a new Apple ID account or use an existing one.  In the second case, the login is indicated along with the password, we synchronize the smartphone with the previously specified information.  If you create a new account, then you must fill in all available fields.  They need to indicate the name, date of birth and other relevant information.  Again, without creating an Apple ID account, you cannot use the Apple Store.  Actually, this is the end of this stage of how to properly configure the seventh iPhone.  It remains only to install applications for their own needs.  This operation will be discussed in the next section. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.irefone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The first inclusion or how to activate the iPhone." class="if uuid-3050862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3050862.jpg"></div><h2>  Software installation </h2><p>  As noted earlier, the installation of application software is the final step in how to configure iPhone 7 when you first turn it on.  When you run it, you must go to the Apple program store.  Then the search for the necessary software and its further installation is carried out.  At this stage, the user himself must already decide on what he wants from the smartphone.  At the end of the operation, we exit the software store. </p><p>  Actually, this ends the first inclusion or how to activate the iPhone 7 immediately after purchase.  Now you need to use a smartphone and enjoy it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gadgetguy.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to set up iPhone 7 the first time you turn it on?" class="if uuid-3050864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3050864.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Within the framework of this review, an algorithm was described for performing such an operation as setting up "iPhone 7" when it was first turned on.  Most owners of such mobile devices have developed a persistent stereotype that this is a complex operation and only specialized specialists can do it.  But actually it is not.  Apple developers initially minimized the possibility of errors during the setup process.  Therefore, even if something goes wrong and the owner makes a mistake, a hint will appear and will allow him to solve any question that has arisen. </p><p>  Therefore, it is inexpedient to pay an additional amount for initialization and software configuration of such a device.  It can be done without assistance.  At the same time, you will understand the features of your smartphone and in case of problems during its further operation, solve them yourself, and do not contact the service center.  In the latter case, again, you have to pay a large sum for solving a fairly simple question. </p>
