At least since 2011, for sure.  And today's object of our review - the telephone to which this article is devoted, will be just one of those. </p><p>  Meet the guest of today's review is the well-known iPhone 5S device.  The model, released after the 5th generation version, is its follower.  You can‚Äôt call it ‚Äúindependent‚Äù either, since the case and base were borrowed from the iPhone 5th version.  However, despite this, the device has gained the highest level of popularity and to this day continues to be actively sold in electronics supermarkets.  What is this gadget and what technical characteristics does it have, read in our article. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2>

    <p>  The model that we characterize in this article was introduced in 2013.  Despite the fact that the device looks very much like the ‚Äúfive‚Äù - the previous generation of the iPhone - the model is unique in many respects: the use of the revolutionary new 64-bit processor, the installation of a special fingerprint scanner to protect personal data and many other options made the model one of best-selling company ever. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What distinguished this gadget and what features distinguish it from the "brothers" in the lineup - read in this article. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  It's no secret that Apple pays special attention to how the device looks, what emotions it gives to the owner and what impressions it can convey.  Thanks to such a unique approach, the company's products have always been considered high-class examples of industrial usability user design.  This is confirmed by how familiar these smartphones have become for us and how millions of users around the world have ‚Äúhooked‚Äù on them. </p>

    <p>  If you know what the iPhone 5 looks like, you can imagine version 5S.  In fact, there are only two differences between the models (in design): the number of flash holes on the back side (two in the 5S version and one in the classic version on the iPhone 5);  as well as the presence of <span>a fingerprint scanner</span> instead of the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button.  If on the ‚Äúfive‚Äù we can see a gray rounded rectangle in place of the last one, symbolizing the ability to go to the home page and <span>minimize all windows,</span> then on the 5S model there is a round sapphire crystal framed by a shiny decorative ring. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A finger scanner is installed at this place, which recognizes whether the fingerprint image belongs to its owner or not.  This option has become (at one time) a subject of serious discussion, because, according to experts, such access by Apple to the ‚Äúbase‚Äù of fingerprints is a serious blow to the policy regarding confidential and private information about a person. </p>

    <p>  Regarding the appearance of the smartphone, there is nothing more to add - all other elements of the case were borrowed from the previous, fifth generation. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  As already noted, a revolutionary new 64-bit processor developed by Apple is installed on this version of the device.  Paired with it is the <span>PowerVR G6430</span> graphics processor <span>,</span> which is able to ‚Äúfly‚Äù even when working with ‚Äúbulky‚Äù game graphics. </p><p>  The clock frequency of the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the device is 1.3 GHz;  RAM - 1 GB. </p><p>  Physical memory is offered in different volumes, depending on what kind of modification is involved.  There are versions with 16, 32 and 64 GB on sale - these are indicators that indicate how much free space will be on your <span>Apple iPhone</span> 5s. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display, which is installed on Apple technology, has always been the epitome of technology and wide capabilities (which, in principle, can be said about all the company's products).  The same goes for the iPhone 5S version.  Its technical parameters are as follows: iPhone 5s <span>screen resolution</span> in pixels is 640 by 1136, the physical diagonal size is 4 inches.  Note that the 5S version is the last on which such a small display is installed - the next, the 6th generation was presented with an enlarged screen, which was also met with noticeable criticism from the company's fans. </p>

    <p>  You know what screen resolution the iPhone 5S has and what the physical dimensions of its display are.  Based on these indicators, we can conclude that the pixel density on the device is 326 dots per square inch.  Given that the display is made using IPS LCD technology, we can safely say about its colorful picture and brightness, saturated colors.  Given the iPhone 5S screen resolution, the image reproduces the display amazingly clearly and sharply: even the most demanding smartphone specialist will have no reason to criticize the device. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The phone is equipped with a battery with a capacity of 1560 mAh.  Given the small (compared to more modern models) iPhone 5S screen resolution, as well as the high level of optimization of the phone‚Äôs charge, we can talk about a fairly long autonomous (on a single charge) operation - almost 10-hour period of time in the active mode.  Tests show that in standby mode the device can last up to 10 days. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  We talked a little about the processor;  about the iPhone 5S screen resolution, about the battery and battery life of the device.  Now we can note the work of an 8-megapixel camera, capable of taking very colorful and accurate photos.  Apple technology has always been known for its responsible approach to camera optics on its devices and to the quality of the resulting image.  As in the case when we analyzed the screen resolution of the iPhone 5S, the description of the image processing system of the device contains indications of a lot of advantages with respect to other iPhones and other devices from the ‚Äútop‚Äù segment. </p><p>  This may include, for example, face recognition technology and further image correction in such a way as to obtain a photo in the best quality.  Even the flash that is installed on the iPhone 5S (the screen resolution of which we have already characterized) has True Tone technology, supposedly making the photo even more ‚Äúalive‚Äù even in poor lighting conditions. </p><h2>  Software </h2>

    <p>  Despite the fact that today Android is at the peak of its popularity (Android is the dominant operating system in the smartphone market), Apple is not far behind, offering its fans a more advanced iOS7 OS in some issues.  Today, however, this version is considered obsolete - but at the time of the release of the iPhone 5S (the screen resolution of which you already know) it was the seventh generation that was the last released by Apple. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Traditionally, Apple's technology does not have support for two SIM cards.  The company followed the same policy when releasing the iPhone 5S smartphone (the screen resolution and other technical parameters of which were already described earlier).  Nevertheless, the smartphone has all the necessary systems and functionality at that time, which includes access to Wi-Fi, GPS, work with NFC-technology, Bluetooth-interface and much more.  The latter, by the way, makes it possible to use the gadget as a tool for making payments through iPay technology and working with the phone as a portable electronic wallet with all your payment cards and funds. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  The model clearly broke records of popularity: today, most users prefer the iPhone 5S version, and there are several reasons for this.  The first is the price.  An older model obviously costs a lot less, which makes the device more affordable for everyone.  With the advent of new generations, the price of this device will fall even more, which will affect the further growth of its popularity until Apple completely closes the production of these devices and their delivery. </p>

    <p>  Secondly, this is the high build quality of the phone and its manufacturability, which confirms the review of the Apple iPhone 5S, (we examined the characteristics in detail). </p><p>  As user reviews indicate, the device constantly pleases its owner, does not glitch and does not freeze, shows the most smooth and smooth operation.  Most of the comments that we managed to find about the model are exclusively positive.  Consumers praise the phone for various criteria. </p>
