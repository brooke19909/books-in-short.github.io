  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Anomalous zones. The logic of the unusual</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On the surface of planet Earth there are many areas that cause not only a lot of questions among ordinary people, but also put scientists in a difficult position.  While human rumor ascribes to these sites the title of black spots, the concept of "anomalous zone" has been strengthened among researchers, journalists, and even some natural scientists.  The general similarity of the parts of the <span>earth's surface that</span> fall under this definition is that for a long time various unexplained and mysterious phenomena occur on their territory that do not agree with the conclusions of official science or are uncharacteristic of this area.  Anomalous zones of the Earth have such ominous nicknames as damned or damn places.  Sensible people avoid them; for adventurers and researchers, they become objects of increased attention.  Birds and animals bypass these places, even the vegetation in such areas is very different from endemic. </p><p>  Anomalous zones have common features, by which it is already possible to rank one or another part of the terrain among them.  First of all, in an unusual area, if not a violation of the course of time, then its other perception is observed.  The influence of zones on emotional natures can provoke a feeling of sadness, <span>fear, panic</span> in the latter <span>.</span>  Prolonged stay in such a zone can cause <span>poor health,</span> weakness, and weakness. </p><p>  The largest anomalous zones of the world are the so-called devil's belt.  Five places that have not received a very good reputation and, accordingly, ominous nicknames, have an equal distance from each other and are located along the thirtieth degree of northern latitude.  <span>Bermuda Triangle,</span> Gibraltar Wedge, Afghan Anomalous Zone, Devil's Sea, Hawaiian Anomaly are notorious.  Among the last signs characterizing the anomalous zones is the ufological activity in their area. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The patterns that accompany the world's largest anomalous zones, suggest the existence of other sites, less known.  There is a hypothesis that the manifestation of abnormality in some areas is associated with the internal structure of the planet‚Äôs core. </p><p>  Proponents of this hypothesis see <span>the Earth's core</span> as a growing crystal.  Its unusual shape in the form of an icosahedron (spatial figure with twenty faces) and a dodecahedron (12-faceted), which are embedded in each other, affects the processes occurring on the surface of the planet.  The vertices and centers of the edges of these figures are the so-called nodes.  Among them, a certain hierarchy is observed.  There is a basic system of faces and nodes, as well as subsystems of various orders.  It is precisely with the edges and nodes of the icosahedral-dodecahedral structure of the Earth‚Äôs core (ISS) that various geological anomalies are inextricably linked.  Among them are faults in the earth's crust, and mineral deposits, and areas of tectonic activity, and various gravitational and <span>magnetic anomalies.</span> </p><p>  In the nodes of the IDSZ are centers of origin of the largest human cultures.  The development of civilization also occurs in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthese sites. </p><p>  But this is not the only attempt to explain the existence of anomalous zones.  There is an energy theory according to which the earth's surface is covered with a grid with cell sizes of several meters.  Its effect on biological organisms can be both positive and negative.  On the territory of your apartment you can have one or more nodes of each sign.  To find them, use a method known since ancient times.  As an indicator device, a twig of a vine is used, a more advanced version is a frame.  But the human operator remains the main link in such a study; without it, neither the vine, nor the frame, nor the bead on the string react in any way to the influence of <span>geopathic zones.</span> </p><p>  But there are patches of terrain showing the characteristics of the anomalous, which are the creations of human hands.  These include the locations of high-voltage power lines, the location of nuclear power plants and areas contaminated with radiation, cemeteries, the underground communications network, and various landfills. </p><p>  Knots are also observed at quarrels and conflicts, at the locations of paintings, books, photographs, masks, figurines, jewelry, and even in uncleaned apartments and in uncleaned laundry. </p>
