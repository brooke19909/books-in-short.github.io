    <p>  As for the furniture and appliances in the rooms, they are not new.  But everything is in good and working condition.  If something goes wrong, then contact the reception.  Malfunctions will be resolved quickly enough. </p><h2>  Check-in, cleaning </h2><p>  As our compatriots note, administrators of Sofitel Taba Height 5 *, as a rule, do not seek to accommodate newly arrived guests before two in the afternoon.  Therefore, if you plan to arrive at the hotel in the morning, then be prepared for the fact that you will need to wait for check-in.  However, this does not mean that you have to patiently sit near the reception.  So, you can go for breakfast or lunch, change clothes and swim in the pool or go straight to the beach.  You can leave your things at the reception. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  As for the cleaning of the rooms, almost all the guests were satisfied with its quality.  According to them, thanks to the efforts of the cleaners in the apartments it was always clean.  True, here no one will twist you figures of towels in the form of swans, etc. But this is fully compensated by the quality of cleaning. </p><h2>  Territory, location </h2><p>  As for the own territory of Sofitel Taba Heights <span>5 * (Taba, Egypt),</span> then it is very large, well-groomed, clean and beautiful.  There are a lot of blooming greenery, palm trees, nice places for walks and photo shoots.  In addition, the hotel offers stunning views of the lights of Jordan and Saudi Arabia in the evenings.  Tourists enjoyed this spectacle with pleasure. </p><p>  As for the location, people who prefer a measured rest without having to visit nightclubs every day, liked the location of the hotel.  After all, Sofitel Taba Heights 5 *, the reviews of which we are considering, is located at some distance from large cities.  But the location of the hotel is very convenient for those who want to go on an excursion to Israel. </p><p>  Some domestic tourists also complained about the fact that Russian tour operators do not offer direct flights to Taba.  So, almost all travelers are forced to get here from Sharm El Sheikh Airport.  And this makes the path quite long and difficult.  Indeed, on the road you have to spend about 3.5-4 hours. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In general, most tourists in their reviews showed unanimity regarding this issue.  So, in their opinion, the food in Sofitel Taba Height 5 *, although not bad, is still somewhat less than the level of a five-star hotel.  According to our compatriots, they would like to see a wider selection of dishes offered in the restaurant.  Of course, no one was left hungry here.  After all, there were always on hand dishes from meat, fish, chicken, side dishes, snacks, salads, fresh vegetables, fruits, pastries and desserts.  But still, many travelers expected a little more from a five-star hotel. </p>

    <p>  As for the bars, tourists were generally satisfied with their work.  Of the drinks, many praise the local beer and the cocktails offered at the bars.  But the quality of red wine, some guests were not satisfied. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Since almost all tourists come to Egypt for an excellent beach holiday, this issue plays a very important role in choosing a hotel.  As for the hotel complex Sofitel Taba Height 5 * under consideration, then, according to our compatriots who have visited here, lovers should swim in the warm sea and bask in the gentle sunshine.  So, the hotel is located just 50 meters from its own large sandy beach.  As tourists note, sun loungers and parasols are abundant and enough for everyone.  So the guests will not have to get up early in the morning and run ashore to take a deck chair.  On the beach Sofitel Taba Heights 5 * (Egypt, Taba) there is a bar and a Bedouin cafe, where you can comfortably arrange on soft pillows and smoke a hookah. </p><p>  As for entering the water, according to travelers, stones are found at the bottom.  However, there is a site where you can enter the sea along the sandy bottom.  Therefore, in general, rubber shoes will not be superfluous, but you can do without it too.  Also on the beach there is a pier along which you can go down to the depths. </p><p>  Near the coast there is a small coral reef.  Its inhabitants are not as bright and varied as, for example, in Sharm el-Sheikh, however, armed with a mask for snorkeling, you can quite admire the funny marine inhabitants. </p>
