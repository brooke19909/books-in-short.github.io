Favorite music can play in a new way with a high-quality <span>speaker system.</span>  Favorite musical compositions will significantly reduce travel time.  <span>High-quality acoustic</span> equipment is indispensable in the event that a person spends a large amount of time in the car. </p><h2>  Main advantages </h2><p>  Experts do not recommend ignoring bass from the front speakers.  Front speakers should reproduce high-quality bass, regardless of how well the rear speakers and subwoofer work.  The sound of the entire acoustics system in the car is provided by the front speakers.  Therefore, the purity and sound reproduction will depend on the front speakers.  Ideally, the front speakers and subwoofer are best purchased from an expensive series. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.auto-magnitola.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Acoustics in a car" class="if uuid-2509774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2509774.jpg"></div><p>  As for the rear speakers, you can save on them.  When choosing acoustics, you should pay attention to resistance.  This indicator for the car radio should not be less than 3 ohms.  For external amplifiers, the indicator does not matter much.  For the Fokal acoustic diffuser, pressed cardboard with VDO-impregnation is used.  Soft rubber is used for suspension. </p><h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  The system has an external crossover, which is an excellent sign of high-quality acoustics.  However, this affects the overall damping coefficient.  If the acoustics work on an external amplifier, this will not affect the sound quality.  The presence of an external crossover negatively affects only the speakers working directly from the GU. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.crutchfield.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car speakers" class="if uuid-2509791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2509791.jpg"></div><p>  Acoustics Focal receives praise from users because speakers produce high-quality sound, have high power and sensitivity. </p><h2>  Speaker Features </h2><p>  <span>"Fokal" occupies a leading position in the market, so it is deservedly in great demand.</span>  <span>However, potential buyers should be careful, because there are many fakes.</span>  <span>Before you make a purchase, you need to decide what it will be - component or coaxial.</span>  <span>The component system consists of 2 or 3 speakers.</span>  <span>In Focal acoustics, all speakers are separated.</span>  <span>They reproduce various BHs on separate devices and do not interfere with each other in physical terms.</span>  <span>In the</span> manufacture of component acoustics, the most high-quality technological processes are involved.  The package includes special crossovers of the highest quality.  Focal <span>speakers</span> for cars provide flexible options for users to place in the cabin.  However, the installation of such an installation is more difficult than coaxial. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.auto-magnitola.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car acoustics" class="if uuid-2509772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2509772.jpg"></div><p>  Coaxial acoustics include from two or more components oriented to different frequencies.  Users note that the system is easy to mount, and also highlight the presence of midrange, treble and bass radiation from one point.  However, car speakers Focal does not allow you to change the angle of the tweeter.  Therefore, this version of acoustics can serve as an auxiliary for the entire audio system.  Acoustic installation is quite simple during installation, which is an indisputable advantage. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Overview of Technical Parameters </h2><p>  Among the main parameters of the Fokal acoustics are the following: </p><ul><li>  the case for the speakers is made of <span>ABS</span> plastic <span>, to which a certain percentage of fiberglass is added (typical for low-cost models);</span> </li><li>  <span>diffusers are made of black fiberglass;</span> </li><li>  <span>lack of o-rings;</span> </li><li>  <span>the grill frame is mounted directly to the bottom;</span> </li><li>  <span>the presence of a medium-sized magnet up to 84 mm;</span> </li><li>  <span>sound-absorbing rings;</span> </li><li>  tweeters have a reverse dome made of aluminum alloy, it can rotate around the axis of the rack, but is usually tilted to the axis of the midbass; </li><li>  the filter capacitor is hidden inside the rack; </li><li>  holistic sound that provides the opportunity to feel every instrument; </li><li>  excellent bass quality, which stands out especially in the overall sound; </li><li>  distortion is present in bass in the working range; </li><li>  high sensitivity of acoustics; </li><li>  power is from 100 to 200 W; </li><li>  the diffuser is made of composite material; </li><li>  using a parametric crossover. </li></ul><h2>  How to install </h2><p>  Usually motorists install acoustics in regular places, which saves money, time and factory design of the car.  You can also install speakers in the door to the podium.  Thus, you can set the speakers of great depth and diameter.  Speakers are installed in other prepared places, which will achieve high quality sound and original appearance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.head-fi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Acoustics in a car" class="if uuid-2509797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2509797.jpg"></div><p>  Before installation, ensure that the mounting surface is level.  Motorists will need to perform acoustic door processing.  Therefore, it is necessary to remove unwanted overtones, soundproof the doors, and also create an acoustic design for front speakers.  The area on <span>which the speaker is installed must not have holes.</span>  <span>Otherwise, the user will not be able to hear high-quality bass.</span> </p><p>  Users say that with improper installation of acoustics, it is impossible to improve other components of the audio system.  Front speakers form the overall sound of the audio system.  Acoustic Focal is characterized by high sensitivity of the speakers.  Therefore, the speakers work perfectly from the head unit, and the installation of an additional amplifier is not required. </p><h2>  Focal - floor acoustics </h2><p>  ‚ÄúFocal‚Äù is perfectly balanced, and the sound contains convincing macrodynamics, which is necessary for energetic genres.  F <span>ocal</span> floor acoustics <span>is characterized by tonal diversity with the highest detail.</span>  <span>Many users have noted exemplary tweeter performance.</span>  <span>Particularly natural in the performance of this system are trebleants.</span>  <span>Therefore, users can hear the smallest details of the sound atmosphere.</span>  <span>The bass register is distinguished by its depth and excellent sophistication.</span>  <span>Focal floor acoustics amazes with the volume of sound space.</span>  <span>Users recommend plugging the bass reflex with a foam plug when using speakers with a subwoofer.</span>  <span>This will get rid of additional overtones.</span> </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Acoustics Focal for many years demonstrates a competent approach to solving non-trivial problems in the field of sound.  The sound of the speaker system captivates users with dynamism, balance, expressiveness and tonality.  Acoustics "Fokal" is characterized by a wealth of musical colors and high-quality sound.  Creative technical solutions have created a unique speaker system that impresses with surround sound.  Among other speakers, the Fokal stands out for its high sensitivity and large power reserve. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crutchfield.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quality speakers" class="if uuid-2509787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2509787.jpg"></div><p>  The manufacturer is constantly introducing new solutions for the integration of high-quality sound.  High-quality materials, modern technology are the main components of the Fokal speaker system. </p>
