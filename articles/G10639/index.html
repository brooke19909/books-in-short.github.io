Salzach, has many historical and architectural attractions, among which its magnificent palaces and castles.  Salzburg is beautiful and unique. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="47.80949" data-lng="13.055010000000038" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/4/4/5/15445.png"></div><h2>  General information about the city </h2><p>  This city is well known in the world of music as the birthplace of V.A. Mozart.  This fame is reflected in such attractions as the museum located in the house where the great composer was born, as well as in various festivals dedicated to his work.  The Salzach River, flowing out of the Salzburg Alps, flows through the expanses of the land on which stands the majestic Untersberg (a mountain range 1 853 meters high).  An unforgettable panorama of the city with its palaces, castles and towers with domes opens from its top. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Salzburg" class="if uuid-3134794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3134794.jpg"></div><p>  The following is the famous fortress and some of the castles of Salzburg. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hohensalzburg Fortress </h2><p>  Hohensalzburg, which is one of the largest medieval fortresses in Europe, is a symbol of Salzburg.  It is located on Mount Festunsberg, and was built in 1077 by order of Prince Archbishop Gebhard I. Its height is 250 meters, its width is 150 meters. The castle is located on the top of a 120-meter mountain, near Salzburg.  It was originally built in the Romanesque style, but today only the foundation has been preserved from that castle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goodfon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hohensalzburg Fortress" class="if uuid-3134791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3134791.jpg"></div><p>  The castle in Salzburg on the mountain was rebuilt and strengthened several times, and eventually turned into a powerful fortress.  She acquired her current appearance in the 16th century.  For the first time in the world, the Ruiszug funicular was installed in this castle, which was intended for the delivery of various goods. </p><p>  Throughout its long history, the Hohensalzburg fortress has not submitted to any of the enemies besieging it.  Only during the Napoleonic Wars had to surrender without a fight.  Subsequently, these structures began to be used as warehouses and barracks.  It was used as a prison at the beginning of the twentieth century.  The Nazis and Italian prisoners of war were kept in it. </p><h2>  Castle in Salzburg on the mountain </h2><p>  What is the name of the castle built on a hill height of 155 meters?  This is Hohenwerfen Castle, located near the Austrian city of Werfen (Salzburg Land).  At one time he had defensive significance for Salzburg - the main city of this land.  It is a completely impregnable fortress located between the forested hills.  The river Salzach flows here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="airfreshener.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hohenwerfen Castle" class="if uuid-3134807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3134807.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the castle began in the 11th century.  Subsequently, it was rebuilt, expanded and strengthened.  Thick walls were built in the castle and special recesses were created for the installation of artillery weapons.  Hohenwerfen Castle Salzburg more than once changed owners, was conquered by the French army of Napoleon, burned. </p><p>  In the XX century, for fifty years, it was used as a training camp for local police officers.  Today it has the status of a museum.  From the height of the funicular that takes visitors to the castle, amazing views of the building and its surroundings open up. </p><h2>  Mauterndorf Castle </h2><p>  Among the castles of Salzburg, this one belongs to the magnificent architectural creations of the Middle Ages.  Since 1023, the entire territory surrounded by the current castle became the property of the bishop of Salzburg.  In 1253, construction began on the building as a defensive structure against enemies.  Initially, it was a four-story building, including a prison and fortress walls.  Over time, towers and another fortress wall were added to the castle.  For about a hundred years, it has been rebuilt and expanded more than once.  The walls were decorated with emblems and frescoes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bergliebe.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mauterndorf Castle" class="if uuid-3134812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3134812.jpg"></div><p>  Since the beginning of the XIX century, the castle became the property of the state, but was soon bought by Hermann von Epenstein (a doctor from Berlin), after whose death the widow of his building was donated to Hermann Goering. </p><p>  The palace was again transferred to city ownership in 1968, and today it houses a museum.  The interior of the castle is richly decorated with stucco.  The chapel of Henry II is decorated with frescoes made in the XIV century.  They depict the Virgin Mary in the process of coronation. </p><h2>  Helbrunn Castle </h2><p>  Another attraction of Austria is the Salzburg castle called Hellbrunn.  It is located six kilometers from the city (south).  At the beginning of the XVII century, Prince Marcus Sitticus von Hohenems, who received the rights to rule the country, decided to build a residence.  Being a fan of Italian culture, he decided to build his country palace in a luxurious Italian style.  And until now, this magnificent structure is a significant example of architecture dating back to the Renaissance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hellbrunn.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Helbrunn Castle" class="if uuid-3134828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3134828.jpg"></div><p>  For the construction, a picturesque place was chosen - a plot at the very foot of Mount Hellbrunn.  In this blessed place, everything is fragrant; nearby are numerous sources and springs.  Among the dense greenery of the park are the famous Fun Fountains, whose streams and jets of water appear unexpectedly and in different places, enthralling visitors.  For about 400 years, these fountains amuse and delight guests of the palace. </p><p>  It should be noted that this beautiful Salzburg castle throughout its history has never been used as an official residence, since the originality of its entertainment and the luxury of the building itself was more conducive to fun celebrations.  Since the 18th century, park alleys have been supplemented with statues of ancient gods and mythical heroes. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  From almost anywhere in the city of Salzburg, one can view the magnificent fortress of Hohensalzburg, and from the height of the fortress itself overlooks the beautiful Alps on the one hand and magnificent palaces and castles that adorn the city landscapes on the other. </p>
