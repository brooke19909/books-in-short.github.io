Some come here for the sake of profitable shopping, others seek to see unusual and very interesting sights, while others dream of just having a great rest on the always warm South China Sea.  We invite you to have a wonderful time on the largest Chinese island of Hainan at Infinity Ocean Beach Resort 4 *.  The reviews about this hotel are mixed.  Someone here liked everything, but someone found some flaws.  Note that Chinese 4-star hotels are slightly different from those in European countries, which must be taken into account when choosing a tour.  But Hainan Island itself, the Bay of Pure Water, where the hotel is located, will certainly not leave anyone indifferent.  The mild climate, fantastically beautiful nature, wonderful beaches, lots of entertainment - all this awaits those who choose this amazing place for relaxation.  And the hotel staff will try to create all conditions so that tourists will certainly want to return here again. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Infinity ocean beach resort 4 hainan reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2105520.jpg"></div>

Some tour operators are positioning him as a five-star, but in reality he has four stars.  This hotel began to take tourists in 2012, so everything here is still in fairly good condition.

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In Infinity Ocean Beach Resort 4 * food, according to Russian tourists, is based only on the principles of traditional Chinese cuisine, which is not suitable for all Russians.  Most tours to this hotel are only offered with breakfast included in the room rate.  Breakfast is served in a beautiful restaurant.  Opinions on the quality of dishes are different, which depends on the individual preferences of each person.  Every day, the menu has a lot of salads, several types of side dish (mainly rice with various sauces), sausages, corn, eggs, fruits.  From drinks you can take tea, coffee or water.  Tourists can have lunch and breakfast in one of the many cafes located nearby.  Unfortunately, in each of them, information about food and ingredients is written in Chinese.  Only in some cafes photos of dishes are attached to the description. </p><h2>  Hotel for children </h2><p>  A lot of tourists come with children on holiday to China to Hainan Island with their children.  Reviews of the service for babies, which provides Infinity Ocean Beach Resort 4 *, are very restrained.  On the territory for young guests is equipped with a playground with various slides and swings.  Guestrooms provide cots upon request.  That, perhaps, is all that is here for the children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Infinity Ocean Beach Resort 4 Entertainment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2105452.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure for adults </h2><p>  In Infinity Ocean Beach Resort 4 * entertainment for young people and older people is more diverse than for kids.  It features a spacious outdoor pool.  Unfortunately, the installation of sunbeds around it is not provided.  Beach towels are also not provided.  Swimming in the pool is allowed only in special swimming caps.  Sports enthusiasts have free access to the fitness center, which has modern sports equipment.  Guests can relax in the sauna or in the massage room.  All those who want to experience the healing effects of Chinese herbs are waiting for folk healers.  They are taken in a separate treatment center.  Animations and discos in the described hotel are not provided, but there is a cinema hall where popular films are shown every day. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  It's no secret that for the sake of a wonderful warm sea, many tourists go to Infinity Ocean Beach Resort 4 *.  The beach from the hotel is only a hundred meters, which is reported by many tour operators.  In fact, it is, but there is no direct road to the coast.  To get to the beach, hotel guests must follow the road surrounding several villas.  As a result, the path to the sea takes 12-15 minutes.  On Hainan Island in the Bay of Pure Water, the beach is amazing.  It is municipal, but very clean.  Here, even at the peak of the season, there is not a large concentration of people, because the length of the coastline is very large.  Therefore, you can always find a quiet cozy corner.  Sun loungers and parasols are not here, vacationers are located right on the sand.  They are unusual because they know how to ‚Äúsing‚Äù with every movement of golden grains of sand.  The water in the sea near the coast is always clear, there are almost no waves.  This is the best place to relax with young children.  But for those who love long-distance swimming, this beach may seem boring, as local rescuers very eagerly perform their duties and do not allow far to go far from the coast.  Otherwise, they not only begin to give signals, forcing violators to return to the permitted territory, but they also call the police. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Infinity Ocean Beach Resort 4 Beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2105433.jpg"></div>

Some tourists like the original Chinese culture, nature, architecture of these cities and towns, while others find it all not very interesting.  There are especially many negative reviews that everything here is only in Chinese, and local residents hardly even speak English, which causes some difficulties with communication and mutual understanding.
