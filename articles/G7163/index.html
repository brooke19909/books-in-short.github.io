  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russia in the 17th century</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the 17th century, Russia was in conditions of increasing the importance of labor of the serf population, the completion of the formation of a nationwide single market, and the geographical specialization of territories.  Zemsky cathedrals were no longer attached as much importance as before.  Prerequisites were formed for the development of an absolute monarchy. </p><p>  However, Russia in the 17th century still remains "rebellious."  Often there are large-scale popular performances. </p><p>  Russia's foreign political development in the 17th century began with state intervention in the Thirty Years War. </p><p>  This century, historians are conventionally divided into two stages.  At the first stage, Russia in the 17th century, first of all, overcame the Time of Troubles.  At the second stage, the preconditions for conducting the Petrine reforms began to take shape. </p><p>  The newly elected Tsar Mikhail Romanov arranged all social strata.  But it should be noted that the real power was in the hands of his father - Metropolitan Filaret - for a long time.  Russia in the 17th century was to overcome the consequences of the Time of Troubles.  It was this task that was entrusted to the king. </p><p>  A system of orders was used to carry out central control, while in places the elected elders were replaced by governors from the center.  The army was based on nobles.  For their service, they received land allotments with the peasants.  But, in connection with the flight of the latter during the Time of Troubles, estates were not particularly valuable.  The government, increasing the search term for the fugitives, is transferring the investigation files to the Robbery order.  From that moment, the flight of the peasant from the estate was a criminal offense. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the middle of the century there was a need to systematize existing laws.  A special commission was convened for this.  As a result, in 1649 the <span>Council Code</span> was adopted <span>, which</span> completed the establishment of serfdom.  Thus, the search for the fugitives became indefinite, the state of the serf - hereditary.  In addition, some articles strengthened royal power.  Thus, the estate-representative monarchy became absolute.  Absolutism was based on the peasant community and the nobility. </p><p>  During the reign of Alexei Mikhailovich, the Zemsky Sobor ceases to gather, the <span>Boyar Duma</span> loses its significance.  The tsar identifies especially trusted persons (the nearest Duma), but makes decisions independently. </p><p>  Industrial development is characterized by the emergence of manufactories, the division of labor.  Machines are used in production.  Wage labor is also used (workers were mainly from black-and-white and serf peasants). </p><p>  The government made attempts to modernize the country by the middle of the century.  Modernization was understood as changes in various spheres of life aimed at strengthening absolutism and serfdom.  Transformations were supposed to strengthen the tax and military-technical development of the state.  These were the changes in the social, economic, spiritual and domestic political sphere that characterize the 17th century. </p><p>  Russia over the course of this century was able to expand its territory.  So, Tsar Alexey Mikhailovich annexed Ukraine (Little Russia) to the state.  At that time, Zaporizhzhya Cossacks revolted in Ukraine led by Khmelnitsky.  The uprising turned into a people's war.  Fearing subsequent military battles with the Turks and Poles, the rebels asked for help from Russia.  In 1653, <span>Left-Bank Ukraine</span> was annexed <span>.</span>  This provoked a war with <span>the Commonwealth.</span>  The fighting ended in recognition of the accession of Little Russia.  In addition, Russia received back Smolensk, and in 1686 - Kiev. </p><p>  Failure befell the Russian state in the Russian-Swedish war, as well as in the <span>Crimean campaigns.</span>  But, along with this, the East Siberian territories were annexed, access to the Pacific Ocean was made, and the border with China was also established. </p>
