Not all banks in the Russian market adhere to such a policy, which means the lender is interested in expanding the client base. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="kredit-nsk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="loan processing" class="if uuid-2980803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2980803.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, Vostochny offers several lending options.  Each of the products is a unique loan, which is developed taking into account the needs of one of the population categories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Lending programs </h2><p>  Consumer credit at Vostochny Bank is presented in several versions, which allows the borrower to choose the most favorable condition for himself. </p><p>  Loans are divided into unsecured loans and those that require compulsory collateral.  In the second case, it is necessary to provide documents for the object. </p><p>  Bank loans "Vostochny": </p><ul><li>  cash loan (standard program); </li><li>  program "Cash loan 3.1"; </li><li>  "Great season"; </li><li>  secured by real estate; </li><li>  on the security of the car; </li><li>  "Big money"; </li><li>  "Equal payment"; </li><li>  "Seasonal"; </li><li>  "Pension"; </li><li>  car loan; </li><li>  mortgage loan; </li><li>  refinancing a mortgage agreement. </li></ul><p>  The choice of a loan is the prerogative of the client.  The interest rate, decision-making speed and amount depend on the program. </p><h2>  Cash loan at Vostochny Bank </h2><p>  A classic product in the line of credit - a cash loan.  It is offered to customers who plan to gradually pay off debt.  Therefore, the minimum loan repayment period is 37 months, the maximum loan is approved for 60 months. </p><p>  Other parameters: </p><ol><li>  Interest rate from 11.5% to 24.9% per annum. </li><li>  Issue only in rubles on the day of treatment. </li><li>  Decision on the application - within 24 hours. </li><li>  Amount - from 150 thousand rubles to 3 million rubles. </li></ol><p>  The interest rate on a cash loan at Vostochny Bank is calculated individually.

It is taken into account from the moment of issuing a loan to the date of repayment of obligations. </li><li>  Russian citizenship. </li><li>  At least 3 months of experience for persons not older than 21 years, for the rest - at least 1 year. </li></ul><p>  Documents for obtaining a loan: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  passport of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  SNILS; </li><li>  certificate of income 2-PIT; </li><li>  additional document: certificate in the form of a bank, driver‚Äôs license, passport, etc. </li></ul><p>  To obtain a loan, the bank is entitled to request other additional documents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="bank loan oriental reviews" class="if uuid-2975339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2975339.jpg"></div><p>  A copy of the work book is needed if the loan amount exceeds 500 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Features of "Cash Loan 3.1" </h2><p>  Reviews of the loan at Vostochny Bank according to version 3.1 indicate a quick decision on granting a loan.  All customers note that the decision on the application comes within 1 hour, at least 30 minutes. </p><p>  A feature of this loan is the speed of receipt and a minimum of documents.  To apply for a loan, it is enough to provide only a Russian passport.  But if the client wants to get a minimum interest rate, he must provide information on income. </p><p>  Loan conditions: </p><ul><li>  It is issued on the card of the Vostochny bank. </li><li>  Interest rate - from 14.9% per annum to 22.7% (for cash expenses).  Interest on non-cash transactions may reach 55% per annum. </li><li>  Loan amount - from 50 to 500 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Only in Russian rubles. </li><li>  Free internet banking. </li></ul><p>  Of the documents required passport of the Russian Federation.  But as an additional proof of income, the client can provide the following: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  certificate 2-personal income tax; </li><li>  a document in the form of a bank; </li><li>  account statement with salary or monthly turnover of at least 20 thousand rubles; </li><li>  statement from a foreign bank account; </li><li>  extract from the personal account of the FIU; </li><li>  accumulative insurance agreement in the amount of at least 1 million rubles; </li><li>  borrower life insurance contract in the amount of 150 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  The interest rate is individual for each borrower and depends on the number of documents submitted, the amount of the loan and the reliability of the client. </p><h2>  Big Season Program </h2><p>  A new type of loan that allows you to get a large amount at a fixed interest rate.  "Big season" is a loan of up to 1 million rubles under two documents.  The decision on the application is made quickly - up to 8 hours. </p><p>  Features of the program "Big Season": </p><ol><li>  The interest rate of 11.5% per annum is fixed. </li><li>  Loan amount - from 80 thousand rubles to 1 million </li><li>  Issued in rubles. </li><li>  Upon request, registration of insurance to protect the life and work capacity of the borrower. </li><li>  It is provided for a period of 13 to 60 months. </li></ol><p>  Of the documents required only a passport of the Russian Federation and a certificate 2-NDFL.  But the bank has the right to require the provision of additional certificates if the loan amount is more than 200 thousand rubles or the solvency of the client is in doubt. </p><h2>  Loan secured by real estate: reviews </h2><p>  In the "East" Bank, you can arrange 2 types of loans with collateral.  One of them requires real estate security. </p><p>  The difference between this type of loan from the rest are large amounts to issue.  The borrower can receive up to 30 million rubles in cash.  Moreover, the loan term is much longer than most loans - up to 20 years. </p><p>  Reviews on the loan of Vostochny Bank secured by real estate on the Net are positive.  The loan is issued quickly, interest on the loan is transparent, convenient terms for repaying funds. </p><p>  Main parameters: </p><ul><li>  Amount from 300 thousand rubles to 30 million </li><li>  Mandatory collateral - property.  In this case, the pledgor may be another person (not the borrower). </li><li>  Loan term - from 1.1 years to 20 years. </li><li>  Individual interest rate.  On average 9.9% per annum. </li><li>  The decision on the application is active within 45 days. </li><li>  Mandatory registration of collateral property insurance (by law). </li></ul><p>  The requirements for the borrower are the same as for all loans of Vostochny Bank.  But as an exception, the age limits can be shifted after a positive decision by the bank's management. </p><p>  In addition, the requirements for seniority are also reduced: at least 3 months of cumulative seniority at the last place of employment are required. </p><p>  A loan can be used as a guarantee, but this is not mandatory.  The presence of a guarantor significantly increases the chances of approving and providing a favorable interest rate on a loan.  The guarantor is subject to the same requirements as the main borrower. </p><p>  From the documents you need to provide a passport of the Russian Federation and a certificate of ownership of housing.  If the borrower and the pledgor are not one person, everyone must provide an identity document. </p><p>  Special requirements are imposed on the pledged property.  It cannot be owned by a minor owner, housing should not be built before 1998 and located in a closed territory.  A complete list of restrictions is available on the Vostochny Bank website. </p><h2>  Credit secured by a car </h2><p>  Another type of secured loan is a loan secured by a car.  The advantage of the contract is the absence of compulsory insurance of the pledged property and its ownership by the owner during the entire loan repayment period. </p><p>  Reviews on cash loans at Vostochny Bank with a pledged vehicle are only positive.  Customers appreciate the quick decision making, namely within 1 day.  They also note that the lack of compulsory insurance saves payers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kobelkov-ilya.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank reviews oriental cash loan" class="if uuid-2978009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2978009.jpg"></div><p>  Lending terms: </p><ul><li>  The rate is from 19 to 32% per annum.  Installed individually for each borrower. </li><li>  The term of the loan agreement is from 1 to 5 years. </li><li>  You can issue from 100 thousand rubles to 1 million. </li><li>  The object of the pledge is a car that falls under category B. </li></ul><p>  The main requirements are for the vehicle, namely: </p><ol><li>  Age not older than 3-10 years (depending on brand). </li><li>  No burden.  Auto can not be the object of collateral for loans at other banks. </li><li>  The borrower is its owner. </li></ol><p>  The application is considered during the day.  When applying, in addition to a passport, the client must provide documents for the car. </p><h2>  Big Money Loan </h2><p>  One of the classic lending options is a loan called Big Money.  The product was created both for customers who can confirm employment, and for all other citizens.  The presence of a document indicating permanent income increases the chances of obtaining the maximum amount and affects the interest rate on the loan. </p><p>  Terms of registration: </p><ul><li>  amount from 50 to 500 thousand rubles; </li><li>  consideration of the application from 30 minutes to 24 hours; </li><li>  issued in rubles. </li></ul><p>  If the client wishes to receive an amount of up to 200 thousand rubles, he can provide only a passport.  With an agreement amount of 200 thousand rubles or more, one of the following documents is required: </p><ol><li>  Help 2-PIT. </li><li>  Statement from the payroll account. </li><li>  Another option indicating constant stable income. </li></ol><p>  Those who took a loan from Vostochny Bank leave positive reviews about the Big Money product.  But not everyone is satisfied with the interest rate, which is calculated by the bank separately for each borrower. </p><p>  For the product "Big Money", interest ranges from 14.9 to 29.9% per annum.  To reduce overpayments, it is recommended that you provide a complete set of documents, including an income statement. </p><p>  Upon request, a program of life insurance and borrower interests is provided.  The service is paid. </p><h2>  Reviews on the loan "Equal Payment".  Loan conditions </h2><p>  Studying the company and wanting to take a loan, customers read the reviews on Vostochny Bank first.  Feedback from borrowers on the product "Equal Payment" is mixed.  Many were not satisfied with the low limit - up to 300 thousand rubles, and every third seemed to have high interest. </p><p>  Positive <span>feedback about Vostochny Bank</span> (who took a loan in 2016 and earlier) is associated with classic offers that exclude online filing.  But the conditions of those loans differed from modern offers.  Feedback on the Vostochny Bank online loan called ‚ÄúEqual Payment‚Äù appeared only in 2018, and more than 2/3 of borrowers praised the service. </p><p>  For the product "Equal Payment" it is envisaged to conclude an agreement in 3 ways: at the office, online or by phone of the support service.  Such a variety is beneficial for borrowers who may not always find the time to apply in person. </p><p>  Main parameters: </p><ul><li>  credit limit from 50 to 300 thousand rubles; </li><li>  instant decision - within 15 minutes; </li><li>  registration in rubles; </li><li>  individual interest calculation, but not less than 22.7% per annum; </li><li>  for registration only a passport is required. </li></ul><p>  This lending option is beneficial for borrowers who cannot provide income information.  The lack of certificates carries risks for the bank, so the interest rate on the product "Equal Payment" is higher than on most other loans. </p><h2>  Loan conditions "Seasonal" </h2><p>  One of the most popular loan products is the Seasonal loan.  Feedback on the loan of the "East" bank with this name is only positive, since the interest rate is favorable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gorodche.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="east bank" class="if uuid-2980815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2980815.jpg"></div><p>  When applying for a loan, the bank offers a fixed 11.5% per annum.  From the documents only a passport is required. </p><p>  Common parameters: </p><ol><li>  The size of the loan is from 25 to 500 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Fixed annual rate of 11.5%. </li><li>  Issue in Russian rubles. </li><li>  Decision on the application within 15 minutes. </li><li>  It is provided to citizens of the Russian Federation. </li></ol><p>  Vostochny Bank borrower reviews of Seasonal consumer credit reviews want to know if the rate is really fixed.  According to the terms of the bank, interest is set on the offer system and does not increase with the growth of the loan amount. </p><p>  Another advantage of the proposal is the absence of collateral and surety.  Even a client with temporary registration in the Russian Federation can become a borrower.  An important condition for obtaining a loan in this case is the presence of a Vostochny Bank branch in the region, since submitting an application online for the product is not possible. </p><p>  The offer is valid for 2018.  Interest rates on loans are changed unilaterally.  The conditions of the ‚ÄúSeasonal‚Äù loan can also be changed without notifying the borrowers, therefore, those who wish to get a loan at a low interest rate should not be delayed with the application. </p><h2>  Pension loan: features, conditions </h2><p>  Despite the fact that all loans of Vostochny Bank are issued to clients under the age of 76, the bank has offers exclusively for senior citizens.  A feature of such a loan is a strict age limit - from 50 to 76 years - and the absence of experience. </p><p>  Reviews of the loan to pensioners of the "East" Bank confirm the benefits of the product.  Borrowers noted that lack of seniority is an important condition for obtaining a loan for those who work informally.  And this is more than 1/5 of pensioners in our country. </p><p>  The interest on the loan is calculated individually.  The rate of the loan is affected by the borrower's credit history, the existence of existing obligations and an account with Vostochny Bank. </p><p>  Basic conditions: </p><ul><li>  Credit limit from 40 to 99.99 thousand rubles. </li><li>  The loan currency is rubles. </li><li>  A loan is provided for a period of 13 to 36 months. </li></ul><p>  The feedback on the loan of the Vostochny Bank in Tver showed that another advantage of the product is the absence of collateral and surety.  A loan is issued to those who receive income for 3 months (without official confirmation). </p><p>  In order to protect interests, clients are invited to apply for a life and employment insurance program.  The offer is paid and drawn up only at the initiative of the client. </p><h2>  Car loan </h2><p>  Customer reviews of cash loans from Vostochny Bank are not without an opinion on car loans.  The product is a targeted loan.  The purpose of the loan is the purchase of a new or used car. </p><p>  The main advantage of a car loan is the lack of a mandatory Casco.  This reduces customer spending on loan servicing. </p><p>  A car loan is a security loan.  The pledged object is the purchased vehicle.  As in the case of a loan secured by a car, collateral cannot be an object for loans from other banks.  The requirements for the condition of the vehicle and the period of its operation are similar to the conditions for a loan with a pledge of a car. </p><p>  Car loan options: </p><ol><li>  Amount from 100 thousand rubles to 1 million </li><li>  Interest rate - from 19% per annum. </li><li>  Issued in rubles. </li><li>  Consideration of the application takes from 30 minutes to a day. </li><li>  The pledge is the acquired vehicle. </li><li>  The loan is issued for a period of 13 to 59 months. </li></ol><p>  Since the loan is aimed at buying a car, in addition to a passport, the client must provide documents for the car.  This is a title deed, a sales contract, a car pledge agreement and a seller‚Äôs passport.  Additionally, SNILS of the borrower is required. </p><p>  Customer feedback on a cash loan at Vostochny Bank for the purchase of a car is not always positive.  Customers note that not all sellers are willing to provide their passport for a loan.  Some believe that in this way the borrower wants to include them in the contract as a guarantor, but this is not so. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.examplesofletters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="east bank consumer credit" class="if uuid-2976631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2976631.jpg"></div><p>  The seller‚Äôs passport acts as a document confirming the fact of a purchase and sale transaction in the motor vehicle market.  But its absence is often the reason why it is impossible to get a loan. </p><p>  An additional advantage of a car loan at Vostochny Bank is the absence of a down payment.  The loan amount is equal to the amount of the purchase of the vehicle.  If desired, the client can include in the loan amount a connection to the Casco insurance program, but this is not the main condition. </p><h2>  Real estate loan </h2><p>  A mortgage loan at Vostochny Bank is targeted.  The object of the pledge is an apartment purchased with a loan. </p><p>  The advantages of the product are favorable conditions, a convenient way to repay the loan, the possibility of attracting co-borrowers, a high credit limit. </p><p>  The amount of funds depends on the region of real estate purchase.  , -         20     .        10  . </p><p>    3   : </p><ol><li> " ". </li><li> " ". </li><li> . </li></ol><p>       " " -         . </p><p>   : </p><ul><li>   - 20-50 %.        . </li><li>   - 500 . .      - 20  ,   - 10  . </li><li>    .  ,  ,    ,   .     . </li><li>           .     0,7 % .         0,7 %. </li></ul><p>           .  ,      21-65 ,    . </p><p>     ,    ,    .           1   . </p><p>   ""         .       . </p><p>   " "        , ,    . </p><p> " " ,           . </p><p>   ""           :       ,    (   ),   (    ). </p><p>          ,          . </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixorange.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="eastern bank cash loan customer reviews" class="if uuid-2976629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2976629.jpg"></div><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Working citizens must provide income information. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pensioners - a statement from the pension account, a certificate from the Pension Fund. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the registration of mortgages, entrepreneurs apply a tax return for the last year and a business registration certificate. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Owners of their own business must provide a certificate of dividends that the business brings, a report on the activities of the company and general information about the company.</font></font></p><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Mortgage Refinancing </font></font></h2><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Like most Russian banks, Vostochny offers refinancing - repayment of a previous loan at the expense of a new loan on favorable terms. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The program is available only as part of a mortgage agreement.</font></font></p><p> There are practically no reviews on refinancing loans from other banks by Vostochny Bank, since the program is a new product.  The conditions and requirements for borrowers coincide with the registration of a mortgage in the bank. </p><p>  The exception is only the special requirements for the contract in another institution.  To refinance on a previous loan, the client must: </p><ul><li>  make regular payments for six months or more; </li><li>  Do not have current delays. </li></ul><p>  An important point is the lack of restructuring of the mortgage agreement.  If all the requirements are met, the borrower can count on the loan application to be considered by Vostochny Bank to reduce the interest rate.  The lender offers loans from 9.75% per annum in the amount of up to 20 million rubles. </p><h2>  Application Methods </h2><p>  Feedback on loans at Vostochny Bank proves that customers like the company‚Äôs application conditions.  Unlike traditional methods, the lender offers borrowers to apply for a loan online or contact support. </p><p>  When submitting an application on the website of the Vostochny Bank, it is required to indicate: </p><ul><li>  FULL NAME.; </li><li>  telephone; </li><li>  E-mail address; </li><li>  date of birth; </li><li>  income information; </li><li>  passport data; </li><li>  SNILS; </li><li>  registration and registration data; </li><li>  loan amount and term; </li><li>  information on existing obligations. </li></ul><p>  After filling out the questionnaire, the client‚Äôs application automatically goes into processing.  The borrower will receive an SMS notification about the bank‚Äôs decision to the indicated number.  The decision is made online within 15-30 minutes. </p><p>  Passport reviews on a passport with an instant decision are not always positive.  Customers are unhappy with the established rate and do not always delve into the terms of the loan agreement.  Those who carefully study the rates offered by the bank note the speed of disbursement of funds and convenient loan servicing (payment, notifications). </p><p>  The second way to apply for a loan is to call support.  To obtain a loan by phone, you must introduce yourself, name the data of the document, SNILS and the desired loan parameters.  The decision on extradition is made within 30 minutes from the moment of conversation with the operator. </p><p>  Feedback on loans issued by Vostochny Bank over the phone was positive.  Customers like the unusual way to apply and make decisions quickly.  But they also note that the rate set in the contract is not always fixed.  So when receiving copies of the contract, it is recommended to study at what percentage the bank approved the loan.  If the information does not match, you should contact the contact center or bank office to adjust the loan conditions. </p><p>  The traditional way to get a loan is to contact the bank office.  There are many reviews of loans issued by Vostochny Bank on the Web, which customers made out at the branch.  Everyone notes the courtesy of the staff and the pleasant atmosphere. </p><p>  Lending conditions do not depend on the application method.  The client chooses which option is best for him. </p><h2>  Credit payment: methods, features </h2><p>  For the convenience of customers, the bank provides several ways to pay off debt: </p><ol><li>  Payment online on the site. </li><li>  Redemption in the Internet bank. </li><li>  Payment at the terminals of the "East" bank. </li><li>  Transfer to an account in another organization. </li><li>  Payment at the office of the company. </li></ol><p>  The easiest and fastest way to pay a loan from Vostochny Bank is to pay off online on the site.  To complete the operation, you must go to the active window "Online repayment of the loan" Vostochny "card of any bank." </p><p>  Next, the client must choose a payment method - by contract or card number.  In the first case, the loan agreement number and cell phone are entered.  In the second - card data for debiting and crediting funds (since most bank loans are issued to a plastic card account). </p><p>  After data acquisition, the operation must be confirmed.  The cards of third-party banks may be charged according to the tariff. </p><p>  Repayment of a loan in the Internet bank is an opportunity to pay off without leaving your home.  To pay, you need to log in and find the ‚ÄúCredits‚Äù tab, then select the desired contract (if there are several), the payment method and amount.
