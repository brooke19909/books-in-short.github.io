It is literally filled with historical and architectural sights.  By the way, Vyborg is much older than its regional center - for about four centuries.  The history of the city begins in the year one thousand two hundred and ninety-three, when the Swedes occupied the Karelian Isthmus.  On a small island, later called Zamkov, they built a fortress.  Around the stronghold, a settlement gradually grew.  And in one thousand four hundred and third year, two hundred years before the foundation of <span>St. Petersburg, Vyborg</span> received the privileges of the city.  And until now, it has preserved real medieval streets, towers, the town hall, the old market square and, most importantly, the only knight‚Äôs castle in Russia.  But this article was not written to praise local attractions.  It is devoted to only one question: how to get to Vyborg from St. Petersburg. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to Vyborg from St. Petersburg" class="if" height="474" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1573975.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Distance between cities </h2><p>  If we consider the centers of settlements, that is, the main post offices, from which state stagecoaches were serving before the era of automobiles, to be considered as starting points, then one hundred and fifty kilometers lie between St. Petersburg and Vyborg.  And if you start from the northwestern outskirts of the regional center, then this distance is reduced to 130 km.  It would seem that it can be overcome in two hours with a little.  And this makes Vyborg an interesting place for Petersburgers to spend a weekend.  It would seem that this is difficult?  To leave early in the morning by car, train or bus, at nine to be in place, to inspect everything, and in the evening to return home, full of joyful impressions of a beautiful medieval city ... But it's not so simple.  Vyborg lies in the so-called "Finnish" direction.  And on the road interstate buses and minibuses constantly ply.  In addition, in the north-west of St. Petersburg there are huge summer cottages.  This circumstance should be taken into account when drawing up a plan on how to get to Vyborg from St. Petersburg.  It may well be that the travel time will not stretch for two and a half hours, but for all four due to traffic jams.  Therefore, it is better to plan a trip in the summer period not on a day off. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  To Vyborg by car </h2><p>  Own motor transport is the best option for a trip to a fabulous city.  You do not depend on the schedule of buses and trains, and you can enjoy the beauties of Vyborg as much as you want.  In addition, along the way you can make stops and see other interesting settlements.  At the same time, the driver has a choice between three roads.  You can go through Pargolovo, Sestroretsk (A181 and E18) or on the highway of national importance "Scandinavia".  The advantages of the last route are indicated by the ideal road surface of the highway.  But a few lanes still do not save from traffic jams.  If you are thinking about how to get to Vyborg from St. Petersburg by car along the M-10 ‚ÄúScandinavia‚Äù highway, then it should be noted that there are a lot of traffic intersections in which it is easy to get confused and lose the right direction.  On highways, the journey will take two hours (excluding traffic jams). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to Vyborg from St. Petersburg by bus" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1573972.jpg" width="600"></div>

In St. Petersburg, there are two bus stations from where the flight machines of route number 850 depart. These are Devyatkino and Parnas.  The last bus station is preferable.  It is from Parnassus that the earliest bus leaves at six forty-five in the morning.  And the last of Vyborg - at eight in the evening.  And the cars from Parnassus come out on the flight more comfortable.  And the intervals between them are small - every twenty-five minutes.  True, a ticket from Parnassus will cost a little more - two hundred and fifty rubles.  If you are thinking about how to get to Vyborg from St. Petersburg from the Severnaya station, we are compelled to disappoint you: last year the flight from there was canceled. </p><h2>  How to find the Parnas bus station </h2><p>  This is not an idle question at all.  Regarding the Parnas bus station, which is located next to the metro station of the same name, the only difficulty is to find a ticket office.  It is an unpretentious-looking barn without decals.  Upon leaving the metro, you need to turn obliquely to the left, pass a small parking lot.  You will find yourself on a platform with buses.  Turn sharply to the left and you will see a shed with several steps.  This is the box office.  This is all you need to know about how to get to Vyborg from St. Petersburg.  In the medieval city itself you will not have any difficulties.  Buses arrive almost to the center (to Kosh Bay), say, right next to historical sites. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to Vyborg from St. Petersburg by train" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1573966.jpg" width="390"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Vyborg from St. Petersburg by train </h2><p>  But road transport, whatever it may be, can become a hostage to traffic jams.  Therefore, if you do not want to stand and breathe in the fumes, use the services of the railway.  You can also get to Vyborg by trains to Helsinki.  Then the travel time will be generally ridiculous - fifty-five minutes.  But travel on the train of St. Petersburg-Helsinki is very expensive - one thousand six hundred and fifty rubles.  Every day, trains leave for Vyborg.  The very first comes out at six fifty five.  All trains leave from <span>Finland Station</span> (at Ploshchad Lenina metro station).  The only minus is the ‚Äúat every pillar‚Äù stop.  As a result, travel time stretches for two and a half hours.  In addition, in the warm season, electric trains are crammed with summer residents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyborg how to get from St. Petersburg on a swallow" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1573968.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Express "Swallow" </h2><p>  To reduce travel time, you can take the fast train next to Vyborg.  How to get from St. Petersburg to "Lastochka"?  To do this, you must be at the Finland Station at eight zero five.  Since this express train makes only three stops (in Roshchino, Udelnaya and Zelenogorsk), the travel time is reduced to one hour and forty-five minutes.  On weekends, another ‚ÄúSwallow‚Äù leaves from St. Petersburg - from the same station, at ten thirty-five.  The last express train leaves Vyborg at twenty forty six, and arrives in the City on the Neva at ten in the evening.  The cost of a ticket in a seated wagon without services is two hundred eighty-two rubles. </p>
