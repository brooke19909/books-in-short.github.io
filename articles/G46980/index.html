    <h2>  Significance of Operation Codes </h2><p>  The transaction codes in the VAT tax return must be correctly defined, otherwise the agency that is the administrator of the relevant payments to the budget may not recognize the necessary indicators in the declaration, as a result of which the assessment of the quality of fulfillment by the taxpayer of the obligations stipulated by law may not be completely reliable.  Thus, to indicate the correct figure in the declaration is primarily in the interests of the VAT payer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Codes in books and magazines on VAT </h2><p>  It is important not to confuse the codes in question with those that characterize the filling of various accounting documents by VAT payers - books and magazines.  The fact is that they use a different code - a figure that corresponds to the name of a taxpayer‚Äôs action that is of economic importance in terms of evaluating the content of the accounting document, which can be transferred to the Federal Tax Service in the established manner.  This code facilitates the systematization and subsequent interpretation by tax service specialists of the content of VAT accounting documents. </p><h2>  Codes in Books and Magazines: Governing Law </h2><p>  The list of relevant codes is also enshrined in law.  The main source of law in which they are given is Order of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation No. MMV-7-3 / 136, published on March 14, 2016.  Codes of operations in accordance with the indicated source of law can be recorded: </p><p>  - in purchase books, which are used in the framework of calculations for VAT, additional sheets to them; </p><p>  - the sales book, as well as on the sheet supplementing it. </p><p>  In addition, the noted legal act contains codes of varieties of transactions that are necessary for the taxpayer to maintain an invoice journal. </p>

    <p>  These are the features of the reflection of information in Section No. 3 of the reporting document.  We will now study what a particular transaction code can mean in a VAT declaration in Section No. 4. Once again, we will use the format of a small table for these purposes. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="11%"><p>  The code </p></td><td width="89%"><p>  Value </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="11%"><p>  1011700 </p></td><td width="89%"><p>  Reflects transactions carried out by tax agents. </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="11%"><p>  1011711 </p></td><td width="89%"><p>  Corresponds to the sale of goods and services by foreigners who are not considered taxpayers </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="11%"><p>  1011712 </p></td><td width="89%"><p>  Corresponding to the sale of works and services by foreigners who are not considered taxpayers </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="11%"><p>  1011703 </p></td><td width="89%"><p>  Reflects the provision by the authorities of various types of state as well as municipal property for rent </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="11%"><p>  1011705 </p></td><td width="89%"><p>  Corresponds to the sale on the territory of the Russian Federation of various types of confiscated property, sold in accordance with court decisions, ownerless things, treasures, valuables for purchase, as well as transferred to the authorities by right of inheritance </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="11%"><p>  1011707 </p></td><td width="89%"><p>  Reflects the sale of goods, work and services by foreigners on the basis of civil law agreements </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="11%"><p>  1011709 </p></td><td width="89%"><p>  Reflects the <span>payment of VAT by</span> persons in the status of <span>tax agents,</span> which are given in paragraph 6 of Art.  161 of the Tax Code </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Let us now examine what the code of the type of operation can indicate in the VAT declaration in Section No. 5. Similarly, we use a small table. </p><h2>  Codes for operations in Section No. 5 </h2><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="11%"><p>  The code </p></td><td width="89%"><p>  Value </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="11%"><p>  1011800 </p></td><td width="89%"><p>  Reflects transactions related to transactions in various real estate </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="11%"><p>  1011801 </p></td><td width="89%"><p>  Corresponds to the property that was completed as part of the capital construction carried out by contractors </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="11%"><p>  1011802 </p></td><td width="89%"><p>  Corresponds to the property that has been completed as part of capital construction carried out by a person for their own use </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="11%"><p>  1011803 </p></td><td width="89%"><p>  Reflects a property purchased under civil law agreements. </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="11%"><p>  1011805 </p></td><td width="89%"><p>  Corresponds to the modernization or reconstruction of a property </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  These are the transaction codes of Section 4 of the VAT return.

    <h2>  What codes are recorded in Section 7 </h2><p>  In accordance with the norms of the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, the transaction codes of section 7 of the VAT return can be applied as follows: 1010823;  1010800. The use of these codes can be carried out until the competent authorities develop new ones and add it to the Procedure for the preparation of the declaration.  In a similar way, it is regulated not only that which is present in such a document as a VAT declaration, Section 7. Codes of operations for sections 5 and 6 within the framework of the procedures provided for by sub.  9.2 p. 1 Article  164 of the Tax Code, are also not yet developed separately.  Therefore, code 1011417 can be used instead. It can also be used to reflect the relevant operations in Section 4 of the VAT return. </p>
