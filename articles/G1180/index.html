It means that the subscriber does not use the services of his operator, but a foreign company (through the intermediary of his provider) to communicate with the number he needs.  Due to this, the cost of calls, messages and Internet abroad is very different from the prices relevant on the domestic market. </p>

    <h2>  Special rates </h2><p>  In this regard, mobile providers often hold various promotions and provide a discount on communication with other countries, trying to choose the most affordable tariff for their subscriber.  However, this is not always possible to do - often users still cannot afford the costs that are imposed by companies.  Even the various options for working in only one direction, for any particular country, cannot be significantly cheaper due to the presence of two mobile operators - yours and foreign. </p><h2>  Alternative </h2><p>  If a user cannot afford to spend so much on mobile communications while abroad, he has several solutions to this situation.  The first is simply to stop using mobile phones.  Now there are a lot of Internet services that allow you to communicate with each other.  Most of them are free.  But communication through the network is not always convenient, and sometimes it becomes completely impossible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second way is to buy a special SIM card of another operator, whose tariffs are more affordable.  Often we are talking about some international providers that release their own special SIM cards for travel.  Just about one of these we will talk in this article.  So if you decide to go somewhere, it will be useful to you. </p>

    <h2>  Special operator </h2><p>  This is about GoodLine.  The reviews left about her on the Internet indicate that this is the supplier of the so-called tourist SIM cards.  In fact, this is what we mentioned earlier - the opportunity to purchase a dedicated card for communication between countries.  Its peculiarity lies in the fact that the final price of services is an order of magnitude lower compared to our largest telecom operators.  Even if we compare the prices of various special offers of our ‚Äúordinary‚Äù operators and the cost of calls provided by the GoodLine SIM card, the difference will be huge.  Because of this, people are looking for similar services in order to be able to somehow save on mobile communications. </p><h2>  Concept </h2><p>  The general model of the company is very simple.  Either you are given a card with which calls are much cheaper to Russian numbers and, in turn, are free if you are called from Russian numbers, or you attach your ‚Äúnative‚Äù number to the Good Line card.  Reviews note that the second option, of course, is more convenient (since you save your number).  But it also costs 15 cents under the conditions specified on the operator‚Äôs website. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  This company offers not only cheap calls.  There are also <span>tariff plans that</span> provide for the availability of Internet traffic at a special price.  This means that you will be able to use mobile Internet, being somewhere abroad. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  In fact, the GoodLine (Russia) business model resembles how other mobile operators work.  Here, in particular, they serve customer numbers and support the work of your SIM cards.  Here they develop their tariff plans and for a certain cost allocate service packages (minutes, messages, traffic). </p><p>  In addition to serving private customers, GoodLine (reviews confirm this) also helps companies interested in mobile services.  For example, it can be some corporate data packages that apply to several interconnected mobile numbers. </p><p>  The company also provides other services.  For example, there is an online store that sells goods that you may find useful in the future on a trip.  They also offer room service, for example, topping up an account. </p><p>  True, domestic operators in a sense can offer more than Good Line.  TV services, for example, the company to which the review is devoted, does not provide.  Yes, and in roaming, probably this is not such a pressing issue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tariffs </h2><p>  At the time of writing, in the section of the GoodLine website ‚ÄúTariffs‚Äù (which is obviously devoted to the cost of services in the system), two plans were presented that the subscriber could choose.  One of them is Planet Good (an option that allows you to make calls, write messages and use the Internet).  In particular, the cost of incoming calls in more than 140 countries is 0, the price of a minute from Europe to Russia <span>(city numbers in Moscow</span> and St. Petersburg) is $ 0.05, other numbers are $ 0.29, and other countries are $ 0.49.  From the USA to Russia, the call price is $ 0.49, from China - $ 0.29.  And on the company's website there are several more areas and services provided for by this tariff. </p>

    <p>  The second package, described in the Good Line section of the Tariffs website, is called Good Internet.  It includes options that mean the ratio between a certain amount of traffic (for example, 10 mb) and the price for 1 day of use (1 dollar).  The maximum package is 2 GB of data, the cost of which is $ 100.  The option is valid for 30 days. </p><h2>  Special offers </h2><p>  In addition to the services described above, the company is engaged in the provision of special, promotional offers.  For example, one of those is a profitable account replenishment (at the official rate of the Central Bank).  Here you can also include a 10 percent discount on goods from the online store (tablets, phones, insurance policy, etc. are sold here), as well as a program for accumulating special ‚Äúmiles‚Äù.  This means that the more the subscriber is talking on the phone, the more he can ultimately benefit from working with Good Line.  The reviews indicate that upon reaching a certain amount of bonuses, the client is given the opportunity to use the airline‚Äôs services for free, get free hotel accommodation and other benefits. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Client recommendations that we found on some sites with reviews and characteristics of mobile operators really praise the company, recommend its services and note the low prices of services in it.  Many argue that they began to seriously save, using tariffs to which you can connect the Good Line number.  If you count the money that a subscriber would pay for calls with other, Russian operators, he would spend several times more.  Therefore, we see a lot of positive feedback from company customers. </p>

    <p>  Another thing is the various problems that arose in the process of cooperation.  In this regard, we found a lot of negative comments.  They, of course, are fewer, but they are.  Users complain that they have uncontrolled loss of money from the account, or that the final cost of services was higher than the one that was announced earlier. </p><p>  Users also emphasize that the disadvantage of the card is the inability to check it and activate it in Russia.  That is, you can actually find out whether your phone will be available or not, only after you get to another country.  And this, you see, is such a risk that not everyone is ready to take. </p><p>  And finally, another problem can be called a slightly confusing pricing.  That is, if you call to one country, but they call you from another, this is understandable.  But, for example, such a fact: the GoodLine subscriber number is served by an Estonian operator.  If you are called from Russia, you do not pay for incoming calls, but your subscriber will pay twice as much, because he has roaming charges. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  So, what did we manage to find out about the work of GoodLine? </p><p>  Everyone knows how to call, how to activate a card, and how to replenish an account.  These are not some complicated actions that require additional information.  Therefore, there should not be any problems.  But with regard to tariffs and various hidden conditions, then here really it will be necessary to try to reveal all of them.  After all, the plans are very cunning, the subscriber must ‚Äúrummage‚Äù in tariffs and understand what is at stake.  Then really calls from Good Line can be very profitable. </p>
