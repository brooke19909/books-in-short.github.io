But this is an erroneous opinion.  Literally 10 km from MKAD is Troitskoye beach. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  Entrance to the beach area is free.  If you want to call in a car, you will have to pay 200 rubles.  The bathing area on Troitskoye beach is sandy, and the surrounding area is lawn.  There are locker rooms and a free toilet, umbrellas that allow you to hide from the sun. </p><p>  For children, a bathing area is specially equipped, so parents will not need to worry that the child will drown or swallow water.  There is a medical center and a rescue station in sight. </p><p>  Near the coastline are gazebos with barbecue facilities.  You can simply relax in them or prepare a barbecue, or order in a cafe. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Trinity beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2228765.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Zoo </h2><p>  Troitskoye Beach is famous not only for its sandy beaches, but also for its mini-zoo.  All these animals once suffered from the cruelty of people, and now are under the watchful eye of employees of the recreation center.  Everyone can visit the zoo for free.  Park animals: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Bactrian Camel </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Argo </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  He loves treats and was selected from the Kazakh owners at 6 months of age </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Lama (male) </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Stepan </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Has a very cute appearance and vindictive character </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"><p>  Lynx (male and female) </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  By incredible efforts, the female was raised to her feet after a spinal injury </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Bear </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Rimbaud </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  It was found in the forest, has an excellent appetite and hibernates for the winter </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Sika deer </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  5 individuals </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Adults became victims of forest fires in 2010, two in 2011 were released into the wild, and the remaining gave posterity </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"><p>  Foxes </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  All individuals came to the zoo through the fault of irresponsible people </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Beach activities </h2><p>  Naturally, you can just lie on a deck chair and swim.

Here you can ride children on a pony, take part in a horseback riding master class or just ride a chaise.  And if you came to rest in the winter, then for everyone, they organize sleigh rides with the Russian troika.

The total occupied area is 11.5 hectares.  The territory is fully landscaped, there is a developed infrastructure. </p><p>  The hotel complex of the recreation center includes 3 hotels and 11 cottages.  The most interesting building is the Bagration hotel-ship.  This is a real ship moored to the shore and installed on concrete piles.

There is also a bar, where you can enjoy panoramic views of the reservoir. </p><h2>  How to get to paradise near Moscow </h2><p>  It‚Äôs easy to get to the beach in Troitsky.  If using public transport, you need to get off at Altufyevo station and take the bus following route No. 273 or 503. Get off at the Klyazmensky Forest Park stop.  Now walk to the coastal zone, about half an hour.  If you go by bus number 302, then get off at the final stop. </p><p>  If you have a trip on your own car, you should go to Dmitrovskoe highway and move to Vinogradovo.  After that, at the traffic light, do not miss the turn to the right, there will be a sign ‚ÄúTrinity Recreation Area‚Äù.  Now everything is simple - go strictly following the signs. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beach trinity reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2228763.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Trinity Beach is, above all, appreciated for its proximity to the capital.  Klyazmen reservoir is clean sand and water, free access to the shore and entertainment for every taste.  Therefore, reviews of vacationers are mostly positive.  Although visitors do not like the promenade, where there are no steps and a gentle descent, and a meter to the water.  Naturally, for lovers of a quiet holiday it will be too noisy here, as many people come here on weekends and holidays. </p>
