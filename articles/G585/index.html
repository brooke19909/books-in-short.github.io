This question has been bothering scientists since Charles Darwin.  No less the question of where the first person appeared is of interest to many curious inhabitants.  However, this topic is not as simple as it might seem at first glance.  The fact is that if you start to understand it in order to adequately answer the question of where the first person appeared, it turns out that there is still no final and generally accepted opinion among archaeologists or anthropologists.  Who is considered a man?  Which of the links in the evolutionary chain suddenly became human, leaving its own parent at the steps of the monkeys?  After all, evolution is not at all </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where did the first person appear" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/268594.jpg" width="600"></div>  instantaneous act, and long and very slow transformations.  The second difficulty with the question of where the first person appeared is in the criteria themselves - how to separate a person in general, by what criteria?  By upright posture, opposing the thumb, by the use of implements of labor, or after all by the volume of the brain?  Let us try to outline an extremely brief picture of the path of Homo sapiens.

    <p>  Where did the first people come from? </p><p>  The answer is in Africa, apparently.  According to the calculations of modern researchers, the lines of modern <span>anthropoid apes</span> and immediate <span>ancestors of people</span> were divided about 8-6 million years ago.  It was then that the first erect hominids appeared on the planet.  Their earliest fossil representative is the sahelantrum creature.  He lived about 6-7 million years ago and already walked on two legs.  Of course, it‚Äôs hardly possible to call him only on this basis </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where did the first people appear" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/268596.jpg" width="300"></div>  the most ancient man.  The rest of its features were still similar to monkeys, but the fact that they had already descended from the branches significantly changed their lifestyle and directed evolution in the right direction.  Sahelanthropus was followed by orrorin (about 6 million years ago), known to all Australopithecus (about 4 million years ago), parantrop (2.5 million).  These are not all the links found by archaeologists and dated to this long period, but only some representatives of the chain.  It is important that each of these hominids had certain progressive traits compared to its predecessors.  The first hominids that were really close to the modern type of people were Homo habilis <span>(skilled man)</span> and Homo ergaster (working), which appeared 2.4 and 1.9 million years ago.  Like all previous links, these ancestors of modern people lived in Africa - the cradle of mankind.  And finally, the truly indisputable people are Homo sapiens, who appeared only 40 thousand years ago.  Interestingly, this species of man also appeared in Africa, but at the same time, Europe was already inhabited by people!  People who, according to modern scientists, have already appeared in Europe, <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where the first people appeared history" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/268592.jpg" width="496"></div>  however, over time they disappeared from the face of the Earth and are not direct descendants of modern humanity, but only a dead end branch of evolution.  We are talking about the famous Neanderthals, who died out for reasons not entirely clear about 25 thousand years ago.

    <p>  Where did the first <span>people</span> come from <span>?</span>  <span>The history of the emergence of</span> ancient civilizations </p><p>  Be that as it may, it was the <span>rational man who</span> was destined to eventually settle out of Africa across all continents of the planet.  Since then, people have not undergone significant biological changes.  However, an important event was the so-called <span>Neolithic revolution.</span>  This is the process of transition from an appropriating economy to a reproducing one, that is, the emergence of agriculture and livestock raising.  New forms of management proved to be much more effective, allowing tribes to significantly increase their numbers, create an excess product of labor, giving rise to social stratification.  Ultimately, these processes led to the appearance of the first civilizations and states that arose in Mesopotamia. </p>
