His ‚Äúbrother‚Äù came out with it - the 6 Plus model, which, in fact, simply has increased case sizes (hence, also a screen with a battery).  As for the latter, if on the iPhone 6 the <span>battery capacity</span> is 1810 mAh, then the Plus model received a 2915 mAh battery.  Thus, the life of the second device is slightly longer, although the energy consumption here is much higher. </p><h2>  IPhone 6 Battery: Customer Reviews </h2>

Every fan of Apple products tried to grab the new product quickly, to show off to friends and, of course, see what kind of new iPhone it is.  In the end, the opinions of such lucky people who managed to do this were divided.  Some confirmed Apple's commercials that this device is the most advanced, released in the history of the company;  others found flaws in the design of the device, in its functionality and criticized the novelty as soon as they could.  Be that as it may, in fact, but the actual operating time was increased, optimizing the battery consumption in the new iPhone;  as for the functions of the smartphone, they have become an order of magnitude more than in the previous 5 generation model.  In addition, Apple's sales volumes speak for themselves - in the early days, millions of gadgets were purchased.  Obviously, if the iPhone 6 in some way did not live up to the expectations of customers, sales would surely fail, which did not happen.

This is expressed primarily in the fact that the user does not have to charge the phone every day, as the owners of other smartphones do after active use.  The same applies to the <span>iPhone 6. User reviews</span> say that they have enough battery power for 2-3 days of active work with the device.  This refers to listening to music, receiving calls, using applications - those actions that consume the most battery power.

    <p>  True, in order for the battery to function fully, after purchasing the new iPhone 6 you need to charge it properly.  According to experts, the first time the device should be charged to the maximum, that is, fully.  To do this, the phone must be completely "planted."  After that, it must be connected to the network and wait until charging is completed.  After that, your iPhone can be used in normal mode.  In the future, by the way, it is necessary to carry out the procedure partially, that is, for example, if the battery shows 50% of the charge or even 90% - this does not matter.  In general, the iPhone 6 battery (as well as the Plus version) is more suitable for this type of charge. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to extend battery life </h2>

However, even after some period of time, they begin to work worse, allowing the smartphone to discharge faster.  It is impossible to deal with these processes, but you can postpone them and extend the life of your battery.  To do this, experts recommend, at a minimum, maintain a normal temperature regime - both not to heat up too much and not to overcool your iPhone 6. The battery capacity does not matter here, because if you put any battery outside the mode at -5 and up to +25 degrees Celsius , its functioning may be impaired.  Of course, this will not happen immediately, but the effect of temperature on the battery is undeniable.

    <p>  In addition, the lithium-ion battery of the iPhone 6 can not often be brought to zero.  This type of battery is not intended for frequent full energy consumption, so it is best of all that they work in a constant mode of recharging, and not power from 0%. </p><p>  In addition, other battery recommendations should be followed.  True, they are more obvious.  So, you should protect it from mechanical damage, from moisture and dirt, and so on.  These recommendations are elementary, and most users follow them regularly. </p><h2>  How to charge iPhone 6 faster </h2>

If you conduct it using an original device from a home network of 220 volts, it will take up to 2 hours.  It should be noted that using non-original charging adapters and cords or those that are adapted to work with other models of devices is strictly prohibited.  This may cause a complete battery failure.

    <p>  So, we all know the moments when you need to charge a smartphone, but there is no time for this due to certain circumstances.  So, there is a theory that in order to speed up the process of charging the battery on the iPhone 6 (battery capacity is not important - it can also be an iPhone 4 or 5 generation battery), you just need to turn on "Airplane" mode.  As a result, a number of functions that consume a charge are disabled in the smartphone (WiFi, 3G, Bluetooth, receiving a network signal), and the process really accelerates. </p><h2>  Reduce battery consumption on the device </h2>

It all depends on what purpose you still need a smartphone for - to receive a call or, for example, to take a picture.  For the first, a simple shutdown of Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 3G, as well as a decrease in screen brightness, is suitable.  If the phone is needed for a picture, then you can safely turn on the same "Flight Mode".  In extreme cases, if you do not have enough battery life all the time, you can think about buying <span>an external battery</span> for iPhone 6 in the form of a special case or portable gadget.  Its cost starts from 990 rubles and ends in the region of 10 thousand apiece.

    <h2>  IPhone <span>Battery Replacement</span> </h2><p>  If the battery capacity of the iPhone 6 Plus due to the solid age of the device, as well as due to some damage or malfunction does not suit you to a large extent, you can think about how to replace the battery on the iPhone.  True, you should not do this yourself.  We recommend that you purchase the battery separately (as you save) and take it with your phone to a specialized service center.  There, experts will professionally service your smartphone, having carried out a replacement. </p><h2>  How to choose a new battery? </h2><p>  According to official information, the battery capacity of the iPhone 6 Plus is 2915 mAh, and the iPhone 6 is 1810 mAh.  When choosing batteries in a store, pay attention to these indicators.  In addition, of course, keep an eye on the price - genuine Apple accessories cannot be cheap.  On average, the battery on the iPhone 6 will cost about 900 rubles - if you buy in an online store, and on 6 Plus - about 1100 rubles.  However, of course, when buying them in retail chains, you can meet different prices.  The voiced above is only a guideline, fluctuations can be upward to 300-400 rubles.  Remember: it is advisable to choose the batteries themselves in the store that really sells original, certified products.  Otherwise, buying accessories in the transition, for example, you run the risk of getting a battery on the iPhone 6, whose battery capacity is less, as well as the service life.  Moreover, you can even spoil your expensive smartphone with a low-quality battery.  Be careful with this. </p><h2>  Thinner, lighter, more durable </h2>

Obviously, the next generation of mobile phones of this company will be even more detailed than the iPhone 6. The battery capacity of the following models will certainly be higher, and the weight and dimensions will be less.  Therefore, if now something does not suit you in the Apple technique, do not be discouraged!  Perhaps the iPhone 6S or 7 will live up to your expectations.
