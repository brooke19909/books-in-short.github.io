A few decades ago it was quite difficult to find a citizen of the Soviet Union who had never been to Crimea.  Modern tourists have become selective, picky, their taste preferences and requirements for resorts have changed.  Moreover, foreign resorts became available, where the main stream of Russians rushed.  The fashionable European and Asian resorts boast amazing service, high quality services and developed infrastructure.  One problem - the cost of tours is quite high.  In addition, to visit the near abroad, a passport is required, the registration of which is fraught with a number of difficulties and considerable financial investments. </p><p>  Now that Crimea has become part of Russia, and vacationers do not need to issue foreign passports, why not consider this region for yourself?  Here you can really have a good and inexpensive rest.  The largest travel companies, air carriers offer profitable tours, low-cost charter flights to Crimea.  All this helps to increase the number of vacationers in this region.  The southern coast of Crimea remains the most popular, but so many vacationers gather here in season that literally there is nowhere for an apple to fall.  If you, as a tourist, are looking for a more secluded, not crowded and calm place for your vacation, we suggest paying attention to the northern region of Crimea.  An excellent option is just Sudak.  With children, vacation in this region is safe and even useful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
