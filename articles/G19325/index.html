  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HTC One M8s - a review of a powerful toy from Taiwan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At first glance, it might seem that they are identical.  Only this is not entirely true.  The <span>HTC One</span> M8s is not an exact copy of its predecessor, the HTC One M8.  Therefore, it is time to find out what these two models have in common and how they are different. </p><h2>  Device design </h2><p>  You can‚Äôt look for something new in the design of the device.  Apparently, the developer considered that he was already perfect, which means that he does not require major changes.  The case of the new model, as before, is a solid piece of high-quality aluminum with plastic inserts that not only do not spoil the appearance of the device, but also slightly reduce its weight. </p>

On the left side of the device there is a slot for nano-sim, and on the right side there is a volume key and a slot for a memory card.  The back panel metal is not smooth, but a little rough, which significantly improves the grip of the smartphone with the hand, reducing its sliding.  There you can also notice an unusual system of two cameras with a multi-colored flash next to the main module.  In general, the design has not changed and, if you read the user <span>reviews</span> left about the <span>HTC One M8s</span> smartphone, this was not needed.

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  In the case of the display, the situation is the same.  This is the same 5-inch screen developed using SuperLCD 3. By the way, these displays are considered the best and compete with Amoled technology.  Perhaps that is why they were not affected by the change.  Smartphone HTC One M8s proudly demonstrates excellent brightness, excellent contrast, excellent color reproduction and huge viewing angles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

And using the phone with wet hands is a pleasure.  But no matter how good this feature may be, it is not new.  Therefore, to find out about the changes in the smartphone HTC One M8s, the review will have to continue.

    <h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  In fact, the hardware device of the smartphone hides the real differences between the two models.  The novelty runs on the 8-core Snapdragon 615 processor and the Andreno 405 graphics accelerator. But the last device only worked on four cores and a less powerful graphics chip.  The amount of RAM has not changed - 2 GB, space for data storage - 16 GB.  Although it can be increased up to 128 GB.  And here are the first real differences between smartphones.  And if you read the reviews left about the device HTC One M8s (16 GB), there are no dissatisfied with the fact that it has become more powerful. </p><p>  As for the communicative functions, it is unchanged.  It connects to the Internet via Wi-Fi, LTE-connection and 3G.  There is also Bluetooth and an NFC module.  On long trips, the FM receiver will brighten up the time, and the GPS sensor will help you not get lost on the road. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  HTC One M8s Smartphone: Camera Review </h2><p>  The cameras in this model are one of the strongest advantages.  There are two rear modules, the joint resolution of which is 13 megapixels.  But they do their job better than the cameras of the previous device.  The photos are excellent.  Interestingly, there is the ability to simultaneously take photos and shoot videos. </p>

An overview of the front camera is not needed here, because it has the same characteristics as the old model.

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  It is immediately noticeable that there is a difference in the work of the two devices, because they have different software.  It uses version 5 of Android, which works without brakes or interruptions. </p><p>  Manage your smartphone conveniently.  Although no one has complained before.  But thanks to Motion Launch technology, much of it has been greatly simplified.  For example, to answer a call, you can simply bring the device to your ear, and to unlock the smartphone it will be enough to slap your finger on the display twice with your finger. </p>

This was influenced by the updated version of the Sense UI shell.  Elements such as the phone book and file manager have also undergone minor modernization.

    <h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  Small changes have affected this part.  The new smartphone uses a battery with a larger capacity of 2840 mAh.  True, the operating time has not changed much.  Most likely, an 8-core processor played a role here.  In general, in standby mode, it can last about 800 hours, while the previous model could last about 600 hours.  Those who like to talk will have about 20 hours at their disposal.  And in this regard, smartphones can be considered the same. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It's time to take stock of the <span>HTC One M8s.</span>  <span>The review</span> revealed several significant differences between the models.  First of all, we are talking about the hardware, which has become more powerful.  And this is very important, because the smartphone has become able to cope with a large number of tasks.  There is a situation with the main cameras, which have become better to shoot, and a more capacious battery. </p><p>  And that‚Äôs all, there‚Äôs nothing more to say.  The developer did not come up with a new design, try to change something in the display, and even more so did not modernize the front camera.  What for?  This is all well implemented.  Having released the smartphone HTC One M8s, the Taiwanese company simply decided to slightly improve its device. </p>
