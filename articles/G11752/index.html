    <p>  For millennia, the <span>demographic situation has been</span> characterized by a very slow increase in the number of people on Earth.  About ten thousand years ago on the planet, the population was about five million people.  By the beginning of the new era, the number of mankind reached two hundred to three hundred million.  This growth is mainly due to the start of food production.  During the period of medieval wars and epidemics, the rate of increase in numbers decreased slightly.  The sharp increase coincides with the beginning of the <span>industrial revolution.</span>  About two hundred years ago, significant progress was noted in the development of medicine, economics, science and other areas of public life, which allowed to significantly expand the capacity of the human environment. </p><p>  Starting from the 17th century, a marked increase in the growth rate <span>of the Earth's population was</span> noted <span>.</span>  In the 1820-30s, the number of people on the planet reached the first billion.  After this, a sharp increase in population growth begins.  There was a "population explosion." </p><p>  In the twentieth century, especially in its second half, an unprecedented increase in population was noted.  At the same time, the demographic situation was characterized by serious changes in mortality and fertility, the family and age structure of the world population.  Migration and urbanization were noted, there were significant differences in the development of mankind depending on the region of residence. </p><p>  The <span>population</span> explosion in the 20th century is characterized by high absolute rates of <span>population growth.</span>  By the end of the century, the number was growing annually by ninety million people.  UN experts believe that such a pace will continue until 2015. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that the <span>population of the planet</span> reached the sixth billion already in 1997-98.  According to experts, every eleven years, up to the middle of the 21st century, a billion people will be added. </p><p>  It should be noted that the ‚Äúpopulation explosion‚Äù is more pronounced in developing countries.  This is due to the emergence of new opportunities in these states.  By gaining independence, developing countries can make greater use of global medical advances.  With the participation and help of <span>world communities,</span> these states were given the opportunity to eliminate various epidemic diseases that claimed thousands of lives.  Thus, over several decades, mortality rates have declined significantly.  However, fertility in developing countries remained high.  This triggered a "population explosion." </p><p>  A sharp increase in population growth can be reduced if fertility is reduced, given the fact that mortality in developing countries continues to decline steadily. </p><p>  The modern ‚Äúpopulation explosion‚Äù is a large-scale phenomenon.  Today, a sharp jump in population growth is observed in a large number of countries, while covering a significant part of the entire population of the planet.  In addition, there is a direct or indirect impact on the entire community in the world, as the <span>demographic problem is</span> becoming one of the most global today. </p><p>  Experts note that the increase in the European population was mainly associated with changes in the social, economic sphere of life.  In other words, the development of these industries has provoked an increase in the number of people.  In developing countries, the situation is the opposite.  In these states, the increase in the number of people preceded economic and social development.  As a result, developing countries are aggravating the already difficult situation of the population associated with problems of employment, the environment, and food supply. </p>
