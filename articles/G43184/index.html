    <h2>  What is climate? </h2><p>  By this definition is understood the established weather regime that distinguishes this or that locality.  It is reflected in the complex of all changes observed in the territory.  Climate types affect nature, determine the state of water bodies and soils, lead to the appearance of specific plants and animals, and affect the development of industries and agriculture.  Formation occurs as a result of exposure to solar radiation and winds in combination with a variety of surfaces.  All these factors directly depend on the geographical latitude, which determines the angle of incidence of the rays, and hence the volume of heat production. </p><h2>  What affects the climate? </h2><p>  Different conditions (in addition to geographical latitude) can determine what the weather will be like.  For example, proximity to the ocean has a strong impact.  The farther the area is from large waters, the less rainfall gets, and the more uneven it is.  Closer to the ocean, the oscillation amplitude is small, and all types of climate in such lands are much milder than continental.  No less significant sea currents.  For example, they warm the coast of the Scandinavian peninsula, which contributes to the growth of forests there.  At the same time, Greenland, which has a similar location, is covered in ice all year.  Strongly affects climate formation and topography.  The higher the area, the lower the temperature, so it can be cold in the mountains, even if they are in the tropics.  In addition, the ridges can hold back the <span>air masses,</span> which causes a lot of precipitation on the windward slopes, and further on the continent they are noticeably less.  Finally, it is worth noting the impact of winds, which can also seriously transform climate types.  Monsoons, hurricanes and typhoons carry moisture and significantly affect the weather. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  All existing types </h2><p>  Before studying each type individually, it is worthwhile to understand the general classification.  What can be the main types of climate?  The easiest way to understand the example of a specific country.  The Russian Federation occupies a large area, and in the country the weather is very different.  Learn all help the table.  The types of climates and the places where they prevail are distributed in it according to each other. </p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Arctic climate </p></td><td><p>  Islands of the Arctic Ocean, Siberia in coastal areas </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Subarctic climate </p></td><td><p>  The area along the Arctic Circle </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Temperate climate </p></td><td><p>  Central European, West Siberian Plain, Far East </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Subtropical climate </p></td><td><p>  Black Sea coast, Caucasus </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  As you can see, there is no <span>equatorial belt</span> and some intermediate types.  What is characterized by each of the above can be studied in detail, starting from the pole and moving down the map. </p><h2>  Arctic climate </h2><p>  Also known as polar, a similar type is characteristic of zones near the pole.  It is included in the types of climates in Russia - the table begins with this particular variant of weather conditions.  In general, two varieties of it are distinguished.  The first is the polar climatic zone in the Arctic, and the second is in the Antarctic.  Weather conditions in such territories are notable for their severity, which does not imply a person's comfortable living.  Throughout the year, the zone is characterized by minus temperatures, even in August the air can only warm up to five degrees.  This period is called the polar summer, it lasts only a few weeks or does not occur at all.  Winter also has a duration and a little snow.  The average temperature is determined by the territory: the type of climate assumes both minus ten in the Atlantic Ocean, and up to thirty-five degrees below zero in the Pacific.  The belt is characterized by a minimum rainfall not exceeding three hundred millimeters.  There is practically no vegetation on such lands; only lichens and mosses survive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monsoon type of climate" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/748296.jpg" width="600"></div>

A moderate type of climate prevails between 45 and 65 degrees in the Northern Hemisphere and within 42 and 58 in the Southern.  It is characterized by a clear division of the year into four seasons with two transitional (spring and autumn), warm (summer) and cold (winter).  The weather is characterized by periodic cloudiness, precipitation is formed under the influence of cyclones and anticyclones.  The closer the area is to the ocean, the more noticeable their impact.  Moreover, the farther the area is from the water area, the stronger the temperature fluctuation becomes.  Transitional seasons are usually long, with long lows and rises.  The average temperatures of the coldest month, January, can be from 10 to 40 below zero, everything is determined by the specific location of the region.  The hottest month is July (average temperature is about 21 degrees Celsius).  The table describing the types of climates in Russia assigns most of the territories to the <span>temperate zone</span> .  It is also characteristic of the United States and most of Europe.  Coniferous and mixed forests, sometimes forest-steppes, are widespread in such a zone.  Year-round vegetation is not possible due to the changing seasons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Continental climate" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/748297.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tropical climate </h2><p>  It is characteristic for lands located between 20 and 30 degrees north or south latitude.  Tropical is included in the main types of climate.  It is characterized by extremely low humidity and minimal rainfall, the predominance of high-pressure anticyclones, which leads to frequent sunny days.  It often blows strong dry winds, which are the cause of the appearance of a sandstorm in the desert.  In such an area there are no four seasons, which suggests a temperate climatic zone.  The climate type of the tropics provides only two seasons - cold and warm, with temperature fluctuations within thirty degrees.  Record heat was plus fifty eight.  This type is also distinguished by noticeable diurnal fluctuations, sometimes reaching up to thirty degrees.  For example, in the summer the air heats up to forty-five, and cools down to fifteen in the evening.  Rarely, frosts occur at night.  As mentioned above, this type of climate forms deserts.  The most famous is the Sahara.  The tropical climate is typical of Mexico, North and South Africa, Arabia and Australia.  In the humidified areas of these territories, one can find savannah and deciduous forest zones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of climates in Russia, table" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/750047.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Equatorial climate </h2><p>  This variant of weather is characteristic of regions of the central belt of the Earth.  Just a few hundred kilometers south and north of the equator is just such a zone.  It is included in the main types of climate, of which there are four.  Equatorial weather has the highest temperatures all year round.  The average is about 25 degrees.  In the daytime, the air can warm up to forty, and cool down to fifteen at night.  During the year, this temperature does not change.  Other types of climate are characterized by at least a small change of seasons, while the equatorial is a constant summer.  The maximum decrease in average monthly temperature is only two degrees in the winter months.  In addition, there is extremely heavy rainfall, presented in the form of a shower with a thunderstorm.  Their number can reach tens of thousands of millimeters.  Due to the high temperature, evaporation in this area is stably good.  Equatorial climate is also distinguished by the length of daylight, reaching twelve hours.  This zone is characterized by rich flora and fauna.  Almost half of all existing species of animals and plants are found in the equatorial climate belt.  It is characteristic of South America, Africa and Indonesia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Territory: type of climate" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/748301.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Subpolar climate </h2><p>  It is worth talking about intermediate options.  You can easily determine the type of climate in the Arctic or at the equator, but what about, say, the tundra?  It combines the properties of polar and moderate!  Therefore, scientists have identified intermediate options.  The subpolar climate is characterized by a low evaporation rate with precipitation of five hundred millimeters, which leads to the occurrence of swamps.  Summer in such areas is cold and short, with a temperature not exceeding fifteen degrees of heat, and in winter it drops to minus forty-five.  The territory is covered by permafrost and is characterized by minimal vegetation in the form of lichens.  Such weather distinguishes the northern parts of Russia, Canada, Greenland, Scandinavia, Alaska and Antarctica. </p><h2>  Subtropical climate </h2><p>  This strip stretches between 30 and 40 degrees north or south latitude.  It separates the moderate type of climate from tropical.  In the subtropics are the United States, Asia, the Mediterranean, Japan, New Zealand and Australia.  <span>The subtropical climate</span> is considered the best for human health.  Two seasons can be distinguished in it: dry and warm in summer and cool and humid in winter, which passes under the influence of air masses moving from temperate zones.  The annual temperature amplitude is quite large.  In summer, the air warms up to thirty-five, falling to two degrees on a winter night.  During the day, the differences are small.  July and August are considered the warmest, January and February are the coldest.  In the southern hemisphere, the situation is reversed.  The subtropical climate is characterized by evergreen forests, sometimes semi-deserts.  A variety of flora guarantees the weather, providing year-round vegetation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Determine the type of climate" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/748305.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Subequatorial climate </h2><p>  This type of weather prevails on lands located just below the tropical zone.  He is transient.  In summer, equatorial masses dominate here with heavy rainfall; up to six thousand millimeters can fall.  In winter, the time comes for tropical monsoons, which provide the territory with dry and warm air.  During a drought, the amount of precipitation does not exceed fifteen millimeters.  This leads to the fact that in this zone two seasons can be clearly divided: the period of rains and the months of drought.  At the same time, the temperature remains quite high throughout the year.  In the winter months, it decreases only a couple of degrees.  In addition, the daily amplitude is also small: nights, as a rule, are almost as warm as the days.  The subequatorial climate is characterized by moist forests, in which many animals live - rodents, predators, artiodactyls. </p><h2>  Marine climate </h2><p>  It is also worth highlighting the various zones located within the same belt.  One can distinguish a temperate marine or tropical <span>marine climate,</span> which are characterized by some similarities, despite impressive differences.  So, this type is characteristic of territories on the coast.  It is characterized by minimal fluctuations in both annual and daily temperatures and very soft transitions of the seasons.  The marine climate is characterized by strong winds, high clouds and constant humidity.  Such a territory can be found, for example, in <span>Western Europe.</span> </p><h2>  Continental climate </h2><p>  Such weather prevails in the regions located further beyond the marine climate zone.  What are its features?  The continental type of climate is characterized by sunny weather with anticyclones and an impressive amplitude of both annual and daily temperatures.  Here, summer quickly replaces winter.  The continental type of climate can be further divided into temperate, harsh and ordinary.  The best example is the central part of the territory of Russia. </p><h2>  Monsoon climate </h2><p>  This type of weather is characterized by a sharp difference in winter and summer temperatures.  In the warm season, the weather is formed under the influence of winds blowing on land from the sea.  Therefore, in summer the monsoon type of climate resembles a marine one, with heavy rains, high clouds, humid air and strong winds.  In winter, the direction of the air masses changes.  The monsoon type of climate begins to resemble a continental one - with clear and frosty weather and minimal rainfall throughout the season.  Such environmental conditions are characteristic of several Asian countries - they are found in Japan, the Far East and northern India. </p>
