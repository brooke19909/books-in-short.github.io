His career is not over at the moment, and he continues to delight his fans. </p><h2>  Curriculum Vitae </h2><p>  John Glover was born in the city of Salisbury, <span>Maryland (USA)</span> on August 7, 1944.  Since childhood, he dreamed of becoming an actor and in 1966 received a university diploma in drama. </p><p>  John Glover was very purposeful in his youth.  After graduating from university, he moved to New York and three years later he got a role in the popular play “The Fragrance of Flowers”.  And after three more - for the first time he rose to the Broadway stage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="john glover" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1424170.jpg" width="422"></div>

    <p>  The actor began his career in cinema in 1973 and has since starred in more than a hundred films, between which he continued to play in performances, and also participated in television shows. </p><p>  Today, in addition to filming, John Glover teaches in his own school for future actors and does charity work, helping people with Alzheimer's disease. </p><h2>  The most successful films </h2><p>  The main genres of films with Glover are thriller, comedy and drama.  The favorite type of hero is a cold and thoughtful scoundrel.  So the actor appeared in the films “Picked Up For Big”, “The White Knight”, “Chocolate War”, “Gremlins-2”, “Night Killers”, etc.  The devil from Brimstone performed by Glover is simply amazing.  The actor was also successful in his negative role in the debut for him series “Scorched by Fury”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="John Glover in his youth" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1424169.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, John Glover can not be called an actor of one role.  So, he remarkably coped with the role of a person dying from AIDS in the drama "Freezing";  in the television movie George Washington, he made an excellent general;  in the series "Starting Point" - a genius-Nazi;  and in the movie "David" - a crazy dad. </p><h2>  Smallville Secrets </h2><p>  In the sensational series “Smallville Secrets”, John Glover played the cruel and treacherous Lionel Luttor.  And this role, perhaps, can be called one of the most successful in the entire career of an actor.  True, no matter how hard the master “on villains” tried to appear before the viewer in the guise of a notorious scoundrel, critics noted that in Lionel, notes of a cheerful and light character that Glover possessed still slipped.  By the way, colleagues on the set, who worked with John on "The Secrets," note these features.  So, for example, <span>Michael Rosenbaum,</span> who played Luttor's son, calls Glover very hardworking and talented, and actress Annette O`Tull - delightful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Smallville John Glover" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1424171.jpg" width="327"></div>

    <p>  A cheerful, bright and a little reckless actor had a lot of funny things in life.  One of the latter happened in 2014, when the phrase “John - Glover.  The decisive battle.  Who will win?".  Fans of the actor already thought that their favorite was crazy and was going to fight with himself.  But in fact, it was a duel between two athletes, wrestlers, and the phrase should have read as follows: “John Jones - Glover Teixeira.  The decisive battle.  Who will win?" </p><p>  Here is such a confusion with the names and surnames.  And John Glover is in good health with health, and he continues to delight the audience with his work, and charge his friends with a huge positive. </p>
