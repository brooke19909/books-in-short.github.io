No one has any complaints about its quality, which is a rarity.  As a rule, tourists notice flaws.  But not at the Atlantis Hotel, whose helpful staff tries to please absolutely all the guests. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Residents of the hotel during the holidays do not even have time to figure out how many restaurants and bars work in the building.  There are really a lot of them.  A buffet is served at Kaleidoscope.  According to reviews, the food offered to guests is invariably tasty and fresh.

Gourmet establishments and food courts - all this can be found in the building.  It is simply not possible to visit all the restaurants in one vacation.  Therefore, there is always a reason to return here again.  Many chefs of institutions can boast Michelin stars, which speaks for itself about the level.  The main restaurants of the hotel are Kaleidoscope and Safron, they are always crowded. </p><p>  It is very interesting to visit the Ocean underground complex, the main attraction of which is a huge aquarium with fish and a chic selection of dishes with seafood.  Among the huge variety of restaurants it is difficult to choose the best.  Each of them is good in its own way and specializes in a particular cuisine.  When choosing a place where you intend to spend a pleasant evening, based on what dishes you prefer. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  The city hotel impresses with its magnitude and magnificence.  You can go beyond its territory only in order to see Dubai.  Some tourists believe that it is removed from the center, because it is located on top of the Palm Jumeirah.  But skeptics will be able to find flaws in everything.  In general, the hotel has all the required facilities that are needed for relaxation.  The most delighted is the water park, which attracts people from all over the emirate.  There are always a lot of people in it.  But from this he does not become less magnificent.  Experienced travelers believe that this water park can safely be called the best among those in which they managed to visit.  You will not find such extreme slides anywhere. </p><p>  Older people and children really like the large wave pool and slow river.  In the water park a lot of entertainment.  You can even purchase a subscription with unlimited access to the water complex.  No less impressive is the dolphinarium.  Tourists strongly recommend visiting it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kojaro.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Atlantis The Palm Dubai Water Park" class="if uuid-2961168" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2961168.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the fact that tourists put aside enthusiastic reviews about the hotel, there are small nuances that not all guests like.  For example, if you purchased a ticket with half board, drinks will still be paid for you, and this applies even to ordinary water.  With all the luxury of a hotel complex, this looks a bit odd. </p><p>  The hotel has a stunningly long and beautiful beach.  It is well equipped and kept clean.  On the coast you can spend hours admiring the sea.  But the purity of the water leaves much to be desired.  Unfortunately, this situation is observed throughout Palm Jumeirah. </p><p>  The extensive coast of the hotel allows a large number of guests to relax, who absolutely do not interfere with each other.  Despite the large concentration of tourists, there are always places for everyone.  There are a lot of sunbeds and awnings on the beach. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  The hotel can be safely called year-round, as there are many tourists at any time of the year.  This unprecedented demand is explained by the developed infrastructure, the presence of a large number of pools and the presence of a water park. </p>
