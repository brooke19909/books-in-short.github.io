The best beaches on the shores of the Gulf of Finland: map, photos and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Gulf of Finland is a site in the east of the Baltic Sea, washing the shores of three countries: Finland, Estonia and Russia.  In Estonia, it is visited by the cities of Tallinn, Toila, Sillamae, Paldiski and Narva-J√µesuu, in Finland - Helsinki, Kotka and Hanko, and in Russia - St. Petersburg (including the towns adjacent to it), Sosnovy Bor, Primorsk, Vyborg, Vysotsk and Ust-Luga. </p><h2>  Finland </h2><p>  Sea cities of the country literally come to life with the advent of summer - more and more people begin to travel to nature and spend free time on the beach.  This also applies to residents of Russia. </p><p>  Domestic tourists travel to their neighbors on vacation regularly, since here you can find a completely amazing combination: northern nature and the beautiful <span>southern sea.</span>  And although in Finland there are many wonderful places worthy of attention, there is one that you should definitely pay attention first of all to those who wish to relax on the shores of the Baltic Sea. </p><h2>  Helsinki </h2><p>  The capital of the Finnish state boasts about three dozen beaches, of which 11 are located on the seashore.  The best beaches in the Gulf of Finland in this area are Hietaniemi, Pihlajasaari, Rajasaari, Tervasaari and Tuorinniemi. </p><h2>  Hietaniemi Beach </h2><p>  The central beach of the capital is the most visited vacation spot of local and visiting guests.  It is clean and comfortable, the shore is well maintained and equipped with changing cabins, toilets, litter bins, a playground for children. </p>

    <p>  You can only get to it by ship or ferry, but the beauty of this corner of Finnish land and the tranquility and convenience of its beach are worth the effort. </p><p>  Pihlajasaari was once an island of mansions and cottages.  Some of them have survived to this day, hiding from a prying eye among rocks and trees.  Later, however, it turned into a resort area. </p><p>  Why is he one of the best?  The island of Pihlajasaari is a combination of beautiful nature, convenient sandy beaches and a landscaped area.  There is also a beach for nudists.  It offers gazebos for cooking, a marina, saunas, restaurants, and you can also put up tents for the weekend. </p><h2>  Estonia </h2><p>  Like Finland, this country has access to the sea, and, like in Finland, there is where to relax and what to see.  The main <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãresorts of the</span> country are P√§rnu, Kuressaare, Haapsalu, Toila and Narva-J√µesuu, of which the last two have beaches on the Gulf of Finland. </p><h2>  Toila </h2><p>  This small resort town can offer a wonderful sandy coast, which looks quite peculiar thanks to the mounds of flat stones here and there.  It has <span>coast guard, it</span> also offers paid parking, Wi-Fi, information stands and children's attractions, and, of course, toilets and changing cabins. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This beach (the Gulf of Finland in this resort part of Estonia is clean and meets sanitary standards) is quite popular both among Estonians themselves and among foreign tourists, it is available around the clock and is free.  In the summertime, a tavern with soft drinks, snacks and ice cream is open here. </p><h2>  Narva-J√µesuu </h2><p>  The Northern Riviera, as this resort is also called, has the longest beach in Estonia - its length is about 9 kilometers.  Nearby is a coniferous forest. </p><p>  On the seashore, vacationers are equipped with changing cabins and toilets, campfire places, an outdoor shower, children's attractions, and volleyball courts. </p>

    <h2>  Niva </h2><p>  Another noteworthy beach (the Gulf of Finland and the resorts on its shores in Estonia enjoy well-deserved respect and popularity) is located in the town of Nyva - only 120 km from Tallinn.  <span>Pine forests,</span> various animals and birds live side by side with the pure ‚Äúsinging‚Äù sands of the many-kilometer coast. </p><p>  Nyva is also more than 20 picnic areas, barbecue facilities, tables, about a dozen toilets, even for people with disabilities.  The beach is cleaned every day, so everything is very clean and tidy.  Tents are permitted everywhere except the forest. </p><p>  However, this beach may not be a very suitable place for families with small children - the water here is sharp, the depth reaches two meters, just a dozen steps from the coast. </p><h2>  Pirita Beach, Tallinn </h2><p>  Within Tallinn is one of the best places for recreation in it.  Pines here very close to the coast, covered with fine sand, together forming a large, well-maintained, over 4 km long beach.  The Gulf of Finland in the summer warms up here to a temperature of + 16 ¬∞  ... + 20 ¬∞ , making swimming, especially on hot days, quite comfortable.  Water near two other metropolitan ‚Äúsandy shores‚Äù - Stromi and Kakum√§e - usually warms less. </p><p>  The infrastructure of Pirita is developed at a decent level - there are toilets, changing rooms, showers, along the entire beach there are paths for cyclists. </p><p>  In addition, there is something to do on the shore for outdoor enthusiasts - yachting center with a harbor is at guests' disposal, a little away from it is an entertainment complex with bars, restaurants, gyms and discos are often held. </p><p>  However, Pirita has its drawbacks - it is very popular, and therefore it is almost always noisy here, a lot of people (and as a result there is nowhere to place your sunbed), you can not sunbathe nude. </p>

    <h2>  Russia </h2><p>  Located between the two above-mentioned countries, Russia also boasts a proximity to the Gulf of Finland and noteworthy beaches on its shore.  Even the inhabitants of the ‚Äúnorthern capital‚Äù - St. Petersburg - can sunbathe in the sun in the summer and relax under the measured whisper of the waves without leaving it. </p><h2>  Affectionate Beach, St. Petersburg </h2><p>  The village called Solnechnoye is located in the resort <span>area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSt. Petersburg, it</span> is known from the XVIII.  "Tender" appeared here in the late 1960s - early 1970s, and from then until today is considered one of the best that the Gulf of Finland can offer.  The beaches, the photos of which are shown above, surpass it in terms of infrastructure, but lose in terms of accessibility and originality. </p>

    <p>  Affectionate is public, it is free and available around the clock.  It offers visitors - changing cabins, toilets, litter bins and even a foot fountain. </p><p>  Volleyball fans will find about 10 playgrounds on Laskovoy.  Almost all summer there are competitions in this sport.  There are several cafes and restaurants within reach. </p><p>  Starting from 2012, it is no longer permitted to make bonfires and make barbecue on the coast; separate platforms with tables, benches and barbecue grills act as a ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  "Tender" is not a unique beach: the Gulf of Finland, or rather, its substantial coastal part in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort village of Komarovo, has become a specially protected natural area, where it is forbidden to light a fire and set up a camp. </p><p>  Rospotrebnadzor does not recommend swimming here, however, as on most beaches in the Gulf of Finland, but Laskovoi regulars assure that the southern part is the best place for swimming: there are no stones and is deep enough. </p>
