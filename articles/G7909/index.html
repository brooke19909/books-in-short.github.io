    <p>  MGTS is a company with a long history.  According to some reports, it was founded even under Tsarist Russia in 1882, when the first telephone exchange in Moscow was opened on Kuznetsk bridge.  Now the largest shareholder of MGTS is MTS and its subsidiaries. </p>

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  One of the most famous products of the company is the Internet from MGTS (fiber optic).  Reviews about this service are found in a wide range.  Now access to the network within the framework of this product is used by several hundred thousand Moscow subscribers.  MGTS also provides similar types of services to legal entities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For a long time, the main communication technology with the network in MGTS networks was DSL telephone channels.  But gradually gaining the status of leading another method of accessing the Internet - GPON from MGTS.  Reviews about it as a whole reflect the positive ratings of users in terms of changing access technologies.  The fact is that when using GPON channels, fiber is used in its pure form, which allows data to be transmitted at a very high speed. </p><h2>  Services - more and more diverse </h2><p>  Since 2009, MGTS has been providing Triple Play services based on the current Internet infrastructure.  The service "Internet TV".  MGTS, reviews of which are largely determined by the quality of not only the main service - providing access to the network, but also in terms of additional services, is considered by many Muscovites to be a reliable provider of modern TV content.  The range of channels within the framework of tariff packages from this provider is quite diverse.  In the same year, the Internet provider "MGTS" (reviews of many users very positively characterize this initiative) began to sell access services to the network in a "box format".  Buying it, the client could start using the Internet simply by connecting the equipment to the computer and not thinking about the settings.  While services from many other providers require in many cases to call the wizard for the appropriate work with the equipment. </p><h2>  Boxed Solution </h2><p>  Actually, the equipment in the framework of the service in question, even externally looks like a box, decorated in the corporate style of the company.  It has quite comfortable instructions for reading by an inexperienced user on how to organize home Internet.  MGTS (reviews of many customers indicate an extremely positive assessment of this aspect) compiled the corresponding ‚Äúboxed‚Äù manual so that it would be possible to go online without contacting the support service. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Although, if necessary, you can always call the MGTS contact center - its number is indicated on the "box".  At the disposal of the user - marked manual, as well as a modem.  As a rule, it belongs to the budget series, however, the functionality of this device, as many experts note, is quite at the level. </p><h2>  Unusual and promising services </h2><p>  Among other notable MGTS services is the <span>Parental Control</span> service <span>.</span>  Through it, adults can control the use of the Internet by children - mainly by allowing or denying online access on certain days and hours.  The technologies MGTS works with are constantly evolving. So, in the fall of 2014, various sources reported that the provider was going to introduce complex algorithms for analyzing Internet traffic.  This type of technology will allow, as expected, effective filtering of online packages.  It is also supposed to be used as a marketing tool. </p><h2>  GPON Technology </h2><p>  We will study in more detail the nuances regarding the most modern technology, according to which this Moscow provider provides Internet access - GPON from MGTS.  User reviews, as we noted above, characterize this kind of communication channel as having a very high speed.  The corresponding figure can even reach hundreds of megabits / sec for home Internet users.  At the same time, high <span>data transfer rate</span> is not the only advantage of GPON (also called "Jeepon") over previous technologies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Communication is stable </h2><p>  By using GPON channels, reliability and stability of the connection are achieved.  Disconnections, freezes, and other malfunctions that are characteristic of technologies of the previous types are not typical for networks using optical fiber.  Another remarkable feature of GPON is that you can adapt a wide range of additional services to it, which, in fact, does the Moscow provider we are considering.  MGPS Internet Jeepon, reviews of which in many respects indicate that the above-described advantages of the technology are not theory, but reality, is supplemented by a large number of other services available to the company's customers.  Communication with the network is carried out through a user modem, which, as a rule, is provided by MGTS for rent.  Modern models of relevant devices allow you to access the Internet via Wi-Fi.  This means that you can access the network from multiple devices at once. </p><h2>  ADSL Technology </h2><p>  Of course, even in such a technologically developed city as Moscow, there are areas and houses that the fiber has not yet reached, or there is no technical possibility to connect everyone to it.  In this case, MGTS offers to organize home Internet access to its client via ADSL access.  In principle, most of the needs of modern users, this technology is quite capable of satisfying.  In particular, with regard to the aspect of speed - when using ADSL, it is quite possible to achieve an indicator of 7-8 megabits, or even more.  To view pages, videos, listen to music, talk on Skype, this is quite enough. </p>

    <h2>  The main thing - the phone is at hand </h2><p>  ADSL technology has some advantage in terms of convenience - the current telephone line is used as a communication channel.  It is not necessary, as in the case with GPON, to mount something additionally.  Moreover, the phone itself remains functional - the digital signals of the modem are filtered using a small splitter connected to the network.  In this case, when talking on the phone, the subscriber will not hear third-party signals generated during the operation of the ADSL modem. </p><h2>  Tariffing </h2><p>  Consider the pricing principles that the Moscow operator adheres to in a fairly competitive market.  According to some user reviews, the Internet is considered by MGTS as a flagship service.  Accordingly, any errors and miscalculations at the tariff level are probably undesirable here - customers can easily go to another provider, of which there are a lot in each district of the capital.  Among the most notable features of the tariffication characteristic of MGTS is the postpaid payment system.  That is, you can first use the network, and then pay the invoice - and in so many ways. </p><p>  Due to technological differences between GPON and ADSL channels, the pricing principles for each of them differ at MGTS. </p><ul><li>  ADSL access can be much cheaper - for example, there is an option with an Internet connection for 150 rubles per month.  True, the speed in this case will be relatively low - 3 megabits. </li><li>  In turn, the most inexpensive tariff for GPON connections from MGTS is 300 rubles per month at a speed of 15 megabits. </li></ul><p>  The general regularity for both tariffs is that the more specific a proposal is, the cheaper the speed increase, if expressed in individual megabits. </p>

    <p>  But, as we have already noted above, in practice, the optical fiber used when accessing the Internet from MGTS (many users confirm this) may not provide a noticeable increase in page loading speed.  Just because the specificity of the corresponding Internet traffic does not imply the transfer of a large amount of data. </p><h2>  Tariffs are competitive </h2><p>  The MGTS Internet tariffs ‚Äî the reviews of many customers testify to this ‚Äî are quite competitive, although some experts admit that there are quite a few Moscow providers whose rates are lower for comparable access speeds and connection stability.  At the same time, MGTS may offer an option in which tariffing will occur not on a monthly basis, but on a daily basis.  Many users are impressed by this opportunity.  Access to the Internet becomes possible only on those days when access is really necessary.  You do not have to pay for the month in this case. </p><p>  In general, the feedback sent by users to the major Internet access provider MGTS is very positive.  Moscow is a city in which competition between providers is quite fierce.  And therefore, if the degree of customer mood is positive, this may be an indicator of the success of the company.  And in many ways this is, according to experts, precisely with the attractive tariff policy of this provider. </p><h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  One of the basic tools for interaction between MGTS and Internet users is the online Personal Account service.  In it, the client of the Moscow provider can receive all the necessary information regarding any services that it uses or plans to use.  Using convenient online tools, you can manage services. </p><h2>  Assessment of prospects </h2><p>  We studied the main features of technologies and the tariffing of services of one of the largest Moscow telecommunication companies, observed the degree of mood that contained reviews.  The MGTS Internet, as we said above, is considered by one of the IT experts as one of the key services.  At the same time, it will also be useful to evaluate the marketing prospects for promoting the brand in the capital telecommunications market. </p><p>  According to some experts, the company has every chance to consolidate its status as one of the leading suppliers of communications in the Russian capital.  MGTS home Internet, television, fixed-line communications, as experts and many users who leave feedback on thematic portals believe, are services that are provided by the provider with the optimal combination of quality and tariffs. </p><p>  There is evidence that MGTS plans to occupy about half of the broadband market in Moscow by 2016.  At the same time, the share of revenue from the provision of relevant services will be about 60%.  As part of this strategy, MGTS management plans to cover all the districts of Moscow in which it is present and provides services with a GPON network.  In addition, as evidenced by the reviews left by experts, the Internet "MGTS" plans to actively provide not only individuals, but also organizations.  At the same time, access to online will be supplemented by other services, such as, for example, cloud software, in particular, accounting, as well as hosting. </p><p>  In addition, as evidenced by the opinions and reviews encountered in the expert environment, the Internet is considered by MGTS as a leading, but not the only significant service from the point of view of the <span>global</span> business development <span>strategy</span> .  There is evidence that the company plans to take one of the leading positions also in the digital TV market, bringing its share in this segment to 26%. </p>

    <h2>  Competition is the engine of progress </h2><p>  True, competing companies, experts say, will try to do a lot so that the Moscow provider does not succeed in doing everything exactly as planned.  And this despite the fact that MGTS has the highest communications infrastructure in terms of technology.  Many of the largest providers in Moscow, which are direct competitors of MGTS, are actively improving their own facilities.  For example, there is an opinion that other promising communication standards, such as, for example, DOCSIS, can compete with GPON technology used by MGTS.  Some Moscow providers are mastering them quite actively. </p><h2>  MGTS: reviews </h2><p>  What is the degree of sentiment in the customer reviews of the Moscow City Telephone Network?  User opinions can be conditionally classified in several directions. </p><p>  The first concerns the tariff policy of the provider.  The reviews are rather neutral with respect to it: on the one hand, it cannot be said, as MGTS clients believe, that the prices are high, on the other, there are telecommunication companies that offer more competitive rates. </p><p>  Another group of reviews characterizes the quality of communication itself.  Opinions here are very different.  Critical ones reflect some instability of online channels in terms of using popular file hosting services, trackers.  However, regarding this point of view, there are counterarguments that are based on the thesis that the actual responsibility for the quality of communication in this case lies more with the owner of the site than with MGTS.  Positive reviews reflect a high speed of access to most Internet resources, minimal ping (response between request and server response), and stability of communication.  In many respects, such sentiments, experts believe, may be due precisely to the advantage of fiber-optic communication channels that MGTS uses. </p><p>  Another direction in the spectrum of opinions of the company's customers reflects the quality of the technical support of the provider.  The opinions here are different, but on the whole a positive degree is maintained in the estimates.  This may be due, according to analysts, high competition in the flagship segment in which MGTS operates.  If the subscriber does not like something in communicating with the support service, he can immediately decide to change the provider. </p>
