  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tatar-Mongol invasion</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Tatar-Mongol invasion of Russia left a significant mark in the history of the country.  Even now, after many centuries, historians continue to study this difficult period, the main characteristics of which were enslavement and bloodshed.  The long yoke of the Golden Horde was a significant historical event primarily because it lasted almost two and a half centuries.  The Tatar-Mongol invasion began in the 13th century, at the very beginning.  The first battle between the Russians and the Mongols took place in 1223 on <span>the Kalka River.</span>  In this battle, the Russian army was completely defeated by the steppes, and six Russian princes fell on the battlefield. </p><p>  The dominance of another faith and culture over a long period of time left not only a significant mark in the history of Russia, but also determined its further historical development.  What was the Russian state in those ancient times?  How did it happen that large territories fell under the domination of the Tatars and the Mongols?  Historians repeatedly return to the study of this issue and unequivocally agree on one thing: the reluctance of the then major principalities to unite into one strong state allowed them to become easy prey for an armada of nomads.  The Tatar-Mongol invasion, not having received the proper resistance, managed to capture the vast territory of Russia. </p><p>  In large <span>Russian cities</span> then approximately 20-30 thousand inhabitants lived.  During the siege, they could identify up to 10 thousand armed defenders.  The cities basically defended themselves, alone and the invaders, moving with an army of 60-70 thousand, easily occupied them in just a few days, establishing their order everywhere. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Tatar-Mongol invasion very quickly led to the fact that a different order was established on the territory of Russia.  For example, Russian princes regularly bowed to the Horde and left their children there as hostages.  The khans issued special labels to the princes, which meant a certain right to the principality, which operated until the second half of the XIV century.  In addition, the khans obliged the Russian princes to send the best warriors for battles on their first order.  Russian princes at that time were just vassals of the Golden Horde. </p><p>  In the 50s of the 13th century, the Tatar-Mongol invasion of Russia, according to historians, contributed to the economic ruin of the country.  The bala established an excellent tribute collection system; it was collected by special Muslim merchants, who were called "Besermen."  They bought their right to taxes from the ruler - the Mongol khan.  At that time, there were more than 14 types of various taxes.  The Tatar-Mongol invasion was characterized by an interesting feature, which consisted in the fact that only the clergy were freed from requisitions. </p><p>  In 1262, the rebellious Russian people expelled the pickers and in the same period there was a great split between the Golden Horde and the <span>Mongol Empire.</span>  The rulers of the Golden Horde in ancient Russia were called "kings", as in Byzantium. </p><p>  The Mongol invasion of Russia and its consequences for many centuries will be studied by scientific historians, but no matter what arguments are given, the enslavement of one nation by another, the forcible planting of faith, culture and customs have not benefited any other state in history.  The subjugation of one nation to another always brings global destruction and economic decline.  According to some historians, perhaps this is where the not so high economic development of Russia lies later in comparison with more successful Western countries.  During the capture years, Russia was at a higher stage of development in socio-economic terms than the Mongol-Tatars, so the years of enslavement became a significant step back for it.  There is evidence that at this time the development of complex crafts stopped, which undoubtedly contributed to the decline.  The cities of Russia were destroyed, but no new ones were built, the country's population fell sharply, and in some cities and villages life did not revive for centuries. </p><p>  Some historians believe that the Tatar-Mongol invasion of Russia and its consequences have affected many centuries on the development of our country, which, just getting out of the yoke, gradually began to recover and strengthen.  Scientists are sure that it was during this period that the foundations of the future Russian Empire were laid.  It was precisely the difficulties that rallied the Russian people and contributed to the formation of the foundations for building the future united state. </p>
