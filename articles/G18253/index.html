Those who love exotic, he certainly will not leave indifferent.  And you can save on travel by choosing a cheaper hotel, for example, Dona sa <span>Maria 2</span> Cavelossim in the south of Goa. </p><h2>  What to expect from a trip to Goa? </h2><p>  As often happens, India causes a mixed reaction among those who arrived here for the first time on vacation.  Too noisy and <span>exotic country,</span> which should first be studied, understood, then to fall in love and not pay attention to the disadvantages that are inherent in it.  Goa is no exception, and judging by the reviews of vacationers, opinions about it are the most controversial. </p><p>  Among the advantages of this Indian state: </p><ul><li>  Great climate in the beach season with the gentle sun and warm ocean. </li><li>  In the southern part of Goa, the beaches seemed to have come down from posters advertising delicious chocolate bars.  Golden sand, the gentle whisper of the surf, the absence of a large number of bodies on the sand, palm trees along the coast, all this is a big and greasy ‚Äúplus‚Äù for relaxing in Dona sa Maria 2, for example. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  A large selection of seafood prepared with local spices that give them a bright taste and aroma, freshly squeezed juices is a dream for those who want to know what a healthy and wholesome food is. </li><li>  Sights are represented by architectural monuments of both Portuguese origin and Indian. </li><li>  The opportunity to get yoga classes or open your chakras with real masters, as well as undergo a therapeutic massage course for those who care about health, is another tick in favor of relaxing in Goa. </li></ul><p>  A visa to India is issued for a period of up to 30 days only after arrival in the country, but you must first submit an electronic application.  Usually, after 3 days it is approved.  The consular fee will cost about $ 65. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What can upset in Goa? </h2><p>  At this resort you can spend your vacation, both very expensive and elegant, and budget.  This is what he attracts tourists every year.  The winter holiday months of December and January are especially popular. </p><p>  You can save money by choosing a small home hotel.  In such places there are no chic rooms, but they are all cozy, equipped with the necessary furniture and with a pleasant level of service.  For example, the Dona sa Maria 2 hotel, located 7 km from Cavelossim, is one of these. </p><p>  Among the not very pleasant moments in Goa, vacationers note: </p><ul><li>  Bad tap water can cause health problems, so fruits should be washed with bottled water.  When buying it in a store, you need to carefully look at the cork, so as not to be victims of scammers. </li><li>  The lack of large stores deprives the pleasure of shopping. </li><li>  Often entertainment can only be reached by bike or car. </li></ul><p>  Since Goa has no specially equipped playgrounds and pools, this resort is more suitable for couples without children and youth. </p><h2>  Location of the hotel Dona sa Maria 2 * </h2><p>  There are hotels, as if intended for a quiet, uncomplicated vacation, when most of the time you spend on the beach or on excursions.  These include Dona sa Maria 2. It is located at some distance from the beach, although many tour operators do not mention this.  It will take you about 20 minutes to get to the sea with a calm step, but the places that you have to go through are pleasing to the eye. </p><p>  The path to the beach lies along the picturesque fields and the small village of Fatrad, in which the dogs friendly wave their tails to the travelers.  Even in the evening, the path will be pleasant, since the road is well lit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The hotel itself is a family business.  Here you can not only relax, but also plunge into the atmosphere of creativity of local potters or taste the vegetables and fruits grown by village farmers. </p><p>  The village of Cavelossima, near which Dona sa Maria 2 is located (south of Goa, India) is famous for its beaches and silence, so lovers of noisy parties and nightlife will be bored here. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  According to travelers, being in silence in India is very difficult.  Life here is seething, day and night, but around the Dona sa Maria hv 2 hotel it is always quiet and calm.  Surrounded by <span>rice fields</span> where peacocks are walking, near a small village with several shops and souvenir shops, that‚Äôs all there is to the hotel. </p><p>  The hotel itself consists of a main two-story building and two bungalows.  Around it is a small landscaped garden where it is pleasant to spend time in quiet evenings.  The hotel is family run and the atmosphere is the same. </p>

    <p>  The main guests of the hotel are foreign pensioners, most often the British, who prefer to leave away from their damp, cold homeland in winter.  Given this contingent, it should be remembered that the Dona sa Maria 2 hotel is more suitable for a relaxing family or romantic vacation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  The hotel rooms, as noted by vacationers, have the necessary furniture, a shower and a toilet.  In the main building there are no air conditioners, only fans on the ceiling, but they are in the bungalow, so the price for the rooms is slightly different. </p><p>  If someone necessarily needs a TV and cable, then this hotel does not have them.  It is suitable for a real quiet vacation, when you can hear the sounds of the jungle in the windows, which begin right behind the bungalows and the sound of the ocean. </p><p>  All rooms have a balcony, where you can relax after the heat of the day or just watch the sunset.  Cleaning is carried out daily, linen and towels change every other day, which is a very good indicator for a 2 star hotel. </p>

    <p>  Both the hotel and its rooms are furnished in the traditional style of Goa residents, which gives it an incredible flavor.  The territory is in perfect cleanliness; neither plastic cups nor empty bottles are visible near the bar.  The staff is very friendly and hardworking. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel has little entertainment, but for a relaxing and quality holiday there are: </p><ul><li>  Pool with clear water and sun loungers arranged around. </li><li>  Restaurant and lobby bar. </li><li>  A garden with many birds. </li><li>  Free parking and laundry services. </li><li>  Bike rental is available directly at the hotel. </li><li>  Tables and chairs in the open air in the family recreation area. </li></ul><p>  Internet is available at the Dona sa Maria 2 hotel, but according to the reviews of its customers, it is paid in rooms and will cost 700 rupees per week, although you can pay hourly or per day.  In the public area, it is free. </p><p>  At the reception you can book any excursion, exchange currency, learn about interesting routes or nearby restaurants.  The currency exchange rate in the hotel itself is slightly lower than in the market, so if not in a hurry, then it is better to change money in the village. </p>

    <p>  Social life in Dona sa Maria 2 (reviews of vacationers report this) mainly takes place in the evenings by the pool.  Those who want complete silence prefer to book rooms in a bungalow away from the main building. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Since the hotel is designed for a quiet family vacation, the main attractions here are excursions in Goa, cycling and hiking, fishing.  The latter will especially appeal to even a novice, since there are many fish in the ocean and no one has left without a catch. </p><p>  Directly from local fishermen, you can rent everything you need and catch it yourself from the pier, or book sightseeing fishing at the hotel.  You can also rent a boat.  For three people, a boat with an experienced guide will cost about $ 100, but in this case the price can be brought down just like at an auction in any Indian bazaar. </p><p>  Parties are sometimes held on the beach for hotel guests, but otherwise, according to the Indians themselves, if you have a bike, you can find adventures to your liking in nearby villages. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel has a restaurant with excellent local and continental cuisine, but judging by the reviews of vacationers, the modest breakfasts that it offers are not suitable for everyone.  They include a couple of toasts, butter, coffee or tea and jam. </p><p>  Those who are accustomed to eating more densely in the morning prefer to have breakfast in cafes on the beach, where there is a large selection of dishes and drinks for every taste. </p>

    <p>  La Afra's restaurant is located right in the garden, so you can enjoy birdsong by choosing Chinese, Indian or Continental cuisine from the menu.  The portions are usually large and, as in many Indian restaurants, rice, seafood or chicken predominate. </p><p>  In the lobby of the hotel there is a cozy bar with a large selection of alcoholic and refreshing drinks.  Perhaps this is not enough for sophisticated tourists, but the Dona sa Maria 2 hotel service compensates for everything else.  The staff is very polite and everyone speaks English. </p><h2>  Restaurants near the hotel </h2><p>  Although the hotel itself is small, not far from it there are numerous restaurants where you can eat deliciously and very inexpensively.  According to customers, the cost of dishes in the restaurant at the hotel is slightly higher than in other cafes, but the food is incredibly tasty, so everyone chooses to overpay and have fun, or take a chance in another place and save money. </p><p>  Among the most popular cafes, according to tourists, are: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúHorns and hooves‚Äù, where a large portion of rice with green onions and shrimp will cost only 160 rupees, and delicious frashes from pineapples or oranges - from 70 rupees. </li><li>  The beach bar ‚ÄúLittle Tiger‚Äù is one of the cheapest, but with an excellent selection of local dishes, the preparation of which is pleasant to expect, watching entertainment programs. </li><li>  Those guests who want to visit the village of Cavelossim are expected in a small restaurant Blue Bird.  Here you can choose from Chinese, Indian and Goan cuisines, as well as a large number of incredibly delicious local pastries and desserts. </li></ul><p>  Hindus know how to cook deliciously, and Goa has many small cafes where you can eat cheaply.  Therefore, staying at Dona sa Maria 2, each of his clients can arrange a real ‚Äúbelly festival‚Äù and not deny anything to themselves either in the hotel restaurant or in the nearest cafes. </p><h2>  Attractions near the hotel </h2><p>  Since there is nothing remarkable around the hotel except rice fields, the jungle and the ocean, you can book an excursion to the most famous cultural centers of Goa or visit the city of Cavelossim, located nearby. </p><p>  It is famous for its restaurants and beaches and is in demand among wealthy Europeans.  But in addition to food and bathing, guests here expect: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dona sa maria 2 south goa india" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/1474011.jpg" width="600"></div>

Here you can buy spices for every taste. </li><li>  There are many small shops in the village where you can buy souvenirs, jewelry, clothes or books. </li></ul><p>  You can order a taxi directly from the hotel to Cavelossim or take the bus, which stops nearby. </p><h2>  Tips for hotel guests </h2><p>  Choosing to stay in Goa Dona sa Maria 2, it is worth remembering: </p><ul><li>  This is a small hotel, the owners of which honor local traditions and treat people of any faith and nationality well, so their culture should be respected in return. </li><li>  There are no televisions and poor telephony, so you should be prepared for informational silence.  This is a homely hotel without frills, but clean and comfortable. </li><li>  The hotel is designed for a relaxing family vacation, so you need to be prepared in advance that there is little entertainment. </li></ul><p>  Otherwise, a vacation in Goa, even in a 2 star hotel, remains beautiful and unforgettable.  All you need is a visa to India and a plane ticket. </p>
