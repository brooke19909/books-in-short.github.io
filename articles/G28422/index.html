    <p>  During the existence of railway communication in <span>Moscow, stations were</span> repeatedly renamed, so there is always confusion with their names.  This is especially true for older people who, after the last renaming, do not always remember new names that are relevant for today. </p><p>  As of the summer of 2015, the name of the Moscow-Oktyabrskaya station is Leningradsky Station.  <span>This building,</span> located on <span>Komsomolskaya Square,</span> is one of the oldest railway stations in the city.  It was erected in 1855.  Over its more than fifty years of history, the station has repeatedly changed its name. </p><p>  Now the station is one of the most popular in the capital, this is due to the fact that it is from here that you can leave from Moscow to St. Petersburg using high-speed or regular passenger trains.  That is why a Muscovite and a guest of the capital need to know how to get to the station and train station in order to begin their journey. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Leningradsky railway station and its history </h2>

    <p>  The building was erected in 1849, and then it was called the Nikolaev Station, in 1923 it was renamed the October Station, and only in 1937 it was given its current name.  In 1851, regular passenger traffic began to operate between Moscow and St. Petersburg, after which the station became a major interchange point, which remains to this day. </p><p>  In 1934, the station and the station were re-equipped, new ticket offices were installed, a mother and child room, as well as a post office appeared.  In 1950 and 1977, the railway station was reconstructed again, the interior of the premises was changed, and new premises for passengers and employees of the station were rebuilt. </p><p>  Passenger dead end station "Moscow-Oktyabrskaya" is the terminal on the main passage of the October <span>Railway "St. Petersburg-Moscow".</span>  The key difference between the station and the station is that it is the only railway complex in the capital that belongs to the October Railway, and not to the Moscow Railway, as it should be.  In the near future it is planned to return the historical name to the station - Nikolaevsky. </p><h2>  What's next? </h2>

    <p>  Moscow-Oktyabrskaya station, and the Leningradsky station, respectively, are located on the famous "Square of Three stations".  Kazan and Yaroslavsky stations are conveniently located in the neighborhood, which is very convenient for passengers traveling to different parts of Russia with a change in Moscow.  Just cross the road to get on the right train. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not far from the square is <span>the Moscow metro station</span> "Komsomolskaya".  In 2011, a <span>monument to George the Victorious</span> was erected on the square <span>.</span>  There is also a railway agency that provides passenger services, where you can contact in case of any problems while traveling by train. </p><h2>  Track development </h2><p>  The Moscow-Oktyabrskaya station as of 2015 has ten routes, half of which is reserved for suburban electric trains, the other half is intended for long-distance trains.  In the 1950s and 60s, the station had its own landing stage, which could be used by arriving and departing trains. </p><p>  In the mid-1970s, the station was left without a landing stage, but the vacant seat was not empty for a long time; construction of the Big Hall for the station immediately began on it, which lasted until 1977, inclusive.  At the same time, the station track was reconstructed, since then it has not changed in any way, except for periodic repairs. </p><h2>  Served Destinations </h2>

    <p>  Approximately 65% ​​of all trains leaving from the Moscow-Oktyabrskaya station go to St. Petersburg.  The station also serves trains running between Moscow and Veliky Novgorod, Pskov, Borovichi, Murmansk, Petrozavodsk, Ostashkov.  Trains to Helsinki also depart from here. </p><p>  According to statistics, the hourly passenger traffic of the station is 500-600 people.  The station receives branded trains “Red Arrow”, “Pskov”, “Arctic”, “Karelia”, “Megapolis”, “Leo Tolstoy”, etc. Recently a new route has been opened between Moscow and St. Petersburg, on which double-decker trains run compounds developed at one of the Russian plants.  The fare must be clarified at the box office. </p><p>  Moreover, it was here that the Sapsany high-speed electric trains began to run for the first time, especially for them the reconstruction of especially dangerous sections of the October route and station platforms in Moscow and St. Petersburg was carried out.  Sapsan is able to demonstrate an average speed of 160 km / h along the Moscow-St. Petersburg route, and it covers the distance between two cities in four and a half hours. </p><h2>  Suburban traffic </h2>

    <p>  "Moscow-Oktyabrskaya" also serves suburban trains running in the suburbs.  It is from here that one can leave for Klin, Kryukovo (Zelenograd), Konakovo, Tver and many other settlements.  A detailed schedule should be clarified in advance at the box office of the railway station, since it changes quite often. </p><p>  The reason for changing the schedule is the need for “technological” windows, during which specialists of the track service will be able to check the condition of the rail track and repair it.  The fare in an electric train must also be clarified at the ticket office of the station, it will directly depend on the distance of your trip. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2>

    <p>  "Moscow-October" - what station in Moscow?  How to get there? ”  - residents of the capital are lost in conjecture, trying to answer this question.  You can get to the “Three stations square” in a variety of ways, there is a metro nearby (Komsomolskaya station), which operates daily from 6 to 24 hours. </p><p>  You can also get to Komsomolskaya Square via bus routes No. 40 Pesochny pereulok - Novorogozhskaya ulitsa and No. 122 Sokolniki-Komsomolskaya square metro.  Trolleybus routes Nos. 14, 22, 41, 88 and tram routes Nos. 7, 13, 37, 50 also run nearby. You can also use the services of fixed-route taxis, but traveling around Moscow with things in them is not very convenient because of their low capacity. </p><p>  If you want individuality, you can order a taxi in one of the many services that provide these services.  But there is one significant drawback - the cost of the trip can be quite high, especially if you get to the station from a remote area of ​​the city. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now that you know exactly where the Moscow-Oktyabrskaya railway station is, it will be much easier for you to get there.  It’s best to take care in advance of acquiring train tickets for the route you are interested in, since the October Railway is very popular among passengers, especially with flights between Moscow and St. Petersburg. </p>
