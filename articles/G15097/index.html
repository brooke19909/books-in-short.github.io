    <p>  Since due to the high humidity in the rooms unexpected neighbors can quickly appear in the form of exotic and familiar animals (cockroaches, bugs) animals ... Alas, this is not uncommon for the number of rooms in Pattaya, especially with a long service life. </p><p>  Therefore, the choice of the Centara Pattaya Hotel 4 * hotel, reviews of which formed a high rating, excludes such "surprises".  It is especially important that the new hotel managed to earn so quickly a reputation as an institution with high quality services.  Among the advantages, tourists note: </p><ul><li>  convenient location of the hotel; </li><li>  comfortable rooms; </li><li>  the presence of Russian-speaking staff. </li></ul><h2>  What is important to know </h2><p>  When choosing a vacation in the Thai resort of Pattaya, you should consider some of the wishes of experienced travelers: </p><ul><li>  Before the trip, carefully read the cultural customs of the country.  The Kingdom of Thailand sacredly reveres its king and careless attitude to his image (including on banknotes), ignoring the norms of communication with Thais is fraught with negative consequences, up to imprisonment. </li><li>  Do not buy tanning products, cosmetic accessories for a trip to this country.  It’s better to get it all on the spot.  Natural cosmetics in Thailand, quality is guaranteed by state laws, and violations in this area are severely punished. </li><li>  Think of your wardrobe according to the principle of minimalism.  It is better to take summer things with you on vacation, which you want to get rid of.  If this is not a business trip, everything you need for a vacation can be purchased on site at the lowest prices. </li><li>  Particular attention should be paid to sanitary and hygienic standards: drink only drinking water specially designed for consumption, wash your hands as often as possible, be sure to process fruits. </li></ul>
