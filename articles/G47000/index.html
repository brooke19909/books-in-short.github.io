Hotel Bellevue Vistanova 3 * is it really suitable for relaxation? </p><p>  Immediately it is worth saying that tourists leave different reviews.  Life on the territory of the hotel complex is quite active, and the fun here is literally in full swing.  Therefore, the hotel is perfect for youth recreation, although couples often stop here. </p><p>  The hotel is quite large, and the location is convenient - in a few minutes you can reach the sea and the center of the fashionable resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPalma Nova.  The hotel area is large, clean and well maintained.  The rooms are quite spacious, almost all windows and balconies offer beautiful views of the surroundings or the sea shore. </p><p>  The food is also at a decent level - the choice of dishes is relatively large, and the food is always fresh and aromatic.  But you should understand that you cannot take dishes from a restaurant with you.  The front desk is open all the time, and the staff here are helpful and polite.  They will always help you, answer all questions, sometimes even check in is carried out earlier than the time indicated on the official website. </p><p>  Travelers recommend for a budget holiday the Bellevue Vistanova 3 * hotel.  Mallorca, Magaluf is a good place to spend a vacation. </p>
