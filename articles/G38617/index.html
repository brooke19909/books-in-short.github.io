Temujin (Genghis Khan): history, descendants</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In world history there are a large number of unique people.  They were simple children, often brought up in poverty and did not know good manners.  It was such people who changed the course of history dramatically, leaving behind only ashes.  They built a new world, a new ideology and a new outlook on life.  All of these hundreds of people, humanity owes its life today, because it is the prevailing mosaic of past events that entailed what is today.  Everyone knows the names of such people, because they are constantly on the lips.  Every year, scientists can provide an increasing number of interesting facts from the life of great people.  In addition, many secrets and riddles are gradually being revealed, the announcement of which a little earlier could lead to terrifying consequences. </p><h2>  Acquaintance </h2><p>  Genghis Khan is the founder of the <span>Mongol Empire, the</span> first great khan of which he was.  He rallied various disparate tribes located on the territory of Mongolia.  In addition, he conducted a large number of trips to neighboring states.  Most military campaigns ended in complete victory.  The empire of Genghis Khan is considered the largest of the continental in all world history. </p><h2>  Birth </h2><p>  Temujin was born in the tract Delun-Boldok.  The father named <span>his son Genghis Khan</span> in honor of the captive leader of the Tatars Temujin-Uge, who was defeated just before the birth of the boy.  The date of birth of the great leader is still not known exactly, since different sources indicate different periods.  According to documents that existed during the life of the leader and his biographical witnesses, Genghis Khan was born in 1155.  Another option is the year 1162, but there is no exact evidence.  The boy's father, Yesugei Bagatur, left him in the family of the future bride at the age of 11 years.  Genghis Khan had to stay there until adulthood so that the children would know each other better.  The little girl, the future bride named Borta, was from the unigirat clan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Father's death </h2><p>  According to the scriptures, on the way back home, the boy's father was poisoned by the Tatars.  There was a fever at Esugei's house; he died three days later.  He had two wives.  Both of them and the children of the head of the family were expelled from the tribe.  Women with children were forced to live in the forest for several years.  They managed to escape by a miracle: they ate plants, the boys tried to fish.  Even in the warm season, they were doomed to starvation, as they should have stocked up food for the winter. </p>

    <p>  Fearing revenge on the heirs of the great khan, the new head of the Targutai tribe, Kiriltukh, pursued Temujin.  Several times the boy managed to escape, but in the end he was caught.  They put a wooden block on him, which absolutely limited the martyr in his actions.  It was impossible to eat, drink, or even drive the annoying bug out of the face.  Realizing the hopelessness of his situation, Temujin decided to run away.  At night, he reached the lake, in which he hid.  The boy was completely immersed in water, leaving only nostrils on the surface.  The bloodhounds of the head of the tribe carefully searched for at least some traces of the escaped.  One man noticed Temujin, but did not give him away.  In the future, it was he who helped Genghis Khan escape.  Soon, the boy found his relatives in the forest.  Then he married Bort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The formation of a commander </h2><p>  The empire of Genghis Khan was created gradually.  At first, the nukers began to flock to him, with whom he attacked neighboring territories.  Thus, the young man began to have his own land, army and people.  Genghis Khan began to form a special system that would effectively manage the rapidly growing horde.  Around 1184, the first son of Genghis Khan - Jochi - was born.  In 1206, at the congress, Temujin was proclaimed the great khan of God.  From that moment he was considered the complete and absolute ruler of Mongolia. </p><h2>  Asia </h2><p>  The conquest of Central Asia took place in several stages.  The war with the Karakit Khanate ended with the fact that the Mongols received Semirechye and East Turkestan.  In order to gain the support of the population, the Mongols allowed Muslims public worship, which was prohibited by the naiman.  This contributed to the fact that the permanent settled population completely sided with the conquerors.  The population considered the arrival of the Mongols ‚Äúthe mercy of Allah,‚Äù compared with the stiffness of Khan Kuchluk.  Residents themselves opened the gates to the Mongols.  That is why the city of Balasagun was called the ‚Äúmeek city‚Äù.  Kuchluk Khan could not organize a sufficiently powerful resistance, so he fled from the city.  Soon he was found and killed.  Thus, for Genghis Khan the path to Khorezm was opened. </p>

    <p>  The empire of Genghis Khan absorbed Khorezm - a large state in Central Asia.  His weak point was that the nobility had complete power in the city, so the situation was very tense.  Muhammad‚Äôs mother independently appointed all relatives to important government posts, without asking her son.  Thus creating a circle of powerful support, she led the opposition against Muhammad.  Domestic relations worsened when the grave threat of the Mongol invasion hung.  The war against Khorezm ended in the fact that none of the parties received a significant advantage.  At night, the Mongols left the battlefield.  In 1215, Genghis Khan agreed with Khorezm on mutual trade relations.  However, the first merchants who went to Khorezm were captured and killed.  For the Mongols, this was an excellent occasion to start a war.  Already in 1219, Genghis Khan, together with the main military forces, opposed Khorezm.  Despite the fact that many territories were besieged, the Mongols robbed the cities, killed and destroyed everything around.  Muhammad lost the war even without a fight, and, realizing this, he fled to an island in the Caspian Sea, having previously given power to the hands of his son Jalal-ad-Din.  After long battles, the khan overtook Jalal-ad-Din in 1221 near the Indus River.  The enemy army totaled about 50 thousand people.  To cope with them, the Mongols used a trick: after conducting a roundabout maneuver on rocky terrain, they struck the enemy from the flank.  In addition, Genghis Khan engaged a powerful guards unit of Bagatur.  In the end, the army of Jalal-ad-Din was almost completely defeated.  He, with several thousand soldiers, fled from the battlefield. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After a 7-month siege, the capital of Khorezm - Urgench fell, the city was taken.  Jalal-ad-Din fought against the forces of Genghis Khan for 10 long years, but this did not bring his state significant benefits.  He died defending his territory in 1231 in Anatolia. </p><p>  In just three short years (1219-1221), the kingdom of Muhammad bowed to Genghis Khan.  The entire eastern part of the kingdom, which occupied the territory from the Indus to the Caspian Sea, was under the rule of the great khan of Mongolia. </p>

    <p>  The Mongols conquered the West through the campaign of Jebe and Subadei.  Having captured Samarkand, Genghis Khan sent his troops to conquer Muhammad.  Jaebe and Subedai passed through all of Northern Iran and then captured the South Caucasus.  Cities were captured by certain agreements or simply by force.  The troops regularly collected tribute from the population.  Soon in 1223, the Mongols defeated the Russian-Polovtsian military forces on the <span>Kalka river.</span>  However, retreating to the East, they lost in the <span>Volga Bulgaria.</span>  The small remnants of a huge army returned to the great khan in 1224, and he was then in Asia. </p><h2>  Trekking </h2><p>  The first victory of the khan, which occurred outside of Mongolia, occurred during the campaign of 1209-1210 on the Tanguts.  Khan began to prepare for war with the most dangerous enemy in the East - the state of Jin.  In the spring of 1211, a great war broke out, which claimed many lives.  Very quickly, by the end of the year, the troops of Genghis Khan owned territory from the north to the Chinese wall.  By 1214, the entire territory covering the north and the Yellow River was in the hands of the Mongolian army.  In the same year there was a siege of Beijing.  Peace was obtained through exchange - Genghis Khan married the Chinese princess, who had a huge dowry, land and wealth.  But this step of the emperor was only a ruse, and as soon as the troops of the khan began to retreat, having waited for a good moment, the Chinese resumed the war.  For them, this was a big mistake, because in speed the Mongols defeated the capital to the last pebble. </p><p>  In 1221, when Samarkand fell, the eldest son of Genghis Khan was sent to Khorezm in order to begin the siege of Urgench - the capital of Muhammad.  At the same time, the youngest son was sent by his father to Persia to rob and seize territory. </p>

    <p>  Separately, it is worth noting the <span>battle on Kalka,</span> which occurred between the Russian-Polovtsian and Mongolian troops.  The modern battle territory is the Donetsk region of Ukraine.  The Battle of Kalka (year 1223) led to the complete victory of the Mongol.  First, they defeated the forces of the Polovtsy, and a little later the main forces of the Russian army were defeated.  On May 31, the battle ended with the death of about 9 Russian princes, many boyars and soldiers. </p><p>  The campaign of Sub-Dey and Dzhebe allowed the army to pass through a significant part of the steppes, which were occupied by the Polovtsy.  This allowed the military leaders to appreciate the merits of the future theater of operations, study it and think out a reasonable strategy.  The Mongols also learned a lot about the internal structure of Russia, they received a lot of useful information from prisoners.  Genghis Khan's campaigns were always distinguished by the thorough <span>tactical preparation</span> that was carried out before the offensive. </p><h2>  Russia </h2><p>  The Mongol invasion of the Tatars in Russia took place in 1237-1240 under the rule of Genghis Baty.  The Mongols actively attacked Russia, inflicted strong blows, waiting for successful moments.  The main goal of the Mongol-Tatars was the disorganization of the soldiers of Russia, the sowing of fear and panic.  They avoided battles with a large number of warriors.  The tactic was to divide the large army and defeat the enemy in parts, exhausting him with sharp attacks and constant aggression.  The Mongols began fights with throwing arrows in order to intimidate and distract opponents.  One of the significant advantages of the Mongolian army was that the management of the battle was better organized.  The managers did not fight next to ordinary warriors, they were at a certain distance, so as to maximize the angle of view of military operations.  Instructions were given to the soldiers using various signs: flags, lights, smoke, drums and pipes.  The Mongol attack was carefully thought out.  For this, powerful intelligence and diplomatic preparations for the battle were carried out.  Much attention was paid to isolating the enemy, as well as inflating internal conflicts.  After this stage, the <span>Mongol army</span> concentrated near the borders.  The offensive took place around the perimeter.  Starting from different sides, the army sought to get to the very center.  Penetrating deeper, the military destroyed cities, stole cattle, killed soldiers and raped women.  In order to better prepare for the attack, the Mongols sent special observation teams that prepared the territory, as well as destroyed the enemy‚Äôs weapons.  The exact number of troops on both sides is not known reliably since the information varies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fall of empire" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1421589.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For Russia, the invasion of the Mongols was a severe blow.  A huge part of the population was killed, the cities fell into decay, as they were thoroughly destroyed.  Stone construction ceased for several years.  Many crafts simply disappeared.  The sedentary population was almost completely eliminated.  The empire of Genghis Khan and the invasion of the Mongol-Tatars in Russia were closely connected, since for the Mongols it was a very tasty morsel. </p><h2>  Empire Khan </h2><p>  The empire of Genghis Khan included a huge territory from the Danube to the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan, from Novgorod and to Southeast Asia.  During its heyday, it combined the lands of Southern Siberia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, China, Tibet and Central Asia.  The 13th century marked the creation and heyday of the great state of Genghis Khan.  But already in the second half of the century, a huge empire began to split into separate uluses, ruled by Genghisides.  The most significant fragments of a huge state are: the Golden Horde, the Yuan Empire, the Chagatai ulus and the state of the Hulaguids.  Nevertheless, the borders of the empire were so impressive that no commander or conqueror could achieve more. </p><h2>  Capital of the empire </h2><p>  Karakoram city was the capital of the entire empire.  Literally, the word translates as "black stones of a volcano."  It is believed that Karakorum was founded in 1220.  The city was the place where the khan left his family during campaigns and military affairs.  Also, the city was the residence of the Khan, in which he received important ambassadors.  Russian princes also came here to resolve various political issues.  The 13th century gave the world many travelers who left records about the city (Marco Polo, de Rubruk, Plano Carpini).  The population of the city was very motley, as each quarter was isolated from the other.  The city was home to artisans, merchants who came from all over the world.  The city was unique in terms of the diversity of its inhabitants, because among them there were people of different races, religions and thinking.  Also, the city was built up by many Muslim mosques and Buddhist temples. </p><p>  Ogedei built the palace, which he called "the Palace of ten thousand years of prosperity."  Each Chingizid also had to build his own palace here, which, naturally, was inferior to the building of the son of the great leader. </p><h2>  Descendants </h2><p>  Genghis Khan had many wives and concubines until the end of his days.  However, the first wife, Borta, gave birth to the commander of the most powerful and famous boys.  The heir to the first son of Jochi, Batu, was the creator of the Golden Horde, Jagatay-Chagatay gave the name to the dynasty that ruled the central regions for a long time, Guess-Ugadei was the successor of the khan himself, Tolui ruled the Mongol empire from 1251 to 1259.  Only these four boys had a certain power in the state.  In addition, Borta gave birth to her husband and daughters: Khojin-bagi, Chichigan, Alagai, Temulen and Altalun. </p><p>  The second wife of the Khan of Merkit, Khulan-Khatun, gave birth to a daughter, Dayrusuna, and the sons of Kulkan and Kharachar.  The third wife of Genghis Khan, Esukat, gave him a daughter, Charu-noinon, and the sons of Chahur and Harhad. </p>

    <p>  Genghis Khan, whose life story is impressive, left behind descendants who ruled the Mongols in accordance with the Great Yasa Khan until the 20s of the last century.  The emperors of Manchuria, who ruled over Mongolia and China from the 16th to the 19th century, were also direct heirs of the khan along the female line. </p><h2>  Sunset of a great empire </h2><p>  The fall of the empire lasted a long 9 years, from 1260 to 1269.  The situation was very tense, as there was an urgent question of who will transfer all power.  In addition, it should be noted the serious administrative problems encountered by the management apparatus. </p><p>  The fall of the empire occurred because the sons of Genghis Khan did not want to live according to the laws established by his father.  They could not live according to the main postulate "On the quality factor, the severity of the state."  Genghis Khan was formed by cruel reality, which constantly required decisive action from him.  Temujin experienced a constant life from the early years of his life.  His sons lived in a completely different environment, they were protected and confident in the future.  In addition, we should not forget that they valued the father's possessions much less than he did. </p>

    <p> Another reason for the collapse of the state was the struggle for power between the sons of Genghis Khan.  She distracted them from the vital affairs of the state.  When it was necessary to resolve important issues, the brothers engaged in sorting out relationships.  This could not but affect the situation in the country, world status, and the mood of the people.  All this led to a general deterioration in the state in many respects.  Dividing the empire of the father between themselves, the brothers did not understand that they were destroying it by dismantling it into stones. </p><h2>  The death of the great leader </h2><p>  Genghis Khan, whose history is impressive to this day, having returned from Central Asia, went with his army through Western China.  In 1225, Xi Xia Genghis Khan was on a hunt near the borders, during which he fell and was seriously injured.  By the evening of the same day he began a severe fever.  As a consequence of this, a meeting of managers was convened in the morning, at which the question of whether or not to start a war with the Tanguts was considered.  Jochi was also on the council, who did not enjoy special trust at the top of the government, since he regularly deviated from his father's instructions.  Noticing such constant behavior, Genghis Khan ordered his army to go against Jochi and kill him.  But because of the death of his son, the campaign was never completed. </p><p>  Having recovered his health, in the spring of 1226 Genghis Khan with his army crossed the border of Si Xia.  Having defeated the defenders, and having given the city for plunder, the khan began his last war.  The Tanguts were completely defeated on the approaches to the Tangut kingdom, the path to which became open.  The fall of the Tangut kingdom and the death of the khan are very connected, because the great leader died here. </p><h2>  Causes of death </h2><p>  The scriptures say that the death of Genghis Khan came after he received gifts from the king of the Tanguts.  However, there are several versions that have equal rights to exist.  Among the main and most likely causes are the following: death from illness, poor adaptation to the climate of the area, the consequences of falling from a horse.  There is also a separate version that the khan was killed by a young wife, whom he took by force.  The girl, fearing the consequences, committed suicide that night. </p><h2>  Tomb of Genghis Khan </h2><p>  No one can name the exact burial place of the great khan.  Different sources disagree in the hypotheses for a number of reasons.  Moreover, in each of them various places and methods of burial are indicated.  Genghis Khan‚Äôs grave can be in any of three places: on Burkhan-Khaldun, on the northern side of Altai Khan or in Yhe-Utek. </p><p>  Monument to Genghis Khan is located in Mongolia.  Equestrian statue is considered the largest monument and statue in the whole world.  The opening of the monument took place on September 26, 2008.  Its height is 40 m without a pedestal, whose height is 10 m. The whole statue is covered with stainless steel, the total weight is 250 tons. Also, the monument to Genghis Khan is surrounded by 36 columns.  Each of them symbolizes the khan of the Mongol empire, beginning with Genghis and ending with Ligden.  In addition, the monument is two-story, and it houses a museum, art gallery, billiards, restaurants, a conference room and a souvenir shop.  The horse's head serves as a viewing platform for visitors.  The statue is surrounded by a large park.  The plans of the city authorities to equip a golf course, an outdoor theater and an artificial lake. </p>
