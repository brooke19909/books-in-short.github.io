  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Amusing regiments of Peter 1: the foundation of the Russian army</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An important role in the formation of the Russian imperial army was played by the so-called amusing regiments of Peter 1. What kind of event was this, it is difficult to understand outside the context of the general historical situation in our country.  In addition, one should take into account the personal factor, namely the character of the ruler, who cared about creating troops according to the European model. </p><h2>  Characteristic of the era </h2><p>  The amusing regiments of <span>Peter 1,</span> which should be briefly discussed exclusively in the context of analyzing the foreign and domestic political situation in our country, were the first important step in the reforming activities of the new tsar.  It should be borne in mind that at the end of the 17th century, Russia was already the largest power in Europe, and therefore its rulers naturally took care to reach the world level of development in all spheres of society.  This trend was already evident during the first Romanovs, it continued during the reign of <span>Princess Sophia,</span> in 1682-1689.  But only with her brother did this reform course become especially distinct.  It is significant that he began his activity precisely with the transformation of the military sphere.  The fact is that at stake was the question of our country gaining access to the Baltic Sea. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amusing regiments of Peter 1" class="if" height="443" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1267127.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  Start of formation </h2><p>  In rather difficult conditions, the childhood of Peter I passed. The amusing regiments played a large role in shaping his personality and determining the direction of his activity.  As a child, he became interested in war games with neighboring boys.  Together with them, he organized improvised military battles and battles, which gradually developed into complex and serious maneuver exercises.  When the number of soldiers became sufficient to make independent military formations, the future emperor thought about creating separate units. <!--EndFragment--></p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="two amusing regiments of Peter 1" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1267357.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  The emergence of units </h2><p>  The amusing regiments of Peter the Great, whose founding date dates back to 1691, appeared during a very difficult period in the history of Russia, but played a decisive role in the future military campaigns of the emperor.  The king completely trusted them precisely because they were his own brainchild.  He himself took an active part in their formation, selected fighters, made sure that they had talented leaders.  He himself went directly into all the details and planned the exercises.  The names of the amusing regiments of Peter 1 are associated with two villages where the recruitment of soldiers took place (Preobrazhenskoe and Semenovskoe).  That is what he called his military units, which in a very short time was to become the basis of the Russian army, having won so many brilliant victories in the western and eastern directions. <!--EndFragment--></p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="names of amusing regiments of Peter 1" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1267358.jpg" width="317"></div></h2><h2>  Foreign influence </h2><p>  Two amusing regiments of Peter 1 were formed largely with the participation of foreigners.  One of the closest associates of the new king was the Swiss <span>F. Lefort,</span> who took an active part in all the king‚Äôs enterprises, supported him in everything and was his right hand until the end of his life.  It is known that it was he who instilled in the very young Peter love for the fleet and army pleasures.  Lefort took an active part in the emergence of regiments.  The significance of his influence is that he brought his European experience to the organization of detachments of soldiers of the future emperor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amusing regiments of Peter 1 briefly" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1267142.jpg" width="344"></div></h2><h2>  Gordon's involvement </h2><p>  The amusing regiments of Peter 1 became the basis of the Russian army.  The ruler himself understood the need to borrow foreign experience, so he actively used the advice and knowledge of his foreign friends.  Near the place of formation of the regiments was a German settlement, which he often visited.  Here he made many acquaintances, and many of its residents subsequently became his employees.  Of great importance in the transformative activities of the future emperor was P. Gordon.  He possessed extensive knowledge in the military sphere, he studied a lot, was an excellent theoretician.  At the time of the confrontation between Peter and Sophia (in 1689), he sided with the former.  Gordon played an important role in organizing regiments.  He was a very talented leader, kept the troops in exemplary order, and possessed outstanding military capabilities.  His experience played an important role in creating the internal structure of these units. </p><h2>  The activities of Menshikov </h2><p>  The amusing regiments of Peter 1 were created not only under the influence of foreign experience, but also by the efforts of Petr Alekseevich's closest friends.  The main merit in this, of course, belongs to A. Menshikov, who was originally the right hand of the king and, like Lefort, participated in all his enterprises.  He also played an important role in the formation of regiments.  It is known that he was engaged in recruiting fighters, and also personally took part in all the impromptu undertakings of the king.  He was not educated like Gordon, but he was very quick, quick-witted and smart, besides, he had outstanding organizational skills that very soon put him among the most prominent military and political figures of the <span>Petrine era.</span>  He himself went through this military service in the regiments, therefore, not a single significant event of the future emperor took place without his participation. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="childhood of Peter 1 amusing regiments" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1267139.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  First fighting </h2><p>  The amusing regiments of Peter the Great became the backbone of the Russian army.  They participated in the famous <span>Azov campaigns of the</span> ruler in 1695.  This was an important stage in their acquisition of combat experience, which allowed them to become the basis of new troops.  Many distinguished themselves in these battles, which, however, is not surprising, given that the king especially cared for their organization and preparation.  Since then, the amusing regiments of Peter 1 began to be on a special status in the Russian army.  Their significance was determined by the fact that they became the basis that determined the further military reforms of the successors of the emperor.  We can say that the ruler literally created these troops himself and prepared them according to the European model. </p><h2>  Value </h2><p>  The amusing regiments of Peter the Great played a decisive role in the formation of the new Russian army.  They served as a model for organizing the troops of the new, imperial Russia.  In this sense, they acquired not only military-technical, but also deeply symbolic significance as military units, which were destined to become the pillar of imperial power in our country.  These two regiments were especially honored as the backbone of the Russian imperial army. </p><h2>  King's participation </h2><p>  The phenomenon of amusing regiments in historical science is also connected with the very revealing and curious fact that Pyotr Alekseevich himself served in them from the lowest rank to the rank of captain.  Thus, he himself, as they say, held out a soldier‚Äôs strap with his children‚Äôs comrades.  Of course, this played a large role in the fact that both amusing regiments were infinitely devoted to him and became the backbone of his growing power. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amusing regiments of Peter 1 foundation date" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1267363.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Place in the context of reform </h2><p>  As part of the transformational activities of Peter Alekseevich, the creation of amusing regiments, as mentioned above, was one of the first steps in the years of his independent rule.  This is a very revealing fact, since it determined the further course of the king‚Äôs reforms.  All transformations of the emperor, in fact, were subordinated to military needs: after all, almost all of his reign took place in the war with Sweden (1700-1721).  Therefore, the creation of amusing regiments was also a very revealing fact that immediately, already at the end of the 17th century, marked a tendency to reform.  The fact that Pyotr Alekseevich began his reign precisely with the creation of amusing regiments, a new type of army, as if predetermined by the fact that the military sphere will be the main course of his reforms. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="funny regiments of Peter 1 what is it" class="if" height="228" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1267361.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  Image in literature </h2><p>  The creation of amusing regiments attracted the attention of not only historians, but also writers.  For example, the famous Soviet author A. N. Tolstoy, in his novel ‚ÄúPeter I‚Äù, paid a lot of attention to those childhood and youthful years of the future emperor, in which he was engaged in the arrangement of a new army. </p>
