In the modern world, such presentations have gained even greater popularity and relevance, and packaging and design have become much more interesting and brighter.  Inventive needlewomen went even further and began to make amazing delicate bouquets of sweets.  Undoubtedly, a unique present!  There are a lot of reasons for giving such a gift: from a wedding to an ordinary trip to friends. </p><p>  How to make a bouquet of flowers from sweets, what is needed for this?  The most important thing is that the cost of acquiring the materials necessary to create a bouquet will be minimal, but the joy of the result is colossal! </p><h2>  Brief description of the work process </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself bouquets are valued much higher than simple sweets.  Since making a flower out of sweets is simple, creating a composition is an easy task that anyone who decides to do it can do. </p><p>  Delicate, incredibly realistic buds and large inflorescences are made of corrugated paper.  On sale you can find a lot of different shades.  And the choice of the type of flowers for the bouquet is absolutely unlimited: roses, tulips, carnations, orchids, crocuses, peonies, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="candy chrysanthemums" class="if uuid-2935547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2935547.jpg"></div><p>  As for the design of such bouquets, there are also no rules: everything is limited only by your ingenuity, imagination and taste!  Boxes of any shape, baskets, vases, flower pots and this is not the limit! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tools and materials commonly used in work </h2><p>  The tools for work are usually standard.  Only the bouquet‚Äôs decor can be original, but the flowers are made from the same materials. </p><p>  So, what needs to be prepared before making a flower from sweets? </p><ul><li>  Firstly, you can not do without sweets.  Choose according to your taste, but it is better if they are hard, such as roasting.  With liqueur or soft fillings, sweets from the heat of your hands can be deformed.  To avoid this, place the sweet ‚Äúparts‚Äù of the bouquet in the refrigerator before use. </li><li>  The next important part will be corrugated paper.  You can find its huge variety in stores, but we recommend giving preference to Italian: it is very dense, thick and stretches perfectly, keeps its shape perfectly and does not fade in the sun.  Do not take soft and thin for children's creativity.  She does not possess the necessary qualities. </li><li>  Wire or wooden sticks (depending on which stems you want to get as a result).  For the manufacture of ampoule bouquets, no doubt, take the wire. </li><li>  Glue gun (you can use any glue that glues paper surfaces). </li><li>  The presence in the set of adhesive tape and floral tape is welcome, but you can do without them </li><li>  Threads (for fixing the petals). </li><li>  Capacity for a bouquet.  It can be a vase, basket, box, etc. </li><li>  Colored paper. </li><li>  Polyfoam, polystyrene foam, sponge "Oasis" (to fill the cache-pot, in which the composition will be collected). </li><li>  Scissors. </li></ul><p>  This will be our set for creativity.  You can add something yourself, for example, decorative elements, ribbons, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bouquet of tulips" class="if uuid-2935552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2935552.jpg"></div><p>  It remains to choose the type of flowers that you want to collect, and get started! </p><h2>  Clove </h2><p>  In order to make a flower of sweets with your own hands, prepare: </p><ul><li>  corrugated paper red or purple; </li><li>  ribbons of different widths (for decoration); </li><li>  wire; </li><li>  ribbon for floristry; </li><li>  decorative mesh; </li><li>  branches for decor; </li><li>  wide bow. </li></ul><p>  From the wire, cut pieces equal to the required length of the stems. </p><p>  We take the corrugation and cut out of it several rectangular parts with dimensions of 6 by 14 cm. </p><p>  Next, you need to wrap all the candies in these rectangles, insert a piece of wire into the bottom of the workpiece and tighten with tape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cloves in a box" class="if uuid-2935543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2935543.jpg"></div><p>  We bind the bud with a narrow ribbon.  Stretch the edges of the paper, forming an inflorescence of carnations.  So do a few more flowers. </p><p>  It remains to collect everything in the composition, adding branches, beads and ribbons.  Wrap the finished bouquet with a packing cloth and tie a large bow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Lush and bright flowers from sweets and paper. </h2><p>  In the work we need: </p><ul><li>  corrugated paper of two close floral shades; </li><li>  green corrugation; </li><li>  some sweets; </li><li>  some transparent film; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  piece of wire; </li><li>  a few skewers. </li></ul><p>  First, cut out the details of the petals.  To do this, we cut out rectangular blanks from the corrugations of both colors.  Decide on the amount yourself: the more petals, the larger the flower will turn out. </p><p>  Let's fold the paper with an accordion and cut a semicircle from one edge to make it wavy.  Straighten and slightly extend the cuts.  We stretch the middle, and slightly twist the edges with a pencil or skewer.  Thus, we process each petal. </p><p>  Then we take a transparent film cut into squares so that sweets can be wrapped in it.  We wrap each and fix it at the base with a thread.  We carefully attach the petals to these centers, lapping them and gradually picking up the flower: lighter paper will go first, then darker. </p><p>  It remains to attach the stem from a skewer or wire, wrap it with a narrow strip of green paper or floral tape.  One flower is ready - we‚Äôll do a few more and create a beautiful bouquet! </p><p>  As it turned out, it is very simple to make flowers from sweets.  A photo of the process will help you better understand the technology.  The principle of operation is the same for all varieties of flowers, the differences are only in the shape and shade of the petals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="process of creation" class="if uuid-2936041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2936041.jpg"></div><h2>  Packaging and design </h2><p>  Making flowers from sweets and corrugated paper is easy, but what about next?  How to pack them beautifully and tastefully?  Compositions with the use of sweets wrapped in special paper for bouquets or in ordinary wrapping became extremely popular.  They also produce packaging resembling a newspaper sheet: such bouquets look incredibly stylish and interesting!  Moreover, the most elegant and fashionable option in our time is considered to be a very simply packed bouquet: the main attention should be paid to the flowers themselves. </p><p>  Baskets are also quite in demand in the compositions.  It looks great, and the scope for imagination is huge due to the fact that there is more space for the formation of a bouquet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bright bouquet" class="if uuid-2935558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2935558.jpg"></div><p>  Boxes are also in demand.  Moreover, both flat and deep.  The shape is also unimportant - square, cylindrical, in the form of a heart - there are many options!  Often they are very originally decorated, for example with lace or burlap. </p><h2>  How to make a bouquet of flowers from sweets with your own hands </h2><p>  To perform the composition, flowers alone will not be enough.  The made inflorescences must be compiled into a bouquet and fixed in a container that plays the role of a vase.  For these purposes, you can apply everything that is at hand: cardboard boxes, small pots, vases, etc. </p><p>  Still need filler to fix the stems.  Foam, plasticine, foam rubber, polyurethane foam in cans, even cement or asbestos are suitable. </p><p>  So, how to make a flower out of sweets, you know.  Make the required amount, and then start preparing the dishes.  To do this, cut out the desired shape from the foam or foam rubber and put it in a container, filling the entire surface.  If you decide to use a mounting foam, then just squeeze a small amount into the prepared form.  Remember that in this case, you can no longer disassemble the bouquet and use the dishes for other purposes.  When working with asbestos, the bouquet is also not disassembled. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tulips with Raffaello" class="if uuid-2935550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2935550.jpg"></div><p>  After everything is prepared, you can stick the flower stalks in the desired order and cover with some decorating material from above: cloth, sisal, paper. </p><h2>  A miniature bouquet with a center made of lollipops </h2><p>  How to make a candy flower on a stick?  To create a small pretty bouquet you will need: </p><ul><li>  9-15 lollipops; </li><li>  corrugated paper (pink, purple and violet); </li><li>  a roll of narrow tape; </li></ul><p>  Pink paper is cut into rectangles with sides of 4 by 8 cm. Cut the fringe along the wide side and wrap the candy so that the fringe encircles the candy. </p><p>  Lilac and violet squares with sides of 6 cm, fold as when cutting snowflakes, cut off the edge to get a wavy line.  Make a small hole in the middle.  Expand each blank, fold them in two different colors.  Insert a stick of candy into the holes and tighten with a narrow tape. </p><p>  So the flowers are ready, and the bouquet can be collected in a cup or cup. </p><h2>  Roses in a basket </h2><p>  To make such a bouquet, take: </p><ul><li>  corrugated paper (green and pink); </li><li>  hard-filled sweets; </li><li>  foil; </li><li>  lurex or ordinary threads; </li><li>  glue gun; </li><li>  floristic ribbon; </li><li>  floristic wire; </li><li>  beads, twigs. </li></ul><p>  All candies are individually packed in foil and tied with thread.  From paper of a pink shade we cut out first rectangular details, and then we will form round ones from them.  Petals need to be stretched a little in the middle, giving them a realistic look.  In a circle, lay all the petals around the candy, and then dress it. </p><p>  We cut out the sepals from green paper and wrap a flower around it.  Trim the edges, removing the excess.  Insert skewers or wire here and fix with hot glue.  Wrap the whole leg with tape.  Spread the inflorescence - that's it, the flower is ready! </p><p>  We‚Äôll also make some more roses.  Now you can begin to form a bouquet. </p><p>  For the ‚Äúpots", take a box: the simpler the packaging, the better and more original the bouquet will look.  Filling it with filler, insert flowers, decorative twigs and decorations.  All you can give! </p><p>  Anyone can create a beautiful delicate bouquet: just be patient, turn on your imagination at full power and be sure to add love! </p>
