    <h2>  A bit of history and geography </h2><p>  The eternal city, as historians call it, is truly amazing.  Where was Rome, whose domination over the world lasted over six centuries?  Probably every schoolchild knows this.  This is Italy, part of its modern capital, a place on the banks <span>of the Tiber River.</span>  In the past its influence was so great that the ancients said: "All roads lead to Rome."  It was the true center of the universe, because it created laws, built roads, built amazing temples and palaces, improved water supply, and brought the art of war to perfection.  Rome became the soul and heart of cultural and religious life, the cradle of Western civilization.  The inhabitants of the city and the empire, although they belonged to the Ancient Era, were distinguished from the Greeks by their practicality and rationality, which allowed them to create an empire that had aroused strong fear for enemies for a long time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where was ancient rome" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/800588.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Blood city </h2><p>  So, where Rome was and where it is located now, every educated person knows.  This is the region of Lazio in the Roman province, Italy.  The founding date of the city is considered to be April 21, 753 <span>BC,</span> and the legendary brothers Romul and Rem are the founders.  But it is worth noting that, despite all its greatness, the city was always washed with blood and stood on its bones: everyone here was hungry for power and eliminated rivals and objectionable.  From the time of the Etruscan ruler Amulius, who nearly killed the babies of Romulus and Remus, to <span>Romulus Augustulus, the</span> last emperor of the empire, conspiracies, assassinations of senators and supreme rulers, philosophers and orators, the elimination by any means of all pretenders to the throne, have been practiced. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the city of rome" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/799982.jpg" width="571"></div>

    <h2>  The heart of the Christian church </h2><p>  But the place where Rome was was destined to again become the religious center of the world.  It is here today that the papal residence, the main shrines and museums, the library and the archive of the Catholic Church are located.  The successors of the <span>Apostle Peter,</span> that is, the pope, taking care of the beauty of the temples, contributed to the development of culture, art, architecture.  So <span>where is the Vatican?</span>  In Rome!  This is an enclave, that is, a state inside another, the creation of which was officially fixed on February 11, 1929. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sights Cities on seven hills </h2><p>  The question of where the city of Rome is, you will not puzzle anyone today.  And if you ask people what interesting things can be seen in this city, then there will be a lot of answers.  Over its long history, the city has collected so many attractions that only their list could take more than one page.
