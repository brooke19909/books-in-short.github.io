Despite the fact that its lobby does not have magnificent finishes, like the pavilions of the first Avtovo section - Ploshchad Vosstaniya, Vyborgskaya also has interesting design features.  The station is interesting not only for its underground facilities, but also for its external design, as well as the longest pedestrian tunnel in the city.  Most recently, the station was reopened after a long overhaul and is functioning smoothly, receiving more than 800 thousand passengers per month.  What are the history and design features of Vyborg?  How does the station work today, what ground transport is attached to it? </p><h2>  History of the Vyborgskaya station </h2>

    <p>  The Ploshchad Lenina - Lesnaya section, which included the Vyborgskaya metro station, was opened on April 22, 1975.  In the project, it was called "Baburin Lane", but later received its modern name in honor of the area where its lobby is located.  The pavilion was designed by architects V.P. Shuvalova, V.G. Khilchenko and A.S. Getzkin and is one of the few surviving glass metro buildings.  Since the 70s of the last century, decorative plants have been planted on the balcony above the inclined course of the lobby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Underground structures of the Vyborgskaya station </h2>

    <p>  Vyborgskaya metro station was laid at a depth of 67 meters.  The walls of the station are made of travertine, and the floors are lined with gray granite.  The end wall is decorated with a bas-relief that depicts the workers of the Vyborg side who participated in the 1917 uprising.  The station hall is connected to escalators by a passage resembling the Latin letter S. Similar connections are also available at the stations "Primorskaya" and "Ligovsky prospekt".  In the 90s, the three extreme spans of the hall were closed for official needs.  Entrances to the office premises are fenced with metal bars. </p><h2>  Repair of the Vyborgskaya station in 2015 </h2>

    <p>  <span>On February 7,</span> 2015, the Vyborgskaya metro station was closed for major repairs for a period of 11 months.  During this time, the waterproofing was completely restored, outdated lamps were updated, the work of all three escalators was established and cosmetic adjustments were made.  On December 25 of the same year, Vyborgskaya was inaugurated anew and put into operation.  Passengers who used ground transport tied to neighboring stations all year round were greatly relieved, because it is still the most convenient way to get to business centers and other places of work at the Vyborgskaya metro station.  Repair, however, according to the head of the St. Petersburg metro, is necessary for all stations whose age exceeds 40 years.  In 2016, the Elizarovskaya and Vasileostrovskaya stations were closed for updating. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Vyborg tunnel - the longest pedestrian tunnel in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  The longest underground pedestrian crossing in St. Petersburg, tied to the Vyborgskaya metro station, was opened on November 4, 1983.  The beginning of the tunnel is inside the station itself, and the exit is not far from the LOMO factory entrance.  The long and confused <span>underground passage</span> immediately overgrown with a huge number of legends and mysterious stories.  Some Petersburgers believed that the tunnel was built as a bomb shelter, and someone was completely sure that there were secret paths between the railway and the metro hidden in the passage.  Nevertheless, the purpose of the Vyborg tunnel turned out to be more prosaic - a similar passage, necessary for access to railways and factories, had already existed, but due to weather conditions it soon became worthless, so its more stable modern version had to be built a little deeper. </p><h2>  Station "Vyborg" today </h2>
