  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Best pensions in Moscow: living conditions, prices and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every year, thousands of our compatriots travel to hot countries to spend their holidays there.  However, there are many people who like to relax in Russia, who enjoy the beauty of their native land and are interested in the architecture and history of their country.  Accommodation in hotels or hotels is not always profitable, but rest in a boarding house is much cheaper and more convenient. </p><h2>  What is a boarding house? </h2><p>  In Soviet times, sanatoriums were very popular, where citizens with various diseases could move in for a whole month.  They received proper treatment there, and underwent procedures that were beneficial to health.  In contrast to the <span>sanatoriums,</span> there is no strict day regime <span>in the boarding houses</span> , that is, the main goal here is not to carry out health procedures and treatment, but to rest and have fun. </p><p>  A boarding house is a holiday home that combines the features of a hotel (high level of comfort) and a sanatorium, since it is possible to agree on additional services with the owners of boarding houses (wellness massages or a jacuzzi and much more). </p><div class="photo" data-original="zoon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="boarding house Moscow and region" class="if uuid-2530497" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43623/2530497.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Pensions in Moscow</span> are in great demand due to their location and a wide selection of services offered. </p><h2>  Features and differences from sanatoriums </h2><p>  Usually boarding houses are located in forest park areas or on the seashore, near major resorts.  The main criterion for choosing a place is the presence of picturesque landscapes and, of course, clean air.  Unlike <span>sanatoriums, boarding houses</span> do not have their own medical base, but they offer interesting excursions and tours of city attractions.  And if the boarding house is located near the mountains, then a trip to the picturesque mountain peaks is provided to you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk about the capital's boarding houses, then many of them are in the immediate suburbs.  Typically, boarding houses in Moscow and the <span>Moscow Region</span> are two- or three-story houses located in forests.  They have many separate rooms with all amenities, the territory is fenced and is guarded.  You can book a suite or a standard room, the difference is that the class A rooms are equipped with eco-furniture, air conditioning, a refrigerator and a Jacuzzi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="boarding house Moscow and region" class="if uuid-2529919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43623/2529919.jpg"></div><h2>  Pensions for the elderly </h2><p>  Due to various life circumstances, in Moscow and other large cities, not everyone can afford to be around the clock with their aged parents or grandparents.  For many, the solution to this problem is turning to nursing homes, where they take full care of the elderly. </p><p>  For some reason, in Russia, the level of service in nursing homes does not reach European standards, so it is considered somewhat embarrassing to leave parents in a nursing home.  In this case, the ideal way out is pensions for the elderly.  Moscow has a very wide selection of such institutions, so everyone will find what suits him both in quality and in cost.  Let's see which metropolitan establishments have a good reputation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sgc-opeca.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pension for seniors in Moscow" class="if uuid-2530462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43623/2530462.jpg"></div><h2>  The best pensions </h2><p>  In Moscow, their number is much smaller than in the region.  This is due to the large technical workload of the capital, in which the noise from cars does not stop for a minute.  However, those boarding houses that are available in the metropolis are indeed the standard of a true comfortable stay with all amenities.  So, here is a list of the best pensions for the elderly in Moscow: </p><ol><li>  Elite private boarding house "European", which is located in the very center of Moscow on Botanicheskaya street.  It is a beautiful two-story house equipped with the latest technology.  Owners offer 24-hour care for your family.  Judging by the reviews, there are excellent medical specialists who will find an approach to everyone.  The cost ranges from 1000-2000 rubles per day, depending on the choice of room and additional services. </li><li>  Pension "Hearth" has modern equipment, a feature of this institution is the availability of recreational leisure programs for the elderly.  The food is balanced, 6 meals a day.  Despite the remoteness from the city center, it is very convenient to reach it both by your car and by public transport.  Pension Moscow is located in the Naro-Fominsk district of the capital. </li><li>  In the top three you can safely include the boarding house "Second House".  The name speaks for itself.  The atmosphere here is really very cozy, and the working staff treats their wards with great love and compassion.  There is a boarding house in the Leninsky district, just 5 km from Moscow.  Reviews of satisfied customers convince us that people who believe in God work here and who are also qualified specialists. </li></ol><h2>  Cost of living and what is included in it </h2><p>  Prices for accommodation in boarding houses in Moscow and the region usually vary, this is due only to the location of the holiday homes.  The quality of care for the elderly is controlled by Rospotrebnadzor, so there is nothing to fear.  Each guest house determines the cost of its services on its own, however, there are factors that determine prices.  For example, in the "Care" boarding house, the wards do daily gymnastics with a professional trainer, so the cost of living in it costs a little more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pansion-zabota.ru" data-author=": &quot;&quot;, "><img itemprop="image" alt="boarding houses in Moscow and Moscow" class="if uuid-2530475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43623/2530475.jpg"></div><p>  Firstly, the availability of medical personnel and equipment makes the boarding house much more reliable, because it is not known when a doctor may be needed.  Secondly, the availability of various amenities in the room.  Typically, standard rooms are 2- or 4-seater, and "luxury" can accommodate one person.  The rooms always have the necessary amenities: a bed, an armchair, a washbasin, a toilet, a small closet, air conditioning and a TV.  The cost of living starts from 1000 rubles per day.  For customers paying for a long stay, many boarding houses in Moscow are ready to make discounts.  The price usually includes meals, the menu is agreed with the client and the supervising doctor. </p><h2>  Nursing homes with medical conditions </h2><p>  <span>In the Moscow region there</span> are a lot of boarding houses for the elderly who are diagnosed with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, dementia, diabetes mellitus or disability.  Here is just a small list of boarding houses ready to care for your family around the clock: </p><ul><li>  Pension "Romashkovo" is one of the most budget options, living here costs only 800 rubles per day.  Located in the <span>Moscow region,</span> Odintsovo district. </li><li>  The geriatric boarding house "Khorlovo" is located in the village of the same name and offers care for the elderly with mental disorders.  Here the cost of living is 24 thousand rubles per month.  It includes nutrition, medical procedures, as well as psychological assistance. </li><li>  In the Ramensky district there is a well-known and beloved by many boarding house "Warm conversations".  The location of the house in a pine forest makes this place especially attractive for those who need to breathe clean air.  The cost is from 1200 rubles per day. </li></ul><p>  When choosing a place for your family, we recommend that you carefully study all the reviews on thematic sites, as well as consult with doctors who will prescribe procedures for the treatment or prevention of the disease. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dobrotaizabota.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="boarding houses in Moscow" class="if uuid-2530487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43623/2530487.jpg"></div><p>  You should choose a boarding house, focusing on the services offered: those necessary procedures that the doctor has prescribed for your parent or an elderly relative should be available. </p>
