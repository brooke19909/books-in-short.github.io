  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Musenka's dragon crochet by mom and daughter Lyusenka</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Although today in the departments of children's goods is full - full of a wide variety of toys, mothers are increasingly turning to the manual method of their manufacture.  And if a girl sees that her mother prefers crocheting a dragon instead of the usual shopping, she has the idea in her mind that doing needlework is interesting and fascinating. </p><p>  The second educational moment, of course, is the praise of others and their recognition.  A smart mom will take a picture of her creation and post the photo on the Internet, for example, on social networks, or on the sites of needlewomen under the funny name ‚ÄúCrocheting the dragon Musenka by mother and daughter Lyusenka‚Äù.  Of course, good comments, praises and words of admiration for the work of hand-made art will soon appear under the photograph.  The baby will feel pride in her mother, and she herself will strive to acquire such skills and also receive recognition from others. </p><p>  The third positive point is the fact that mom, performing dragon knitting, can not just make an ordinary soft little animal, which there really are a lot on store shelves, but attach a bit of creative thought and make an educational toy, for example, a parsley-glove for a puppet theater .  And later it will be possible to connect Musenka and other characters for the dragon, to come up with a fairy tale and even put it in kindergarten or at school after school.  What?  Now that the crochet of the dragon is mastered, it's not at all difficult!  Just friends for Musenka can be made in other colors, with modified ear shapes or with different hairstyles. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, the pattern of knitting a dragon - gloves is much simpler than for a regular volumetric toy.  Indeed, from the yarn we need to make only the head of Musenka.  For the body, you will need to select the material from which to cut out, and then sew the "dress" of the dragon.  So, the easiest way to make a toy is to connect a hollow ball with a hole and fill it with filler: synthetic winterizer or pieces of foam rubber. </p><p>  We make eyes either from buttons or from beads.  You can go to the needlework store and purchase special factory eyes for soft toys.  And some just cut their eyes out of black cardboard and stick them on their faces.  In extreme cases, normal embroidery is acceptable. </p><p>  If desired, you can still tie the original ears.  They can be of various shapes: triangular - pigs, with elephants in the lobes, round - cheburashi.  You can even tie the ears - wings, reminiscent of the shape of bat wings.  Such wings on the dragon‚Äôs head look very beautiful when they are made in two colors: the membrane of the main color and the guiding concentric stripes - contrasting. </p><p>  It is worth discussing the implementation of this detail in more detail.  In <span>contrasting</span> yarn <span>,</span> we begin to knit a chain of 10 stitches.  After turning the knitting we make 10 half columns on it and we attach the thread of the main color.  Now we will knit the membrane.  We skip the first column, we knit the second with a half-column, 3 single crochet, 3 with double crochet and 2 with double crochet.  We turn the part and perform all the same actions, but in the reverse order. </p><p>  Next, you should change the thread to contrast and knit two rows with half columns.  Change the thread again and repeat the algorithms for knitting the membrane and the guide strip.  Now you can either finish knitting this part, or make another membrane. </p><p>  Do not neglect the main distinguishing feature of all dragons - the ridge with sharp triangles!  Without such a detail, crocheting a dragon cannot be considered complete.  After all, then it will not be clear to everyone that this toy is a dragon.  The ridge is made of the main color yarn, but you can take another one - who knows what the real dragon ridge really was? </p><p>  The chain should be tied as long as needed for the toy.  The ridge can start from the top of the head and pass through the entire toy, decorating even a ‚Äúdress‚Äù - a glove sewn from fabric.  And it can end as soon as the fabric begins.  The tip of the ridge consists of a <span>half-column, a column, a</span> double crochet, a double crochet, a double crochet, a column and a half-column.  The next point should begin to knit already with a single crochet. </p><p>  As you can see, making a toy is not difficult at all, but it is extremely useful for raising a growing girl. </p>
