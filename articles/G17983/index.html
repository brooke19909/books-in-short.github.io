Great women in the history of Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The history of mankind is made by</span> men and women alike.  Only their roles are different.  Women most often act as gray and black cardinals, and men heroe and knock themselves on the chest.  Therefore, more of them fell into the annals of history.  The great women in the history of mankind are, in principle, all the women who lived, live and will live.  And this is not a compliment, but a simple statement of fact. </p><h2>  Female beauty is a formidable weapon </h2><p>  Thinking about the greatness of famous ladies, subconsciously we are convinced that they were fatal beauties.  This is where the famous phrase that <span>beauty will save the world</span> comes to mind <span>.</span>  Unfortunately, not everyone knows the continuation of winged expression.  But the explanation follows: ‚Äú... if she is good!‚Äù  It would seem that only three words, but the meaning immediately becomes different.  However, there is no particular contradiction in it, we understand that a woman combines two complete opposites, this is the horror and danger of female beauty.  Thousands of examples convince mankind that the earthly loveliness of a woman, absolutely devoid of a spiritual beginning, is often mistaken for true beauty and brings about death.  In fairness, it is worth noting that not all the great women who left a significant mark in the history of mankind were beautiful.  However, each of them has its own special history of life, love, which has been preserved for centuries, is surrounded by incredible legends.  This is their greatness. </p><p>  Possessing amazing strength of mind, they, not being afraid to get ahead of time, boldly went beyond the moral of their century.  The list of majestic persons can be continued indefinitely: Sappho, Cleopatra, Catherine II, <span>Georges Sand,</span> Nefertiti, Margaret Thatcher, Joan of Arc, Wang, Camilla Claudel, Princess Olga, Murasaki Shikibu.  Perhaps we will not sin against the truth if we dare to assert that these are the greatest women in history.  After all, each of them can rightfully be considered as a symbol of its era, its time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  On an equal footing with a slight advantage in favor of women </h2><p>  More recently, no more than 15 years ago, genetics with a sufficient degree of certainty found that a woman transfers about 80% of her cellular information to a child, father - 15-17%, and the first man - up to 5% due to the so-called telegonia.  But that is not all.  The character of a person is formed mainly until the age of 5, and then he practically does not change.  So the woman‚Äôs influence on all men is such that they can all be called sissies without any exaggeration. </p><p>  Like a she-wolf, who can restore a wolf tribe in seven generations of mating with dogs, so one woman is capable of more in history than one man.  The exploits of the real Achilles, Hector and Samson are the sum of the deeds of men.  A woman is capable of turning the course of history alone. </p><p>  Famous women in historical chronicles are less common not because they were fewer, but because their role is deeper.  They carefully and thoughtfully prepared the twists and turns of history that men then made, as if on a hunch. </p><h2>  Olympiad - mother of Alexander the Great </h2>

Probably due to the fact that Greek culture became the basis of modern European.  But the Olympics influenced the course of historical events much more than the great Aristotle.

The future legendary commander absorbed the Greek worldview with mother's milk.  The Olympics found him teachers who trained his body, teachers (including Aristotle) ‚Äã‚Äãwho honed his mind, and, finally, friends who became his associates.  So who made the real story?  However, the Olympics did not even fall into the category of ‚ÄúFamous Women in History‚Äù. </p><p>  Macedonia was a strong state with its original and equal Greek culture.  But who is now thoroughly studying it (except for a handful of lovers of philosophy)?  And they only know that there once was a certain religious and philosophical movement named in honor of Orpheus, and three or four postulates from it.  But even Archimedes and Pythagoras were Orphics.  Philip, Alexander‚Äôs father, brought a deadly sword over Greek culture and lifestyle.  And it seemed that her death could not be averted.  But the woman managed to find the ways that the winners turned into the vanquished, with their great consent. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="famous women" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/385260.jpg?1399143546146" width="288"></div>  Esther </h2><p>  Another name for the great woman in the history of the world, who performed a kind of feat.  It is in honor of Esther that Jews around the world have been celebrating Purim for more than 3 thousand years.  Her name is inscribed in the Bible and therefore only survived to this day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When financial and military elites came together in ancient Persia in a confrontation for power, Esther spoke for the financial side, most of which consisted of half-Jews to her.  Then the scales tipped in their favor, and the Jews won the longed-for victory. </p><p>  Many of the Jewish husbands contributed to the struggle for this victory, but even Mordechai was not honored with the memory of the entire Jewish people that went to Esther.  But she was only the wife of the king of Persia.  But it had such an impact on his decisions that the outcome of the battle was predetermined. </p><h2>  Amazons </h2><p>  Many have heard about this brave and warlike tribe.  But they are not called great.  And the thing is not even that their names are not preserved in the annals.  Just in direct, open, confrontation on the battlefields, they were inferior to men.  So, their queen could not withstand the onslaught of Achilles and heroically died at his hand.  This is easily explained: they did something unusual for women. </p><p>  Therefore, their history was deleted from their lists.  The stamina of a woman in the heat of bloody battles is inferior to the stamina of men, but in ordinary, everyday life they are an order of magnitude higher than the latter.  Many heroes, finding no use for their forces, drank themselves, fell, rushed, as if into a whirlpool, with all their might.  But with women, this happens much less often.  They have a powerful and great internal moral core. </p>

    <p>  So, the Holy Virgin and Jesus.  As a mother (who, by the way, gave birth to a son miraculously from the Holy Spirit), Mary could not pass him 100% of her genetic information.  In fact, the Savior should be, as it were, the Virgin in the male body.  Difficult?  Perhaps, but nothing can be done.  On top of that, Mary exerted a great moral influence on her firstborn.  She was present at his death, and was among the elect who met Jesus resurrected. </p><p>  According to legend, before her ascension to heaven, Mary lived under John the Theologian.  When heavenly angels began to visit him in visions, and then the Savior himself, John wanted to abandon his mission.  But it was the Mother of God that kept him from this step.  That is, again, here you can see how a woman in the history of mankind directs a man, and he is already doing significant things and glorifying himself with exploits. </p><h2>  Muse of the prophet </h2><p>  The guiding role of Khadiji in the life of a prophet is much clearer.  It was she who took the initiative to marry him.  She saw in time what potential lurks in a twenty-five-year-old young man.  She was the first, like no other, to appreciate the prophecies of Mohammed.  And, most likely, the prophet would never take the risky path of companionship without the moral and material support of his unforgettable first wife.  For this, she (according to legend) went to paradise with the help of the archangel Jebrail, although according to Islamic teachings women do not have a soul. </p><h2>  Role in history is not measured by fame </h2><p>  Widespread fame is far from the most accurate indicator of the role that a person plays in the history of mankind.  Many hollow breeds, famous women and men, shocking the public, or even villains are known much more than the true benefactors of all the intelligent inhabitants of planet Earth. </p><p>  You can compare Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, and Hypatia, the <span>great mathematician</span> and philosopher.  Cleopatra can add to her title the ‚Äúhigh rank‚Äù of the greatest woman in history.  But this is not true.  And the name of Hypatia for the vast majority of men will remain an empty phrase.  Although very many use its invention to this day.  This is an ordinary building level.  She came up with astrolabe.  Thanks to this, long trips to the open sea became possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="woman in human history" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/388877.jpg?1399216451274" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Cleopatra, with her ‚Äúunearthly‚Äù love, made a hero out of nothing, gave the independence of the country to the hands of the iron power of Rome.  She had everything, both military and economic, in order to organize the defense of her homeland, but did not use them.  Primitive thinking is not unique to the so-called great men.  But in the minds of most, Queen Cleopatra, at least, is one of the great women in history. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="great women in world history" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/388871.jpg?1399216303291" width="580"></div>

    <p>  And Hypatia was not only the last great mathematician of antiquity and the inventor of many useful things, but also led the movement to preserve the knowledge accumulated by mankind.  She defended this knowledge from Christianity, which had begun to become brutal, which made senseless the image of the Savior and began to claim power over the spiritual life of all people without exception.  She died heroically, but the knowledge she saved with her associates still helps to make our life better, more comfortable, more convenient.  Japanese stone gardens - this is her solution to the geometric problem, when from any point on the plane all the stones are visible, except one.  Without solving this problem in the twentieth century, they could not have created such a wonderful thing as a computer familiar to everyone.  Knowledge snoozed for 1,700 years to wake up in the heads of talented people and move the history of mankind further along the path of progress.  So there are great women in history.  Of course, they were different, and they went down in history in different ways. </p><p>  . </p><h2>  Olga is the creator of the core of Russian civilization </h2><p>  The category ‚ÄúGreat Women in the History of Russia‚Äù should start with Princess Olga, mother of Svyatoslav.  She ruled Russia for him, she directed him in great affairs. </p>

    <p>  Olga‚Äôs wisdom was so great that she did not allow her son‚Äôs heroism to drain the human and economic resources of Russia.  Olga gave exactly so much of the reserve that daring campaigns would benefit society and the state.  Nor did she come into conflict with her son, did not insist, and, most importantly, did not show the man that she was smarter than him. </p><p>  <span>Princess Olga also</span> saw the spiritual life of people.  Svyatoslav was blunt, like a warrior, and therefore put it simply: "Christianity is an abomination."  But Olga understood that the Vedic religion should recede for a while.  This is the dictate of the logic of history.  But you must always retreat wisely.  No wonder the military says retreat is a more complicated operation than an offensive.  She managed to weave the living stems of Vedism into the Christian worldview.  Without this, the Vedic renaissance of the 12th century would not have been possible.  And the "Word about Igor‚Äôs regiment" would not have been created, and the epics about Svyatogor would not have survived to this day.  And in Russia, as in Europe of those times, the fires of the Inquisition would burn.  And the architecture of Russian Orthodox churches would not bring glimpses of the Vedic vision of the universe.  And the word Orthodoxy itself would not exist.  What would happen?  Byzantine state.  Comments are unnecessary ... </p><p>  However, Olga is far from the only lady who is remembered in a conversation about the great women of the Russian land. </p><h2>  Great women in the history of Russia: dubious greatness </h2><p>  But there is greatness in exaggeration.  It is based on outward signs and brilliance.  In the history of Russia there are two empresses - Elizaveta Petrovna and Catherine II.  But only one of them was almost officially included in the list of ‚ÄúFamous Women in the History of the World‚Äù.  It's about Catherine the Second. </p>

    <p>  But it was precisely during the reign of Elizabeth (and it lasted 14 years) that Russia did not know the shocks.  War with external adversaries, which seemed to have lurked in those years, did not rattle, peasant uprisings did not occur, the morals of serfdom softened, and science and production developed.  And all this was done somehow quietly and imperceptibly.  And yet she is not as famous as the other ruler of the Russian State. </p><p>  Descendants know more about Catherine.  She was an enlightened woman with enormous knowledge and incredible potential.  But for some reason, no matter how insulting, when mentioning this woman in Russian history, obscenities are more often heard and lists of her countless favorites are recalled.  Such is human nature ... </p><p>  The history of mankind continues.  The twentieth century replenished the list under the title ‚ÄúGreat Women in the History of the World‚Äù with prominent figures: Queen of Detectives Agatha Christie;  space explorer Valentina Tereshkova;  expressive Coco Chanel;  Calcutta mother Teresa, in the world of Agnes Gonzha Boyakshu;  Fatal Marilyn Monroe and the unforgettable <span>Princess Diana.</span>  It is difficult to argue that a woman is the most mysterious, beautiful and unpredictable creature in the Universe, as well as the fact that without women our world would be much more boring. </p>
