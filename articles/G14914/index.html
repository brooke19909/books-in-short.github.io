    <ol><li>  After preparing all the starting materials, take the bezel and glue the large flowers first. </li><li>  In between place small details: leaves, buds. </li><li>  Glue extra decor. </li></ol><p>  So quickly you can create a beautiful accessory.  Unlike the first method, where you are limited by the colors with which you will find elastic bands, here the assortment of initial blanks is much wider.  This will allow you to diversify the created jewelry for the hair. </p><h2>  Paper flowers </h2><p>  You have already read how to make a rim with flowers with your own hands in several ways.  These are quick and easy options.  If you want more creativity and originality, make a floral decor yourself.  Then your product will be completely unique.  It is very simple to make flowers out of paper.  They look natural, just like real ones.  It will take more time and patience, but in this way you can make a bezel with any colors you want, and not with those that you could buy. </p><p>  The assembly scheme of the product is the same in all cases.  You have already studied it.  Flowers are made as follows: </p><ol><li>  Prepare paper in the desired shades.  As a rule, corrugated crepe is used, although spectacular floral elements can also be obtained from a regular sheet that does not stretch and without texture.  If you are going to carry the leaves, you definitely need green paper or tape.  You will also need scissors, glue, a pencil and a small piece of cardboard. </li><li>  When everything you need is in front of you, you can start creating blanks.  On the cardboard, draw petal patterns and cut them out. </li><li>  Give flat parts volume.  Corrugated and crepe paper is easily stretched with your fingers. </li><li>  Make a center and leaves. </li><li>  Gather all the details of the flower in one piece and do this to everyone. </li><li>  When all the parts are assembled, proceed with the assembly of the rim. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, from improvised inexpensive materials you can create amazing beauty and fashionable jewelry. </p><h2>  Textile headband with flowers </h2><p>  How to make a rim with flowers with your own hands?  A master class (photo of the finished product is below) will help you with this.  The previous section examined the technology of making paper decor.  It uses fabric.  Depending on what kind of appearance of the flowers you want to get, you can use both natural and synthetic materials. </p>

    <p>  To create realistic elements, chiffon, nylon are suitable.  For simplified colors, you can even take fleece or felt.  Work with fabric goes like this: </p><ol><li>  Like paper, blanks of petals and other details are cut from chiffon. </li><li>  Here it is imperative to process the edges of the elements above the candle flame so that the threads do not crumble.  This operation also adds volume to the petals. </li><li>  Separately, make the center (pestle) and stamens, if necessary. </li><li>  <span>Fabric flower</span> elements can be neatly stitched together or glued together. </li></ol><p>  Assembly and decoration of the rim are performed similarly to the previous options. </p><h2>  Kansashi Technique </h2><p>  In addition to the above, there is another way how to make a rim with flowers with your own hands from ribbons.  This is a very time-consuming method compared to all previously considered.  <span>Flowers</span> made using the <span>kanzashi</span> technique are decorative (unrealistic), but very unusual, bright and beautiful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a rim with flowers do-it-yourself master class photo" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/940016.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <p>  For production, as a rule, wide <span>satin ribbons are used.</span>  They are cut into squares, in which it is necessary to carefully process the edges above the flame.  The resulting blanks are stacked in different ways into details similar to the petals.  Small workpieces can be glued together, stitched or joined by fusing the material with fire.  Using different colors and folding patterns, very diverse compositions are obtained.  These jewelry look impressive on the rim, and on hairpins, and on elastic bands.  Initially, it will create a single set in this way. </p><p>  You learned how to make a rim with flowers with your own hands.  Choose your favorite method, prepare materials and tools.
