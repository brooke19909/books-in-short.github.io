The grandiose project, which in 2013 celebrated the fifteenth anniversary of the beginning of its implementation, embodies all the achievements of modern technical thought.  An impressive part of the material about near and deep space and some earthly phenomena and processes of scientists is provided precisely by the international space station.  The ISS, however, was not built in one day, its creation was preceded by an almost thirty-year history of space exploration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="international space station" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/735755.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How it all began </h2><p>  The predecessors of the ISS were <span>orbital stations.</span>  The undisputed superiority in the creation of them was occupied by Soviet technicians and engineers.  Work on the Almaz project began at the end of 1964.  Scientists worked on a manned orbital station, which could be 2-3 astronauts.  It was assumed that Almaz will last for two years and all this time will be used for research.  According to the project, the main part of the complex was the OPS - orbital manned station.  It housed the working areas of crew members, as well as a household compartment.  The OPS was equipped with two hatches for going out into outer space and dropping to Earth special capsules with information, as well as a passive docking station. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The efficiency of the station is largely determined by its energy reserves.  The developers of Diamond have found a way to increase them many times over.  Delivery of astronauts and various cargo to the station was carried out by supply vehicles (TKS).  Among other things, they were equipped with an active docking system, a powerful energy resource, and an excellent traffic control system.  TKS was able to supply energy to the station for a long time, as well as manage the entire complex.  All subsequent similar projects, including the international space station, were created using the same method of saving resources of the OPS. </p><h2>  First </h2><p>  The rivalry with the United States made Soviet scientists and engineers work as quickly as possible, therefore, another orbital station, Salyut, was created as soon as possible.  She was taken into space in April 1971.  The base of the station is the so-called working compartment, which includes two cylinders, a small and a large one.  Inside the smaller diameter was a control point, sleeping places and recreation areas, storage and eating.  The larger cylinder is a reservoir of scientific equipment, simulators, which no such flight can do without, and there was also a shower cabin and a toilet isolated from the rest of the room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first international space station" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/735557.jpg"></div>

These orbital stations marked the beginning of a new era in the study of space and terrestrial processes.  "Salutes" were the base on which a large number of studies were conducted in the field of medicine, physics, industry and agriculture.  It is also difficult to overestimate the experience of using the orbital station, which was successfully applied during the operation of the next manned complex. </p><h2>  "World" </h2><p>  The process of accumulating experience and knowledge was long, the result of which was the international space station.  "Mir" - a modular manned complex - its next stage.  It was tested on the so-called block principle of creating a station, when for some time the bulk of it increases its technical and research power due to the addition of new modules.  It will subsequently be "borrowed" by the international space station.  Mir became a model of technical and engineering skills of our country and actually provided it with one of the leading roles in the creation of the ISS. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="international space station world" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/735558.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Work on the construction of the station began in 1979, and it was delivered into orbit on February 20, 1986.  Throughout the entire existence of the "World", various studies have been carried out on it.  The necessary equipment was delivered as part of additional modules.  The Mir station allowed scientists, engineers and researchers to gain invaluable experience in using a <span>spacecraft of a</span> similar scale.  In addition, it became a place of peaceful international cooperation: in 1992, an agreement on cooperation in space was signed between Russia and the United States.  It actually began to be realized in 1995, when the American Shuttle set off for the Mir station. </p><h2>  Completion of flight </h2><p>  The Mir station has become the site of a wide variety of studies.  Here were analyzed, updated and opened data in the field of biology and astrophysics, space technology and medicine, geophysics and biotechnology. </p><p>  The station ended its existence in 2001.  The reason for the decision to flood it was the development of an energy resource, as well as some accidents.  Various versions of rescue of the object were put forward, but they were not accepted, and in March 2001 the Mir station was immersed in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. </p><h2>  Establishment of an international space station: preparatory phase </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating the ISS arose even at a time when thoughts of flooding the Mir had never occurred to anyone.  The indirect cause of the station was the political and financial crisis in our country and economic problems in the United States.  Both powers realized their inability to cope alone with the task of creating an orbital station.  In the early nineties, a cooperation agreement was signed, one of the points of which was the international space station.  The ISS as a project united not only Russia and the USA, but, as already noted, another fourteen countries.  At the same time that the participants were identified, the ISS project was approved: the station will consist of two integrated units, American and Russian, and will be staffed in orbit in a modular manner similar to the World. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="international space station" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/735554.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  "Dawn" </h2><p>  The first international space station began its existence in orbit in 1998.  On November 20, with the help of the Proton rocket, the functional-cargo block of the Russian production Zarya was launched.  He became the first segment of the ISS.  Structurally, it was similar to some of the modules of the Mir station.  It is interesting that the American side suggested building the ISS directly in orbit, and only the experience of Russian colleagues and the example of the World incline them towards the modular method. </p><p>  Inside, ‚ÄúZarya‚Äù is equipped with various devices and equipment, <span>life support systems,</span> docking, power supply, control.  An impressive part of the equipment, including fuel tanks, radiators, cameras and solar panels, are located on the outside of the module.  All external elements are protected from meteorites by special screens. </p><h2>  Module by module </h2><p>  On December 5, 1998, the Endeavor shuttle with the Unity American docking module headed for Dawn.  Two days later, Unity was docked to the Dawn.  Further, the international space station ‚Äúacquired‚Äù the Zvezda service module, the manufacture of which was also carried out in Russia.  Zvezda was a modernized base unit of Mir station. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ISS International Space Station" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/735555.jpg" width="600"></div>  The docking of the new module took place on July 26, 2000.  From that moment on, Zvezda took control of the ISS, as well as all life support systems, and it was possible for the astronauts to stay at the station continuously.

    <h2>  Transition to manned mode </h2><p>  The first crew of the international space station was delivered by Soyuz TM-31 on November 2, 2000.  It included V. Shepherd, commander of the expedition, Yu. Gidzenko, pilot, <span>S. Krikalev</span> , flight engineer.  From this moment, a new phase of operation of the station began: it switched to manned mode. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crew of the international space station" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/735553.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The composition of the second expedition: <span>Yuri Usachev,</span> James Voss and Susan Halms.  She changed her first crew in early March 2001. </p><h2>  <span>The study of space</span> and earthly phenomena </h2><p>  The International Space Station is the venue for a variety of <span>scientific research.</span>  The task of each crew is also to collect data on some space processes, study the properties of certain substances in zero gravity, and so on.  Scientific research conducted at the ISS can be presented in the form of a generalized list: </p><ul><li>  observation of various distant objects of space; </li><li>  study of <span>dark matter,</span> cosmic rays; </li><li>  Earth observation, including the study of atmospheric phenomena; </li><li>  study of the characteristics of physical and biological processes in zero gravity; </li><li>  testing of new materials and technologies in outer space; </li><li>  medical research, including the creation of new drugs, the testing of diagnostic methods in zero gravity; </li><li>  semiconductor materials manufacturing. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="creation of an international space station" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/735556.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Future </h2><p>  Like any other object subjected to such a heavy load and so intensively operated, the ISS will sooner or later cease to function at the required level.  It was originally supposed that its ‚Äúexpiration date‚Äù would end in 2016, that is, the station was given only 15 years.  However, from the first months of its operation, assumptions began to sound that this period was somewhat understated.  Today, hopes are expressed that the international space station will operate until 2020.  Then, probably, the same fate awaits her as the Mir station: the ISS will be flooded in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. </p><p>  Today, the international space station, the photo of which is presented in the article, successfully continues to circle in orbit around our planet.  From time to time in the media you can find references to new research done on board the station.  The ISS is also the only object of space tourism: only at the end of 2012, eight amateur astronauts visited it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="earth from space" class="if" height="468" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/735751.jpg" width="600"></div>  It can be assumed that this type of entertainment will only gain strength, since the Earth from space is a fascinating view.  And no photograph can be compared with the opportunity to see such beauty from the porthole of the international space station.
