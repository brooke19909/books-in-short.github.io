It is no secret that not every family, especially a young one, has the opportunity to purchase their own apartment, so people are increasingly interested in what housing lending is and how to arrange it.  The bottom line is that if a citizen does not have funds to buy real estate, you can apply for a mortgage at Sberbank and get the necessary amount of money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.outsource2india.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apply for refinancing a mortgage with a savings bank" class="if uuid-2975249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/2975249.jpg"></div><h2>  What does a mortgage mean </h2><p>  She is represented in various programs.
