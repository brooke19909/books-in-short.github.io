  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to open an account in a foreign bank.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In a crisis and in connection with the unstable and tense situation in the country, Russian citizens are increasingly thinking about opening an account with a foreign bank.  The order of filing and paperwork is a rather complicated procedure, but if desired and competent organization, it is feasible for almost every resident of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Ways to open an account with a foreign bank. </h2><p>  You should immediately decide on the concept of a foreign bank.  All banks located in the Russian Federation are subsidiaries of foreign banks.  And their activities are fully regulated by the Central Bank.  These financial institutions are subject to the laws and jurisdictions of the Russian Federation, just like any Russian bank.  In our country, the activities of foreign banks are prohibited.  Therefore, in order to <noindex>  <span>open an account with the European Bank</span> </noindex>  You need to use one of two ways: <br>  1. Personally visit a bank branch in another country. <br>  2. Seek help from intermediary firms. <br><br>  For personal use, you should prepare a certain set of documents, which is better to familiarize yourself with in advance.  You can obtain the necessary information on the bank's website or at a Russian subsidiary.  The main documents include: </p><ul><li>  passport of a citizen of Russia; </li><li>  international passport; </li><li>  certificate of no criminal record; </li><li>  income statement; </li><li>  certificate of family composition. </li></ul><p>  Some banks may require additional documents.  For example: characteristics from the place of work, utility bills, recommendations from Russian banks.  And sometimes a personal interview with a bank employee is required.  This procedure is usually requested from US banks, Swiss or English banks. <br><br>  If you use the help of a company engaged in opening accounts in foreign banks, you should additionally provide a sample of certified signature.  The signature is certified at the consulate of the country where you plan to open an account, or at a subsidiary of a foreign bank in Russia.  The cost of opening an account varies depending on the country and branch of the bank, and can be more than 10 thousand dollars. </p><h2>  Account management methods. </h2><p>  Managing funds in a foreign account is not much different from managing money in a domestic bank.  This can be done using online banking, a checkbook, a plastic card and other methods, including courier services.  But to deposit money into the account will be much more difficult.  There are two ways: cash and cashless.  When transferring funds from an account in a Russian bank to a foreign account, you should provide the bank with a tax certificate.  Cash transfer is carried out through an intermediary company or a bank branch in Russia.  In both cases, a fee is charged. </p><h2>  Additional important information </h2><p>  It is important to know that having opened an account with a foreign bank, you should inform the tax service about this within a month.  And every year to report to the organization on the status of the account. </p></div></article>
