  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to knit a facial crossed loop Features and Secrets</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the fastest and most unusual ways to decorate the fabric when knitting is knitting with crossed crossed loops.  Using the modified facial loops, you can form any pattern on a plain canvas.  If you knit a loop through one loop according to the scheme, you will get a voluminous relief fabric in which it will be warm and comfortable to walk even in severe frosts.  This pattern is most often knitted sweaters, hats, panties for children, as well as adults.  Knitting is magnificent and at the same time dense, which allows the product to retain heat near the body for a long time. </p><p>  You can also knit only with crossed loops such things as coats, warm skirts, trousers.  Knitting will be dense, inelastic, but very warm. </p><p>  Often crossed loops come out randomly.  For example, with circular knitting.  To knit a straight front loop, you need to take the loop for the back wall (right half), but the crosses are obtained if you start the knitting needle for the front wall (left half). </p><p>  The front crossed loop is also necessary when you need to make knit loops.  If you knit a regular straight front loop, a hole will appear at the site of the increase, which does not always look beautiful and aesthetically pleasing.  Therefore, the craftswomen know such a secret, and add a crossed loop.  Then there will be no hole - it will be closed by a cross of threads, the finished product will look even and neat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oknit.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="straight and crossed loops" class="if uuid-2243437" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69973/2243437.jpg"></div><h2>  How to knit crossed loops: a brief educational program </h2><p>  A crossed front loop is a regular front loop that is tied to another wall.  There is no fundamental difference from the usual straight face loop, but the appearance of the face crossed loop is interesting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="w05.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="front loops" class="if uuid-2243430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69973/2243430.jpg"></div><p>  Unfortunately, this type of knitting is only suitable for hand knitting.  To understand how to knit a crossed facial loop, it is important to understand the intricacies: the whole point of knitting with crossed crossed facial loops is that the loop with the front or wrong knitting is taken not on the other side, as in regular knitting, but on the other part, side .  In machine knitting, this type of knitting is incredibly difficult to apply, you have to constantly turn the loop, which is not very convenient, extremely labor-intensive and energy-intensive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="w05.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting a simple front loop" class="if uuid-2243431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69973/2243431.jpg"></div><h2>  Multicolor Cross-Stitch Knitting </h2><p>  You can knit with facial crossed loops not only plain fabrics, but you can add other colors in knitting.  For example, you can draw a contour of a figure, shift it to the canvas, calculate the correct number of loops, form a pattern of crossed front loops and knit it with a different color.  Small flowers, checkmarks, rhombuses and similar patterns will look ideal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Crossed front loop: how to knit </h2><p>  First you need to determine the pattern and repetition rate in knitting of crossed loops.  When knitting one loop through one loop, a rather uniform product is obtained, which can be diluted with other colors, stripes, patterns.  When knitting two loops through two loops, you will get a pattern similar to a chessboard, which when knitting for boys looks quite interesting.  To avoid unnecessary work, a pattern of crossed front loops must be thought out in advance.  Patterns of rhombuses, wavy lines, diagonal lines, honeycombs and other simple patterns look very good. </p><p>  In total, there are two options for knitting a crossed loop, both are executed by knitting behind the front wall.  The only difference is that the working thread can be captured both clockwise and counterclockwise, and the shape of the resulting loop depends on this.  Try this in your work and see how the new eyelet on the right needle will look. </p><div class="photo" data-original="w05.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit crossed front stitch" class="if uuid-2243434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69973/2243434.jpg"></div><p>  It is not very convenient to knit a crossed front loop; each experienced needlewoman will automatically knit the correct straight front loop without hesitation, and never confuse the front loop with the crossed front. </p><p>  When knitting the fabric on the wrong side, you can also repeat the pattern (and sometimes it is even necessary to get the desired pattern), and then the craftswoman knits the wrong crossed loop.  The knitting method is exactly the same: we start the knitting needle behind the back wall of the loop of the previous row and pull out a new loop, already crossed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="w05.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet back loop knitting" class="if uuid-2243433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69973/2243433.jpg"></div><h2>  Important differences </h2><p>  The usual (that is, a straight facial loop) is always knitted for the right half.  The crossed (crossed) front loop knits for the left half, that is, the back wall with direct rather than circular knitting.  Perhaps this is all the features of such knitting.  Really easy? </p>
