France and its southern features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The oldest and one of the most interesting countries in the world is France.  Montpellier (photo of the city - in the article) is one of its largest cities, the capital of the Languedoc-Roussillon region, which is located in the south-west of the country.  In the old days, the Mediterranean Sea approached directly to the city center, and this place was considered one of the most prestigious and sought after by the rich.  Therefore, so many churches, cathedrals and palaces have been set up here that delight their eyes with chic and gloss.  Today, the waters of the sea receded 10 km, so all local beaches are located in the suburbs. </p><h2>  How to get to Montpellier </h2><p>  This southern warm city can be reached in several ways, and each of them will have its own budget and its own characteristics.  Firstly, the city of the same name located Montpellier Airport.  France is a popular country, so flights from Paris are carried out with enviable frequency.  Also by air in Montpellier you can fly from London, Berlin, Brussels and Amsterdam.  On four rented wheels you can drive all over France, including its southern regions.  Well, the railway in this place has many connections.  Trains to this area run from Paris, Leon, Nice, and even from Barcelona. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montpellier France" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/469342.jpg" width="585"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport in the city </h2><p>  Montpellier (France) - although one of the capitals of the regions, is very compact.  In fact, this ancient town can be walked on in half a day and at the same time see a lot of attractions and beauties of this area. </p><p>  However, the French who live here actively use cars and public transport.  In this regard, huge traffic jams are constantly gathering in the narrow ancient streets.  So, if you are a tourist, then do not buy bus tickets and do not rent a car.  The best option for this town is to rent a bike or get on a tram.  By the way, this is the only mode of transport that runs until one in the morning. </p>

    <h2>  Where to stay in the Southern resort town </h2><p>  That's really what was done here on a grand scale - these are the hotels of Montpellier.  France is a very expensive country, so the price of daily accommodation in a five-star hotel will be much higher than 5 thousand rubles.  Three-star apartments in this city can be rented for 2-4 thousand rubles.  The rest of the housing, which is offered in the district, is no longer included in the standard package of a tourist permit.  However, the living conditions in these hotels are fully consistent with their price.  Everything is thought out here, moreover, each room is arranged taking into account the tastes and preferences of wealthy tourists. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cuisine, restaurants and eateries in Montpellier </h2><p>  France, as you know, is famous for its unique cuisine, a few specific, but very tasty and sophisticated.  However, this wonderful resort city is by no means a haven of national restaurants and other establishments that offer tourists to taste French delicacies.  There are a lot of <span>Italian restaurants,</span> Spanish as well as Arab.  Sandwiches and <span>kebabs, shawarma</span> and other light snacks are prepared on the streets and in outdoor cafes.  But what is truly French here is the fault.  In the region they are produced in especially large quantities, so you can taste them in any restaurant.  The advantage should be given to red varieties, the most astringent and bright in their taste. </p>

    <h2>  The wealth of the southern capital </h2><p>  Beautiful and ancient architecture interspersed with neo-classics and modernism, as well as many unique stucco moldings - these are the main cultural secrets that Montpellier keeps in itself.  <span>France, the sights of</span> which can be considered for years, in this region is becoming a little different, lighter and fresher than all the other ancient cities.  The most ancient buildings in the area are houses located in the Aragon quarter.  It exists here from the 12th century, from the moment of the formation of the dynasty of the kings of Aragon, who ruled here for a long time.  Extremely narrow streets have been preserved here, on which even a car, pavers and building facades will not pass.  One of them shows a tower, which at that time served as an observatory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels Montpellier France" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/469339.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Modern houses and their style </h2><p>  In the 20th century, the city was almost completely renovated.  Here, residential buildings and community centers grew, which in their style resemble the era of antiquity.  They are found at home in a neo-classical spirit, simple and modest, but at the same time chic and expensive.  On the streets of the city began to open <span>summer cafes,</span> open bars and restaurants.  Montpellier hotel complexes were built in a different architectural style.  France, thanks to them, became famous as a resort region, and people began to come here to rest as often as to the islands. </p><h2>  Sea holidays in Montpellier </h2>

    <p>  France, whose beaches are mostly pebble, does not cease to amaze its guests.  It is in this small (by our standards) town that the widest sandy recreation areas are located, with infrastructure and all the necessary equipment.  Rest here is possible absolutely anything: both in the circle of a noisy company, and family, quiet and measured.  Sun loungers and beach chairs are for rent, umbrellas can be used for free.  Far from the central beaches of Carnon and Palavas-les-Flots, there are many wild bays.  There are no cafes and bars, these places are designed for secluded relaxation, complete relaxation and unity with nature and the sea.  Also, at some distance from the city you can find beaches on which quite high waves rise.  These are great places for windsurfing and kitesurfing. </p>
