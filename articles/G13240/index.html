This is one of the most popular and reliable financial institutions, which millions of citizens and companies trust their money with.  Payment plastic is issued for a certain period, after which it becomes necessary to replace the card.  In case of unscheduled cases: loss, damage, blocking, change of surname and other situations, the Sberbank card is also re-issued.  Replacement is carried out in one of the bank branches.  What needs to be done for this procedure, we will consider in the article. </p><h2>  Planned reissue </h2><p>  Sberbank issues cards valid for a year to three years, which depends on the type of plastic chosen.  The procedure is provided for security and protection against theft of funds.  A planned <span>replacement of Sberbank cards is</span> carried out only in one case - after the expiration of its validity.  The date of the next reissue is indicated on the front side of the plastic next to the inscription Good thru (Valid thru) in the format ‚Äúmonth / year‚Äù.  The bank warns the user with an SMS alert a couple of months before the planned replacement. </p>

First you need to decide whether the card holder needs in the future.  Sberbank does not impose its products, therefore, when it is time for the next replacement, the individual has a choice: </p><ul><li>  continue cooperation on the same conditions; </li><li>  refuse to issue a card; </li><li>  switch to another tariff plan and type of plastic. </li></ul><p>  Regardless of what choice the client made for himself, the first step after the expiration of the term will be a visit to a branch of Sberbank.  It is advisable to come to the office where the expired card was received (usually this is a territorial office at the registration address).  You need to take your passport and payment plastic with you.  Turning to a specialist, you need to explain the situation and find out if the Sberbank card was automatically replaced after the expiration date.  In this case, it remains only to pick it up by signing several documents, unless, of course, the client does not mind continuing cooperation. </p>

    <p>  Even if it so happens that the expiration date, you must contact Sberbank yourself.  Replacing <span>salary cards</span> is identical to another debit plastic.  You will need to leave a statement and wait for release.  You don‚Äôt have to worry about getting a salary: for this, you use a bank account tied to a card.  The money will go to him, and you can withdraw it at the Sberbank branch through the cashier.  After receiving a new card, account details do not change. </p><h2>  Reasons for an unplanned replacement </h2><p>  Sberbank cards do not always ‚Äúlive out‚Äù to the end of their term.  Replacement is sometimes required in case of emergency.  Among them are common cases such as: </p><ul><li>  spoilage; </li><li>  loss or theft; </li><li>  ATM capture; </li><li>  declassification of card data. </li></ul><p>  These are urgent incidents, which in the interests of the holder should be resolved by reissuing plastic.  There are more expected changes that lead to the invalidity of the card: change of surname (less often first name, middle name). </p><p>  An unplanned reissue, regardless of the reasons, is a paid service.  New plastic will cost the client from 30 to 150 rubles, depending on the type of card.  Do not worry about the financial side of reissue holders of premium plastic.  "Gold" and "platinum" cards under any circumstances are replaced with new ones for free and much faster than classic ones. </p><h2>  Replacement for loss or theft </h2><p>  The main reason for an unplanned reissue is the theft of plastic or its loss.  In both cases, you need to act quickly.  First you need to block the card so that attackers or lucky ones who discover orphan plastic cannot use the owner‚Äôs money.  You can do this by calling the Sberbank contact center, sending an SMS (if you have the Mobile Bank service) or by completing the action yourself through your Sberbank Online account. </p><p>  After that, you should contact the bank office where the card was issued.  The client fills out an unscheduled reissue application, indicating the reason.  If you wish, you can close an existing account and open a new one, or transfer funds to another one.  Unscheduled circulation periods for replacing a Sberbank card are a standard period of 3-5 business days, but sometimes delays (up to 14 days) occur. </p><h2>  Spoilage of plastic </h2><p>  Sometimes it happens that the card is demagnetized or breaks due to physical impact.  The situation is unpleasant, but solved.  Damage to plastic, regardless of the reasons, leads to an unscheduled reissue of a Sberbank card.  Replacement is carried out by personal appeal of the owner to the territorial branch of the bank.  At the same time, the client has the right to leave the same type of card or choose a more interesting tariff for himself.  Before receiving new plastic on hand, you can use the funds using your account through the cashier. </p><p>  When ‚Äúcapturing‚Äù a card by an ATM there is a great chance of its destruction.  It will have to be restored according to the same algorithm as with loss. </p><h2>  Card reissue upon change of personal data </h2><p>  Replacing a Sberbank card when changing a surname is made upon personal appeal of the client.  Do not hesitate to reissue for the following reasons: </p><ul><li>  if you lose your card and regain access to the account opened by the old name of the holder, problems will arise; </li><li>  wage and other income payment transactions will not ‚Äúpass‚Äù; </li><li>  inconsistencies in the database of the bank and passport will lead to significant inconvenience. </li></ul><p>  Contact the credit and financial institution that issued the card with irrelevant personal data should immediately after receiving a document confirming the change of name.  The procedure does not take much time and consists of the following actions: </p><ol><li>  Appeal to the territorial branch of the bank. </li><li>  Submission of applications: to change personal data and reissue a card. </li><li>  Getting a new card. </li></ol><p>  In addition to the passport, you will need a document on the change of surname: certificate of marriage / divorce, other official paper.  Reissue is carried out within 5 working days, but delays are not excluded.  The service is paid - from 30 to 150 rubles (for Gold and Platinum cards - 0 rubles), like any unplanned replacement of Sberbank cards. </p><p>  The change of surname is usually preceded by planned events, so the client has the opportunity to think ahead and visit the bank. </p><h2>  Re-issuing credit cards </h2><p>  Like debit, credit cards have a fixed validity period, after which they must be replaced with new ones.  In this case, the rules for contacting the bank remain the same: if you want to extend the period of use, the client personally or through the Sberbank Online system submits an application for reissue.  Although most often the organization independently takes care of the extension in automatic mode. </p>

With a planned reissue, only the CVV2 / CVC2 security code located on the reverse side and the validity period are changed.  The PIN may be changed.  Card number remains the same. </p>
