The ATM did not give out money, what should I do?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sometimes when using an ATM you can get into a situation, and it‚Äôs not always pleasant.  It often happens that the ATM wrote off funds from the account, but did not give out the money.  And although this can happen to everyone, how to behave - not everyone knows.  In the case when the self-service device managed to print a check, then this is simply a great success, and therefore it should be saved.  This document will be a confirmation of such an incident. </p><p>  Basically, Sberbank does not give out money in the event of a technical malfunction of its devices.  For example, a signal with a button that is responsible for issuing banknotes may disappear.  In the event of a system breakdown, the amount may also be partially issued.  Regardless of what happened, you should definitely contact the bank.  You can call the support service or contact a bank employee who is competent in this matter. </p>

    <h2>  Reasons why the ATM does not issue money </h2><p>  There are several reasons why Sberbank does not give out money.  The most common are such as: </p><p>  - objective reasons, without cancellation; </p><p>  - demagnetized strip of cards; </p><p>  - there was a technical failure with the debit of funds from the card; </p><p>  - fraud. </p><h2>  Other reasons </h2>

    <p>  One of the possible reasons why ATMs may not issue funds is the lack of necessary banknotes.  In this case, you can simply use another device that allows you to perform such an operation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The next reason is the lack of the necessary amount in the client's account.  Of course, Sberbank does not give out money today through ATMs in excess of the available amount.  In addition, the device itself and the printed receipt will show this information in the form of a message.  If the client knows the exact amount of funds on the card, but still could not withdraw the money, then in this case, perhaps, a commission for withdrawing funds is provided.  To find out, you should carefully study the <span>terms of the contract</span> and perform a second operation. </p><p>  Also, Sberbank will cease to issue money through an ATM if the amount of the daily limit has already been withdrawn from the account.  Some financial institutions, including Sberbank, have a daily limit on the issuance of funds, especially for credit cards.  If the client was not notified about this in advance, then he can simply come to the bank branch and clarify all the conditions on the card. </p><p>  If the card, as used over time, slightly changed its shape, bent, or a crack appeared on it, the ATM may swallow it or simply not accept it.  In this situation, you should contact the bank for a reissue of the card.  This situation can only be avoided with careful storage of the card. </p><p>  But, despite all this, the most unpleasant situation is to write off funds from the account without actually providing them. </p><h2>  How to behave if the <span>Sberbank ATM</span> did not give out money, but wrote it off? </h2>

It may be that there was a failure, and information on this is indicated on the check, but the funds were not withdrawn from the account.  To verify this, you should insert the card back into the ATM and check the balance.  If the money was nevertheless withdrawn, then any further action can already be taken. </p><p>  When ascertaining the reasons why Sberbank does not give out money, it is imperative to keep the check if it was issued.  In order to return funds that were not issued by the ATM, it is necessary to provide the bank with a check, passport and a card from which the client tried to withdraw money.  Be sure to write a statement in which you need to describe in detail what happened.  For example, if the ATM first issued the money, and then it was captured back, or if the necessary amount was incorrectly issued. </p><h2>  What else can be done? </h2>

    <p>  The instructions to the ATMs indicate that if Sberbank has not issued the money in full, then you should urgently contact the bank and declare that a shortage has occurred.  With the right and timely actions, the funds will be returned to the account very quickly.  Money should always be counted carefully right at the ATM.  The procedure may take longer if the funds were withdrawn from ATMs of another bank, since the operation was carried out from them, respectively, and the money should be returned to them.  But customers always turn to the bank that issued the card. </p><h2>  How long is the money back? </h2><p>  The return of the missing amounts is carried out for some time, approximately it is about two weeks.  If the amount is not very large and the loyal customer is dear to the bank, then it will be returned immediately after the security service checks the relevant bank - in our case, it is Sberbank.  ATMs do not give out money very often, so all incidents are carefully checked and when confirming the issue, when the funds have already been credited, the amount can be debited back, even if there are not enough funds on the account.  In this case, a negative balance is formed on the card. </p><h2>  Some nuances of the procedure </h2>

    <p>  As we already said, the situation will become more complicated if an ATM of someone else‚Äôs bank was used.  In this case, the issue will be resolved for a very long time, and, accordingly, the funds will not be returned to the account soon.  For this reason, it is better to use Sberbank to use payment devices.  ATMs do not give out money - this happens here, but they will return very quickly.  Anyway, you should not use such devices that very often fail.  If there is no other way, then you can get money through the cashier. </p><p>  If a check is issued for an operation, then its unique code must be indicated in it, so you should not throw it away, because it can still be useful for six months.  If an incident occurs when Sberbank does not give out money at an ATM, you should know one answer to the question "what to do" - you should save the check. </p><h2>  Whose fault is it if the ATM did not give out the money? </h2>

    <p>  If the operation was completed and the amount was not provided, then this is mainly the fault of the ATM, and perhaps the reason is its technical malfunction.  But if, when issuing funds, they were simply forgotten at the ATM, and they were seized by him, then simple inattention is to blame.  When contacting the bank, it is imperative to explain in detail what happened, since by non-issue of money by an ATM customers mean different situations. </p><p>  We should not forget that you need to contact exactly where the card was issued, even if the incident happened elsewhere.  Just write down the device number, the name of the bank and the time when the operation was completed. </p><p>  In our life, a variety of situations happen, so the main thing is not to panic.  If through an ATM Sberbank did not give out money or issued, but not completely, then you just need to contact the bank. </p>
