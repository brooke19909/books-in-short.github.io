Therefore, for most, the profession of an artist is shrouded in romance.  It seems that they live in a unique world full of bright colors and unique events.  However, this is the same profession as everyone else.  And when you find out how much artists earn, you will most likely be surprised.  Let's get to know this profession better. </p><h2>  Where are the artists in demand? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="german.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does the artist earn per month" class="if uuid-2679352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2679352.jpg"></div><p>  After graduating from an educational institution, yesterday‚Äôs graduate will be able to apply his talent for employment in: </p><ul><li>  advertising agency; </li><li>  fashion salon; </li><li>  private studio; </li><li>  art, etc. </li></ul><p>  Some manage to begin to learn the profession in practice while still students. </p><h2>  What affects the income of the artist </h2><p>  How much do artists earn?  The answer directly depends on the form of employment and your own self-esteem. </p><p>  Someone prefers to remain a free artist, painting and selling paintings.  Novice creators cannot count on high pay.  Typically, newcomers receive a small income by selling their own paintings.  However, it is impossible to know in advance how much an artist earns per month, because success is largely determined by the presence of an interested public, as well as the place chosen for the sale of paintings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is another category of artists who prefer to get a permanent job.  Companies that create illustrations and advertising products are pleased to open their doors for them: logos, banners, etc. In this case, the artist‚Äôs income will be more predictable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pic2.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much do artists earn" class="if uuid-2679350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2679350.jpg"></div><p>  For those who paint portraits, summer is considered the most profitable season.  While walking, people often turn to street <span>artists, wanting to</span> get their own portrait.  Typically, rates are from 800 rubles and above. </p><p>  Perhaps the most important factor affecting the artist‚Äôs income is his popularity.  Sometimes even talented craftsmen are unclaimed.  Because of their own modesty, they remain behind self-confident individuals who lack talent. </p><h2>  Average rates </h2><p>  To get a general impression of how much artists earn, let's turn to statistics. </p><ul><li>  Beginners - 10-15 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Medium - about 2 thousand dollars. </li><li>  Upscale - up to 10 thousand dollars and above. </li></ul><p>  Of particular importance in terms of income is the artist‚Äôs fame.  Brand masters can sell their paintings for a huge cost. </p><h2>  Working conditions </h2><p>  This factor is not the last value.  It is important not only how much artists earn in Russia, but also in what conditions they have to work.  Each master decides for himself in which environment it will be more convenient for him to create.  Someone prefers the territory of the employer.  Someone likes to work in their own workshop, creating comfortable conditions for themselves. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Professional Requirements, or How to Become an Artist </h2><p>  Any talent requires cutting.  That is why the presence of artistic inclinations is not enough.  Have to attend an educational institution. </p><p>  Some even in their youth enter art schools.  This hobby has to be combined with the main place of study.  However, in this way, young talents undergo a kind of hardening.  If the love of art does not dissipate in a few years, you can seriously think about entering a university. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.heimhelden.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much do artists make animators" class="if uuid-2679354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2679354.jpg"></div><p>  The applicant can choose one of the specialties, one way or another related to art: </p><ul><li>  design; </li><li>  graphics; </li><li>  painting; </li><li>  Fine arts; </li><li>  arts and crafts, etc. </li></ul><p>  It is also important to understand that the profession of an artist is very diverse.  There are many directions.  Sooner or later, you will have to decide on the scope of work.  You can become an illustrator, animator, cartoonist, animator, fashion designer, restorer, etc. </p><p>  Training for an artist lasts several years and has a lot of nuances and difficulties. </p><p>  It is not surprising that young boys and girls are wondering how much an artist earns per month in Russia.  They are interested in the prospects of the profession.  It is possible that the size of income will not suit everyone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Employment contract for artists </h2><p>  The presence of a document describing the relationship between the artist and the customer, allows you to defend your rights and avoid conflicts.  That is why you should not neglect the existence of an employment contract.  This applies to those who get a permanent job, and those who prefer to remain a freelancer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eag-fpi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much do animators earn" class="if uuid-2679357" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2679357.jpg"></div><p>  Not every artist manages to conclude an agreement on their own terms.  To do this, you need to build a reputation and wait for customers to line up themselves.  Having become famous and in demand, a talented artist will be able to conclude labor contracts, putting forward his own requirements and not experiencing fear of losing another customer.  After all, new ones will come in his place. </p><h2>  Ways to make money </h2><p>  There are many options for monetizing artistic talent.  The choice directly affects how much artists earn.  Let's find out the most popular ways. </p><h2>  Sale of finished paintings </h2><p>  Not everyone likes to complete creative orders by the due date.  Therefore, a worthy alternative will be the creation of paintings at a convenient time and subsequent sale at exhibitions or online venues.  Ideally, a combination of both methods.  This increases the reach of the audience and, accordingly, increases the chances of a successful transaction. </p><h2>  Work with different clients </h2><p>  Potential customers for the artist may be individuals or entire companies.  Among the latter, publishers, advertising firms, banks, game developers, etc. are usually called. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much an artist earns per month in Russia" class="if uuid-2679356" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2679356.jpg"></div><p>  Specializing in private clients, the artist can offer portraits of photographs.  It is convenient for both the master and the customer.  Communication and file sharing take place via the Internet, which saves time on personal meetings.  At the same time, you can negotiate with several clients, and perform work in a convenient schedule. </p><h2>  Photobanks </h2><p>  These are platforms where the artist can sell images.  Only in this case, we are not referring to the drawings that are created on paper by hand.  We are talking about images in the style of vector graphics.  For this, the artist will require knowledge of special programs. </p><h2>  How much does an illustrator earn? </h2><p>  The master who has chosen this specialization is involved in the design of various print publications - books, magazines, etc. To get the job you will need an artistic taste and detailed knowledge about the product.  After all, illustrations are precisely created to express the essence of what is being told in a book or magazine.  Pictures should complement the general meaning, and not exist on their own. </p><p>  Illustrator can work in different genres: </p><ul><li>  comics; </li><li>  retro; </li><li>  fashion; </li><li>  caricature; </li><li>  science fiction etc. </li></ul><p>  If an artist works for himself, he will still need the entrepreneur's talent to find clients.  The income directly depends on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.heimhelden.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does an illustrator earn" class="if uuid-2679353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2679353.jpg"></div><p>  The average salary for self-employed illustrators ranges from 20 to 60 thousand rubles.  For freelance artists, the numbers may be different.  Starting to gain experience, the illustrator can receive a symbolic income.  Having become popular, the same specialist will be able to earn 50, 60, 100 or more than thousand rubles. </p><h2>  How much do animators pay? </h2><p>  First of all, a few words about this work.  The animator works in the film industry.  It is he who is responsible for creating the characters of animated films. </p><p>  In fact, the whole process comes down to creating a large number of frames with little movement of parts.  Thanks to their quick change, an illusion of movement is created.  In the same field, animators work, which make the characters move in the frame.  However, the <span>profession of the animator</span> involves a wider range of responsibilities. </p><p>  The amount of income for such artists depends on qualifications, experience, etc. A novice specialist and a professional can count on completely different amounts.  How much do cartoon artists earn?  If you believe the statistics, on average in Russia 40-75 thousand rubles are paid to such specialists.  Approximately the same answer can be given to the question of how much animation artists earn.  If you are lucky to find a generous employer, you can earn 100 thousand rubles or more.  Agree, this prospect is very tempting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="entdecken-sie-algarve.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much artists earn in Russia" class="if uuid-2679351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2679351.jpg"></div><p>  Having reached a certain ceiling in their income, these specialists can master related specialties or grow to higher posts.  For example, from an ordinary artist you can turn into a project manager, and later even become a director or open your own studio. </p><p>  The profession of the artist has a creative component, therefore, attracts people with the appropriate talent.  With a serious approach, the master will be able to earn a decent living doing what he loves.  After all, the entrance to the profession is open even to those who have not received a special education. </p>
