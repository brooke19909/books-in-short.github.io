Another thing is that the choice of a specific model is not simple and requires certain knowledge about the intricacies of this device.  Different models differ not only in size, functionality and power.  Increasingly, the separation takes place according to the fundamental principles of the organization of the work process.  One of the newest and most effective concepts in this direction is the Panasonic inverter furnace, which is also available in several versions.  In particular, the latest generation of the Japanese manufacturer offers a steam humidification system.  The inverter control principle is also somewhat innovative - it is worth starting the consideration of these microwaves with it. </p><h2>  Features of inverter furnaces </h2>

    <p>  In terms of structural design, this difference is expressed in the departure from classical transformers.  They were replaced by magnetrons, which perform the function of converting direct current to alternating current.  Inverter-type models announced themselves quite loudly, which was greatly facilitated by advertising.  However, many potential users are still distrustful of this innovation.  In fact, inverter microwave ovens have long proved their superiority over conventional microwave ovens.  First of all, they give an advantage in the form of providing a better-prepared product.  Not only taste qualities are preserved, which is very subjectively evaluated, but also the structure of food.  This is especially noticeable on the example of warming dairy products.  In addition, magnetron systems consume less power.  This may seem strange, because transformers do not work in constant mode, unlike inverter systems.  But the difference in resource consumption is achieved due to the fact that magnetrons in the process of operation vary power indicators in favor of energy conservation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is the difference between a steam inverter furnace? </h2>

    <p>  If inverter ovens on the market there are quite a large number of different manufacturers, then steam models are rare.  And the Panasonic company is almost the only one who has tightly mastered this function.  Among the analogues in quality, one can name only the modification from Virpul, which will still be considered.  Its peculiarity lies in the possibility of moistening food during heating.  This task is realized through an integrated steam humidifier.  This is a container that the user must initially fill with water, and a ceramic diffuser.  Due to the steam action, the inverter oven does not allow to dry the products not only during normal heating, but also during defrosting.  But it is important to consider the lack of such models.  So, if the aforementioned magnetron, in contrast to the transformer, occupies very little space in the microwave design, then the steam-humidifying infrastructure nevertheless significantly increases the dimensions of the device. </p><h2>  Panasonic NN-DS592 Model </h2>

    <p>  This is the older and more functional version of the combination microwave, which has both pros and cons.  The user of this version is given a choice of 6 cooking methods.  Among them, it is worth highlighting the effect on the product with microwaves, steam, grilling, convention and various combinations of these cooking formats.  As for the temperature range, the convention makes it possible to heat from 100 to 300 ¬∞ C.  However, if you need a powerful inverter furnace, then this option may not work.  Its power potential is 1000 watts, which is the average for modern microwaves.  At the same time, the volume will suit many housewives, since the camera holds up to 27 liters. </p><h2>  Whirlpool JT379 Model </h2>

    <p>  Competitive version of a steam inverter microwave device.  But it should be noted right away that the grill function is not provided for in this model, and the steam effect is realized as an auxiliary feature and it is given less importance than in Japanese counterparts.  On the other hand, a Whirlpool inverter furnace with a steam humidifier can be of interest to a technologically advanced control system.  The user is not required to accurately calculate the cooking time.  The unique development of Virpul engineers automatically monitors the level of readiness, timely changes the heating parameters and stops it at the moment of optimal food condition.  The power of the device also does not differ in high potential - 1000 W, but again the camera volume is impressive, amounting to 31 liters. </p><h2>  Positive feedback on inverter steam microwaves </h2><p>  The advantages of inverter furnaces with steam exposure are unique.  This is the case when a high quality of cooking does not contradict the interests of economy.  According to users, the food in these models cooks quickly and at the same time retains its shape.  For example, milk does not spill, cereals do not spill on a plate, and fruits get optimal internal warming.  The owners also point out that an inverter microwave requires exactly as much energy as is needed for a specific function.  Moreover, this is achieved in various ways.  So, ‚ÄúPanasonic‚Äù initially optimizes the regulatory function of inverter converters, and ‚ÄúVirpul‚Äù company rationally consumes energy thanks to a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù heating control system during operation.  In many ways, balanced processing by thermal radiation also allows you to preserve the nutritional properties of products without destroying their structure. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Such a technique also has quite expected shortcomings.  The main one is cost.  Inverter type models with steam humidification function can be purchased at a price of 17 to 25 thousand rubles.  average.  This aspect scares the consumer the most.  But the owners already have claims to the operational features of such equipment.  In particular, large sizes are noted.  Even in the initial segment, an inverter furnace with a steam humidifier can exceed the dimensions of high-power traditional analogues.  The most offensive is that from the increase in the size of the useful space for cooking is not added.  It is reserved specifically for the integration of steam humidification devices. </p><h2>  How to choose the best model? </h2><p>  If the choice has already fallen on the inverter steam oven, then it will be useful to look at other parameters.  Pay attention, for example, to a method of directly controlling the functions of the device - through mechanical elements, a remote control or a touch panel.  Also, an inverter <span>microwave is</span> selected according to power.  It has already been said that models of this type rarely indulge in high potential, but it is compensated by a balanced heating system.  Therefore, power above 1000 watts for a small family may not be required.  It is worth considering the sets of additional devices and auxiliary accessories for the device, which often go already in the basic configuration. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  The entry of new technologies into the everyday life of an ordinary consumer is often accompanied by many flaws and shortcomings.  This also applies to microwaves, which get rid of aging and ineffective functions every year.  This trend is confirmed by the Panasonic inverter furnace, supplemented by a steam humidification system.  It is possible that two relatively new concepts implemented in this technique will subsequently create a whole direction in the segment of kitchen appliances.  But while the users themselves are only getting used to the proposed innovations, which, undoubtedly, have qualitatively increased the level of microwave ovens. </p>
