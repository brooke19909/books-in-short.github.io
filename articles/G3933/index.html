Russian travelers in recent years have become real experts in the field of tourism.  Turkey is a particularly popular destination. Our compatriots managed to visit almost all resorts in this country.  Many of the tourists are familiar with most of the hotel complexes worthy of the attention of vacationers.  However, from time to time, Turkey pleases Russians with the advent of new hotels that are ready to compete with recognized chain hotels.  If you crave something new, but do not want to sacrifice your usual comfort, then you should go to the Lara Family Club in Antalya.  This complex was opened not so long ago, but has already received a large number of positive reviews from guests.  Therefore, today we decided to tell you as much as possible about Lara Family Club 4 * so that in the next holiday season you do not even have doubts about which hotel to choose for your vacation. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Complex Overview </h2><p>  Lara Family Club attracts tourists with its novelty.  It was built just four years ago and continues to actively develop, given the shortcomings of past years.  Some of our compatriots, who were relaxing at the hotel immediately after its opening and who came here again a couple of years later, write that the service in Lara Family Club has changed for the better, and the territory has changed thanks to the grown trees and shrubs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel complex is positioning itself as a hotel designed for families.  Therefore, there are always a lot of kids for whom absolutely all conditions are created.  The main contingent of Lara Family Club 4 * are Europeans.  Russians are no more than fifteen percent, but every year the hotel is becoming more and more popular among our compatriots. </p><p>  Guests of the complex admit that its territory is not too large.  It has swimming pools and several playgrounds.  And although shrubs and flowers create a special atmosphere of the resort area, vacationers actually have nowhere to go for a walk.  However, there is another hotel nearby - <span>Ramada Resort Lara, the</span> territory of which guests of Lara Family Club can visit absolutely free. </p><p>  The hotel complex consists of four nine-story residential buildings located close to each other.  The rooms offer views of the sea, the pool and the neighboring hotel.  Guests can be accommodated in any of three hundred and forty-eight rooms of three categories. </p><p>  The catalogs often indicate that the hotel has five stars and is located on the second coastline.  But in reality, the Lara Family Club is a good "four", which is located about three hundred meters from the sandy beach.  To get on it you must cross a busy road.  Do not forget about this fact when planning a trip with children. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Many tourists believe that Lara Family Club has a very convenient location.  Those travelers who are not afraid to explore the resort areas on their own highly appreciate the opportunity to visit shopping centers and markets without leaving far from the hotel complex. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Almost a hundred meters from the hotel are famous shopping centers where you can buy branded items, and shops, in which tourists are offered a very wide range of goods. </p><p>  If you want to stroll around the center of Antalya, then you will need to travel by taxi only nineteen kilometers.  The same distance separates vacationers from the airport.  This greatly facilitates the transfer after arriving in Turkey.  Lara Family Club, by the way, provides its guests with an individual transfer for an additional fee. </p>

    <h2>  Beach area </h2><p>  Beach Lara Family Club is not satisfactory.  Almost all guests who come on vacation like it to enjoy the gentle sun and sea waves.  The beach area stretches for one hundred and fifty meters, while most of it consists of sand.  Only when entering the water comes small pebbles, which, however, does not interfere with bathers. </p><p>  Please note that a free shuttle service runs from the hotel to the sea.  The interval of motion is approximately fifteen minutes.  The beach area is well equipped, guests get access to sun loungers, umbrellas and have the opportunity to get towels at the entrance to the beach. </p><p>  If you do not like to relax in a crowd of tourists, then rent an individual gazebo.  For thirty-five euros a day you will have a refrigerator with soft drinks, including alcoholic drinks, as well as your own waiter.  Rest in such conditions is much more comfortable and enjoyable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  In a hotel </h2><p>  Lara Family Club (Antalya) is considered one of the best hotel complexes on the coast, so guests are pleased with its developed infrastructure.  The hotel has one large pool and two water parks.  One of them is designed for children, and the other is equipped with four slides and is ideal for adults and teenagers.  The relaxation area around the pool is very extensive; towels can be obtained by cards at the spa. </p><p>  The hotel has one main restaurant and five a la carte establishments.  Also for guests in the morning several bars and cafes are open. </p><p>  Guests note that the hotel has a fairly roomy business center.

Both are well equipped and are suitable even for very serious events. </p><p>  Reception is open 24 hours a day.  Here you can always meet employees who speak Russian well.  In addition, the staff speaks Arabic, English and German.  This greatly facilitates understanding between hotel guests and staff. </p><p>  Luggage storage, safety deposit box and car rental are available at the reception.  The latter service is not very popular with Russian tourists, but for those who prefer free movement, free parking is prepared. </p><p>  The guests are also enthusiastic about the beauty salon.  Professionals who work here are ready to do everything so that the guests are satisfied and come here one more time. </p><p>  The hotel has several shops, but mostly they sell basic necessities and souvenirs.  If you are set for more serious shopping, then go to Antalya or the village of Kundu, where the hotel stands. </p><p>  Some guests enjoy visiting the Internet club, which opens its doors at ten in the morning. </p><h2>  Service level </h2><p>  On this topic, guests do not get tired of writing reviews.  Almost always, they mention the level of service and the quality of the services provided.  From the comments you can make an opinion that the Lara Family Club hotel is fully consistent with its stardom and meets the expectations of guests.  However, often guests say that the hotel is no different, but gives the necessary level of comfort. </p><p>  Wi-Fi is excellent throughout.  The signal is strong and stable, so vacationers can freely communicate with their loved ones from anywhere in the hotel and work remotely if you need it. </p><p>  Laundry, dry cleaning and ironing facilities are available.  At your request, the maids will pick up dirty clothes, which will be brought in full order in a day and delivered to your room. </p><p>  Room service is available around the clock.  For vacationers, they will deliver food, products or purchases from the store to the apartments.  However, please note that this service is paid and will be included in a separate room bill when leaving the hotel. </p><p>  If you do not want to purchase excursions from a guide from a travel agency, then try to choose them at the hotel tour desk.  According to guest reviews, very friendly people work here who are always ready to suggest the most interesting tour. </p>

    <h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  According to the rules of the hotel, check-in at the apartments is only from two in the afternoon.  However, guests in the comments write that they were easily accommodated in the room at any time of the day or night.  The hitch could occur only when the room was not yet available and cleaned.  Then the tourists were politely asked to wait and were given the opportunity to check in to enjoy all the benefits of life in the hotel complex. </p><p>  Departure is carried out until twelve in the afternoon.  If necessary, guests can arrange a service such as late check-out.  It is very convenient if your flight is scheduled for evening or night time. </p><p>  Keep in mind that you will not be accommodated in the room with pets.  Recently it has become popular to come on holiday with your four-legged pets, but this is not welcome at the hotel. </p><h2>  Accommodation with children </h2><p>  In the hotel complex children are welcomed with great pleasure.  Parents with children of any age come here.  If your baby is not even two years old, then the hotel staff will install a cot in the room.  Accommodation of the child in this case will be free.  Children under twelve years of age, placed in standard beds, will also live at no extra charge. </p><p>  But adults and older children who need an extra bed should pay about seventy-five euros per day. </p><p>  Tourists need to know that no more than one bed can be installed in a room.  At the same time, this need must be agreed upon in advance when booking a hotel complex. </p>

    <h2>  What to do with the child? </h2><p>  Little guests at the hotel are not bored, they have excellent conditions and spend their day with maximum benefit.  Children under the age of twelve enjoy splashing around in a water park for toddlers.  For those who have already outgrown small slides, an adult water park is suitable, where the child will be allowed only under the supervision of adults. </p><p>  The hotel has several playgrounds.  Some of them are located in the open air, while others are hidden from the scorching sun by an awning. </p><p>  If your child is calmly left without you, then you can take him to a kids club.  Good animators work there, which occupy little guests for the whole day.  Games, master classes and competitions have been prepared for them.  Usually, in reviews of Lara Family Club, parents kindly recall the time spent by their child in this club. </p><p>  In the restaurant for kids, you can choose dishes from the children's menu.  The list is quite wide, so parents will not have problems with feeding the crumbs.  Comfortable chairs are provided for the little ones. </p>

    <h2>  Brief description of the number of rooms </h2><p>  The hotel complex is ready to provide tourists with three types of apartments: </p><ul><li>  Double standard.  The room is thirty square meters can accommodate two people.  When booking an apartment, be sure to indicate the number of beds, the standard can be set to one large bed or two single beds. </li><li>  Improved number.  Two people can come here, on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãthirty-five squares they will be quite comfortable. </li><li>  Family Suite.  The room has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãeighty squares and accommodates up to five guests.  The apartments are divided into two bedrooms and a living room.  There are also two bathrooms.  In the living room there is a folding sofa, which, if desired, can be turned into an extra bed. </li></ul><p>  Judging by the reviews, the rooms are very well equipped.  Each room has a standard set of amenities: cable TV, individual split, safe, mini fridge and so on.  All apartments have a balcony.  It has light furniture and a dryer. </p><p>  In general, guests are very pleased with the number of rooms, but sometimes complaints arise regarding the quality of cleaning.  Some guests complain that in their building it was carried out nominally and the maids did not even wash the floors in the rooms.  But in other residential blocks, the situation was radically different, so we can assume that the matter is in specific hotel employees, and not in the work organization system. </p><p>  Also, many consider it a drawback that smoking rooms are not available at Lara Family Club.  However, smoking on site is possible, but only in strictly designated areas. </p><h2>  Tours at Lara Family Club </h2><p>  Our compatriots claim that the cost of a ticket to this hotel is quite high even in the fall season.  Many attribute this fact to the fact that the hotel complex is considered new and is of great interest to travelers.  On average, a two-week tour for two people will cost one hundred and sixty thousand rubles.  The price includes air travel, accommodation in the standard and all-inclusive meals. </p><p>  If you are ready to give such money for a vacation in a four-star new hotel, then feel free to get a ticket.  Here you will definitely like it, and you will definitely want to come back here one more time. </p>
