    <h2>  Description of the water body </h2><p>  Among the dense forests, away from the main roads, in the very center of the vast basin of the Ruzsky district of the Moscow region, is located the Deep Lake.  This is a small secluded water body, mostly surrounded by forest.  A <span>dirt road</span> leads here from Novogorbovo village <span>,</span> leading directly to the shore and wooden structures of the MSU biostation.  Glubokoe Lake (Ruzsky District) is interesting for its unique purity of water, due to this a huge number of microscopic crustaceans live here, in addition, there are many different fish.  The depth of this water body reaches 32 meters, although its area is relatively small: only 1.2 km in length and 0.8 km in width.  Another interesting fact associated with the lake is that the repeatedly tagged fish from it was found in the neighboring lake Trostnensky, near the village of Onufrievo, about ten kilometers.  Apparently, these two objects have underground communication. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deep lake photo" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/448086.jpg" width="600"></div>

From the west it adjoins a swamp covered with moss carpet and covered with small willow and birch.  Cranberries grow in abundance on mossy bumps.  The shore on this side is hanging, formed by rafts.  The south side of the reservoir is bordered by a huge swamp.  In the spring, meltwater overflows it.  They, flowing into the lake, give the water a brown tint, but over time it disappears.  The northern part has a gulf with a flat bottom.  The depth here is only five meters, for fishermen this is of most interest.  From the bay originates the rivulet Malaya Istra, it is almost completely overgrown with dense reed.  On the northwest coast is a large hill.  Locals nicknamed it "the island." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deep lake Moscow region" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/446710.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <h2>  Riddle of occurrence </h2><p>  Deep Lake (Moscow Region) is a rather unusual water body.  There are several theories about its origin.  Most often, glacial, karst and meteorite versions sound.  The literature indicates the glacial origin of the reservoir: melting waters filled the deep trough of the Smolensk-Moscow Upland and gave rise to its existence.  However, some facts are not linked to this theory.  For example, all glacial lakes have the property of aging.  This occurs in connection with silty sediments, the onset of peat bogs.  However, here all these factors are powerless, and the secret of the lake has not yet been disclosed.  The meteorite theory seems more likely, but there is also no evidence in its favor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Glubokoe Lake (Ruzsky District): fishing <strong> </strong></h2><p>  Even in the summer heat at great depths, the temperature of the water in the pond does not exceed six degrees Celsius.  As a result, in the warmer months, the fish prefers to stay on the coastal zone.  That is why the wide bay on the north side of the lake, with a depth of five meters, is the place of spawning and feeding of many species of fish.  In addition, the presence of reed on the shores of the bay attracts young growth here.  And predators come after him.  The deep lake and the bay are separated by an underwater edge.  You can detect it by fishing in a plumb bob using a heavy lure.  The fish here prefers to stay underwater slopes, which are located at a distance of 18-20 meters from the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deep ruzsky lake fishing area" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/446713.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  The bottom of the lake is dense, there is very little vegetation.  Due to the protection of the coast and the terrain, the winds here do not create large accelerating waves, and the surf does not force the fish to leave the coastal zone.  Boats are allowed only official, in the summer period fishing from <span>rubber boats</span> and rafts is allowed.  Here is a deep lake! </p><p>  Fishing here attracts with its diversity.  You can put perch and pike into mugs, or roach and bream in a feeding place.  In calm, calm weather, from a boat without anchoring using the alloy method, you can pleasurely put a plumb bob into a mormyshka or spinner.  Tackle is best used for deep sea fishing.  In addition, shore fishing for a long float fishing rod or bottom tackle worked well. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Access to this <span>water body</span> is possible at the beginning of a snowy winter and in dry periods along several routes.  The first is from the city of Zvenigorod, bypassing the villages of Shikhovo and Rybushkino, Kariyskoye and Faustovo, as well as Andreevskoye.  This path will be about thirty kilometers.  The second - by bus from the city of Zvenigorod to the village of Gerasimovo, and then about six kilometers on foot.  Another way is possible - past Tuchkovo and Kulyubakino, through the village of Novo-Gorbovo and then about five kilometers along a dirt road. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deep fishing lake" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/448088.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  And what else is this object interesting for? </h2><p>  The deep lake of the Moscow region is a favorite place of pilgrimage for tourists and a good vacation for lovers of hiking for berries and mushrooms.  In addition, it is believed that the water of this reservoir has miraculous, healing properties.  As a result, many people come here to rest and improve their health, sacredly believing in the power of a relict lake.  Pilgrims stop directly on the shore, pitching tents, or rent an apartment in neighboring villages - all in order to swim in the lake and recharge with the energy of its healing waters. </p><p>  In addition, collecting minerals has become a new entertainment, and there is something to collect.  There are a lot of <span>samples</span> , a <span>melting glacier</span> brought them here <span>.</span>  Now they are lying in bulk in open areas of land, and sometimes covered with a layer of turf.  They are interesting in that they are the same age as the reservoir and serve as geological greetings from the distant past of our planet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deep ruzsky lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/446716.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Science station </h2><p>  The deep lake is of great interest to science.  Back in 1891, a hydrobiological station was established here, which monitors the reservoir.  According to the results of more than a century of study, scientists have come to the following conclusions. </p><ol><li>  Currently, this lake due to anthropogenic interference is a reservoir filled with clean water.  It is surrounded by relict forest, untouched even during the Second World War. </li><li>  Despite the fact that the morphometric parameters of the object are determined, the accuracy of these calculations is insufficient to compile the characteristics of the processes that occur in this aquatic biogeocenosis.  So the question of significant changes in morphometric parameters remains open. </li><li>  The following hydrochemical properties of the lake were determined: regardless of the ratio of ground and surface waters, as well as the amount of precipitation, the water here is always low mineralized;  during the dry seasons, it is bicarbonate-magnesium, and in the period of wet seasons it is bicarbonate-calcium.  This phenomenon is due to special biological production and destruction processes in the reservoir. </li></ol>
