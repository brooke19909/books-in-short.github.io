  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VPN on Android: a review of the best applications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>VPN (Virtual Private Network,</span> which means ‚Äúvirtual private network‚Äù) is a tool that is truly free from Internet tracking.  Such software is a kind of intermediary between the user and the end resource.  That is, a VPN (for Android as well) allows you to access the World Wide Web without revealing your real IP address.  A similar technology is used to access sites blocked by regulatory authorities.  In addition, VPNs for Android are very often used to protect user data from being intercepted in public Wi-Fi networks. </p><p>  There is a lot of similar software in the vastness of the World Wide Web.  And if experienced users have long found the right tool for anonymous surfing, then newcomers are experiencing serious problems with this. </p><p>  We‚Äôll try to understand this issue and designate the best VPNs for Android, where each application is distinguished by its quality component, efficient operation, as well as availability and a large number of flattering responses from consumers.  All the software described below can be found on the official resources of the developers, so there should be no problems with testing. </p><p>  The list of the best VPNs for Android is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Opera VPN. </li><li>  Hola VPN. </li><li>  Turbo VPN. </li><li>  VPN Master. </li></ol><p>  Consider each product in more detail. </p><h2>  Opera VPN </h2><p>  This VPN for Android is the brainchild of a famous developer of Opera Software, who presented us with the browser of the same name.  The application meets the user with a friendly, fairly quick and nice interface, which even a beginner will understand with this matter.  In addition, this VPN for Android is in Russian, which significantly facilitates the entry threshold. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpolice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best vpn for android" class="if uuid-2872645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2872645.jpg"></div><p>  Connection to the anonymous network takes place in one click, which is symbolized by the local talisman in the person of the Scandinavian warrior.  By default, access to the network is provided through the nearest virtual server.  But the general list of regions is quite impressive for a free product: USA, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, as well as a VPN for China. </p><p>  On the android gadget, you can configure the security of the Wi-Fi connection.  A whole section is devoted to this.  The program is automatically activated as soon as you enter the public network, which prevents traffic interception. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bgr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vpn for china on android" class="if uuid-2872642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2872642.jpg"></div><p>  One of the notable features of this VPN for Android is the blocking of ad trackers.  The latter collect user data for a more relevant display of commercial units.  This is a rather voracious traffic procedure, and not everyone likes such surveillance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the data transfer rate, the program showed its best side.  There were no serious hangs or lags during operation.  Judging by the reviews, users are calmly watching videos in the 1080 p. </p><h2>  Distribution Terms </h2><p>  The product is distributed free of charge, there are no restrictions on the volume of traffic, as it happens with other applications.  As such, paid tariffs are simply not provided.  Although ad units are present, they cannot be called aggressive. </p><h2>  Hola VPN </h2><p>  "Hola" is one of the most common virtual networks.  In addition to a separate application for the Android platform, the developer offers similar solutions for the Windows operating system and various browsers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chrome.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vpn for android in Russian" class="if uuid-2872643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2872643.jpg"></div><p>  The program interface has the so-called flat style and, unlike other VPN products, a separate private network is opened for each application here.  Other software on the mobile gadget continues to work with the Internet on your IP, that is, directly. </p><p>  But there is a more classic solution - a proprietary browser.  It is also included with the product.  With it, you can visit sites with a specified location.  The list of regions is very impressive: USA, Germany, Italy, Estonia, Angola and other countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.malavida.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="virtual network for android" class="if uuid-2872647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2872647.jpg"></div><p>  The application was originally developed as a tool for working anonymously with hulu, Netflix, Pandora and Spotify services.  With the latter, the minimum ping delay is fixed, and the video in the 1080 p scan is broadcast without any lags. </p><p>  Other services also work well together with "Hola".  You can count on stable video display in a resolution of 720 r, provided that the provider itself does not create interference.  The program interface is simple, understandable, and even the lack of Russian-language localization does not prevent newcomers from mastering it. </p><h2>  Distribution Terms </h2><p>  The product has a free distribution license, but advanced users are better off looking at a paid subscription.  It allows you to use multiple browsers at the same time and significantly expands the geo-targeting of the virtual network.  There is no advertising both in the first and in the second case, which cannot but rejoice. </p><h2>  Turbo VPN </h2><p>  Turbo VPN for Android is another popular and well-established virtual network for anonymous surfing.  The application provides full access to a secure channel without regard to the volume of traffic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.greenbot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="turbo vpn for android" class="if uuid-2872646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2872646.jpg"></div><p>  The application interface is simple and straightforward.  Actually, apart from providing a VPN protocol, there is nothing here.  The list of regions is quite diverse for a free product: USA, Germany, Great Britain, France, India and Singapore.  From time to time, the developer opens access to other countries. </p><p>  There were no serious delays when working with Turbo VPN for Android for users, especially if you select European countries as a virtual server.  Movies in a 1080p scan are viewed without delay and are uploaded to the clipboard in a timely manner. </p><h2>  Distribution Terms </h2><p>  The product is distributed free of charge, some paid tariffs are not provided by the developer.  The application did a great job, but, as is often the case with such a license, it is burdened with advertising, and very aggressive.  The latter can pop up on the whole screen and linger for a long time. </p><h2>  VPN Master </h2><p>  The VPN Master application for Android is designed to circumvent any restrictions on the World Wide Web.  The product has an impressive amount of useful (and not so) options to facilitate the work with the Internet.  The program reliably encrypts user data and provides access to any resources using its own virtual network. </p><p>  VPN Master for Android has a user-friendly interface; even a novice can easily deal with a product.  In addition, the program is fully and competently translated into Russian.  Yes, and reference materials in abundance in the menu. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.info24android.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vpn master for android" class="if uuid-2872644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2872644.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that the program has its own tool for diagnosing networks.  One will show the optimal response in a particular region, which greatly simplifies the task of finding the perfect option for anonymous surfing. </p><p>  As for the countries, practically all of Europe, Asia and the USA with Canada are represented here.  So there is plenty to choose from.  The application (if desired) intelligently integrates into the notification panel and in local browsers, reliably protecting user data from being intercepted by third parties. </p><p>  The speed of connection and transmission of traffic is also respectable.  Users note the smooth playback of video in a resolution of 1080 p.  If you select remote regions, then ping increases markedly, and you have to reset the quality to 720 p. </p><h2>  Distribution Terms </h2><p>  The product is distributed both under a paid and under a free license.  The first allows you to select specific regions and can connect to any application that goes online.  In the free version you can not choose a virtual server, you will be thrown to any free one.  In addition, there is a lot of advertising, and very aggressive. </p>
