    <h2>  City population </h2><p>  In 2014, the population of Syzran was 176,000 people, while in 2002 this figure was much higher - 188,000. True, this year, according to statistics, there was some increase in the population, although this is most likely due to for emigration to Syzran.  The Samara region has on its territory many less prosperous settlements, which leads to the fact that some people move to Syzran.  And local residents, especially young people, in turn, are leaving for <span>big cities</span> in the hope of better arranging their life. </p><p>  The average age of residents in the city is 40 years.  This suggests that the population is aging and, probably, in a few decades, young people will practically not remain here.  As for the peculiarities of the worldview of the inhabitants of this city, the influence of the traditions of the philistine lifestyle that reigned here several centuries ago is still felt in it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  In 1863, the city of Syzran was founded.  It is difficult to say what <span>area it</span> was in those days, because that administrative division was significantly different from the modern one.  However, it is known that the settlement owes its appearance to Prince G.A. Kozlovsky, who founded the fortress here, although this village received the status of the city much later - in 1796.  From the moment of its foundation, the fortification served as an outpost for the protection of caravans moving from West to East and back.  Soon, however, the main function of Syzran was trade, not defense.  In 1780, by decree of Catherine II, the city was assigned a coat of arms depicting a black bull in a gold field.  Syzran was awarded this honor thanks to great success in the trade in livestock and bread. </p>

    <p>  Over the period of its existence, the city survived two large fires - in 1795 and in 1906.  The first time the settlement burned to the ground, the fire did not reach only the river settlements.  The second time managed to save only 954 buildings.  After this fire, the city authorities adopted a decree prohibiting the construction of wooden structures on the main street of Syzran. </p><h2>  Transport connection </h2><p>  At a fairly high level is the transport connection of the city of Syzran.  What area is this, many do not know, and because of such a developed transport connection, they believe that it is an independent city.  The railway passes through the territory of the settlement in six directions and connects the city with all the CIS countries.  It is worth noting that the local train station can be easily confused with the capital, so it is at a high level.  It was built about 150 years ago and has recently been restored.  Inside the station, in addition to everything necessary for travelers, there is also a small museum that displays photographs, genuine items and other elements of the ancient interior.  In front of the main entrance of the station, you can see two statues - a girl and a young man showing her the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In addition, a federal highway passes through the city, which ensures a good bus connection with various cities of Russia.  The Volga River Route also crosses the city. </p><h2>  Syzran Economy </h2><p>  One of the main industrial centers - this is how you can characterize the city of Syzran.  What area is this, probably, all the directors of large companies in Russia know.  Indeed, such industrial enterprises operate here as the <span>Syzran Oil Refinery, Syzranskaya</span> TPP, Tyazhmash OJSC, RosLada LLC, Plastic Plant, Syzranselmash Plant, etc. </p><p>  In Syzran, such industries as energy, woodworking, chemical, food, petrochemical and light industries are well developed.  Small business, construction, trade, and engineering also flourish. </p><h2>  Climate and ecology </h2><p>  In order to understand what climate prevails in the territory of the city of Syzran, which region is enough to know.  The fact is that the local weather conditions do not differ from other settlements located in the temperate continental part of the middle Volga region.  Residents of the city have the opportunity to enjoy all four seasons.  Summer is warm and winter is cold.  Although there were more exotic cases - once the city was covered with June snow, and somehow it was bathed in the February flood. </p>

    <p>  As for the environmental situation in the city, it is not the most prosperous here, because many industrial enterprises have the city of Syzran on its territory.  Which region is not important, however, the fact that the city is regularly included in the list of the most polluted settlements in Russia is of great importance for local residents.  The work of numerous enterprises causes great harm to the country's important artery - the Volga.  About 50,000 tons of various pollutants are thrown into the atmosphere of the city every year. </p><h2>  Education in Syzran </h2><p>  Syzran education system is famous for its rich traditions, which were founded back in the zemstvo period.  There is a gymnasium in the city, the building of which was erected in 1914.  In those days, it was the first female gymnasium in the city of Syzran.  What area is of interest to those who have heard of the local higher military aviation school of pilots, because this educational institution is the only one in the country that trains pilots for military aviation helicopters. </p><p>  One of the youngest educational institutions in Syzran is the College of Arts and Culture.  O. N. Nostsova.  It was opened only 43 years ago.  The reason for this was the need for further training of graduates of children's music schools, which at that time were 3 in the city. In addition, these schools needed professional teaching staff.  A lot of effort was made to create this educational institution, partly for the money allocated from the city budget, and partly for the voluntary donations of caring citizens.  And to everyone's joy, on September 1, 1972, the School of Music opened its doors to its first students who wanted to study such specialties as Choral Conducting, Piano, Theory of Music, and Folk Instruments.  Over time, the list expanded, and the theoretical and practical bases of the institution became richer.  Today, many graduates of music schools are interested in what area Syzran is located just to study in the local college. </p>
