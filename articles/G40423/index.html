    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Moremar 3 * has every right to be proud of its location.  So, from the center of Lloret de Mar it is only 800 meters away.  Therefore, all the entertainment of the largest resort town of the Spanish region of the Costa Brava is within walking distance for hotel guests.  In addition, the hotel complex "Moremar" is located in the commercial quarter of the city.  Therefore, it is surrounded by a wide variety of shops and souvenir shops, as well as restaurants and bars.  As for airfields, the nearest airborne harbor is in the city of Girona.  It is only thirty kilometers from Lloret de Mar.  Thus, after landing, you can reach the hotel in just 30-40 minutes.  The hotel is also accessible from <span>Barcelona Airport.</span>  The length of this path is 90 kilometers, and it will take you a little more than two hours to get there.  One of the most important factors for all tourists going on vacation to the <span>coastal countries</span> is the proximity of the hotel in which they plan to stay to the seashore.  As for the Moremar 3 * hotel (Spain), it does not have its own beach.  However, the nearest municipal beach, equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable and varied vacation, is only 80 meters from the hotel.  Thus, guests of the hotel, leaving their room, in a few minutes can plunge into the clear azure waters of the Mediterranean Sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Moremar 3 * (Lloret-de-Mar): photo and description </h2><p>  This hotel was built almost forty years ago, in 1976.  Since then, repair work has been carried out here several times.  The last large-scale reconstruction was carried out in 2009.  Today, this hotel complex consists of three three-story buildings, consisting of 76 comfortable rooms.  There are also apartments specially equipped for disabled guests.  The hotel has a well-kept clean area with a garden, an outdoor pool, a sun terrace, a restaurant and a bar.  In general, we can say that Moremar 3 * (Spain) is ideal for young people who come on vacation in search of a vibrant fun pastime and vivid impressions, but at the same time wish to stay in a budget hotel.  However, it will be quite comfortable here for families with children who come here for a beach holiday and sightseeing. </p><h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  Hotel Moremar 3 * (Costa Brava, Spain), like most hotels around the world, has a so-called <span>checkout time.</span>  So, the arrival of tourists in the rooms booked by them category is carried out after one in the afternoon.  However, the presence of such a rule does not mean at all that if you arrived at the hotel early in the morning, you will be forced to wait 13:00.  If the hotel has free and prepared for arrival rooms, you will be settled immediately.  If the previous guests have not yet moved out, and the maids have not had time to clean the rooms (most often this happens at the height of the tourist season), then you will be asked to leave things in the luggage room and relax by the pool, eat in a restaurant, go for a walk in the vicinity or straight to the beach.  As for the day of departure, the occupied room should be vacated before 11 a.m.  At the same time, it is necessary to hand over the room keys at the reception and pay for the entire period of stay at Moremar 3 *.  Here it is possible to pay both in cash and with a plastic card "Visa", "Mastercard", "American Express" and some other popular payment systems. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel moremar 3" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/524093.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Accommodation with children </h2><p>  The Moremar 3 * hotel complex (Lloret de Mar) is always happy for travelers arriving on vacation with families, with children of any age.  In addition, when placing a baby up to two years old in your room, you don‚Äôt have to pay anything for the extra crib provided.  If one or two children aged 2 to 12 years live in your room and they need a separate bed, you will have to pay extra for each 50% of the cost of living an adult.  For older children or adults sleeping in extra beds, you will have to pay 75% of the cost of living one guest per day.  Please note that each room at the hotel can accommodate as much as one free bed for a baby up to two years and two extra beds.  In addition, keep in mind that the need for such a service should be informed in advance to the Moremar 3 * administration (Costa Brava).  And be sure to wait for confirmation on her part. </p><h2>  Pets travelers </h2><p>  This item will be very important for you if you are used to going on vacation in the company of your four-legged pet.  Unfortunately, the rules of the Spanish Hotel Moremar (Lloret de Mar) prohibit these guests from staying on site.  Therefore, you will either have to find another hotel from the Pets Friendly category for accommodation, or leave your pet at home for the duration of the trip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Moremar 3 *: traveler reviews from Russia </h2><p>  Since it is very important for the vast majority of tourists when choosing a hotel to find out the opinions of people who have already stayed in it, we give generalized comments from our compatriots who spent their holidays in Moremar (Spain, Costa Brava).  I want to say right away that basically all the reviews are positive, which indicates the good quality of both the hotel complex and the service of travelers, and the compliance with the stated number of stars and price.  But we offer to understand the details in more detail. </p><p>  First of all, many tourists note the excellent work of the hotel staff.  So, the administrators really speak Russian, therefore, in order to communicate with them, there is absolutely no need to strain and remember the English language.  Also, all hotel employees are always smiling and trying to help tourists.  Those travelers who arrived at the hotel before checkout time, in most cases, were checked into the rooms almost immediately.  Some of our compatriots had to wait for resettlement only in August, when there were no empty seats in the hotel (I had to wait until noon until the previous guests had moved out and the maids would prepare the rooms).  The rooms themselves in Moremar 3 * seemed to travelers, albeit small, but cozy and well-planned.  Furniture and appliances are in good condition.  The hotel guests liked the regularity, as well as the quality of housekeeping. </p><p>  Travelers also had an exceptionally positive experience with the location of the hotel.  So, due to the fact that ‚ÄúMoremar‚Äù is not located in the very center of the city, it is quite quiet and does not hear noise and music from any entertainment venues. </p><p>  As for nutrition, in general, our compatriots were satisfied with it.  However, there have been several complaints about the quality of the omelet for breakfast.  So, some tourists do not even recommend trying it.  Although all the other dishes seemed to the guests quite tasty and edible.  Some tourists were pleasantly surprised that when they were late for dinner, the hotel staff offered them packaged dishes specially for them, which could then be reheated in the microwave and a full dinner. </p>
