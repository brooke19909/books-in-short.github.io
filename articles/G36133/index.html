Especially when it comes to the long-awaited vacation.  This approach will avoid a lot of difficulties and problems that you may encounter during your vacation.  With special attention, experienced travelers are advised to approach the issue of choosing a hotel.  This is especially relevant for those tourists who prefer to relax on an all-inclusive basis.  Indeed, in this case, you will spend most of the time at the hotel, leaving it only for trips on excursions and walks in the vicinity.  So the impressions of the vacation will largely depend on the choice of the hotel.  According to many experienced travelers, a great way to help determine the choice of a hotel is to study the reviews of those who have recently stayed in a particular place.  Indeed, in their comments, former guests try to talk about both the pros and cons that they had to face.  Therefore, you can get a closer to reality idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat will await you at this hotel.  To save your time, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized reviews of Russian tourists who have recently stayed at Sharm Grand Plaza Resort 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt).  Just note that the vast majority of travelers were quite satisfied with their choice and are ready to recommend this hotel to all those who wish to relax on the Red Sea.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sharm grand plaza resort 5 reviews" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1091680.jpg" width="600"></div>

According to them, the apartments here are quite spacious, pleasantly decorated, with not very new, but high-quality and comfortable furniture, properly working appliances.  If something fails, you should immediately inform the reception administrator about it, and the malfunction will be fixed as soon as possible.  By the minuses of accommodation in this hotel, some of our compatriots attributed poor sound insulation in the rooms.  Therefore, if the building where your apartments are located is closer to the main pool and the main restaurant, then be prepared for what you will hear in your room the whole animated evening program.  True, this feature, according to tourists, is characteristic of many hotels in Egypt.  Therefore, if you prefer to go to bed early or arrive on vacation with young children, then ask if possible to put you in buildings away from noise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Sharm Grand Plaza Resort 5" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1091681.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  To the maids of the Sharm Grand Plaza Resort 5 * hotel (Egypt, Sharm El Sheikh), our compatriots generally had no complaints.  So, according to them, the cleaning was carried out quite qualitatively every day.  Towels and bed linen are updated several times a week.  Also, as expenditures, the maids replenished supplies of bath accessories.  In addition, bottled drinking water will be brought to your room every day. </p><h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  As noted by Russian tourists who visited the Sharm Grand Plaza, the arrival of guests who have just arrived here in most cases occurs immediately.  Therefore, even if you arrive at the hotel early in the morning, you will most likely be able to get your room keys just a few minutes later, and you won‚Äôt have to wait for the accommodation for several hours.  If you do not like the proposed apartments with something, then you can ask to immediately relocate you.  With this, according to our compatriots, there are no problems here. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, it is necessary to vacate the occupied room before noon.  If your departure from the hotel is planned only in the evening, then you can extend your stay at an additional cost.  However, most of the guests prefer to hand over the room keys at 12 o‚Äôclock, leave their suitcases and travel bags in the luggage compartment near the reception and continue their rest.  After all, no one will take off your bracelets after the apartment is completed, and you can continue to use the entire infrastructure of the hotel, with the exception of residential premises, until departure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand plaza resort 5 egypt sharm" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1091682.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  According to travelers, the Wi-Fi coverage at Sharm Grand Plaza Resort 5 * leaves much to be desired.  So, use the wireless Internet here you can only near the reception.  But even there, the connection speed will be very low.  However, experienced tourists advise those who want to always be able to keep in touch upon arrival in Egypt to purchase a SIM card of one of the local mobile operators with a prepaid Internet package.  This will allow you to use the Internet on your phone at any time.  Such a SIM card is inexpensive (about fifteen dollars). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel sharm grand plaza resort 5 reviews" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1091683.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Our compatriots found the territory of this hotel quite large.  However, thanks to proper planning, you do not have to spend a lot of time getting from one point to another.  Also, according to tourists, the territory here is very well-groomed, green, beautiful.  Hotel guests enjoy walking and taking pictures here. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In general, judging by the comments left, most of the guests of the Sharm Grand Plaza Resort 5 *, tours to which are popular with our compatriots, were satisfied with the level of organization of food here.  Of course, if you prefer to see delicacies on your table, then you should look for a more expensive hotel.  However, as noted by Russian tourists, this hotel cooks very tasty, and the menu is very diverse.  So, in the main restaurant, functioning in the buffet format, you can taste a variety of soups, meat and poultry dishes, salads, stewed and fresh vegetables, fruits, desserts, pastries.  For breakfast, you will be offered several types of cereals, toast, scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, pancakes and much more. </p><p>  In addition, guests can visit the √† la carte restaurants, which offer them to try seafood dishes, as well as Italian and Oriental dishes. </p><p>  Also during the day, vacationers have the opportunity to eat fast food in the snack bars on site. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sharm grand plaza resort 5 tour" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1091685.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  As our compatriots note in their reviews, the Sharm Grand Plaza Resort <span>5 *</span> hotel <span>(Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt)</span> will not disappoint beach lovers.  So, from residential buildings to the sea, you can walk in about 5-7 minutes at a leisurely pace.  The hotel has its own fairly large sandy and very clean beach.  There is a sufficient number of sun loungers.  So there is no need to get up early in the morning and go ashore to take a sunbed, as is the case in some other hotels, here.  There is also a bar on the beach where you can either order your favorite drink or have a snack if you wish.  As for the sea, you can enter it both from the shore and from the pier.  Not far from the coast is a coral reef inhabited by a mass of amazing creatures.  Therefore, be sure to bring a snorkeling mask with you to enjoy the colorful marine life.  It is also advisable to purchase special shoes so that when entering the water you do not injure your feet on sharp corals and stones. </p>
