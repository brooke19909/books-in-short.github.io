It is located in the confluence of two parts of the mainland - Asia and Europe.  The northern regions of the region border on the Republic of Tatarstan.  The history of Orenburg is very unusual and interesting.  The city has many historical and modern attractions that will be of interest to tourists and guests. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.7666482" data-lng="55.10045379999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="5"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/2/2/8/9228.png"></div><h2>  The history of the foundation of Orenburg </h2><p>  A small city with a population of more than half a million people is located in the Kazakh border, on the Ural River.  The history of the creation of Orenburg is quite unusual.  On the site of the modern city, the first fortifications were built in 1735.  The place for construction was chosen at the confluence of the Ori and Ural rivers.  The choice in this area fell by chance.  The construction of the city was associated with the further development of trade routes to the Bukhara Khanate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="orenburg.go2all.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water park orenburg reviews" class="if uuid-2843468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2843468.jpg"></div><p>  In the future, a new place was chosen, located much lower upstream of the Urals.  However, he soon had to be abandoned, because the terrain was too rocky.  In addition, there were absolutely no forests and water nearby.  They refused to build fortifications without having started it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Admiral Neplyuyev, who was appointed the head of the expedition, chose a new place for laying the city near the Krasnogorsk tract.  Here was once the Berd Fortress.  Talking about the history of Orenburg (photos of the city are given in the article), they often use the expression "conceived three times, but born once."  The phrase is fully true.  They really tried to lay the city three times, and only the last attempt led to the appearance of Orenburg. </p><h2>  Title </h2><p>  The history of the name of the city of Orenburg is very mysterious.  Scientists have not come to a consensus on why the settlement was so named.  There are currently several versions.  One of them says that the name is associated with the Auru River, on the banks of which it was originally planned to build.  As a result, fortifications were erected 300 kilometers from the river. </p><p>  According to another version, the name came up with one of the leaders of the expedition - Ivan Kirilov - even during the development of the strategy of the expedition to Asian countries.  Be that as it may, but the name has been fixed to the city for many centuries.  The order on the foundation of the city and the assignment of a name to it was signed by Anna Ioannovna back in 1735.  And only in 1938 Orenburg was renamed Chkalov.  He wore a new name for almost twenty years.  The city was named after the famous pilot, whose monument can be seen on the embankment of the Uralische River.  Later, the historical name was returned to Orenburg. </p><h2>  Orenburg fortress </h2><p>  The history of the development of Orenburg can be judged by numerous historical attractions.  Among them, a special place is occupied by the Orenburg fortress.  Unfortunately, time did not spare her.  It is almost completely destroyed.  Only fragments have survived to this day.  The fortress was built in the eighteenth century.  Its walls formed a closed circle.  In fact, the city was closed on all sides, except for the area adjacent to the river.  The fortress lost its significance in the nineteenth century and since then began to gradually decline. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.culture.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of the History of Orenburg" class="if uuid-2843469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2843469.jpg"></div><p>  In the historical part of the city to this day survived: </p><ol><li>  Artillery Yard. </li><li>  Val in the region of the ninth Nikolaev bastion. </li><li>  Part of the Water Gate. </li><li>  One of the fortress towers. </li><li>  Military hospital. </li></ol><h2>  Elizabethan Gate </h2><p>  Elizabethan Gate - one of the historical attractions of the city, preserved to this day.
