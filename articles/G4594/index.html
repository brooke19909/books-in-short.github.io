    <p>  It is noteworthy that this kind of breakthrough is partly associated with the number "6" in the name of the model.  ZTE Blade S6, the review of which can be left by each user who has experience with this smartphone, has a pre-installed operating system of the Android family version 5.0.  Just note that this OS is well-designed by engineers.  Some technical aspects that were previously the causes of lags and brakes were excluded from it.  Now it is more optimized, due to which smoothness and stability are achieved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second interesting quality (and even positive) is the Qualcomm processor family.  It is 64-bit, it consists of eight cores.  Perhaps this approach can be called an established trend.  This again can be called the reason due to which the device has high performance and stability.  As it turned out, the device demonstrates an unprecedented nimble even in multitasking mode. </p><p>  Many manufacturers of mobile devices like to introduce phablet devices to the international arena.  However, ZTE decided not to make a "shovel" out of the Blade S6.  With the appropriate parameters, the thickness of the smartphone is only 7.7 mm.  And this suggests that the model remains one of the most compact, but at the same time it has no less powerful and productive hardware than its closest competitors. </p><p>  One of the most noteworthy advantages of the ZTE Blade S6, the price of which is about sixteen thousand rubles, is the presence of the LTE module, which allows you to successfully work in fourth-generation cellular networks.  In general, at first glance, the phone seems to be a fully-fledged model that does not have significant shortcomings for its segment.  And whether it is so or not, we will try to figure it out. </p><h2>  Smartphone ZTE Blade S6.  Overview of features.  Communication </h2><p>  So, in which networks does this device work for us?  Supports work with GSM, UMTS standards.  As mentioned earlier, there is an LTE module.  It will allow the phone owner to quickly load pages in an Internet browser, interact more actively with social networks, faster download movies and video clips, music files. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The same applies to downloading videos and music.  In general, the quality and speed of exchanging data and Internet traffic is increasing.  Access to the international network is provided on the basis of GPS, EDGE, 3G, and, of course, 4G standards.  There is a built-in modem that allows you to use your <span>ZTE</span> Blade S6 mobile <span>phone</span> as an access point. </p>

That is why the ZTE Blade S6 can be safely used as a navigator for a car.  To do this, you only need to take care of the maps in advance, and the problem will be solved. </p><h2>  SIM cards </h2><p>  The device supports the simultaneous operation of two SIM cards.  However, before using them, the devices will need to be processed according to the NanoSIM standard.

Its capacity is about 2400 mAh.  In principle, this is not so little.  Although with the active use of the phone (watching movies, games, <span>surfing the Internet</span> and chatting on social networks), the charge will drain quickly.  That is why we recommend that all buyers of the device purchase an additional external battery that will allow you to charge the phone again several times even in the absence of an electric network. </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  He has the subject of our review today has a standard form factor.  The material of manufacture is nothing more than plastic.  However, it should be noted that it is soft and pleasant to the touch.  No negative emotions with tactile contact does not occur.  A few words need to be said about reliability.  The device does not slip in the hand, and the material of manufacture avoids causing accidental mechanical damage during intensive contact with an aggressive surface.  The mass of the smartphone is 134 grams.  In three-dimensional space, the dimensions of the device are as follows: a height of 144, a width of 70.7, and a thickness of 7.7 mm. </p>

    <h2>  Rest </h2><p>  The manufacturer is a Chinese company ZTE.  The phone has a position sensor in space.  It is necessary to rotate the image.  There is also a proximity sensor that turns the screen backlight on and off while holding a voice call.  Well, as a nice addition to the kit is a <span>digital compass.</span>  The device is sold on the territory of the Russian Federation in mobile phone stores with a one-year warranty card. </p><h2>  Options ZTE Blade S6: instructions and accessories </h2><p>  The delivery includes the device itself with an integrated lithium-ion type battery (capacity is about 2400 mAh), a network adapter for recharging, a cable for the same purposes (plus for synchronizing the smartphone with a personal computer or laptop), as well as all the necessary documentation .  It includes a warranty card, which the device owner can use for one calendar year from the date of purchase of the smartphone, as well as a brief user guide.  You can purchase a ZTE Blade S6 Silver smartphone, like other versions of the device, in any mobile phone salon. </p><h2>  Conclusion and reviews.  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  So, what are the negative and positive aspects that the owners of the device that purchased it tend to highlight? </p><p>  <em>Advantages</em> : </p><ul><li>  Design.  It can be called ergonomic.  Thanks to this, the device lies perfectly in the hand, its reliable retention is ensured. </li><li>  Good sound quality, which is most clearly audible using a wired headset or headphones. </li><li>  The presence of the function of two SIM cards. </li><li>  Ability to work in the fourth generation cellular network due to the LTE module. </li><li>  The presence on board the device operating system family "Android" version 5.0. </li></ul><p>  <em>Disadvantages</em> : </p><ul><li>  Case (each user has his own point of view on this score).  It is made of plastic, which crunches a little in the hand.  It is possible that over time the paint will be erased from it. </li><li>  Camera.  In its class, it is not the best, although it provides good quality shooting.  The downside is loud work. </li><li>  Not the best conversational speaker.  The sound quality of the voice is up to par, but there is no volume margin. </li><li>  Performance.  The hardware stuffing is quite good, but at the same time, something prevents the top toys from going without friezes and hangs. </li><li>  Screen (at the discretion of users).  Perhaps someone will find that the resolution for such a diagonal is not enough.  Another minus is the quality of the matrix.  It draws out useful properties as far as it can cope with it, but all the same, certain shortcomings and flaws in the work are visible. </li></ul>
