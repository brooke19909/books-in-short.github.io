The construction of the road from the Yungorodok district to the city center took almost thirty years.  Therefore, a real celebration for residents was the opening of the Alabinskaya metro station in Samara. </p><h2>  From England to Russia </h2><p>  The twentieth century has become a century of new technologies.  Their main task is to make human life easier.  These include the metro. </p>

The customer was Metropolitan Railways.  On behalf of the company, the name of this type of urban transport system went.  5 years later, the innovation was taken over by New York, where the overground subway was opened.  Following him, in 1892, Chicago opened the first steam-powered stations.

    <p>  The first subway in Moscow was launched only in 1935. Twenty years later, the line was launched in Leningrad, Kiev, Tbilisi, Novosibirsk and a dozen other Soviet cities.  Among them was Kuibyshev.  At the end of December 1987, all residents of the metropolis celebrated the opening of the metro station.  "Alabinskaya" in Samara then bore the name "October" and was included in the scheme.  But this option was thrown back. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Change direction </h2><p>  The history of the subway began with a decision of the Council of Ministers of the USSR in 1977.  During this period, the population of the point reached 1.2 million people.  Everyone worked actively, so they simply needed to quickly and easily move around the <span>big city</span> .  Not everyone could afford their own car, and public transport could not cope with such a flood of passengers. </p><p>  That is why the party leadership decided to open the first line.  Work began in September 1980.  First, they planned to open the metro station Alabinskaya (Oktyabrskaya) and Russkaya (Prospekt Lenina).  But later, after the construction of the tunnel, the direction changed, and this project was frozen.  The authorities decided that the subway should lie on a different route in the Yungorodka area, where most of the plants are concentrated. </p>

    <h2>  History of route number 10 </h2><p>  They planned to organize the first transportation in 1987 on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the <span>Great</span> <span>October Revolution.</span>  The station opened on December 26th. </p><p>  Today the line runs along the streets of Gagarin and Victory.  In total, 10 sites work.  The last on the line celebrated the opening of the Alabinskaya metro station.  In Samara, it is located at the crossroads of the streets with the busiest traffic - Novo-Sadovaya and Osipenko. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The direction in which citizens could easily and quickly get to the city center was conceived back in the distant 70s.  But they returned to this plan only twenty years later.  The launch of the new branch took place after the opening of the Russkaya station.  The construction of the latter was also repeatedly delayed due to lack of funds.  The 9th, it is worth noting, the longest, the site began its work on December 26, 2007. </p><h2>  Budget issue </h2><p>  The construction of the 10th branch began on February 21, 2007. The opening of the Alabinskaya metro station in Samara was planned for 2009.  Work began with a breakthrough of tunnels, each of which was about 650 meters long.  The first stage of construction was successful.  Soon the territory was fenced off already for the second part. </p>

Then for the first time they started talking about cutting costs.  The repairs on Volzhsky Avenue also became an obstacle.  Due to the closure of this unit, traffic on the streets was resumed, which were at the next construction site.  Some of the workers were transferred to secondary tasks.

    <h2>  Different timing variations </h2><p>  In September, city residents were upset by the information that the finances allocated for the construction had been significantly reduced. </p><p>  Due to budget cuts, they planned to freeze the project.  So, the opening of the Alabinskaya metro station was again postponed.  According to new estimates, the object should have been completed within 9 years after the start of construction. </p><p>  Nevertheless, construction continued.  Equipment was brought to the place, the cost of which was paid in advance.  Excavation work was also completed.  In 2010, the first site was ready.  Three years later, the left distillation tunnel finished.  Due to the volatility of financial flows, the hour of change was constantly changing. </p><h2>  Art in the subway </h2><p>  Seriously and to the design.  Throughout the world, the subway is just a convenient, cheap and fast way to get around.  But in the Soviet Union, even during the construction of the country's first Moscow metro, they decided that the construction should be not only functional, but also beautiful.  Tradition was supported in this city. </p>

The train was filled with people who were directly related to the construction of the facility.  Among them is the governor of the region <span>Nikolai Merkushkin.</span>  But the site was commissioned only on February 1, 2015.  From that day, transport has been running smoothly.  The schedule is user friendly.  Passengers are accepted from 6:00 to 00:00.  The cost of the trip is 23 rubles.  Cellular communication extends to all underground stations. </p>

    <p>  Interestingly, during the construction of the station, a disaster film was shot.  The director of the film, Anton Megerdichev, known for projects such as Shadow Boxing-2 and Yolki-3, was shooting a new film, Metro.  The premiere took place on February 21, 2013. </p><h2>  The main character </h2><p>  When the question arose of how to christen the site, they did not think for a long time.  The name of the person who put his whole life on the development of his beloved city is the Alabinskaya metro station. </p><p>  Samara has become home to many geniuses of past centuries.  Among them, Peter Vladimirovich Alabin, who was born in 1824, in Podolsk.  At a fairly young age he entered the military service, where he received more than one award for heroism and courage on the battlefield.  Later, for some time, he <span>acted as</span> governor of the Samara region.  Then he worked as a district judge.  It was then that this man made a technical revolution in a provincial town.  At his initiative, dozens of factories began to work, hundreds of versatile establishments were built. </p><p>  Another quality for which the residents of the city respect him is kindness.  During the famine of 1891, Samara was on the verge of survival.  The funds allocated by the government were sorely lacking.  Therefore, Pyotr Vladimirovich decided to purchase cheaper flour.  Subsequently, he was accused of stealing public funds. </p>

The metro station is named after this man - a tribute to his justice.
