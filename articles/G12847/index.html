About 3 million tourists visit the capital of Russia daily.  The question arises how safe these days to walk on the white stone.  If war breaks out, where so many people should flee?  The Ministry of Emergencies is sure that the bomb shelters in Moscow will be able to accommodate all the residents and guests of the capital.  It is worth figuring out where the nearest shelters are, how they are organized and what has changed since the Great Patriotic War. </p><h2>  Metro in the capital </h2><p>  It is easy to guess that 14 lines of the Moscow metro, with a length of more than 300 kilometers, are the most accessible bomb shelters in Moscow for ordinary residents. </p><p>  Back in 1935, the first metro line was opened.  Two years later, the country's leadership took care of the construction of special shelters for themselves and members of the NKVD.  The first was located near the Kirovskaya station, the second on Sovetskaya Square. </p><p>  In the fall of 41 years, the capital almost lost strategically important facilities, including the subway.  It seemed that Moscow could not be saved - residents and the military were hastily leaving the capital.  On October 16, by order of the commander in chief, they had to dismantle and blow up the subway. </p><p>  At the last moment, Stalin changed his mind, and the bomb shelters of Moscow, like the city itself, were saved. </p>

    <p>  Interestingly, during air attacks, the metropolitan dungeon turned into a real city.  It opened shops and hairdressers.  And at the metro station "Kurskaya" you could visit the library. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Secret Object Availability </h2><p>  It turns out that nowadays any guest of the capital can visit such military facilities as bomb shelters in Moscow.  Photo, however, according to the <span>rules of using the subway,</span> you can not do.  However, modern equipment allows you to imperceptibly and safely capture an underground shelter on your phone. </p><p>  That is why it is impossible to find a complete list of shelters.  Moreover, many bomb shelters have been kept secret since the time of the war.  For example, such a shelter of air defense was learned only in 2004.  Then the journalists dubbed the found "subway" - "Metro-2." </p><h2>  Shelters these days </h2><p>  Contemporaries, of course, are more interested in whether Moscow bomb shelters can accept all residents and guests of the capital and how safe it is to wait for an air attack underground. </p><p>  The Ministry of Emergencies is sure that there are enough subways in the capital that can protect Muscovites.  Moreover, the ministry, by agreement, is ready to arrange demonstration tours.  In the fall of this year, bloggers studied the bomb shelter on <span>Altufevskoye Shosse</span> and came to the conclusion that the shelter was ready for a sudden war.  The doors are heavy and hermetic, sleeping places are in order, there is a first-aid kit and anti-radiation suits. </p>

    <p>  According to general estimates, about 2 million people will be able to take refuge in the subway.  8 thousand will save the basement under the DC "Moscow City".  Also in the center of the capital there are about 1,200 bunkers.  However, there is no exact data on how many underground shelters exist in our time.  This is a <span>military secret.</span>  Therefore, you have to believe the Ministry of Emergency Situations to say that in case of war everyone can be saved. </p><h2>  How to find the nearest bomb shelter? </h2><p>  Despite the signature stamp, it will not be difficult to partially find the bomb shelters of Moscow.  The addresses of most of them are on the map of the metro. </p><p>  In addition, shelter from bombs can be in almost any basement of a modern high-rise building.  And the houses themselves have recently been built "bombproof": with plastic windows and safe doors. </p><p>  According to unofficial data, more than a hundred facilities intended for bomb shelters are currently under construction. </p>

    <p>  What is noteworthy, the rules for using underground shelters have not changed much since the war.  Shelters are for people only.  They can not smoke, drink alcohol and behave aggressively.  Children, retirees and persons with disabilities should be provided with assistance and assistance.  In addition, modern regulations prohibit the use of cell phones and cameras underground. </p>
