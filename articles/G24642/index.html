An integral attribute of a kitchen is a refrigerator and stove.  The choice of such equipment is treated with caution.  This is especially true for cooking surfaces.  There are several types of this technique.  <span>What is the difference between <span>an induction cooker</span> and an electric <span>stove</span> ?</span>  <span>In today's article, we will try to answer this question.</span> </p><h2>  Where did they come from? </h2><p>  As for a conventional <span>electric stove,</span> this technical device took root among the people back in the distant 19th century.  But about induction cookers it became known much later.  Thomas Ahern - it was this scientist who contributed to the development of this apparatus.  It is used to this day.  Of course, its design is <span>improved</span> every year.  Recently, this patent had an anniversary of 160 years.  Below we look at the features and similarities of each type. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  <span>Electric stoves (</span> induction <span>stoves</span> including) operate from a 220 Volt network. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="induction cookers" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1539774.jpg" width="600"></div>  Now these models are designed for high power.  On an electric stove, cooking dinner takes a minimum of time, but with careless handling, the risk of fire increases sharply.  At the moment, in the world of electricians, there are a large number of appliances for cooking.  <span>Electric cookers,</span> induction <span>cookers are</span> usually distinguished by types of heaters.  The first of them - with an ordinary spiral, the second - with a halogen heater.  There are only two control methods - manual and <span>touch.</span>  Induction electric tabletop <span>stove is</span> convenient due to its small size.  Thanks to its compact dimensions, such a plate can be transported by itself.  Secondly, among its advantages - profitability.  The energy in the tank is enough only for a certain amount of time, and there is always current.  What is the difference between an induction cooker and an electric stove?  This technique varies in weight.  Compact electric stoves cannot be.  Induction cookers are a small portable analog.  He spends much less energy.

There is another difference between an induction cooker and an electric stove.  The first heats up more slowly than the last.  Accordingly, the likelihood of a burn is extremely small.

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Induction cookers are popular among families with children, and all because the risk of burns in contact with it is minimal.  On the electric stove, the dishes are heated unevenly and burn as a result, which cannot be said about the induction model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electric induction cooker" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1539776.jpg" width="586"></div>  It gradually warms up any food, regardless of the degree of cooling.  Cooking on an electric stove needs longer than on induction, which is disadvantageous for large families with small children.  In addition, in terms of energy consumption, the induction model is much better than the electric one.  It ‚Äúeats‚Äù 1.5 times less current than the analogue.  What is the difference between an induction cooker and an electric stove?  Another difference between these types of household appliances is the high price of the first.  It prevents the acquisition of electric induction cookers.  Reviews about this type of household appliances are very good.  Therefore, sometimes it makes sense to overpay.

Damage is caused to humans.  Radiation does not affect the body in the best way.  Induction electric cookers for the kitchen are not very convenient in everyday use.  Reviews say that it is always necessary to buy special dishes, which is not required when using an electric stove.  Modern induction devices are equipped with a function for determining the type of utensils used, which greatly facilitates their selection. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="difference of induction cooker from electric" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1539775.jpg" width="600"></div>  The fact is that only with the availability of a suitable capacity, the stove starts to work properly.  As for the choice of dishes, on an <span>electric surface,</span> you can cook in plates of any materials.  But it is better to choose enamel, since this sample of dishes is heated very slowly.  The bottom of the induction cooker plate should be wide and cover at least 70% of the surface.  If it is not possible to buy induction cookware immediately, stickers reflecting magnetic radiation will come to the rescue.

    <h2>  Combined Option </h2><p>  There are induction-electric hobs that combine the positive aspects of both groups of the group.  But they have not only all the advantages, but also the disadvantages of these models.  So the choice here is entirely up to the buyer.  Any induction cooker can be washed with plain warm water, since the surface is usually covered with a special varnish composition, from which dirt is washed off very quickly.  If suddenly in an apartment or a house the power goes out or knocks out plugs, such ‚Äúsmart‚Äù hobs for the kitchen will be sure to turn off on their own or go into energy saving mode.  Another important feature in many cooking panels is the built-in timer that shows the cooking time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the difference between an induction cooker and an electric stove" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1539773.jpg" width="343"></div>  During operation, you can configure yourself by manually switching.  There is an automatic mode.  If you buy the right hob with wide heating elements, you can easily feed a family of 3-4 people.  Some induction cookers have a screen lock feature that can protect children from burns.  Also, if we talk about powerful models of panels, food can burn out.  It all depends on the timer set.  A significant plus of many hobs is mobility, due to which the unit can be easily transported from one room to another.  The timer on some household devices is designed for one and a half hours or more, which allows you to cook a full meal.  When you turn off or stop working, some types of panels emit a pleasant sound signal.

    <h2>  Cost and reviews </h2><p>  Typically, prices for hobs start at 11 thousand rubles or more.  There are economical options.  But the quality, judging by the reviews, is very "lame."  Now, hobs can be bought not only in the hypermarket, but through the online store. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electric stoves for kitchen induction" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1539772.jpg" width="485"></div>  The disadvantage of many surfaces for cooking products, judging by the reviews, is the insufficient length of the power cord.  It has to be increased with an extension cord.  The protective frame at the edges of the unit is also of great importance, and its absence is a very significant drawback of any plate.  Induction here is no exception.  People who use Hansa brand hobs note that the instruction manual for this stove is written in very poor, fuzzy language.  This complicates the process of studying its capabilities and functionality.  Also, from the minuses of this panel, there is a low heating temperature, which is 170 degrees.  This is not enough to cook some dishes.  As for the pluses, this panel is equipped with convection, delayed start and grill for preparing healthy and nutritious dishes.  Timers with an autonomous control system are installed on the oven and cooking panels. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electric induction cookers reviews" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1539771.jpg" width="425"></div>  There are also cheap options, for example, Kitfort-101.  This <span>is an induction</span> electric tabletop <span>stove</span> .  This panel is equipped with a wide list of adjustable settings.  They make it possible to program the cooking surface for any temperature and power.
