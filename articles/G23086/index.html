In order to get to it, you need to make some efforts, since the path to the Altai Mountains is very short.  Uchar waterfall is located on the small river Chulcha, a tributary of Chulyshman.  The famous waterfall is located about ten kilometers from the junction of these rivers.  And these places deserve to be here at least once in a lifetime. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Uchar waterfall" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/314061.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h3>  Uchar waterfall in Altai </h3><p>  Officially, on geographical maps and in some local history documents, this place is designated as "Big Chulchinsky Falls".  Usually, a waterfall is understood to mean a sheer drop in the flow of water from a certain height.  And in the strict sense of the word, Uchar Falls is not quite a waterfall.  There is no sheer cliff at this place.  There is only a stream of water, galloping over stones for a rather long distance.  According to one of the geological versions, the waterfall was formed here recently, in the last century, after a collapsed hillside blocked Chulcha.  Often, in geographic sources, Uchar Falls is defined as "cascading."  And such a definition can be considered the most accurate.  The total difference in height between the upper and lower levels of the river is approximately 160 meters.  And this river overcomes the height with several jumps on large stone ledges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Uchar waterfall in Altai" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/314060.jpg" width="490"></div>  Despite the ambiguity of the definition of this geographical object, the title of a waterfall, no one will dare to deprive him.  There is a simple criterion here - Uchar Falls cannot be reached either by kayak or on inflatable rafts.  Extreme athletes receiving a dose of adrenaline while overcoming rapids on mountain rivers bypass this spot along the coast.  However, it should be noted that the Chulcha River is not particularly suitable for rafting along it.  For athletes, only some of its sections are interesting.  The waterfall itself is best reached on foot.  Walking with a backpack in the Altai Mountains will be unforgettable.  And in the end, the reward for the efforts will be Uchar Falls.

    <h3>  How to get to the waterfall in the best way? </h3><p>  The hike usually begins on the shores of Lake Teletskoye and takes about 3 hours in one direction.  The first step is to cross over Chulyshman to the right bank.  Next you need to move up the path.  It is easy to read, there is nowhere to turn from it, and therefore there is practically no chance of getting lost. </p><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="uchar waterfall how to get" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/314059.jpg" width="496"></div></h3><p>  Walking is not the easiest, you may need basic climbing skills.  In several places, the path is quite narrow and runs over a cliff.  Safety ropes are pulled here.  Particular care should be taken in rainy weather when the path becomes slippery.  Along the way, several small streams have to be crossed, which, when precipitation occurs, can suddenly turn into serious obstacles.  Making his way to the waterfall, you will have to climb approximately 300 meters from the starting point.  But the noise of Uchar Falls will be heard from a great distance, which greatly improves orientation.  The return trip takes less time, as you have to move from top to bottom. </p>
