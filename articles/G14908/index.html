    <p>  The history of the birth of this place goes back many centuries.  It is believed that the city appeared long before our era.  At first it was the Greek colony of Aspalatos.  Then the city of Spalatum arose here.  Translated into Russian, this name means "palace".  Why did this settlement get the name Split after a while?  There is still no data on this. </p><p>  This city has seen different times: both good and bad.  Many bloody wars took place near these places.  And, as is known from history, Split was part of Austria, and part of France, and was occupied by Italians.  And during the years of World War II, the Germans ruled on these lands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Only in 1944, when the city was finally liberated, it became part of Croatia in the SFRY. </p><p>  After some time, an airport was built 20 kilometers from Split.  Croatia has several heavenly moorings, and this is rightfully considered the second largest of them in terms of passenger traffic. </p><h2>  More on everything </h2><p>  Split is an <span>international airport.</span>  <span>Croatia</span> welcomes tourists here from different parts of the world with its picturesque panoramas, the views of which are opened to the guests from a bird's eye view. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="croatia airport" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/328067.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Green valleys, ancient buildings and columns - the beauty of these places cannot be expressed in words, all this must be seen firsthand. </p><p>  In the "Split" itself there are all the basic amenities and entertainment.  Here those who are waiting for the plane can pass the time, or those who have just arrived can take a break and take a breath. </p><p>  A small bar, a restaurant with good cuisine, a cozy cafe, a local bank branch where you can exchange currency, and ATMs - all this has an airport.  Croatia has many comfortable hotels and hotels, which can be reached by taxi or on their own, by renting a car in a special agency working on the territory of the sky pier.  You can also get to the desired place by bus. </p><h2>  Flights to Split <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="croatia airports on map" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/328087.jpg" width="393"></div></h2><p>  If you look at the airports of Croatia on a map, then you can count about ten heavenly moorings.  The most popular is Zagreb.  "Split", as mentioned above, takes second place. </p><p>  Here guests are welcomed from different parts of the world, among which there are countries such as Russia, Germany, Austria, Finland.  And the popularity of these air gates is understandable, because such beautiful and amazing places that surround this airport have always attracted tourists with their centuries-old history, interesting sights and ancient legends. </p>
