The huge industrial center of the Middle Urals lives its hard working life, its population exceeds one million.  The issue of summer holidays in the city is relevant for many.  This applies to both the indigenous inhabitants of the metropolis and those who happened to be in the city during the warm months by accident. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where you can swim in yekaterinburg" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/240006.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Where can I swim in Yekaterinburg, according to the sanitary service</strong> </p><p>  Unfortunately, not all the beaches and ponds of the city, traditionally popular with its residents in the summer months, are suitable for safe swimming.  The defining moment here is the ecological state of the coastline and the water itself.  And the regional branch of Rospotrebnadzor gives a very disappointing answer to the question of where you can swim in Yekaterinburg.  The eastern shore of the large Lake Shartash on the outskirts of the city is fully compliant with all sanitary and environmental standards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yekaterinburg where to swim" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/240007.jpg" width="500"></div>

But the place is very comfortable for relaxation, the beach is equipped with the appropriate beach infrastructure.  There are parking lots, sports grounds with rental points for a variety of water sports equipment, <span>catering facilities.</span>  There is everything to spend a day off with health benefits.  The lake is quite large, its western shore is barely visible on the horizon.  And this is the cleanest body of water in the city, which is a decisive factor in answering the question of where you can swim in Yekaterinburg.  Unfortunately, this cannot be said of other beaches of the metropolis, the ecological state of which is at best doubtful.  Which, however, does not stop those who wish to swim in them on a hot July day.  Many urban water bodies formed by chance, they have neither legal owners, nor conditions for maintaining cleanliness and timely garbage collection.  You should refrain from bathing in them if your health is dear to you.  Perhaps all the best beaches are located outside the city limits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaches of yekaterinburg" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/240004.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Out of city</strong> </p><p>  Very many people prefer to leave Yekaterinburg for the weekend, where swimming is not always safe.  Fortunately, in the Sverdlovsk region there are still many places with good ecology and beautiful nature.  The best option for a Sunday holiday is the numerous beaches on the coast of the <span>Reftinskoye reservoir,</span> located behind the Cheremshansky dam.  You can have a great time on the lakes of Gurino and Okunevo or on the Pyshma River, on the banks of which children's camps are traditionally located.  The <span>Iset River</span> is also suitable for recreation along its entire length, with the exception of Verkh-Isetsky and Nizhne-Isetsky ponds, where not everything is safe in environmental terms.  In general, the nature of the Middle Urals with its temperate climate is very comfortable for summer holidays.  A person accustomed to the conditions of the middle band does not need additional acclimatization here. </p>
