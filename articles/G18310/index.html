If you plan to visit it soon, then you will probably be interested in information about what to see in Vladivostok.  There are enough sights in the city, which means that interesting leisure is provided. </p><h2>  Golden bridge </h2><p>  The Golden Bridge has become the main modern attraction of Vladivostok.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãits creation arose a long time ago, back in the mid-nineteenth century.  However, at first the plans were violated by the First, and then the Second World War.  Seriously, only Khrushchev became interested in the question, who wanted a bridge in Vladivostok more beautiful than the Golden Gate.  The Secretary General even introduced the project to the general plan.  But years passed, and the decision to build was finally made only in the two thousandths.  The dream was realized only in 2012.  Two bridges were built for the APEC summit: the Russian Bridge and the Golden Bridge.  By the way, both buildings are among the five largest cable-stayed bridges in the world.  The length of the first is 3100 meters, and the second - 1400 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="architectureguru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden bridge" class="if uuid-2285881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2285881.jpg"></div><p>  Despite all the financial scandals surrounding the construction of large-scale facilities, they have become the main modern attractions of Vladivostok and Primorye.  The Golden Bridge was laid across the Golden Horn in the heart of the city.  The building connected remote areas with the central part and the federal highway.  The bridge has six tracks for cars and pedestrian walkways.  Therefore, if you wish, you can appreciate the beauty of the local landscapes during the walk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The Russian bridge</span> connected Cape Novosilsky and the Nazimov Peninsula.  Thanks to the appearance of the bridge, there is no need to ride boats or a ferry every day.  By the way, the bridge entered the Guinness Book of Records.  Among tourists incredibly popular sightseeing tours of cable-stayed bridges.  Sightseeing can be seen during boat trips.  Very often, the Golden Bridge is called the main attraction of Vladivostok. </p><h2>  Lighthouse </h2><p>  The main attractions of Vladivostok include the lighthouse with the beautiful name "Tokarevskaya cat."  Not a single city tour is complete without his visit.  The lighthouse got its name from the eponymous name of the spit on which it is located.  For almost 150 years, this structure has shown the way for ships that pass through the Eastern Bosphorus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="photocentra.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lighthouse in Vladivostok" class="if uuid-2285882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2285882.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists come to see the ancient building and take a photo at the extreme point of a vast continent.  And the luckiest ones even manage to see spotted seals here. </p><h2>  Tsesarevich Embankment </h2><p>  Information about the attractions of Vladivostok with a description can be found in any tourist avenue.  There are many interesting and noteworthy places in the city.  Which ones are worth a visit is up to you.  You should definitely visit the Cesarevich embankment.  It is located near the city center, between Dalzavod and the bridge.  The embankment was opened not so long ago - in 2012.  She immediately became one of the most beloved places of the citizens and guests of Vladivostok.  The embankment got a beautiful name in honor of Emperor Nicholas II, who visited the city while still being a prince.  The program of his visit included laying docks, which later became a shipbuilding and ship repair plant.  And now this company is the oldest in the whole city.  Part of the factory territory has now become an embankment.  The promenade organically fit into the architectural ensemble of the city.  There is a walking area, a playground with swings and attractions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sdelanounas.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsesarevich Embankment" class="if uuid-2285884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2285884.jpg"></div><p>  The embankment is a landmark of Vladivostok, which is interesting with a giant chessboard and observation deck "Bridge of Love", where all lovers leave locks as a sign of their feelings.  The promenade is decorated with a beautiful complex of fountains.  There are also shops and cafes. </p><h2>  Pokrovsky park </h2><p>  Another attraction of Vladivostok is <span>Pokrovsky Park,</span> located in the city center.  It is a favorite vacation spot not only for guests, but also for the townspeople themselves.  Its shady alleys allow you to move away from the bustle of the city.  The history of the park is very interesting.  At the end of the nineteenth century, this territory was considered the outskirts of the city.  Here was a cemetery.  The very first inhabitants of the city were buried on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vladivostok-city.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pokrovsky park" class="if uuid-2285888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2285888.jpg"></div><p>  In 1902, Pokrovsky Cathedral was erected nearby.  It was so big that it became the second temple in Vladivostok.  Later it was blown up, and a culture and recreation park was set up at the site of the cemetery.  Now in the park there is the church of John of Kronstadt, as well as the chapel of Seraphim of Sarov.  In addition, in 2007 the Pokrovsky Cathedral was restored, which is now an authentic decoration of the park territory.  It is made in the old Russian style and is fully consistent with the original version of the structure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Islands in the Gulf of Peter the Great </h2><p>  The unique sights of Vladivostok (photos and descriptions of some of them are given in the article) include Peter the Great Bay.  This is the most picturesque and largest bay in the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan.  It is famous for its beautiful underwater landscapes, azure bays, rocky capes and clean beaches.  But the most interesting are its mysterious islands.  Each of them has its own amazing story.  All of them are a resting place for citizens. </p><h2>  Popova Island </h2><p>  <span>Popov Island</span> was named after Admiral A. Popov, who led the Pacific Squadron in the nineteenth century.  It is this island that is most visited by people.  Despite the fact that it is closest to the city, he managed to preserve his pristine beauty: beautiful grottoes, rocks, centuries-old forests and their inhabitants.  By the way, most of the island is a nature reserve.  On its territory is a museum of nature and a botanical garden.  The island is popular with divers and outdoor enthusiasts.  It has preserved the old fortifications of the early twentieth century.  In addition, the island has several tourist camps and holiday homes for those who want to spend time here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.farpost.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Popova Island" class="if uuid-2285927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2285927.jpg"></div><p>  Another island popular among city dwellers is Reinecke.  Of greatest interest are its natural beauty.  In summer, local beaches attract tourists.  Boats and ferries go to all islands from Vladivostok.  Therefore, in the warm season, getting to them is not at all difficult.  It is worth noting that the bay still has the <span>island of Putyatin,</span> Rikorda and others.  Each of them has its own natural beauty and interesting places. </p><h2>  Sports harbor </h2><p>  Another attraction of Vladivostok (photo is given in the article) can be called Sports Harbor, which is a traditional promenade.  The promenade is one of the oldest places in the city.  Once upon a time, the first baths were here.  The local places were then considered healing because of the increased salinity of the water.  And at the beginning of the twentieth century there was a fish market on the coast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn----8sbiecm6bhdx8i.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sports harbor" class="if uuid-2285930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2285930.jpg"></div><p>  A real equipped beach appeared in this place only in 1953.  Since then, this place began to be called Sports Harbor.  And even later, the alleys were broken, cafes and shops were built.  Currently, there is a light and music fountain open for the 125th anniversary of the city. </p><h2>  Brinner Mansion </h2><p>  If you are interested in the architectural sights of Vladivostok (photos are given in the article), then you should pay attention to the three-story building in the very center of the city, called the Brinner Mansion.  It is considered one of the most beautiful architectural monuments of Primorye.  The mansion was built at the very beginning of the twentieth century according to the project of George Junghendel.  By the way, the architect built a number of buildings in the city, each of which became a landmark. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vladivostok-city.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Brinner Mansion" class="if uuid-2285934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2285934.jpg"></div><p>  The estate belonged to the Swiss merchant Julius Brinner, who was considered the most famous industrialist in the Far East.  It was under the influence of this person that the appearance of the current historical center of the city developed.  Brinner stood at the origins of the Russian shipping company in the Far East.  In the city, he is revered as a person who has made a significant contribution to the development of the entire region.  Now in the mansion is the office of the Far Eastern Shipping Company. </p><h2>  Submarine </h2><p>  Photos of Vladivostok and the sights of the city, given by us article, allow us to some extent appreciate all its beauty.  It is worth noting that there are many monuments of military glory, each of which has its own history.  Among them, I would especially like to note the memorial submarine S-56.  It was built back in 1936 and during the Second World War was part of the Northern Fleet.  There are four German ships on her boat account.  Later, in honor of the 30th anniversary of the victory on the Ship Embankment, it was installed as a monument.  Currently, there is a museum inside the boat.  Everyone can see the compartments that looked exactly the same during the war. </p><h2>  Funicular </h2><p>  The sights of the city of Vladivostok include the funicular system.  Its construction was started back in 1959 at the initiative of Khrushchev.  As conceived by the Secretary General, Vladivostok was to become one of the most beautiful cities in the world.  The implementation of large-scale plans in life began precisely with the construction of the funicular.  Its discovery took place already in 1962.  Local residents immediately appreciated this type of transport, because it is no secret that the city has a rather complicated relief.  The funicular is located on the elephant of the Eaglet Hill.  It consists of only two cars, and the length of the rail tracks is 183 meters.  During the trip, passengers can enjoy a wonderful view of the Golden Horn. </p><h2>  Triumphal Gate </h2><p>  One of the business cards of the city is called the Nikolaev Triumphal Gate (Tsesarevich's Arch).  A beautiful building appeared in the city in 1891.  The semi-park is placed facing the sea, and on its facade is the face of Nikolai the Wonderworker.  The appearance of the building is associated with a visit to the future emperor of the Primorsky Territory.  In order to adequately meet the heir to the throne, local authorities decided to pave Prudova Street, decorating it with the Triumphal Gate in the Russian-Byzantine style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russights.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Triumphal Gate" class="if uuid-2285938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2285938.jpg"></div><p>  The place of construction of the gate was chosen quite symbolically, since it was from here that the city began to grow and build.  It is worth noting that the modern arch is only a copy of the original structure, blown up in 1930. </p><h2>  Oceanarium </h2><p>  City guests can take sightseeing tours of the sights of Vladivostok.  Typically, such programs include visits to the main places of the city.  If you have time, then you should definitely visit the aquarium of Vladivostok.  This is one of the must see places.  There is an institution on the street battery.  In the aquarium you can admire the inhabitants of the rivers of the Far East, the Pacific Ocean, reservoirs of Africa, tropical lakes and the Amazon.  The collection of the institution totals 2000 individuals, every year it is replenished with new copies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.windoftravel.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oceanarium in Vladivostok" class="if uuid-2285941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2285941.jpg"></div><p>  The two-story building of the aquarium offers to get acquainted with the living inhabitants of the seas and oceans.  On the ground floor there is a huge circular aquarium that allows you to view the inhabitants.  Turtles also live here.  Employees of the institution for each inhabitant maximally reproduced the natural living conditions. </p><h2>  Russian island </h2><p>  Russian island is located closest to the city.  Its unique natural beauty with picturesque bays and rocks.  Historians believe that in the old days there was a Manchurch moonlight fortress on the island.  For the first time it became known in the eighteenth century.  Soon Primorye became part of the Russian lands.  Later, during the aggravation of Russian-Japanese relations on the island, fortifications of the Vladivostok fortress began to be erected.  Later on these lands housed the first observatory in the whole country, which was supposed to serve to protect the region from cholera, plague and other dangerous ailments.  During the Russo-Japanese War, the island was the base of the Pacific Fleet.  He performed this function until the end of the twentieth century.  And in Soviet times, the island housed numerous military bases.  But at present, the Russian island is open to all comers.  You can visit it at any time to relax, swim and just admire nature. </p>
