  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to cut a song on Android: an overview of the best programs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern smartphones and tablets of a premium level are already very close in functionality to desktop devices.  They offer not only telephony and good leisure.  Mobile gadgets have some practical qualities, such as storing and playing files of various formats. </p><p>  Today we will focus on music.  Smartphones allow you to store hundreds or even thousands of musical compositions.  Any of them can be set as a ringtone.  But not every track in its original form is suitable for this: the introduction of one song is too long, the other only attracts the refrain, but from the third one you really want to make a mix. </p><p>  Many users are wondering how to trim a song on Android.  Regular software for most firmware, alas, does not have such functionality, so you have to turn to third-party utilities and services.  We will just consider them. </p><p>  From our article you will learn how to cut a song on Android as painlessly as possible for both the mobile device and the user himself.  Consider the most popular utilities for implementing this enterprise. </p><h2>  Top programs </h2><p>  You can trim the song to Android using one of the applications described below.  All programs work stably on all versions of the platform, you can find them on Google.Plea, so there should be no problems with testing software. </p><h2>  Ringtone Maker (Big Bang Inc.) </h2><p>  This is the most common application that allows you to quickly and efficiently cut a song to the Android ringtone.  Here we see a convenient sorting of songs, a friendly interface and support for all well-known music formats. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Ringtone Maker Big Bang Inc" class="if uuid-3087325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3087325.jpg"></div><p>  The program has a lot of additional features.  In the editor, you can impose manifestation, attenuation on the track, increase the bitrate for songs without pronounced bass.  There are sound scaling, tagging, gluing and much more. </p><p>  The Ringtone Maker program allows you to not only cut the song on Android, but also make it a real mix.  Directly from the application interface, you can put the resulting ringtone on a call without the participation of the platform menu. </p><h2>  Ringdroid (Ringdroid Team) </h2><p>  Another extremely popular application that allows you to trim the song on the "Android".  The utility appeared back in 2008 and still pleases users with a pleasant interface, intuitive tools and, of course, its effectiveness. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Ringdroid Ringdroid Team" class="if uuid-3087326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3087326.jpg"></div><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the lack of advertising.  This is the official application of the open project, it does not provide annoying banners or pop-ups for sponsors.  The utility works with all popular music formats. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Here you can edit almost anything: cut out a separate area, apply additional effects on top of the track, glue the parts and shuffle them completely, making a cover mix from a familiar melody. </p><p>  After processing using the application interface, you can put the received ringtone on the call.  For the last action, the utility will need access to your contacts.  The utility will make a separate request at the time of attaching the melody to the subscriber. </p><h2>  Ringtone Maker (AndroidRock) </h2><p>  This small and ‚Äúlight‚Äù application for editing tracks will come in handy for owners of low-cost mobile gadgets with a small amount of RAM and a modest drive.  The utility does not have such chic functionality as we saw in the two previous cases, but it copes with its main task, that is, with trimming songs, with dignity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Ringtone Maker AndroidRock" class="if uuid-3087327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3087327.jpg"></div><p>  The program works with all popular music file formats - MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A, etc. There are no overlay effects as such, but there are such important modes as attenuation and amplification.  The utility works stably on any device.  Users do not notice any lags or brakes. </p><p>  The application is distributed free of charge, so it could not do without advertising.  The banner with "Ozone" and "Aliexpress" are frequent guests when editing tracks, so you have to tolerate or purchase a paid subscription. </p>
