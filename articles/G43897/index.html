  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bank bridge in St. Petersburg: address, description, history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  St. Petersburg has many epithets associated with its natural and city-forming features.  One of them is the name Northern Venice.  And there is more than one confirmation of this.  For example, the fact that through its many rivers and canals a huge number of bridges are thrown: different in design features and unique in design.  One of them is a bridge across the Griboedov Canal with unique images of griffins as functional and decorative elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="banking bridge story" class="if uuid-2337377" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2337377.jpg"></div><h2>  Bank Bridge History </h2><p>  In St. Petersburg, this pedestrian bridge was thrown over the Griboedov Canal in 1826.  The authorship of the project belongs to the engineers V. Tretter and V. Khristianovich.  And the decision to build a bridge in the chosen place is connected with the need to provide a crossing across the canal to the entrance to the Assignation Bank, which was previously located in an old building on the canal embankment, where the Bank Bridge is now located at 27-30 Griboedov Canal Embankment .  In addition, the bridge connects the two central islands - Kazan and Spassky, combining two sections of the historical center of the city into a single territory. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-zoom="16" data-type="roadmap" data-lng="30.325010399999996" data-lat="59.9321423"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/3/7/1637.png"></div><p>  It was planned to complete the construction as early as the laying year - 1825, but the process was delayed due to the untimely casting of cast-iron structures for construction at the Charles Beard factory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Gradually, the Bank Bridge in St. Petersburg deteriorated, and parts of it were replaced with cheaper ones and violating historical compliance with the project.  Therefore, in 1949 during the restoration work, it was decided to return to the Bank Bridge its original appearance.  Restoration work at this stage was completed by 1997.  But in view of the perfect act of vandalism in 2009, when gilding was scraped off the wings of the newly restored griffins, the damaged elements of the bridge had to be restored again.  And in 2015, it was decided to replace the wooden flooring on the Bank Bridge. </p><h2>  Myths and legends </h2><p>  According to one of the <span>St. Petersburg legends, the</span> figures of griffins can bring financial prosperity in the case of certain ritual actions: you need to put a coin on the paw of one of the griffins, rub the paw and kiss it in place above the tail.  It is sometimes said that it‚Äôs enough to just walk across the bridge holding banknotes.  Or shake with small coins, which should be poured into your pocket more, so that the sound is as loud as possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank bridge address" class="if uuid-2337367" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2337367.jpg"></div><p>  According to another, student legend, which originated among students of the St. Petersburg State Academy of Economics and Finance, near which there is a bridge, griffins, being the guardians of knowledge, can help them during the session. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is still a legend not related to financial well-being.  It is associated with the fulfillment of a cherished desire, for which it is simply necessary to rub the gryphon's thigh, located on the side of the Kazan Cathedral. </p><h2>  Design Features </h2><p>  The Bank Bridge over the Griboedov Canal in St. Petersburg is one of the unique historical bridges of the suspension type.  <span>The wooden flooring of the</span> bridge is supported by chains running along the entire length of the bridge and through the mouths of the griffins, attached to massive cast-iron plates lying on the shore near the exit from the bridge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.depositphotos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Assignment Bank at Bank Bridge" class="if uuid-2337372" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2337372.jpg"></div><p>  The bridge has one span.  The design is supported by special pylons in the form of cast-iron frame frames.  The main platform of the bridge is limited on both sides by a unique cast-iron fence. </p><h2>  Decoration: a unique fence </h2><p>  The cast-iron fence of the bank bridge consists of sections-sections of rods arranged fan-shaped and completed with semicircles of arches, which resembles a semi-flower like chamomile.  Between the sections, combining them into a single whole, cast-iron constructions made up of 6 curls similar to currencies are fixed.  The upper frame of the bridge fence consists of parallel beams connected by evenly spaced cast-iron rings.  Some argue that the elements are more reminiscent of unfolded fans and palm leaves.  Some elements of the fence, as well as the wings of the sculptures that adorn the bridge, were covered <span>with gold leaf.</span>  By the end of the 19th century, most of the details had lost the gilding that the locals constantly scraped off for easy profit.  The grille was dismantled for restoration, but disappeared.  And only by the middle of the next century was it restored by the architect Rotach according to preserved sketches. </p><h2>  The mythological miracle of the fabulous bridge </h2><p>  But the true miracle of the bridge is the sculptural images of griffins.  Since the bridge was built near the building of the Assignation Bank, such an artistic solution does not look strange, because griffins - mythological creatures of Greek origin with a lion body and eagle wings - are considered good watchmen and a symbol of wealth, as well as the unity of power and mind.  In addition, they were creatures who obeyed the god of sunlight Apollo and the goddess of retribution Nemesis.  And they even drove their teams.  In addition, the wheel of fate was rotated.  And in ancient Egypt they were associated with the power of the pharaoh, defeating his enemies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank bridge" class="if uuid-2337364" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2337364.jpg"></div><p>  The griffins made at the Aleksandrovsky Iron Foundry according to the Sokolov project on Bankovsky Bridge received bright shining wings covered with a thin layer of gold leaf to gray cast iron.  And precisely because of this, in the future they often suffered at the hands of wealth seekers.  And now griffins are again sent for restoration, but in the current 2018 they are supposed to be returned to their pedestals. </p><p>  In addition, the figures of the griffins were decorated with wonderful lanterns mounted on their foreheads.  The lanterns had a round shade of milky-white glass with a gilded top, resembling sepals of a berry and a tripod-shaped stalk arched by an arc. </p><h2>  Near Bank Bridge </h2><p>  The historical environment of the Bank Bridge is rich and amazing.  First of all, of course, this is the building of the Assignation Bank, established back in 1768 and housed in the building on Sadovaya Street, designed by the Italian architect <span>Giacomo Quarenghi.</span>  Also - the building of the Kazan Cathedral - a monument to the Patriotic War of 1812, erected at the beginning of the XIX century by Andrei Voronikhin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Griffins on Bank Bridge" class="if uuid-2337383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2337383.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, this territory was one of the most relevant trading places of the city - nearby were the Big Gostiny, Apraksin and Schukin Yards.  And a little further - on Nevsky Prospect - the famous Singer company building and Engelhardt's mansion.  In the distance, along the promenade, you can see the domes of the Savior on Spilled Blood. </p>
