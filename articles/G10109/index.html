But where to stay in the capital?  Often hotels in the <span>center of Moscow are</span> very expensive, but do not justify their high prices.  Let's find suitable housing on the outskirts.  Of course, we will consider only those options that allow us to quickly get to the center of the metropolis.  This is primarily the hotel, which are located near metro stations.  No one needs to be convinced of the advantages of such an arrangement.  And what else are the hotels on the outskirts of?  Often they are surrounded not by urbanistic, but by natural landscapes - parks, lakes.  Large supermarkets are located nearby, the prices of which are lower than in stores in the center of Moscow.  For businessmen, the proximity of exhibition centers is often of no small importance.  And tired travelers or passengers of early flights want to be closer to the airports.  All these advantages are available at the Prince Park Hotel in Moscow.  We will consider it in our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Park Hotel Prince" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1180553.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  The hotel is located in the south-west of Moscow.  Its exact address is the intersection of Novoyasenevsky Prospekt and Profsoyuznaya Street.  This is an ecologically clean <span>zone of Moscow.</span>  Why is there a word "park" in the name of the hotel?  Hotel "Prince" is located very close to Bitsevsky Square.  If you go through the park zone, you can go to another metro station - Sviblovo.  But the nearest entrance to the "subway" is located just around the corner of the hotel.  This metro station is called Teply Stan.  Just half an hour drive on this branch - and you are already in the very center of Moscow.  Approximately the same amount of time must be taken to get to the capital's airports Domodedovo and Vnukovo.  This hotel is beneficial for motorists, since there are two convenient exits to the MKAD near it.  Profsoyuznaya Street and nearby Leninsky Prospekt are two more key highways of the capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prince Park Hotel Moscow" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1180546.jpg" width="600"></div>
