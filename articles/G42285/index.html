After all, everyone wants to touch the world of antiquity, see monuments of architecture that are thousands of years old, and also relax on the famous Greek beaches.  Particularly popular are the resorts of the Halkidiki peninsula, which is washed by the waters of the <span>Aegean Sea</span> and resembles a trident in its shape.  One of its ‚Äúteeth‚Äù is the Kassandra Peninsula.  The nature of these places, in comparison with other regions of Greece, is more magnificent.  <span>Pine forests</span> come close to the beaches <span>,</span> which fill the air with the aroma of pine needles.  In addition, it is not so hot here as in the south of the country, and even calmer.  Therefore, hotels located along the beaches of Kassandra are popular among family tourists who prefer a quiet and measured vacation.  One of them is the Bellagio Hotel 3 *, which is located near the village of Furke.  This is a very comfortable hotel that offers tourists the highest level of service. </p>

    <h2>  Holidays in Kassandra </h2><p>  This small peninsula, which together with St. Athos and Sithonia forms Halkidika, is located in the north of the country.  Here the climate is milder and more favorable for summer holidays, because there is no sweltering heat characteristic of the southern regions.  The coastline of Kassandra stretches for 50 kilometers.  This peninsula is considered the birthplace of the Tigants - the sons of heaven and earth.  Today, these regions are mainly developing in the tourist direction.  All 44 settlements of the peninsula, including the village of Furke, in which the Bellagio Hotel 3 * is located, are considered well-developed sea resorts.  As noted above, the peninsula is washed by the turquoise-purple waters of the Aegean Sea.  This unusual shade of sea water is given by algae, which grow near the coast.  Despite the fact that the resorts of Kassandra are more suitable for a lazy beach holiday, there are many entertainment establishments: restaurants, taverns, bars and cafes, night clubs and discos.  But the village of Fourka will surely appeal to lovers of secluded pastime, away from the hustle and bustle of entertainment.  If you consider yourself to be in this category of tourists, then the place in Bellagio Hotel 3 * (Halkidiki / Kassandra) is your place.  Here, no one will stop you from enjoying the sea, peace and quiet. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Old and New Fourka </h2><p>  Fourka, which is several hundred years old, is located three kilometers from the coast, in the depths of the peninsula.  This is a very small village, the number of inhabitants of which does not exceed 500 people.  Here you can see old chapels, and buildings in the traditional Greek style, and Byzantine temples, etc. And the new Fourka is located very close to the coast and is known to tourists under the name Skala Fourkas.  It is in this part among the dense greenery of the forests that the comfortable hotels of the peninsula are located, such as the Bellagio Hotel (Fourka) 3 * and others. Tourists relaxing in this resort can enjoy beach vacations, hiking or cycling, engage in various water activities, go on fascinating excursions to nearby shrines on the peninsula of St. Athos, as well as explore the surroundings of Fourka. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to Fourka? </h2><p>  The first thing that interests tourists who bought tours to the Bellagio Hotel Fourka 3 * hotel - how to get there?  The nearest airport to the resort, where planes fly from major Russian cities, is Macedonia Airport Terminal, located in the city of Thessaloniki, or simply Thessaloniki, as we call it.  From here to 90 km, you can either take a bus or take a taxi.  Typically, tour operators offer tourists to pay for the transfer, and then from the airport to the hotel you will be taken by the Greek department of the travel agency from which you purchased your tour package.  The road leading from Thessaloniki to the resort is very beautiful and picturesque, and you will get a lot of positive emotions from the view of mountains drowning in greenery, the turquoise surface of the sea, gardens and kitchen gardens. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Bellagio Hotel 3 (Greece): Location and General Description </h2><p>  This three-star hotel, which until 2013 was called Avra ‚Äã‚ÄãBungalows, is located 500 meters from the center of Fourka and 400 meters from the beach (on the second line).  He, unlike many other Greek hotels of this category, works on the ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù system, providing the highest quality service to its guests.  So, for example, many services in the hotel (parking, air conditioning, Internet, etc.) are free. </p><p>  The main building of the hotel is in the traditional Macedonian style.  It was built at the end of the last century, but most recently underwent a major reconstruction.  The main feature of the Macedonian style is the use of dark wood in combination with snow-white whitewash.  Five bungalows scattered across a pine forest with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã10 hectares are built in the same direction. </p>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Tourists vacationing on the Kassandra peninsula can always diversify their vacation by looking at the sights.  For example, the ruins of the Byzantine tower in the town of Nea Fokea, as well as the ancient city of Nea Potidea, may be of particular interest to them.  In Kallithea - a small village - you can find the remains of the Temple of Zeus, as well as a sacred structure built in honor of Dionysus, the god of winemaking.  There are also many architectural monuments of the later period on the peninsula: Christian monasteries and temples, etc. From here you can also make boat trips to the peninsula of St. Athos, as well as to the city of Thessaloniki. </p><h2>  Bellagio Hotel 3 *: reviews and ratings of tourists </h2><p>  By reading the reviews of vacationers, we are once again convinced of how subjective opinions about the same subject can be.  Many tourists who spent their holidays in this Greek hotel enthusiastically talk about the excellent conditions, the precautionary attitude and delicious food in the restaurant of the Belagio Hotel.  However, along with this, one can read extremely negative assessments of tourists from Russia.  Firstly, they believe that the prices in this hotel are overpriced.  So, for example, a ten-day tour to a hotel from Moscow costs from $ 700.  For this amount, according to our compatriots, you can relax in Turkey or Egypt with great convenience, and in a four-star hotel.  However, they forget that Greece is Greece, it is a completely different aura, a different color.  Secondly, many complain about the lack of service.  However, do not forget that this is a three-star hotel, and in hotels of this category you can rarely find all-inclusive meals, as well as such a wide range of free services.  If you evaluate the Bellagio Hotel in fairness, then it, of course, is worth the highest praise. </p>
