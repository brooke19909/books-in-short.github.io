    <h2>  Beadwork History </h2><p>  Interest in beadwork then increased, then almost disappeared.  According to legend, the first beads were obtained by the Phoenicians about six thousand years ago.  Like many discoveries, this was also random.  A piece of nitrate was placed near the fire.  The next morning, the Phoenicians discovered a magnificent brilliant ingot, which was very solid and transparent.  With the help of a bonfire, saltpeter was again melted, but now it was combined with river sand.  Thus, the first glass in the history of mankind turned out, which gave rise to glass production. </p><h2>  Beadwork in Russia </h2><p>  In ancient Egypt as far back as the 4th century BC.  e.  engaged in the manufacture <span>of bead jewelry.</span>  They also found the first mention of beads.  Further beadwork spread to Gaul, Greece, Germany and Byzantium.  Over time, skill has improved.  In Russia, beadwork began to appear in the 18th century.  The wind came from Western Europe.  Products from this material, including such as a napkin made of beads, have become incredibly popular.  They decorated the interior of the richest houses and palaces.

    <h2>  How to make a lace napkin </h2><p>  Weaving a napkin from beads is not a very difficult, but time-consuming process.  In order for the final result to please the skilled worker and enthuse others, it is necessary to observe several simple, but very necessary rules: </p><ul><li>  The color scheme should be carefully thought out.  The right combination of colors makes the thing more attractive.  Also, do not use only one or two colors.  Excess color is also undesirable, as the pattern scheme is simply lost. </li><li>  The material must be of high quality.  Quality beads not only shine brighter, it is also the same size.  Beads of different shapes can deform a thing, ruining the final picture. </li><li>  The fishing line should be strong and flexible enough.  In the case of low-quality fishing line, the napkin made of beads will change over time.  If the thread is fragile, then it may break in the middle of the work.  You can also use threads for knitting. </li><li>  A special bead needle simplifies work.  Thanks to this improvised tool, things will go faster, and it will be much more convenient for you. </li></ul>

Patterns of napkins made of beads are clear even to a beginner.  There are a great many of them.  For beginners, the Valentine card scheme is perfect.  To create a lace napkin, red and beige (optional white) beads are taken.  Any openwork bead napkin is woven from the middle.  For this product, you need to <span>crochet a napkin with a</span> diameter of 8.5 cm. After this, the edge of the base is divided into 27 identical segments.  Borders are marked with pins or auxiliary threads.  At these points it is necessary to fix the bead net.  A certain number of beads is collected on each thread, after which neighboring threads are connected.  According to this scheme, the remaining beads are strung.  The last heart (optimally make nine hearts) is fastened by threading the thread through the first bead at the beginning of the net. </p><h2>  Scheme for more experienced needlewomen </h2><p>  As mentioned above, any home is beautifully decorated with bead napkins.  A master class in the manufacture of such a product will allow you to quickly understand the intricacies of weaving this interior detail.  Experienced housewives have repeatedly come across the ‚ÄúTwist‚Äù scheme.  Strict adherence to a phased scheme will turn the process into a pleasant and burdensome pastime.  Napkin according to the scheme "Swirl" looks very beautiful in the performance of two contrasting colors.  Perfectly beads of pale blue and black colors.  Such a napkin is woven with individual elements.  After the manufacture of all parts of the product, they must be connected.  Twists should be directed in one direction.  In this case, openwork weaving in a circle is used. </p>
