This is a truly multinational city where different faiths peacefully coexist. </p><h2>  Buddhist community </h2><p>  There are many republics that are part of the Russian Federation and profess Buddhism.  These include Kalmykia, Tyva, Buryatia, Altai and Transbaikal Territory, Irkutsk Region, which in total amounts to about 1 million people.  In addition to these territories, this religion is widespread in cities such as St. Petersburg, Samara and Moscow, where its adherents form communities that bring together hundreds of people. </p>

    <p>  The re-development of <span>Buddhism in Russia</span> began in the 1990s, when believers began to return the surviving churches and erect new ones.  Today, many schools are represented in the country: from Japanese Zen and Korean dream to traditional Tibetan, as well as Mahayana and Theravada directions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Although there are few adherents of Buddhism, in comparison with other faiths, he is one of the four official religions of Russia.  In 2009, for the first time, a forum was organized and held in Moscow, in the framework of which a conversation took place among representatives of various schools about the future development of religion in the country.  Currently, more and more people of different nationalities are showing interest in Buddhism, which led to the fact that the construction of a Buddhist temple in Moscow has begun, which will unite all schools under one roof. </p><h2>  The value of the erection of the complex </h2><p>  Apparently, the concepts of Buddhism are becoming close to many Russians, since the number of people who have adopted this religion is constantly growing.  The need for a real sanctuary, which can accommodate several hundred people at once, arose long ago. </p><p>  The construction of a <span>Buddhist temple</span> in Moscow is a symbol of the fact that representatives of different directions of this religion have no contradictions with each other, they can conduct rituals under the roof of a single building for all.  This complex can be visited by anyone who wants to learn more about this religion.  It is planned to conduct seminars, lectures, exhibitions and training in basic practices. </p><p>  The main goal of the temple complex will be to strengthen spiritual ties between people in the framework of cooperation between different Buddhist schools. </p><h2>  Property location </h2><p>  Temples of the main religions of Russia were erected in the Otradnoye district.  There is an Orthodox church, a <span>Muslim mosque, a</span> synagogue, and now it is planned to erect the first Buddhist temple in Moscow.  In fact, this will be a real complex, which, unfortunately, was opposed by some representatives of Orthodox communities.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãuniting all four official religions of Russia in one church district is an indicator that, regardless of faiths, people should respect each other's religions and coexist in a single space. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The first Buddhist temple in Moscow (address: Novovladykinsky passage, vl. 15) will become a symbol of the unification of believers from all over the country, even where there are only its small communities.  For them, the presence of a temple complex, in which you can make a pilgrimage to conduct spiritual practices with representatives of different schools, is a confirmation of the recognition of this religion at the national level. </p><p>  His Holiness the Dalai Lama blessed the construction, praising the appearance of the temple in a region where there is no Buddhism.  He gave the future complex the name "Tubden Shedubling", noting that it should become a center that spread the teachings of the Buddha. </p><h2>  Temple Complex: Main Temple </h2><p>  Conceived as an educational and <span>cultural center, the</span> Buddhist temple in Moscow (the photo below demonstrates this) consists of several buildings combined into a single composition. </p><p>  The total construction area is 2875 m2, of which 1186 m2 will be occupied by the complex itself, which will include: </p><ul><li>  a cult room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã600 m <sup>2</sup> ; </li><li>  conference room - about 300 m <sup>2</sup> ; </li><li>  medical building - 334 m <sup>2</sup> ; </li><li>  the library will occupy 222 m <sup>2</sup> ; </li><li>  charity canteen - more than 470 m <sup>2</sup> . </li></ul>
