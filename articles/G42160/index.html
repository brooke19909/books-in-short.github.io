    <h2>  Who is this device aimed at? </h2><p>  The Lenovo company is strictly segmenting its products in the mobile device market.  Series A are budget smartphones with modest settings and a very affordable price.  The devices of the S series are positioned as high-performance and expensive gadgets.  Well, the P line has an increased battery capacity and a very long battery life.  It is to the last group of mobile devices that <span>Lenovo P90</span> Pro belongs.  Reviews in addition to the increased battery capacity highlight another number of important advantages of this particular phone model.  This is an improved hardware platform with an increased level of speed, and a large number of both RAM, and the capacity of the built-in storage of programs and data, and a very high-quality camera.

    <h2>  Appearance.  Smartphone Usability </h2><p>  This mobile device is already manufactured in the usual design - monoblock.  In this case, the input / output functions are assigned to the touch screen, whose diagonal is 5 and a half inches.  A familiar mobile gadget control system is displayed under the display.  Its important feature is the backlight, which is absent in most budget models of this manufacturer.  It can be said that the Lenovo engineers in this case carried out very, very serious work on the errors.  A small circle of the front camera is displayed above the screen from the opposite side.  There is also a conversational speaker with a whole set of sensory elements.  An indisputable advantage from the position of ergonomics and usability of the gadget is the conclusion of all control buttons to the right side of the smart phone.  There are three of them in this case: one to turn on the device and two buttons that provide volume control.  An audio port is displayed on the upper side.  From the opposite edge is another wired interface - MicroUSB.  On the left side of the smartphone is just a slot for installing a mobile operator‚Äôs card.  The manufacturer‚Äôs logo is applied to the back cover.  There is also a loud speaker, a round hole in the main camera and its backlight system from a single LED.  There are three color options in this case: white, red and black.  The most practical of these is the Lenovo P90 Pro Black.  Reviews indicate that in this case, scratches, dust and dirt, which, although by accident, do appear, are not so noticeable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  A very productive semiconductor chip is the basis of such a device as the Lenovo P90 Pro smartphone.  The reviews of experts and owners are primarily allocated by the manufacturer of this silicon solution - Intel.  In the server and desktop segment, it has no equal.  But in the composition of mobile phones, its products are not so often found.  But this does not mean that it is bad.  The Android OS has long been successfully optimized for x86 processors.  So there is nothing to worry about.  The specific CPU model in this case is the Atom Z3560.  Its frequency potential is limited to 1.86 GHz.  It consists of 4 x86 cores at once, and it can process exactly the same amount of program threads.  The chip itself is produced according to a manufacturing process with tolerances of 22 nm, and its level 3 cache is 2 MB.  The maximum temperature that is acceptable for a CPU semiconductor crystal is 90 <sup>0</sup> . From all the above characteristics, we can conclude: this processor will be difficult to compete with the most efficient processors based on AWP architecture (for example, Snapdragon 8xx series), but as a part of average gadgets level it will just look great.  Its computing capabilities in this case will be more than enough for comfortable work and solving most typical tasks. </p><h2>  The graphics component of the central processor </h2><p>  There is also a graphics accelerator in the Lenovo P90 Pro.  Reviews, a description of its technical specifications indicate that this is a mid-range solution.  His model is Power VR6.  The clock frequencies of this semiconductor solution range from 457 to 533 MHz.  This product is able to cope with the tasks of the middle level.  But to complete the most demanding three-dimensional toys, it will not be enough. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Device screen.  Its technical parameters.  Pros and cons </h2><p>  At the same time, both high-quality and large screen are used in this gadget.  According to this parameter, the Lenovo P90 Pro 64Gb smartphone is out of competition against the background of similar mobile devices.  Reviews also highlight very large viewing angles, which are as close to the cherished 180 degrees.  The screen size of this phablet is 5.5 inches.  Its resolution is 1080p, the density of dots is about 400 ppi.  The matrix that underlies this component of this mobile gadget is manufactured using the most common technology for such devices today - IPS.  The image quality in this case is excellent and does not have any significant drawbacks.  The only negative in this case is the inability to control the device with just one hand.  But this is a drawback not only of one separately taken mobile device, but of a whole class of devices called phablets.  In any case, they have a large diagonal of the display, and one-handed operation simply will not work. </p><h2>  Integrated Memory Subsystem Parameters </h2><p>  One of the key advantages compared to competitors is the amount of RAM in the Lenovo P90 Pro - 4Gb RAM.  The reviews, however, indicate that after the launch of the system software, the majority (about 3 GB) remains free and the owner of the mobile device can use it at his discretion.  Type of RAM - LP DDR3 with an operating frequency of 1600 MHz.  Of course, against the background of modern PCs already equipped with DDR4, this characteristic looks rather modest, but most mobile gadgets are still based on this outdated form of RAM, and it still continues to be relevant in this niche. </p><p>  The capacity of the built-in drive for storing information and installing application software is 64 GB (this can be found out easily and simply from the name of the smartphone model).  Some of them are initially filled with pre-installed software, but most of them are allotted to the needs of the gadget owner.  There is simply no slot for an additional external memory card.  As a result, you have to be content with exactly what is already there.  In extreme cases, you can resort to cloud services and store the most valuable files there.  For example, Google Drive allows you to get free 15 GB for these purposes, and this is more than enough for the average average user of a mobile gadget. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Very high-quality and detailed images allows you to take the main camera, which is equipped with a smartphone Lenovo P90 Pro.  Reviews really highlight this important feature of this device.  She has a 13 megapixel sensor.  There is also a backlight system and autofocus.  There is also the ability to record video.  Its resolution is 1080 p.  The quality of the videos is excellent and also does not cause any complaints.  There is also a second camera in the Lenovo P90 Pro.  Reviews, photos and videos in this case are completely and completely similar to those for the main camera of this device.  Their quality is excellent and certainly does not cause complaints.  It is also great for selfies and video calls, because it has a 5 megapixel sensor, and this is quite enough to solve such problems. </p><h2>  Autonomy and battery </h2><p>  Of course, the strong point is the increased battery capacity in the Lenovo P90 Pro 64Gb.  Reviews, in turn, give off increased battery life of the device due to this.  Its capacity is 4000 mAh.  One of its charge is enough for 2 days of the most intensive use of the gadget.  If the load is reduced to an average level, then you can already count on 3-4 days.  Well, in the most severe battery saving mode, you can get 5 days.  Be that as it may, but now this value for a mid-range smartphone can even be called outstanding.  Specifically due to the increased battery capacity, this device by the degree of autonomy leaves far behind any of the possible competitors.  If the duration of the phone‚Äôs work on one charge of the battery comes to the fore, then one of the best offers in the niche of mid-level gadgets is precisely the hero of this review. </p>

    <h2>  List of interfaces </h2><p>  Many relevant ways of transmitting information are implemented in Lenovo P90 Pro, reviews, the characteristics of which are presented in the article.  The opinions of most experts in the niche of mobile devices in this case agree on one thing: this device is equipped with a complete list of all relevant transmitters.  It includes the following: </p><ul><li><p>  All types of GSM networks are supported.  This is 2G (in this case, information can be transmitted using GPRS and EDGE technologies).  The speed in this case can reach 500 Kbps.  This is 3G.  In this case, the speed increases significantly and can, with a favorable set of circumstances, reach 50 Mbit / s or more.  This is LTE / 4G.  In this case, you can even count on 150 Mbps. </p></li><li><p>  Another important way to share information with the global web is through Wi-Fi.  Of course, this device can not boast of support for the most advanced version of Wi-Fi - ac, but it has not yet received widespread distribution.  All other modifications of this wireless interface perfectly support this gadget. </p></li><li><p>  A nice addition to the two previous wireless methods of receiving data is Bluetooth.  It is perfect for both outputting an audio signal to a wireless stereo headset, and for transferring a small amount of data to similar mobile gadgets. </p></li><li><p>  Another important wireless interface is GPS.  It is great for turning a smartphone into a full-fledged navigation device. </p></li><li><p>  Two important functions are assigned to the MicroUSB port.  The first one is charging the battery.  And the second is connecting to a PC. </p></li><li><p>  Another relevant wired interface is a 3.5 mm audio port.  It allows you to organize the output of an audio signal to headphones or speakers. </p></li></ul>

    <h2>  System software </h2><p>  The most advanced and currently most widely used platform for Android mobile devices in Lenovo P90 Pro 4 64Gb is the system software.  The reviews highlight a significant drawback in the system software - its far from the latest version of KitKat, or in the digital designation 4.4. </p><p>  Also, this manufacturer rarely releases system software updates for their devices.  As a result, the owners of this mobile gadget will have to be content with exactly what has already been installed, and any innovations in this regard for this product are certainly not expected in the near future or in the distant future. </p><p>  Like all other devices of this Chinese manufacturer, this device is equipped with the proprietary Lenovo Laucher add-on.  This component changes the OS interface and makes it, according to the manufacturer, more convenient for the end user.  If necessary, it can be replaced with a similar third-party product. </p><h2>  User Reviews for This Gadget </h2><p>  Technical parameters favorably distinguish among analogues Lenovo P90 Pro.  Owner reviews in this regard allocate a processor, a memory subsystem and a graphics accelerator along with a display.  All this is harmoniously complemented by low cost.  The result is really one of the best deals in this segment of the mobile device market.  Well, the cons in this case fade into the background and no longer play such a significant role. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Against the background of direct competitors, a very serious plus is the cost of the Lenovo P90 Pro 64Gb.  Feedback from both analysts and potential buyers indicates that 15,000 rubles is a very modest price tag for a gadget of this level.  Of course, there are certain drawbacks to this device, but they are all offset by a number of significant advantages, which are complemented by a relatively low price. </p>
