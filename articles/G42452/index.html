Despite the external attractiveness of the institution, reviews about it are quite contradictory.  Among the guests there are those who remain satisfied with the service, and those who note the shortcomings of the establishment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tonkosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interiors" class="if uuid-2953253" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2953253.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews, the hotel "Fidan" in Sochi has a very favorable location.  It is a few steps from Kurortny Prospekt.  Nearby are numerous cafes and shops.  The beach from the Fidan Hotel in Sochi can be reached in minutes, which is very convenient.  All the most interesting places of the city are also located close to the hotel.  All facilities are within walking distance. </p><p>  A significant disadvantage of the institution is the lack of parking.  Although the hotel administration writes that it is.  But in fact, about 4-5 cars are located near the establishment.  On the opposite side of the street, unfortunately, you can‚Äôt leave transport, because tow trucks work.  Therefore, if you arrived in Sochi in your own car and decided to stay at the Fidan Hotel, you simply may not have enough parking space. </p><p>  When booking directly through the hotel‚Äôs website, according to tourists, problems often arise.  Upon arrival, you may be offered other apartments temporarily for accommodation, not the ones you booked.  Such unpleasant surprises can spoil the mood of any tourist.  Therefore, travelers recommend calling up the administration in advance and clarifying all the nuances.  Perhaps this will avoid disappointment.  Most likely flaws in the reservation are associated with the fuzzy work of the staff, which the institution must be addressed. </p><h2>  Reviews about the number of rooms </h2><p>  The Fidan Hotel is located in Sochi at 22A Nagornaya Street.  As already mentioned, the number of rooms is quite small.  In total, the hotel has 15 rooms.  According to guest reviews, all of them are designed in bright colors.  The interiors of the rooms are impressive, but, unfortunately, traces of scuffs are noticeable.  They are not so significant and do not spoil the overall impression.  Some apartments have plumbing failures and other shortcomings.  The rooms are fully equipped and comfortable to stay.  They have everything that tourists need. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.riviera-sochi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mini-hotel &quot;Fidan&quot;" class="if uuid-2953248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2953248.jpg"></div><p>  Guests note the quality cleaning of the apartments, which is carried out daily.  Staff also regularly change towels.  Minibar water is provided once upon arrival.  Her stocks are not replenished anymore. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  What are the food reviews at the Fidan Hotel (Sochi)?  The price of the hotel includes breakfast served in the form of a buffet in a cafe.  According to guest reviews, food is not very diverse.  For breakfast, visitors are offered the usual set: cheesecakes, sandwiches, sausages, cheese, omelettes, pancakes, mashed potatoes.  The cost is cheaper if purchased at the time of booking. </p><p>  According to vacationers, you can completely do without a morning meal.  Poor breakfasts are not very tasty and do not differ in variety.  As for food on the menu, visitors are satisfied with its quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tonkosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Restaurant Bar" class="if uuid-2953255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2953255.jpg"></div><p>  Near the hotel there are various cafes where you can always have a tasty meal. </p><p>  According to guest reviews, the hotel makes a good impression.  The institution has its advantages and minor flaws in the service.  Since the hotel is located in a good location, it is very convenient not only for business trips, but also for relaxation. </p><p>  The beach is a 10-minute walk away, so there is no need to take long walks.  The hotel staff also organizes sightseeing trips in the region. </p><h2>  When to visit Sochi? </h2><p>  When is the best time to go on vacation to this beautiful city?  It all depends on the purpose of visiting the resort.  If you are planning a beach holiday, then you should go in July, August or September.  In the middle and at the end of summer, the largest number of tourists accumulate on the coast.  But during this period the best weather conditions for a beach holiday are observed. </p><p>  Summer in Sochi pleases with stable weather and ample opportunities for travel.  The warmest weather in Sochi in August, the air temperature at this time reaches +30 degrees.  And the water warms up to +27.  In August, the sea is the warmest during the entire swimming season.  It is for this reason that there are an incredible amount of people at the resort at this time.  Tourists with small children come here to experience all the delights of a beach holiday. </p><p>  Summer weather in Sochi can be called ideal.  The sea of ‚Äã‚Äãsun and heat is what you need for relaxation.  In September, the weather is not so hot, but suitable for swimming in the sea and excursions. </p><p>  Since the resort is located in the region of the subtropical climate, in autumn the temperature is set here from +14 to +16 degrees in the daytime.  At night, it drops to +5 - +7 degrees.  Compared to other regions of Russia, it is very warm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avia.tutu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Sochi" class="if uuid-2953259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2953259.jpg"></div><p>  Many tourists come to Sochi in the fall for sightseeing.  At this time, vacation prices are much lower than in summer.  If September and October are pleased with stable weather, then in November it becomes moody.  Not all days are pleasing with the sun, very often it drizzles with rain, which is accompanied by strong gusts of wind.  Going to the resort at the end of summer, you should have a set of warm clothes with you.  Due to the proximity of the sea in the city there is a high humidity. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Sochi is a year-round resort, which is of interest not only to beach vacations, but also to numerous attractions and entertainment.  One of the hotels where you can stay while relaxing in the city can be the Fidan Hotel.  A small complex in the center of the resort has a convenient location and nice rooms.  Reviews of tourists allow you to characterize the institution from the best side.  Of course, the hotel has some shortcomings related to the quality of service, but they are not so significant as to spoil a pleasant impression. </p>
