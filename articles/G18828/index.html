  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The capture of Ishmael</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The victorious end of the <span>Russo-Turkish war of</span> 1768-74.  access to the Black Sea coast brought the power to Russia, although according to the terms of the Kuchuk-Karnadzhi treaty, the Izmail fortress, located in the Danube estuary, remained Turkish.  Later, Turkey, supported by France and England, demanded a revision of the treaty, making demands for the return of the Crimea and the Caucasus, and also demanded that all agreements be invalidated. </p><p>  The Turks planned to defeat Sevastopol with the naval base of the Russian fleet, land a large landing in the Crimea and capture Kherson and Kinburn.  To launch such a large-scale military operation, the plans of the Turkish command also included landing in Anapa and Sukhumi.  At that time, Turkey had a strong, well-trained 200,000-strong army, and also had a powerful fleet consisting of <span>battleships,</span> frigates, corvettes, and a large number of supply ships and support ships. </p><p>  In contrast, Russia put forward two armies: the Yekaterinoslav and Ukrainian, as well as the Black Sea flotilla.  Assistant to Russia in this war was Austria.  The plan consisted of an invasion of Turkish territory and was offensive.  The troops planned to capture Khotin, Ochakov, cross the Dnieper, clear the area between the Prut and the Dniester from the Turks. </p><p>  After successful hostilities there were all prerequisites for ending the war and signing a peace beneficial for Russia, but politicians missed the opportunity.  The Turks gathered new troops, enlisted the support of Western countries, as a result of which the war dragged on. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Anshef General <span>Suvorov A.V.,</span> participating in the Russian-Turkish war of 1787-92, carried out a siege, assault and capture of the fortress of Izmail in 1790.  The defeat of the Turkish fleet in the Kerch Strait, the strong dominance of the Russian flotilla in the Black Sea and the offensive on the Danube made it possible to plan an attack on the Turkish fortress Izmail on the left bank, and in the future it was decided to transfer military operations beyond the Danube. </p><p>  Commander-in-Chief of the Southern <span>Army Field Marshal</span> G. Potemkin  ordered an assault on this fortress.  This task could not be solved by <span>well-known commanders,</span> Ishmael did not succumb to Potemkin himself.  After futile attempts, the operation was assigned to Suvorov.  By this time, the <span>impregnable fortress</span> was rebuilt and prepared for new attacks with the latest technology of those times.  It was believed that the capture of Ishmael is impossible. </p><p>  Previously, Alexander Vasilievich approached the commandant of the fortress with a proposal to surrender, to which Pasha refused.  The commander began serious preparations for the assault and was counting on the capture of Ishmael.  Military exercises were conducted on the models of the high walls of the fortress.  The soldiers trained for 6 days on dug and built wooden and earthen analogues of walls and ditches.  They were thrown by the fascist, quickly installed stairs to climb the walls, fixed scarecrows, imitating the enemy, chopped and pricked. </p><p>  General preparations were made for the capture of Ishmael, which was directly inspected by Suvorov himself.  An experienced commander was pleased with the teachings, realizing that a real assault would be extremely difficult and serious.  Even it was difficult for him to foresee all the situations that, undoubtedly, could arise during the battle. </p><p>  The invincible citadel was a grandiose building.  Despite this, as well as the determination of the enemy, the assault and capture of the fortress of Izmail took place in just one day.  The Turks suffered significant losses compared with the Russians, although their number was ten times greater.  Many military men became famous during this operation and subsequently won numerous victories. </p><p>  Contemporaries of that time were shocked at how the capture of Ishmael took place, and this assault was forever imprinted in history.  Thanks to the outcome of this battle, the Russians gained possession on the Black Sea coast, extending from the Dniester to the Kuban, after taking Ishmael. </p>
