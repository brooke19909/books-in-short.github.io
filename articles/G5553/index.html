    <p>  The city has changed its name repeatedly.  During the settlement of the city by the Thracians, in the first millennium BC, it was called Eumolpiad.  After the city was conquered by the king of Macedonia in 342 BC.  e., received the name Philippopol.  During the reign of the Roman Empire, the city reached its highest peak, while changing its name to Trimontius, which means "a city on three hills." </p><p>  Then there was Pyldin, when the Slavs came to these places and the city became part of the First <span>Bulgarian Kingdom.</span>  Captured by the Ottomans in 1364, the city again changes its name and becomes Filipe. </p>

    <p>  In the 15th century, the first mention of a city called Plovdiv appeared.  When Bulgaria was freed from the Turks in 1885 with the help of Russian troops, Plovdiv became a part of it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Walking around the city </h2><p>  Great pleasure can be obtained from a walk in this amazing city.  Most of the narrow streets are closed to traffic.  Plovdiv is a city in which modernity and unique architectural monuments of antiquity and the Middle Ages are harmoniously combined.  Here, in beautiful historical buildings, there are cozy cafes and restaurants, many souvenir and antique shops. </p>

    <p>  Old Plovdiv, being the historical center, is certainly the richest in sights.  Not one day, full of excursion programs, will have to be spent to see all the objects.  Here you can see medieval wooden buildings, and the ruins of stone Ottoman mosques, and Thracian fortifications, and the ancient gates of Hisar Kapiya, and the ruins of the Roman Forum. </p><h2>  Roman heritage </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the <span>Roman Empire</span> sank into oblivion many centuries ago, evidence of its former greatness is found throughout Europe today.  Bulgaria was no exception.  Plovdiv, thanks to a wonderful combination of circumstances, introduced the world to a unique ancient building - the Roman Amphitheater. </p>

    <p>  The grandiose structure, designed for 3,000 spectators, built more than 2,000 years ago by order of the <span>emperor Troyan,</span> was discovered by chance.  This happened in 1972 during the landslide that covered Old Plovdiv.  After a complete restoration, the Amphitheater became available for visits.  Decorated with arcades and statues, the Amphitheater today, as before, hosts concerts and performances. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the center of Plovdiv, surrounded by architectural monuments of various eras, is the Roman stadium.  The period of its construction falls on the second century AD. </p><h2>  Religious sites </h2><p>  I would especially like to note the church of St. Helena and Constantine.  The first church in this place appeared in 337, on the site of the execution of the martyrs Severian and Memnos, professing the Christian faith.  It was named after Emperor Constantine the Great and his mother.  In this church, despite numerous destruction, it was possible to preserve priceless artifacts.  Today, you can see old icons, frescoes and unusual beauty handmade finishes. </p><p>  Since Ottoman rule, mosques have been preserved in Plovdiv.  The largest and most interesting is the Jumai Mosque.  This mosque, built in the mid- <span>14th century,</span> has one distinctive feature.  Unlike others, nine small domes crown its vault. </p><p>  When visiting the Church of the Holy Resurrection, built in 1578, special attention should be paid to the 18th century iconostasis.  For the first time in the history of the Bulgarian Renaissance, it depicted secular subjects along with spiritual ones. </p><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  It is impossible to put together a complete picture of the city without visiting museums and exhibitions.  The most visited is the Historical Museum of Plovdiv.  It exhibits priceless exhibits: </p><ul><li>  historical documents; </li><li>  archaeological finds; </li><li>  works of art. </li></ul><p>  The collection has more than 60 thousand exhibits. </p><p>  The no less interesting Archaeological Museum presents more than 100 thousand exhibits.  Walking through the picturesque park area, you can also see the numerous monuments of Plovdiv. </p><p>  The exhibition of the Bulgarian Renaissance located in the old house of Dimitar Georgiadi will help to find out many interesting facts about the life of the city from the 14th to the 19th centuries. </p>

    <p>  Art lovers will appreciate the State Gallery of Fine Arts.  It is housed in a 19th-century building, which in itself is of great archaeological value.  The gallery presents the works of the most famous Bulgarian painters, as well as various thematic exhibitions and events. </p><h2>  Best restaurants </h2><p>  Traditional <span>Bulgarian cuisine is based</span> on dairy products and meat, which is due to a long tradition of cattle breeding.  Rich meat soups, soured milk soups, spicy sausages and sausages, dried ham - all this can be tasted in almost any restaurant in Plovdiv. </p><p>  The tavern "Nineteenth Century" specializes in traditional Bulgarian cuisine.  A tavern was designed for an old Bulgarian house with guns and photographs on the walls.  The signature dish of this establishment is Manastiri Keremida (a mixture of mushrooms, intestines and tongue baked under cheese). </p><p>  For lovers of Russian cuisine it will be interesting to visit the restaurant "Peter the Great".  Everything is decorated with Russian color here. </p><p>  For several years in a row, Puldin has been considered the best restaurant in Plovdiv.  It serves exclusively delicacies such as foie gras or plum rabbit. </p><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  There are really many hotels in Plovdiv, which allows you to choose a place to stay for every taste and budget.  One of the most stylish is Novotel Plovdiv.  The modern hotel offers rooms equipped with appliances and decorated in different colors.  The hotel also has a huge indoor pool, a children's playground, conference rooms and restaurants. </p><p>  The most refined is considered the hotel-restaurant Hebros Hotel, which is located in the very center of Plovdiv.  It occupies an old building in the Renaissance style, built more than 200 years ago.  The chic wooden interior, antique furniture, works of art, its own wine cellar and restaurant serving national cuisine will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  The Ramada Plovdiv Trimontium is conveniently located.  It is in close proximity to the Roman Amphitheater and other attractions of Plovdiv.  Spacious rooms in the style of national comfort (antique furniture), as well as a restaurant of national cuisine and a courtyard with a swimming pool - all that is needed after a busy day of sightseeing. </p><h2>  Bulgaria today </h2><p>  The mild climate, picturesque landscapes, unique historical sights make Bulgaria a popular holiday destination.  The best time to travel is from May to September.  The weather in Plovdiv, as well as throughout the southern part of Bulgaria, at this time favors a good pastime. </p>
