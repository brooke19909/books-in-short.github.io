We have to find out what it is.  In addition, it is worth looking at the ways in which you can connect this opportunity.  After all, it is the process of starting to use a function that, as a rule, brings a lot of problems.  If they are solved, then each client will be satisfied with the result.  Let's get down to our topic today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="option zero on mts" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/870925.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  What is it? </h2><p>  The option ‚ÄúZero on MTS‚Äù, reviews of which we will learn a little later, is what attracts many modern customers.  Why?  Let's understand this issue. </p><p>  The thing is that now many prefer to communicate.  A lot and regardless of the location of the client.  That is, in roaming, I also want to communicate on favorable terms.  And all MTS clients have this opportunity.  After all, ‚ÄúZero Without Borders‚Äù is just what we need.  For only 60 rubles per month, you can talk within roaming for 10 minutes for free, and then - 25 rubles per minute.  This is a very good offer. </p><p>  The option "Zero on MTS" receives mostly positive reviews.  After all, 6 rubles of a monthly fee is not so much.  Especially when you calculate how much benefit you get.  The quality of communication with this option is also pleasing.  There are practically no failures.  Therefore, let's try to figure out how to connect the option ‚ÄúZero to MTS‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Personal visit </h2><p>  The first scenario, of course, is familiar to everyone.  After all, we are talking about using the offices of a mobile operator.  They are available in every city.  Take your mobile phone with you, as well as your passport (just in case), and then go to the nearest MTS cellular office. </p><p>  There, inform the employee about your intentions to connect yourself an additional option.  They should ask for your passport (without ID, few will agree to connect something to the number), and then verify your rights to the number.  If the owner is not you, then you will have to call the one with whom the SIM card is framed.  In cases where the number is issued for you, you can transfer your mobile phone to an office worker.  He will quickly carry out all the necessary manipulations.  That's all.  The option "Zero on MTS" is connected. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="option zero on pay reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/870926.jpg"></div>

    <p>  True, it is worth noting one important fact - you should have enough money on your phone to make a connection.  As already mentioned, this is 60 rubles.  The advantage of a personal visit is that you can always quickly replenish the balance of a mobile phone without a commission.  But in general, as a rule, customers try to look for other options that help to disable the "Zero on MTS" option and connect any other functions.  What else can be done?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Inquiries </h2><p>  The option "Zero on MTS" can be connected using special requests dialed on your mobile phone.  They are called USSD commands.  And every mobile operator has them. </p><p>  In order to attach an additional function to your number, just dial a combination and then press the subscriber call button.  Next, you will be sent a request with subsequent processing.  Now just wait for the SMS-notification about the successful connection of the option.  And all the problems are solved. </p><p>  But which team do we need?  Just dial * 111 * 4444 #.  That's all.  No problem.  The main thing is to have at least 60 rubles on the balance of the mobile phone.  Otherwise, you will receive an alert in which it will be written about the insufficient amount of money in the account to activate a new function.  But even this is far from all approaches that can only be implemented.  What else suits us?  Let's try to answer this question. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disable the zero option on mts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/870927.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <h2>  Help messages </h2><p>  Well, if you don‚Äôt really like the prospect of using USSD commands to connect, you can always use such a thing as messages.  They can help not only contact the client, but also realize some opportunities.  And now we will deal with you in this approach. </p><p>  Just compose a message with the text "33", and then send it to the MTS short number.  In our case, this is 111. After that, just wait for the notification about the successful start of using the service.  Typically, the process takes about 10 minutes.  Otherwise, you will have to check the balance of the mobile phone (there should be enough money to connect), as well as call the operator and find out about the status of your request. </p><p>  This method has one significant drawback - a long processing team.  Plus, the slightest network failure can leave you without an option.  Not the best prospect, right?  And for this reason, we will try to figure out with you other methods that are suitable for connecting new features.  After all, they are still there.  And some of them will greatly please modern customers.  They will not have to leave the house once again and think about the long processing of the request.  Let‚Äôs sort this out as soon as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="connect option zero to mts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/870928.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Call operator </h2><p>  The MTS Super Zero option, like many others, can be connected using operator calls.  As a rule, this scenario helps many clients.  And for this reason, it is worth understanding this method. </p><p>  Just dial 0890 and then wait for the operator to respond.  Now tell him of your intentions to connect a new feature.  Next, they will require passport data from you - this will establish the identity and rights to the SIM card used.  After this point is completed, you can wait for the results.  Name the desired option and wait for the result.  As a rule, after a conversation within 5 minutes you will receive a notification about the successful processing of the operation and the connection of the option.  As you can see, nothing is difficult. </p><p>  Only this method has one minus - a huge chance of getting on an answering machine.  Then you have to wait about 15-20 minutes before you connect the opportunity you need.  Therefore, we move on to another scenario. </p><h2>  The World Wide Web </h2><p>  So, the last method that pleases many customers is to use the Internet and the official website in order to connect the desired options.  To do this, you will have to go to the MTS official website and go through authorization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="option super zero pay" class="if" height="253" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/870929.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Now you will find yourself in your personal account, where you have to select ‚ÄúServices‚Äù, and after that - find ‚ÄúOption‚Äù Zero on MTS. If you click on this line, you will see a list of possible actions. Click on ‚ÄúConnect.‚Äù Everything - you can wait The main thing is to have enough money, otherwise you will receive an SMS requesting to replenish the balance first, and then try to connect again. </p>
