    <h2>  Kavros Beach Resort 3 *: traveler reviews </h2><p>  In order for you to have a more complete and clear picture of the Cretan hotel Kavros Beach, we bring to your attention the generalized comments of our compatriots who spent their holidays here.  I must say the following.  As in the cases with other hotels, there are people who are satisfied with their choice and those who did not like the hotel very much.  However, we offer to understand everything in more detail. </p><p>  As for the hotel itself and its territory, then most Russians here have no complaints.  So, our compatriots appreciated the small pretty buildings and bungalows of the hotel complex, picturesquely scattered across the green territory.  Despite the fact that it was far from walking from some rooms to the restaurant and the beach, this did not bother the tourists, because along the way they had the opportunity to admire the azure sea and beautiful exotic plantings.  The rooms Kavros Beach 3 * also mostly liked our compatriots.  So, tourists note that although they are compact enough, it‚Äôs nice to be in them, and they are equipped with everything necessary.  The furniture here, although not new, is in good condition.  All equipment works without interruption.  If something breaks, then after contacting the reception, the wizard will quickly fix all the problems.  There were no particular complaints about cleaning.  So, according to travelers, the maids cleaned the rooms every day (except Sunday).  Linen and towels were changed 1-2 times a week. </p><p>  Traditionally, heated debates between tourists flared up on the issue of nutrition.  So, someone assures that the variety of menus and the quality of food here leaves much to be desired.  However, another part of our compatriots completely disagrees with this opinion, stating that the choice of dishes in a three-star hotel can in no way be as wide as in hotels of a higher level, and the quality of food in Kavros Beach is quite worthy.  In any case, it is absolutely impossible to stay hungry here.  In addition, tourists note the fact that the dishes are not seasoned with a large number of spices, so they can be safely given to children. </p><p>  As for animation, according to travelers, in Kavros Beach Resort 3 * (Crete, Greece) it is available only at the height of the holiday season.  Since September, the hotel has become quite quiet.  This time is recommended for people who want to spend a relaxing vacation on the beach.  If you want noisy entertainment and vivid impressions, then you can always go to neighboring villages and cities in which there are taverns, restaurants, bars, clubs, etc. </p><p>  Many tourists praised the location of the hotel.  So, they really liked the proximity to the hotel of supermarkets, shops, shops, excursion bureaus, car rental offices and establishments.  There is also a bus stop near the hotel, from where you can reach almost anywhere in Crete. </p><p>  In general, we can say that this hotel is fully consistent with its level of stardom and value.  Our compatriots recommend Kavros Beach Resort 3 * to people who want a comfortable and at the same time economically relax on the Greek island of Crete. </p>
