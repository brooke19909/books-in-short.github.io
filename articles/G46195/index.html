Protect it from shock, scratches and cracks allows the installation of protective shockproof glass. </p><h2>  What is it and what does it consist of? </h2><p>  Such an element is made of tempered glass that has undergone chemical treatment.  In thickness, it slightly exceeds the standard protective film.  According to the characteristics - significantly exceeds.  The market offers protective tempered shockproof glass with a thickness of 0.26 and 0.33 mm, and some even 0.5 mm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ar.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shockproof glass for samsung" class="if uuid-3197069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3197069.jpg"></div><p>  The hardness of the glass is 9 N, which is 2‚Äì3 times higher in comparison with different types of film.  Commercials often show how <span>tempered glass</span> protects the display from hammering.  It‚Äôs immediately clear that this is an exaggeration, but if you scratch the screen with a knife or a key, no trace will remain on the surface. </p><p>  For the most part, protective glass is distinguished by a five-layer structure, it consists of such materials: </p><ul><li>  a base made of silicone, which is responsible for fixing the element on the surface of the screen; </li><li>  a bonding layer that does not allow the screen to crumble into fragments in the event of an impact; </li><li>  anti-glare layer, responsible for the brightness of the display even in strong light; </li><li>  a protective coating that prevents damage to the screen; </li><li>  the lyophobic layer, which ensures a clean screen, repels moisture and prevents fingerprints and greasy fingers from remaining on the display. </li></ul><p>  From which we can conclude that the protective glass is not only an obstacle to mechanical damage, but also has a number of other useful functions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to choose it? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="screen365.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone protective film" class="if uuid-3197106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3197106.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing a shockproof tempered glass, you should pay attention to the following characteristics: </p><ol><li>  Price.  The cost of protective accessories varies greatly.  At the same time, you should not think that only expensive models have the best qualities.  But high-quality glasses can not cost about one dollar, the average price range varies from 10 to 30 $. </li><li>  Strength.  The vast majority of tempered glasses have a hardness parameter of 9 N. This indicator indicates the degree of impact that the material can withstand upon impact or for a short time.  If there is no corresponding marking on the product packaging, it is better to refuse the product. </li><li>  Glass or film.  It will be more difficult to determine.  It all depends on factors that are more important to the user.  For example, film gives less loss of screen sensitivity than glass, is easier to install and cheaper.  However, the second option has greater transparency and strength, anti-reflective coating, there are no prints left on it. </li><li>  The material of manufacture.  The coating protecting the screen is not always made of glass.  In some cases, it can be replaced by a special multilayer polymer.  If cracks form on the glass upon impact, then only scratches will remain on the polymer.  There are also differences in image transmission.  It's about bandwidth.  Glass very accurately and vividly conveys the picture, while artificial material makes it worse and dimmer. </li><li>  3D glass.  If the phone has rounded edges, then when selecting a hardened coating, you should first of all pay attention to the same rounding around the perimeter as the protection.  Some manufacturers produce glass with specially designed transparent glue, which allows you to hide irregularities along the surface if you purchased a completely flat part. </li></ol><h2>  Mocolo </h2><p>  The company produces a variety of glasses, their thickness on average ranges from 0.15 to 0.3 mm.  The last parameter is the most demanded.  However, if a screen with rounded edges is required for the screen, it is best to purchase 0.15 mm thick glass. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After installing the shockproof protective glass on the gadget, there will be no problems with displaying the picture even with side lighting, the clarity and brightness will remain the same, and the polarization will remain untouched.  Affordable users and affordable price - no more than five dollars.  The kit comes with glue.  It is worth noting that the defect rate of products is quite high, but in such cases the glass will be replaced with a new one for free. </p><h2>  Nillkin Amazing, Solomon </h2><p>  This Japanese manufacturer is considered one of the best in the world among those producing goods of this kind.  Shockproof glass is made of AGC material using a special technology.  As a result, it acquires high strength indicators.  Another distinguishing feature is ultra-high light transmission. </p><p>  A coating is made of tempered glass, the hardness of which is 9 N. It is coated with nano-optical ultrathin layers, due to which the surface reflects ultraviolet rays, repels greasy spots and other impurities.  Its thickness does not exceed 0.2 mm, and the edging is made in such a way that does not allow the edges to injure the hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vgood.ar.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shockproof safety glass" class="if uuid-3197058" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3197058.jpg"></div><h2>  Shockproof Glass for Iphone </h2><p>  Solomon is a company that has established itself among manufacturers of protective coatings.  The glass of this manufacturer has a thickness of 0.3 mm and is great for most iPhone models.  The strength of the coating is 9 N. The top layer is not subject to scratches, very nice tactile.  Gluing the coating is quite simple if you follow the instructions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ar.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shockproof tempered glass" class="if uuid-3197062" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3197062.jpg"></div><p>  Premium protective glass from DF is designed for iPhones starting from the 7th generation and older.  They are made of innovative aluminosilicate polymer, which increases the level of protection of the gadget by 25%.  Its surface is resistant to scratches and moisture.  The average cost of goods is $ 40. </p><p>  Protective shockproof glass Red Line is designed for iPhones 4, 7, 8 models with rounded 3D edges.  All products have a strength index of 9 N, which is why they can withstand various damages.  The glass thickness is 0.33 mm, due to which the sensitivity of the sensor is not limited and the clarity of the picture is maintained. </p><h2>  IQ Shield LiQuidSkin </h2><p>  This is the so-called smart film, it has an unusual wet installation method.  It effectively performs its protective functions and, according to manufacturers, is able to recover. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.coastsplendids.top" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="safety tempered safety glass" class="if uuid-3197090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3197090.jpg"></div><p>  Two pads are included in the package of delivery at once, so if the film could not be installed the first time, you can try again.  Since it is quite difficult to do it yourself, it is recommended that you first watch the video tutorial. </p><h2>  Ringke </h2><p>  This company produces excellent accessories for mobile devices.  However, one of the best products is the "invisible protector."  It is made of polyurethane with an additional reinforced film, and it can take the form of curved edges of the 3D display.

The kit includes a pair of protective pads, a sticker for cleaning dust, a scraper and instructions for use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shockproof glass for iphone" class="if uuid-3197075" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3197075.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, shockproof protection on mobile devices is relevant for users.  Customers who purchased protective films and glasses speak only positively of them.  They are satisfied with the quality of the transmitted image and the fact that it is easy to remove dirt from them.  The only thing users warn about is that it is advisable to install such coverage at service centers or specialized points of sale.  With independent manipulations of people, the quality obtained as a result was not always satisfied. </p>
