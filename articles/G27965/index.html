    <h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Danny Rolling was born in <span>Louisiana</span> in 1954.  His childhood was very difficult.  In the afternoon, his father put on a police uniform and served the law, and in the evening he returned home and brutally beat his wife and son.  After the birth of Kevin Rolling, the fury of his father began to spread to his younger brother Danny.  Mother was not able to change the situation in the family.  Several times she left her husband, but invariably returned to the home tyrant. </p><p>  Due to the lack of a normal family, Rolling was brought up by the street.  From an early age he was a regular at the local police station.  He was constantly arrested for hooliganism and petty robberies.  This led to the complete marginalization of the guy.  He could not adapt in society, constantly changing his place of work.  For a long time, Danny Rolling was a waiter in a small restaurant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The beginning of the bloody path </h2><p>  The first murder Danny committed in the eighty-ninth year.  The fact that the massacre, arranged in the house of the Grissom family, was the work of Rolling, the public found out only after his arrest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lethal injection" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1652413.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <p>  However, it was in quiet Shreveport that the crazy killer tasted the first blood.  Journalists were never able to find out if there was a significant connection between Rolling and Grissoms.  Investigators also concluded that Danny had committed a terrible crime, driven by an pathological thirst for murder. </p><h2>  The murders of the Grissom family </h2><p>  On the evening of November 4, William Grissom invited his daughter and her son to visit.  The grandson was only eight years old.  About three o'clock in the afternoon, Julie Griss took out a dinner from the oven, which she was never destined to try.  The family idyll ended when Dania Rolling appeared on the doorstep.  He brutally killed all three inhabitants.  It is not known whether they tried to resist.  Twenty-four-year-old Julie maniac mutilated and, according to some, raped.  After that, he washed the girl‚Äôs corpse and carefully laid it in a certain pose, dictated to him by an insane consciousness.  This massacre caused a real shock to the inhabitants of little Shreveport, where the usual murder caused mass hysteria. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gainsville ripper" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1652414.jpg" width="298"></div>

Enraged, the son tried to kill his parent, who spoiled his childhood.  This attempt also became known only after the arrest of Rolling. </p><h2>  Gainesville Ripper </h2><p>  And the killer went on.  In the nineties, Rolling arrived in Florida.  Intoxicated by impunity after the massacre at the Grissom house, he staged a real raid on the small town of Gainesville.  Rolling broke into other people's houses and robbed them in broad daylight.  At this moment, Danny felt like a master of life, controlling the fate of members of society unknown to him, avenging his rejection.  Over the course of several days, he killed five people.  All the victims were students. </p><p>  During the investigation, it became absolutely clear that Rolling's goal was precisely violence, not robbery.  Since the frightened victims did not try to prevent him from taking out their property.  He killed all five with extreme cruelty.  Some corpses were beheaded.  After the killings, Danny spent hours laying out bodies in certain poses, having previously washed them. </p><p>  After a series of terrible crimes, police began a large-scale investigation.  Initially, these killings were not associated with what happened in Shreveport.  And the investigation also did not have significant evidence.  Two suspects were arrested.  Then the hunt for Rolling began.  For some time, the Gainesville Ripper managed to hide in the woods. </p><h2>  Capture and trial </h2><p>  Danny Rolling was arrested in November ninety-first.  The trial lasted more than four years.  As a result, the killer himself confessed to all crimes.  At the same time, the investigation of the slaughter in the Grissom house was resumed.  Louisiana police drew attention to a similar handwriting of the killings.  And soon Danny admitted to them.  In conclusion, he wrote a book and several letters to the public.  In them, he shed light on his atrocities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="murders of the grissom family" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1652416.jpg" width="534"></div>

    <p>  Famous writer Sondra London visited Danny in prison when she collected material for her new novel. </p><p>  In 2006, Rolling was sentenced to death.  On October 25th, in full accordance with American law, he ate his last breakfast of shrimp and lobster.  After the criminal refused the last words, he was given a lethal injection.  This was the beginning of the practice of a new kind of execution. </p>
