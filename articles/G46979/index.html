At such prices for Hi-End equipment it is easier (and cheaper) to look at the top devices from the past.  Even from the Soviet past.  They are able to provide no less high-quality sound for a price several times lower.  An excellent apparatus of the times of the USSR is the amplifier "Corvette 100U-068S".  This device is capable of much.  We will consider its main technical characteristics and key features.  But first, a little history. </p><div class="photo" data-original="audioman.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="amplifier corvette 100u 068s" class="if uuid-2952733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2952733.jpg"></div><h2>  Amplifier Overview </h2><p>  "Corvette 100U-068S" is a complete <span>Soviet-</span> made <span>amplifier</span> .  It was created on the basis of the legendary "Brig", but using some modifications.  The result was a unique (at that time) device with a high power density and good appearance.  However, he was pleasing to the eye only in a new state.  A year later, his appearance became, to put it mildly, unpresentable.  At present, it is impossible to find a battered Corvette at a flea market.  At one time, this amplifier belonged to the category of the highest complexity.  This means that in theory it was supposed to provide unrealistically high-quality sound.  Many vintage lovers still believe this.  However, the Corvette 100U-068S amplifier does not compare with the same Brig.  Although made in his image and likeness.  But enough lyrics.  It's time to move on to a dry and boring language of numbers.  But first, consider the design and appearance of the top Soviet amplifier. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="vega-brz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="amplifier corvette 100u 068s electrical circuit" class="if uuid-2952737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2952737.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  The design of this amplifier is noticeably different from other Soviet devices of this class.  Those sparkled with aluminum and bright backlight colors.  But here all this is not.  The front panel is completely made of plastic.  Moreover, it is painted in some strange color.  The worst thing is that the paint is of poor quality.  After a year of active use, it simply wiped off in certain places and the amplifier looked like a shabby state employee.  The control panel contains buttons for switching the sound source, turning on loudness and other necessary options.  There are also many ‚Äútwirls‚Äù for adjusting the tone, timbre, treble and bass, volume and balance.  There are also toggle switches for switching various operating modes.  On the rear panel are the necessary connectors and eight terminals for connecting speakers.  There is also a connector for connecting the power cable.  In general, the appearance of the sound amplifier "Corvette 100U-68S" is interesting and a bit unsuccessful.  Now let's move on to the main technical characteristics of the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rw6ase.narod.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="amplifier circuit corvette 100u 068s" class="if uuid-2952734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2952734.jpg"></div><h2>  Main specifications of the amplifier </h2><p>  "Corvette Amplifier 100U-068C", the characteristics of which we will now analyze, refers to devices of high complexity.  And this means that his characteristics are advanced.  And indeed it is.  The range of reproduced frequencies starts at around 10 hertz, and ends at 70,000. This is the first sign of a Hi-End class device.  Now about power.  The rated constant power of the device with a speaker resistance of 6 ohms is 125 watts.  This is a lot.  Enough for a small concert hall.  Rated short-term (peak) power with the same resistance is 150 watts.  Great results.  Especially when you consider that these are "honest Watts" and not modern Chinese.  Power consumption is 275 watts.  And this is at the maximum load of the amplifier.  In idle mode, it consumes only 30 watts.  This miracle weighs almost 10 kilograms.  Its dimensions are also not modest.  But this is normal for devices that provide high-quality sound.  And now we will consider other features of the Corvette 100U-068S amplifier. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="schmhlpr.appspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sound amplifier corvette 100u 068s" class="if uuid-2952739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2952739.jpg"></div><h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  The most interesting is the sound quality of this device.  This amplifier according to the passport should provide excellent sound quality.  But is it really so?  To begin with, the sound of this device is slightly worse than that of the same "Brig".  Although the scheme used is almost the same.  It's all about improvements and upgrades to an already good design.  What are the problems of the Corvette 100U-068S amplifier?  The electrical circuit is soldered clumsily.  Hence the main problem.  A simple wire winding is also used, which also degrades the sound.  The power transformer is not made high enough, which leads to the appearance of background noise.  That is why this amplifier sounds noticeably worse than the "Brig".  But after appropriate refinement, it should sound as it should.  But not everyone has the experience to carry out such manipulations.  And what is this Hi-End device that you need to pick with a soldering iron in your hands after purchase?  But even without refinement, the sound is very high quality (if you do not compare it with the "Brig").  Therefore, it is not worth focusing on this point especially. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vega-brz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="amplifier corvette 100u 068s instruction" class="if uuid-2952738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2952738.jpg"></div><h2>  Acoustic selection for this amplifier </h2><p>  Not every <span>speaker system is</span> suitable for the Corvette 100U-068S amplifier <span>.</span>  We need such speakers so that the amplifier can swing them.  It works well with speakers such as Radio Engineering S-90.  They have suitable resistance and not particularly high power.  What you need for this amplifier.  Amphiton 50AC will also perform well.  They can produce a clear and balanced sound.  What a sophisticated listener needs.  It does not make sense to consider older columns, since very few have reached our time in decent form.  Also, do not take into account the <span>speaker systems</span> released in Russia after the restructuring.  At that time, I somehow forgot how to make high-quality acoustics.  Now consider the reviews of the happy owners of this amplifier. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.avito.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Corvette amplifier 100u 068s specifications" class="if uuid-2952735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2952735.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive feedback from owners </h2><p>  So, what can those who managed to get a live "Corvette 100U-068S" say?  The vast majority of owners are satisfied with their purchase.  Even despite the fact that <span>the amplifier circuit</span> "Corvette 100U-068C" worked quite clumsily.  With gentle home use, this amplifier produces a very high-quality sound and indescribably pleases the owners.  Some music lovers note that the best results are obtained when using it with Amphiton 50AC speakers, an external computer sound card (or a high-quality CD player) and music in some lossless format (FLAC, APE, WV, ALAC and so on) .  Well, quite possibly.  The happy owners of this device claim that nothing needs to be modified in the amplifier, as this will "kill the soulful analog sound."  We believe these enthusiasts a word. </p><h2>  Negative owner reviews </h2><p>  In previous comrades, those who leave negative reviews about this amplifier will not agree.  These citizens claim that the weakest point of the device is resistors and capacitors.  Say, they burn so that only you have time to change them.  True, they immediately declare that they used acoustics with a power of 200 watts together with the Corvette 100U-068S amplifier.  The instruction manual, of course, has long been lost, but we can safely say that this amplifier is physically unable to pull such a powerful speaker system.  Therefore, it burns.  Also negative reviews were awarded to the design of the device.  And here it‚Äôs hard to argue.  Indeed, all used Corvettes look worse than Chinese consumer goods.  But with this, alas, nothing can be done. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined the top-end sound amplifier "Corvette 100U-068C" originally from the USSR.  Despite its venerable age, this device is still capable of producing very high-quality sound.  And if you work a little with a soldering iron, then you can achieve a Hi-End sound.  But this is not necessary.  He is capable of much without modification.  Although it looks ugly. </p>
