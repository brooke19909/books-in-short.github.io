The history of diplomacy began at a time when the first human society was formed on the planet.  Since even the neighboring tribes had to agree among themselves.  Diplomacy as the dominant idea and the main quintessence of international relations took shape almost simultaneously with the emergence of ancient states. </p>

    <p>  The diplomacy of Ancient Egypt gave humanity a priceless and most famous monument of international relations, which for many centuries remained a model of foreign policy.  Such is considered the agreement of Ramses the Second with the Hittite King Hattushil the Third, dated 1278 BC.  This agreement has become a standard of <span>international law</span> for many ancient eastern kingdoms, as well as for the <span>states of the ancient world.</span> </p><p>  An indelible mark on the development of <span>international relations has been</span> left by the history of Russian diplomacy.  Due to the historically established greatness of the Power, as well as its special position in the structure of international relations and geopolitics, Russian diplomacy has had a serious impact on the entire course of world history.  In this regard, its fateful significance is simply impossible to overestimate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The author of the first Russian diplomatic strategy can rightfully be called Alexander Nevsky, who during the invasion of the Tatar-Mongol hordes did not become an armed resistance.  Since he was well aware that it was doomed to failure due to too much inequality of power and the fragmentation of Kievan Rus into specific principalities. </p><p>  Alexander Nevsky, with the wisdom of a visionary politician, chose the diplomatic path.  He managed to secure the support of the Horde Khan, which gave him the opportunity not only to maintain his princely power, but also to begin the unification of the Russian lands.  This was the first of many subsequent Russian triumphs that the history of diplomacy knew. </p><p>  True, the next brilliant victories had to wait long enough.  And only the coming to power of Peter the Great ushered in a new era in the development of the Russian state.  Then the history of diplomacy in Russia began the countdown of another era.  This ruler turned the country into a strong, economically developed Empire, which all of Europe began to reckon with.  Then Russian diplomatic missions opened in the leading countries of the world. </p><p>  The Russian history of diplomacy reached the next, qualitatively new level during the <span>reign of Alexander the First.</span>  Russia, as the victorious country of Napoleon, acquired the status of the most influential European power, and our emperor took the position of the central and key figure in the negotiations on the arrangement of post-war Europe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  During the reign of Alexander the Second, the post of head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs belonged to His Grace Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov.  His name is associated with the largest and most important achievements of Russian diplomacy.  Through various transformations, he managed to subordinate the country's foreign policy to the interests of its internal development.  This achievement is extremely difficult to overestimate.  Thanks to this great diplomat, the Russian Empire regained its positions that were lost as a result of the Crimean War.  He was able to regain the former prestige and influence of the Power. </p><p>  Largely thanks to the titanic work and skill of the diplomats, Bolshevik Russia managed to survive and be recognized.  The same applies to the events of the Second World War.  In particular, in the most difficult and tense time for the country, when the very fate of the Soviet state was hanging by a thread (1941-42), it was thanks to the efforts of domestic diplomacy that we managed to avoid an insidious blow to us in the back of Japan, a former ally of Hitler Germany and urged her to war against the USSR. </p><p>  Russia's current <span>foreign policy</span> is open, de-ideologized, pragmatic, flexible, multi-vector and balanced.  The essence of this approach is the desire to build equal partnerships with both the West and the East.  Russia does not seek to impose its will on other states, following the example of the United States, but, on the contrary, is trying to achieve peaceful and respectful diplomatic relations with all countries. </p>
