Everyone will name a lot of conditions based on their personal preferences and desires.  But when the heads of large and small settlements really care about relaxation for people, the result is excellent.  Since it is very important to have a place in the city where you want to return constantly. </p><h2>  Historical place </h2><p>  There is one wonderful corner in Belarus.  This <span>is Victory Park in</span> Minsk.  Sometimes it is difficult for the townspeople to get out of the city, into nature.  But Minskers were lucky.  Under their nose is a beautiful green massif with a lake. </p>

    <p>  And he is rather big - 200 hectares of land.  For comparison: the Kiev Victory park, which is located in the Dnieper region, covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã82 hectares.  National Botanical Garden - 117. Ukrainian Museum of Folk Architecture and Life "Pirogovo" - 133. </p><p>  Victory Park in Minsk opened its central entrance in 1945.  The most interesting thing is that at first it was planned to open it on Sunday, namely June 22, 1941.  As many as 18 months before this, young people worked to create <span>Komsomolskoe Lake.</span>  First, they blocked a piece of the local river Svisloch.  Then they put the territory in order.  And they tried very hard.  They worked with enthusiasm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Until the solemn moment remained exactly one day.  Everything was ready to the smallest detail.  And here is the war ... </p><h2>  A dream come true </h2><p>  Most of the girls' boys did not return from the front.  They did not see the opening of their park.  And therefore, in the 45th, none of the survivors had any other opinion about its name, except for Victory Park. </p><p>  For the period 2008-2011, it was reconstructed.  Updated <span>sports grounds.</span>  A pedestrian bridge was erected on Bird Island.  Strengthened the transition to Komsomolsky.  Rebuilt and rescue station.  The embankments began to look different.  Beautiful fountains were installed here.  A pleasure boat was launched on the lake.  And they worked on the beach.  One after another, a fort with a <span>water slide,</span> and a river beacon, numerous umbrellas, spacious cabins, as well as showers, arbors appeared. </p><p>  In 2013, the name was changed to "Museum and Park Complex" Victory "".  And last summer, innovation was again on its territory.  A new building was opened in which the museum of the history of the Great Patriotic War settled.  And now the park of the 50th anniversary of the Victory in Minsk is the most favorite place where veterans meet with pleasure.  Everything here reminds them of youth. </p>

    <h2>  Going to a lot of people </h2><p>  Today on weekends, and on weekdays too, you will see crowds of vacationers: ride a steamer on the lake, sail on catamarans or boats.  They cannot take their eyes off marvelous fountains.  Just like that, at a slow pace, wander along the quiet, fragrant alleys. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Parents with children love to visit Victory Park in Minsk.  Fortunately for the latter, you can rent toys, rollers, balls and swim in the lake. </p><p>  And cyclists do believe that the park was built specifically for them.  After all, who else drives on special tracks that stretch for three kilometers? </p><h2>  Its zest </h2><p>  Victory Park in Minsk would not have been so popular if it hadn‚Äôt had its ‚Äúchips‚Äù.  For example, the most magnificent fountains.  Perhaps this is his main decoration. </p><p>  And how do you like rickshaws on paths and alleys?  There are plenty of people wishing to drive in this way on the most environmentally friendly transport.  Two passengers, only 10 minutes, and memories - for years. </p><p>  You will never be hungry here.  There are kiosks and cafes on every corner.  Anything?  Wafers, chips, greases or sausages in the dough, barbecue?  Or do you prefer ice cream? </p>

Why are awnings of unusual shape pulled?  They do not close the sun well.  But they look like elephants.  Only for some reason on thin legs.  Just like the artist Dali!

In different corners of the green massif special arbors are built for 10 people.  They have a complete set of equipment for the preparation of barbecue, barbecue, and even a piece of land next to it is highlighted.

You can go through it from the street Orlovskaya. </p><h2>  Bird island </h2><p>  But this is a completely unique place.  You can get there, of course.  Only first you need to overcome a bridge 60 meters long.  And as if you are not in a two millionth city. </p><p>  In order to preserve the native flora and fauna of this small island, even the paths, the paths here are equipped in a special way.  No artificial materials! </p>
