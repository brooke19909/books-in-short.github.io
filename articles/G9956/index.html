  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Steel melting point</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Before talking about steels, let's determine the physical meaning of the category itself melting point.  In the scientific and industrial sphere, this concept is also used as the temperature of solidification.  The physical meaning of this category is that this temperature shows at what value it changes the <span>state of aggregation of a</span> substance, that is, its transition from a liquid to a solid state.  At the very point of the temperature transition, the substance can be in one or in another state.  When additional heat is supplied, the object or substance acquires a liquid state, and when heat is removed, it solidifies.  This indicator is considered one of the most important physical properties of any substance in the system, and it must be taken into account (this is especially important for steels) that the hardening temperature is numerically equal to the melting point only when we are talking about a perfectly pure substance. </p><p>  As is known from the school curriculum, the melting temperature of steel for different types of alloys is different.  This is determined by the structure of the alloy, its constituent components, the nature of the technological production of steel, and other factors. </p><p>  So, for example, the melting <span>point of steel</span> consisting of a copper-nickel alloy is approximately 1150 ¬∞ C.  If we increase the nickel content in such an alloy, then the temperature will increase, since the melting temperature of nickel itself is much higher than that of copper.  As a rule, depending on the chemical composition of the alloy and the ratio of components present in it, the melting temperature of steel can be in the range of 1420-1525 ¬∞ C, if such steel is subject to casting in the mold during metallurgical production, then the temperature must be maintained at another 100-150 degrees higher.  An important factor that affects the melting temperature is the level of carbon in the alloy.  If its content is high, then the temperature will be lower, and, accordingly, vice versa - with a decrease in the amount of carbon, the temperature rises. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  More difficult from the point of view of determining the value is the process of <span>measuring the melting</span> temperature in stainless steels.  The reason for this is their complex chemical composition.  For example, steel grades 1X18H9, widely used in dentistry and electrical engineering, have in their composition, in addition to iron itself, carbon, nickel, chromium, manganese, titanium and silicon.  Naturally, the melting temperature of stainless steel of this composition will be determined by the properties of each component included in it.  Cast steel, crowns, various types of dentures, electrical components and more are made from such steel.  You can list some of the properties that this stainless steel has, its melting point is 1460-1500 ¬∞ C, therefore, based on this parameter and the chemical composition of the alloy, special <span>silver solders</span> are used to <span>solder it.</span> </p><p>  One of the most high-tech types of alloys in modern production is various steels with the inclusion of titanium elements in their composition.  This is due to the fact that these steels have almost one hundred percent biological inertness, and the melting temperature of titanium-based steel is one of the highest. </p><p>  Most steels contain iron as their main component.  This is explained not only by the fact that this metal is one of the most common in the <span>natural environment,</span> but also by the fact that iron is an almost universal element for the production of steels of various grades and alloys, of which it is a part.  This breadth of application is explained by the fact that the melting point of this metal, equal to 1539 degrees, in combination with other unique chemical properties makes iron an appropriate component for a wide range of steel grades for various purposes. </p>
