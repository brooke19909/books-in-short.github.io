Fedorov: biography of the gunsmith and engineer</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Fedorov Vladimir Grigoryevich - a famous Soviet engineer in the field of weapons.  Thanks to the technical skills of Vladimir Grigoryevich, the best weapon of those years - the machine gun - was improved for the Russian Empire.  However, despite the unconditional talent of a gunsmith, the release of his military weapons was constantly stopped due to any circumstances.  That is why the name of Vladimir Fedorov, who participated in the creation of small <span>arms of World War II,</span> is still not so famous for many Russians.  However, this article will tell a lot about the biography of the gunsmith. </p><h2>  Biography of Fedorov Vladimir Grigoryevich </h2><p>  The great engineer and constructor was born on May 15, 1874 in the cultural capital of Russia - St. Petersburg. </p>

    <p>  The father of Vladimir Grigoryevich Fedor worked as a caretaker of the Imperial Law Building. </p><p>  The biography of Vladimir Fedor is extremely diverse in his events, which suggests that the engineer was indeed an outstanding mechanic. </p><h2>  Education of Vladimir Fedorov </h2><p>  First, Vladimir Fedorov studied at the St. Petersburg State Gymnasium, where he received his secondary education, and after graduation he entered the Mikhailovsky Artillery School, after which he already had a special education.  It was at the end of the school that Vladimir joined the army of the Russian Empire in 1895, where he served for two years as a platoon commander. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

In 1897 he entered the Academy of Artillery in the same Mikhailovsk.  Vladimir Fedorov passed his production practice at the arms factory, which was located in Sestroretsk.  It was there that he met with the head of the plant, Sergei Mosin, who at that time was already a famous weapons designer.  Mosin's most famous work was a three-line rifle, which was adopted by the Russian army in 1851.

    <h2>  The first steps in the service of Fedorov </h2><p>  After graduating from the Academy in 1900, Vladimir Fedorov was accepted as a rapporteur in the weapons department of the Main Artillery Directorate.  It was there that Vladimir Fedorov gained access to many materials stored in archives and bearing official character.  These documents had a lot of information about the armament of the Russian army and the armies of other countries. </p>

    <h2>  First engineering experience </h2><p>  Already in 1906, Fedorov completed the first project to create an automatic rifle, which relied on the drawings of the Mosin rifle.  Fedorov came to this decision because at that time there were about five million "mosinoks" in service, and their conversion to automatic weapons was much cheaper than creating a new one. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1906, the project of Vladimir Grigoryevich was officially approved.  It was from this moment that Fedorov's career in engineering began. </p><h2>  Major weapon changes </h2><p>  In 1911, Fedorov began another project, which included cartridges with a smaller caliber, which changed the entire design of the rifle.  With the outbreak of World War I, about two hundred Fedorov rifles of a new design were produced, but soon the assembly of this model of weapon was stopped. </p><p>  Already in 1916, at the suggestion of Fedorov, automatic rifles were officially adopted for service, which could conduct continuous shooting.  It was <span>this weapon</span> that came to be called the Fedorov assault rifle. </p>

    <p>  In September of the same year, an order was made to the weapons factory in Sestroretsk for the assembly of twenty-five thousand Fedorov assault rifles.  Despite such an excellent development of events, due to poverty and lack of material during the war years, the order was first reduced to ten thousand copies, and then completely canceled. </p><h2>  Further life of Fedorov </h2><p>  In early 1918, Vladimir Grigoryevich Fedorov was offered the position of chief engineer at a machine gun factory in Kovrov.  Thanks to the technique of manufacturing and assembling Fedorov parts, already in 1920, 100 automatic machines were ready.  And in 1921, thanks to the skills of Vladimir Grigoryevich, the manufacture of machine guns gained significant momentum - 50 pieces per month.  It was at this time that Fedorov was working on the creation and development of new small arms, which were later used during the Second World War.  The small arms, on which Fedorov was already working, helped a lot in the victory of the Soviet troops over the fascist invaders. </p><p>  In the 1920s, Fedorov, along with Shpagin and Simonov, created several variations of machine guns for tanks. </p><p>  Already at the end of the Civil War, Fedorov still managed to make a huge many different changes to the design of his machine.  In 1924, his more advanced weapons passed all tests and began to be produced by weapons factories.  However, despite all the innovations, the machine with an even smaller caliber ceased to be produced.  But by this time more than two and a half thousand units had already been created. </p>

    <h2>  Writing </h2><p>  After the end of World War II, Vladimir Fedorov wrote a scientific book that talked about the appearance of artillery weapons in Russia.  It is in his writings that he writes that this type of weaponry appeared and was first used back in the late 1300s. </p><p>  In addition to his enormous work on the creation of weapons, Vladimir Grigorievich writes several books about ‚ÄúThe Word about Igor's Regiment ...‚Äù, in which he considers all events exclusively with the eyes of a military man, evaluating them from a military point of view. </p><h2>  The death of the great gunsmith </h2><p>  In 1953, Vladimir G. Fedorov resigned. </p><p>  In 1966, the great engineer and gunsmith Fedorov died in the capital of the Soviet state.  Vladimir Grigoryevich was buried in the same place, in Moscow, at the Golovinsky cemetery. </p>
