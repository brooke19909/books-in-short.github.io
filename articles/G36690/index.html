    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Le Zenith 3 * is located in the north of Hammamet, six kilometers from the center of this village.  It cannot be said that it stands almost on the seashore - six hundred meters to go to the longed-for beach.  But the coast of her own, sandy.  Tunis-Carthage International Airport is over sixty kilometers away.  But most tourists come from other air gates of the country - Enfida.  This airport is closer ‚Äî some forty kilometers away.  Transfer from there to the hotel takes about an hour.  And the train station of Hammamet is not so far.  To get there, you need to overcome about seven kilometers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Hammamet </h2><p>  An excellent respectable Tunisian resort has survived all the changes of the recent revolution and continues to attract vacationers.  A map of Hammamet with hotels allows us to understand that the main tourist center is Yasmin, but there are quite a few hotels in the north of the city.  Here there are the ‚Äúfives‚Äù, and ‚Äúfours‚Äù, and ‚Äútriples‚Äù, like our ‚ÄúZenith‚Äù.  Almost all the hotels that stand on the so-called first beach strip are actually separated from the sea by a road - that is how they were originally built here.  The sand here is small, pleasant and white, like flour, and the beaches are very gentle, with a beautiful entrance to the sea and clear water.  Fans of <span>Mediterranean cuisine</span> will think that they are in paradise - in these places, the national Tunisian flavor and the delicacies of French delicacies are quite specifically combined.  Coffee, hookah and fresh juices also attract many lovers of oriental romance. </p><h2>  Hammamet All Inclusive Hotels: General Description </h2><p>  This resort is developing at such a fast pace that soon it will probably overtake the fashionable Sousse.  The hotel base of the city is constantly being updated, and local hotels are doing everything possible to attract more tourists.  Almost all of them have full-fledged animation, compete with each other, inviting famous groups, offer different services and services, and, most importantly for Russian tourists, each of them works according to the all inclusive system.  It is not much different from the Egyptian and Turkish versions, but the food there is more diverse, the choice is richer.  Even the cheapest hotels offer excellent food, and their restaurants have chefs who can be safely called masters of their craft.  Hotel "Zenit 3 *" is a vivid example of such a "treshka" with "all inclusive". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  Le Zenith 3 * is a large five-story white building with an elevator, very stylish, in harmony with the surrounding landscape and built in the <span>Moorish style.</span>  It is large, there are more than three hundred rooms.

The rooms are designed for one, two, three and four guests.  Plumbing is not new, but cleaned to a shine, it works perfectly, nothing leaks.  If you have a baby up to two years old, then you can ask to put a crib in the room.  The mattresses are new, the bedding is impeccable.  Four-person room - two-level.  Views from the balcony to either the pool or the garden.  If you sleep sensitively, it is best to choose a room away from the pool and amphitheater, where shows and discos are held.
