This fact may seem unexpected, but it has a logical explanation.  These caves - Syany - were made by human hands and for a reason.  In Syan, limestone rock was mined for the construction of white-stone Moscow. </p>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  These moves have the largest length of moves in the Moscow region.  And in Russia they occupy the 5th line.  The total length of the <span>underground passages</span> is 19 km, and these are only known and verified.  There is a possibility that the Syany <span>caves</span> near Moscow may turn out to be longer.  At the same time, their position in the ranking of caves will rise. </p><p>  Large caves in the suburbs began to be created in the XIII century.  The fastest increase in underground passages was in the 15th century, when limestone construction was actively developing.  Peasants mined it in adits only in the winter.  There are two reasons for this: </p><ol><li>  In other seasons, peasant people worked on the land, growing bread and raising livestock. </li><li>  In winter, the risk of collapse of passages was reduced.  In the past, people did not yet have sufficient experience and means to ensure security and support arches.  In winter, the ground froze from severe frosts, and moving areas froze. </li></ol><p>  Stones were mined in these adits until the 20th century.  Work underground stopped completely in 1917.  In the thirties of the last century, a number of stones were extracted from the caves in order to strengthen the runway at Domodedovo Airport.  From this time, limestone rocks were no longer taken out of Xi'an.  During the Great Patriotic War, a hospital for wounded soldiers was set up in a dungeon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  14 years of silence </h2><p>  Already in the 1960s, cavers became interested in these caves.  And there were a lot of them appearing here.  The caves began to live a second life.  A few years later, the government decided to wipe all entrances and exits for security reasons.  The dungeons were empty for 14 years, after which the activists opened one of the exits.  In 2007, it was restored to its normal form, concrete rings were omitted and a staircase was made.  This did not diminish extremity. </p><p>  Syana Caves are not considered an ennobled tourist destination.  Visitors are required to follow the recommendations for behavior in the caves, they regularly conduct excursions, and some even celebrate holidays.  For example, to celebrate the arrival of the New Year in the dungeon is not so commonplace. </p>

    <h2>  Underground life </h2><p>  Making fires is strictly forbidden by the established rules of behavior, because other cavers may suffer from the released carbon monoxide.  Some visitors are in the cave for more than one day and are forced to cook and boil water on gas and alcohol.  These features of being underground give a certain zest to such trips.  It may surprise you, but there are people who may not go to the surface for some days at all.  You can lie down and sleep in special extensions of the moves.  Underground sometimes performances of artists and dances. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many tourists are attracted by the cave of Syana.  How to get there, they know, unfortunately, not all lovers of extreme relaxation. </p><h2>  Dungeon Conditions </h2><p>  The conditions in the cave do not change all year round.  Stably from 7 to 10 degrees above zero, and humidity - about 80 percent.  If you have warm and comfortable clothes, then you will not experience unpleasant sensations.  This is if you do not have claustrophobia.  Ceiling heights can range from 0.3 to 2.5 meters.  The width of the passage is about 1.5 meters. </p><p>  All passages studied by cavers are in special maps, which will help tourists not to get lost.  All the passages and halls are named in the cave.  In addition, traveling through the adits, you can meet professional cavers who are always ready to help or give advice.  Each tourist will be enchanted by the caves of Syana.  Photos obtained in these places are mysterious and mystical. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting places and rules of conduct </h2><p>  As soon as you go down to Sian through the current entrance (there is only one so far) under the name ‚ÄúCat Laz‚Äù, you will notice a notebook.  This is an impromptu visitor <span>registration journal</span> .  Everyone who enters and exits must make an appropriate entry in this notebook.  It was created with the aim of helping rescue teams in the event of an emergency to quickly and accurately have data on how many people are currently in the dungeon. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that, meeting underground, regular guests of the dungeons greet each other with the phrase: "Good."  Without the usual ending in the form of the time of day, because there is no way to determine what is actually happening now.  You still do not need to shine on each other's faces, especially strangers.  This is unpleasant, so in Syan it is taken as a rule. </p><p>  The underworld looks like a different reality.  Walking, you can get into the hall called "Aristarchus".  In this place, the human skeleton has long been found.  Now Aristarchus, considered a local deity, is hanged on metal shackles.  There is a legend that in order to receive protection from a deity, gifts should be left.  For this reason, the entire hall is littered with the things of guests and fans of the deity.  In Syan you can‚Äôt scatter and leave behind any garbage.  This simple rule is strictly observed by all, without exception, even though its implementation is not controlled. </p><p>  In the system of passages of the caves of Xiang, you can stumble upon an interesting grotto, called the Milky Way.  For simplicity, it is called briefly: "Miller".  The arch is formed by amazing rocks, which in response to the beam of the lantern play millions of lights.  Reminds the starry sky.  When the light is turned off, it will continue to shine for some time with phosphorescent lights.  Seen will be remembered for a lifetime. </p><p>  There is another interesting place in the system - Pike Laz.  It has a very small height and width, but its length is decent.  "Pike" will give you an adrenaline rush, if, of course, you overcome the natural fear of a confined space. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to the cave? </h2><p>  Six kilometers away from the Lenin Hills you need to go along the main road towards the Pit.  After the bridge, turn left to the village of Novlyanskoye.  At the end of this settlement, you need to cross the Pakhra river, there is platinum.  Next, keep the path along the river to the left.  The entrance to the caves is located in the second ravine on the right, there is a <span>bus stop</span> nearby <span>.</span> </p>

    <p>  Syana's caves are most visited during the New Year holidays and winter time in general.  There are much fewer people here in the summer, because there are also difficulties.  Not everyone can dare to plunge into the underground coolness after being exposed to extreme heat. </p><p>  There are practically no dangers in the caves, especially if you are well prepared.  You can go on an excursion with family or friends.  You will remember this vacation for a long time.  Be sure to visit the <span>caves of Syana.</span>  How to get, now you also know. </p>
