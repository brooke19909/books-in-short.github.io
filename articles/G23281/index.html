Microloans - financial assistance or slavery?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, lending to people through micro-loans is a very profitable business.  You can verify this by at least looking at the market where microloan related activities are being conducted.  There are dozens of different companies that succeed in doing so. </p><p>  This may indicate several factors.  Firstly, about the high demand for ‚Äúfast‚Äù money, secondly, that people are increasingly forced to borrow money (that they lack how much salary gives), thirdly, that companies that issue loans receive this is a good profit. </p><p>  In the context of this article, we will consider, firstly, the thesis that microcredit is another form of slavery or a really profitable financial instrument with which you can solve your problems;  secondly, we will characterize one of the largest companies issuing micro-loans, called RosMoney.  Feedback from debtors of this institution, as well as information from open sources will help us better understand this issue. </p><h2>  Microloans.  Example </h2>

    <p>  We begin, of course, with the general question of what microcredit is.  Surely many of us already understand the difference between the so-called "quick loan" from a simple consumer loan.  But better we give an example that illustrates this category. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, suppose we take a loan to buy a refrigerator.  This is an amount equal to our three salaries, which we pay off gradually, giving back some of our earnings, say, during the year.  This is a classic consumer loan, which is usually drawn up for some significant, large expenses. </p><p>  Another example looks like this: we spent our money, although there are still 5 days left before the salary.  Money is needed to go to the store and buy products for the arrival of guests.  Of course, there is nothing left but to apply for a small loan.  Having received a salary in less than a week, we will pay off this debt.  This is how a microloan works, or, as it is commonly called, a quick loan. </p><h2>  Registration speed and low requirements </h2><p>  It is called ‚Äúfast‚Äù because of how simple the design procedure precedes it.  Instead of collecting various certificates from the place of work and specifying specific information about your property (as in the case of consumer goods), in the case of microcredit, the user just needs to provide a passport.  In some situations, only general information is required that you work and, thus, have a constant source of income.  As deep as banks, micro-lending organizations do not dig. </p>

    <p>  The reason for such ‚Äúillegibility‚Äù of companies is that it is beneficial for them to give such loans.  If the client returns the money on time, he already overpays a rather high percentage for using the funds (for example, 10% for 10 days is a normal rate).  In another case, if the debtor does not return the money on time, he will be dragged by the courts and large financial losses.  The conditions for providing microloans are such that the client will return many times more than he initially took.  On this and earn such offices. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A financial instrument or slavery? </h2><p>  Actually, in our article on micro loans, this question is asked about what can be considered the activities of offices that initially set a very high percentage for their services. </p><p>  On the one hand, you can understand the debtors who are faced with the problem of money.  People taking a quick loan, and without that, as a rule, do not have significant financial resources.  These are not rich representatives of the people, as a rule, living on the same salary (with rare exceptions).  The very function of microloans is to help ‚Äúreach out‚Äù to the next payment. </p><p>  Therefore, when a company asks such a person to pay 10% more, it already worsens his (already difficult) financial situation in order to make his profit.  Realizing this, many customers are outraged, leaving negative comments about such offices. </p><p>  Another issue is the profitability of the company organizing the issuance of micro-loans.  Its profitability consists in receiving from each borrower the money that was provided to him at the beginning, increased at the expense of interest.  And then, no one forces a person to get a loan under initially unfavorable conditions;  and already signed under the contract - please, pay!  Therefore, if you look from a practical point of view, the borrowers themselves are to blame for how companies (such as RosMoney) act with them (in case of non-payment).  Feedback from debtors about it is sometimes also clearly negative, but "business is business" ... </p>

    <h2>  How to manage a microloan? </h2><p>  Depending on what to do with the money borrowed, they can make you both a slave and their master.  If you regularly live on such loans, then most likely you simply do not know how to organize your expenses.  On the other hand, by issuing a microloan only in individual, emergency cases, you can save the situation.  After that, of course, you need to pay off the debt as soon as possible so as not to incur even bigger problems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Not everyone knows how to manage borrowed money.  The <span>reviews of the</span> debtors <span>describing the RosDengi</span> company confirm this.  For example, there are negative comments from those who delayed payment due to the weekend or simply forgot that the "day of reckoning" has arrived.  Obviously, such borrowers themselves are guilty of their problems, and for them such a loan can really become slavery.  This is not the case with more punctual and prudent clients who carefully monitor the debt repayment schedule. </p><p>  Therefore, as a small summary for the first part of our article, we can say that debt slavery is not fearful to you if you can properly monitor, manage and manage your money. </p><h2>  Company "RosMoney" </h2>

    <p>  In the second part, I would like to introduce you to one of the largest organizations in the microcredit market, called RosMoney.  Almost everyone who meets the requirements indicated on their website can get a loan here.  It should be said that they are quite loyal (we will write more about this later). </p><p>  Considering the rich experience of this structure (it has been presented on the market since 2010), as well as an extensive network of offices (the company operates in more than a hundred cities across the country), it can be noted that the organization has developed its own approach to business and individual interaction with customers which the last likes.  This can be judged at least by the fact that over the entire period of work the company has accepted applications from more than a million Russians. </p><h2>  Mission and Values </h2><p>  However, we are not just talking about some kind of commercial "conveyor", which gives loans to all comers.  In fact, we have before us a company with its values ‚Äã‚Äãand mission, which is described in more detail on the official website of RosMoney (feedback from debtors, of course, may not share these principles).  So, the main task of the group is to provide customers with the opportunity to solve their financial problems as efficiently and quickly as possible, receiving a short-term loan from this structure.  The company's motto: "We are there if you need money."  So far, as we see, these words correspond to the real state of affairs in the company, which launches new offices and only expands its market share. </p>

    <h2>  Feedback </h2><p>  The main branch of the company is located in St. Petersburg: the group is managed there;  Applications with resumes of potential company employees are also sent there.  However, as previously reported, you can most likely find a group office in your city.  To learn more about where to go for cash, please call 8-800-200-50-51.  This is the RosDengi service company hotline, calls to which are free.  Please note that, in addition to the phone, there is also a form for online communication on the company's website.  So, each visitor can send a message to a company consultant on a topic of interest to him and receive an instant response. </p><p>  In the capital there is a branch of RosDengi.Moscow.  Addresses of representative offices need to be recognized separately (they are not on the site): three main branches on ul. Moskovskaya, 14A, ul.  Kalinin, 2 and Vokzalnaya street, 18B.  Opening hours - until 20:00, phones can be found on the hotline. </p><p>  Information on how the group is represented in other cities can be found in the same way.  This is important because RosDengi's offices are the centers where a loan is issued. </p><h2>  Conditions </h2>

    <p>  If you believe the official site, getting a loan for your goals here is not difficult.  RosMoney <span>(the microfinance company</span> that we characterize) offers loans ranging from a thousand to 30 thousand rubles to everyone who is 18 years old or older and who has a regular income.  In this case, the maximum period of receipt is 17 days, the minimum is 7. The organization makes it possible to extend the payment term if the user cannot pay on time. </p><h2>  Debtors reviews </h2><p>  As we have already noted, most of the negative comments about the service were made by those who at one time took a loan here and were unable to repay it on time.  People write that the RosDengi company requires the impossible: it raises interest, makes it pay off new debts, and constantly increases the debtor's obligations.  On the other hand, this procedure is logical, because the loan was issued, and the person knew what he was going to. </p><p>  As for the quality of service in general, no complaints were identified.  The fact that the company requires payment of debts is also clear, because it is a matter of their activities and their ability to continue to work in the market. </p><h2>  Employee Reviews </h2><p>  People who work here also leave comments on the RosMoney company in large numbers.  Of course, they did not open a loan here, but they also write both positive and negative reviews.  Someone is glad that they give him the opportunity to learn something new and earn more if he works harder.  Others complain that the labor control system is too tight here, that the bosses are not able to develop, and so on.  There are tons of comments, but they all relate to individual cases.  It‚Äôs impossible to put together a whole picture - the rating of a company on a site with reviews is about 3.5 points out of 5. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2>

    <p>  What can be said about RosDengi?  The organization conducts its activities in a rather tough, competitive and complex (from the point of view of psychology) field.  This is a financial environment where the principle of ‚Äúbusiness is business,‚Äù as we have said above, is in effect.  The fact that the company has been active since 2010 and has only grown over all this time is an indicator of the correct approach of its management.  As for the severe fines for both borrowers and employees, it is certainly humanly possible to understand and regret such people, but both of them knew what they were doing. </p><p>  Interacting with the company is quite convenient - this is a testament to the high level of service.  There is high-quality support (we already specified the phone number served by RosDengi above - this is a round-the-clock call center where you can contact with any question).  But to become a slave to your loan or use it as an effective tool to solve your problems is already a decision made by the borrower. </p>
