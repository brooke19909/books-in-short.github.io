For some, this is enhanced Ultra All Inclusive meals, and for some, the main requirement for the hotel is its own beach.  Some tourists, preoccupied with their own safety, do not want to see anyone there, except for other hotel guests.  Well, their right.  But you have to pay for this service.  Today Montenegro is in our circle of attention.  Hotels <strong> </strong>  with your beach: what are they and where are they located?  The coast of this country is rugged and rocky.  So often the front line hotel is a building towering on a cliff.  Ladders leading down to the solarium pier lead down.  But there are truly gorgeous pebble and sand beaches in this Balkan country. </p><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro Hotels with Private Beach" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/311882.jpg" width="415"></div>  Montenegro: sandy beaches, 5 star hotels </h3><p><strong></strong>  In the south of the country, the relief becomes more gentle, and the coast is sandy.  The glory of the island of Sveti Stefan thunders far beyond the Adriatic.  People come here for day trips to admire the beauty of this miracle of nature, the sand of a reddish tide.  What is it like to live here!  Hotel "Sveti Stefan 5 *" gives you such an opportunity.  The beach of the King, Queen and Milocer offers you to lie on their supple sand.  Exactly there, since sunbeds will cost you quite a tangible amount.  There are other “fives” on the island: “Costa” and “Villa Montenegro”. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Two kilometers from the tourist Budva is the resort of Becici.  There are also 5 star <span>Montenegro hotels</span> with their own beach. <strong> </strong>  with golden sand. <strong> </strong>  The most popular and expensive is Splendid.  It has everything you need for VIP-clients, even a roof top to park your own helicopter.  As well as all kinds of jacuzzis, pools, wellness centers, courts and clubs.  In Budva, on the first line is Max Prestige, and in Podgorica - Krna Gora. </p><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro Hotels with a Beach" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/311884.jpg" width="600"></div>  Four star Montenegro hotels with private beach </h3><p><strong></strong>  Such hotels are especially numerous in the south-eastern part of the country.  From the "fives" they are distinguished unless the lack of branded sanitary ware in the bathroom.  But everything works fine, and restaurants, unlike many "fives", are served on an all-inclusive basis.  Everything is <span>fine</span> with the beach at the Montenegro 4 * hotel <span>: umbrellas,</span> sunbeds and towels are completely free for guests.  The same can be said about the Otrant Beach 4 * Hotel, which is 70 kilometers from Podgorica. </p><h3>  Three Star Montenegro Hotels with Private Beach </h3>

At the very beginning is the hotel "Velika Plaza 3 *".  This is not even a hotel, but a whole complex of apartments and bungalows.  Meals here are carried out under the program "half board".  It is also worth mentioning the “Admiral Club” in Budva and “Adriatic Apartment 3 *”.

    <h3>  Montenegro Hotels with Private Beach (Two Stars) </h3><p>  There are such nice family hotels with small cozy rooms, family atmosphere and romantic balconies in colors.  "Dvushka" - the most reasonable investment in vacation.  Value for money is just perfect.  People often rebuild such mini-hotels from coastal dachas or boathouses.  The beach is close by, but naturally not private.  There are also 2 * hotels that, twenty years ago, served as sanatoriums for the partelite.  You can nostalgic for the long-gone times of the USSR on a squeezed mattress, listening to the noise of the refrigerator.  But the beach is own. </p>
