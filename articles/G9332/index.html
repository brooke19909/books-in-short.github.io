Protecting yourself from problems is very easy.  To do this, you do not need to contact the services of mobile operators and install paid programs.  It is enough to take the phone and block the contact in the iPhone. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Previously, iPhone users had to install paid applications in order to add a specific number to the black list.  Such a need disappeared only with the release of iOS 7. This software allows you to do without downloading additional programs.  You can block a contact in an iPhone in several ways, which are equally simple. </p><h2>  Main Settings </h2><p>  In order to send one of the numbers to the black list, you must follow a certain algorithm of actions.  How to block a contact on an iPhone and get rid of unwanted calls?  The user will need to open the "Phone" application and tap on the "Contacts" section. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.idownloadblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Blocking process" class="if uuid-3191658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3191658.jpg"></div><p>  Then you should find a specific phone number and click on it.  The system will issue a card in which the ‚ÄúBlock‚Äù button is displayed.  After confirming the intention to send the contact to the black list, the user will not receive SMS messages and phone calls from an unwanted subscriber. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to send an unknown number to unwanted? </h2><p>  Not only bank employees, but also various companies offering their services make annoying calls.  Therefore, many users are interested in how to block a contact in iPhone 7 and other smartphone models.  Calls can come from different numbers, so adding them to contacts is simply not practical.  The iPhone has a function that allows you to send to the black list even an unfamiliar number. </p><div class="photo" data-original="certifiederepair.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Smartphone Users" class="if uuid-3191667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3191667.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, open the "Phone" application and click on the "Recent" section.  Then you need to find the number and click on the icon with the letter ‚Äúi‚Äù.  In the window that opens, you will need to find the ‚ÄúBlock subscriber‚Äù button.  After confirming this action, the number will automatically be blacklisted. </p><h2>  How to adjust the data? </h2><p>  If the user mistakenly added the contact to the black list, everything can be fixed.  Just go to the "Settings" section and select the "Blocked" tab in the "Phone" section.  If necessary, the list can be edited and other numbers added to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.igeeksblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Create a blacklist" class="if uuid-3191645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3191645.jpg"></div><p>  If a user needs to reach a subscriber who is blacklisted, the anti-identifier function can be activated.  This option is activated by the telecom operator on a paid basis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to add a message number to the list of unwanted contacts? </h2><p>  You can block a contact in an iPhone directly in the Messages application.  To do this, you need to open correspondence with a specific subscriber sending spam.  Next, click on the ‚ÄúContact‚Äù button and click on the icon with the letter ‚Äúi‚Äù.  After that, you can follow a familiar pattern and block unwanted messages from the contact. </p><h2>  Where to see blocked contacts? </h2><p>  Often people blacklist certain numbers and forget about it.  In order to see blocked contacts, you can open the "Settings" section and tap on the "Phone" item.  The system will open a block called "Calls", where you must select the "Blocked" subsection.  It contains a list of unwanted numbers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailydot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Contact lock" class="if uuid-3191641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3191641.jpg"></div><p>  The list can be supplemented with other contacts via the "Add New" button.  If the user wants to remove a specific subscriber from the black list, just click on the ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù item.  Then you can deduce the number from the number of unwanted ones and click on the ‚ÄúUnlock‚Äù button. </p><h2>  Do Not Disturb </h2><p>  How to block a contact in iPhone 5 and protect yourself from intrusive messages and calls?  The capabilities of this mode allow you to not miss calls to your mobile device at set hours.  As a rule, this option is set during the working day or at night.  To activate the function, you need to go to the "Settings" section, in which you can select the option you need.  The ‚ÄúScheduled‚Äù mode allows you to adjust the time during which the option will be activated.  ‚ÄúCall Admission‚Äù defines subscribers who can reach the user.  The From All option blocks absolutely all calls. </p><h2>  Blacklist Applications </h2><p>  Some users are interested in how to block a contact on iPhone 6 using additional software.  Many applications have been developed that offer owners more options than Apple integrated tools.  The BlackList program is very popular because it allows you to quickly and easily create black lists of subscribers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stellarinfo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black list" class="if uuid-3193692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3193692.jpg"></div><p>  This software has a 10-day free period.  Using the application, you can view the history of blocked messages and calls, create several profiles with different settings, set a password to start the program and activate the parental control function. </p><h2>  Blacklist Benefits </h2><p>  This function is integrated into the iOS operating system, so you can block a contact in an iPhone right away.  The list of unwanted contacts is saved when backing up using iTunes or iCloud.  Such operations can be performed absolutely free. </p><h2>  Message Blocking and FaceTime </h2><p>  The user can not only block the contact in the iPhone, but also disable the receipt of messages from a specific number.  To do this, just go to the desired branch of the message section and tap on the tab "Details".  The drop-down list should be scrolled down to the ‚ÄúData‚Äù section and click on the ‚ÄúBlock subscriber‚Äù button. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.idownloadblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lock methods" class="if uuid-3191639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3191639.jpg"></div><p>  The owner of the device can filter incoming information from numbers that are not in the contact list.  Trying to block the contact in the iPhone 5s, 6, 6S, and 7, you must clearly follow the instructions presented.  To do this, you will need to set restrictions on incoming messages.  They will be stored in a separate section from unknown senders.  In addition, users can block FaceTime calls.  It is enough in the settings to find the corresponding item and the mobile phone number of the subscriber. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Apparently, Apple cares about the comfort of its users.  Therefore, gadget owners can choose the optimal lock mode for themselves.  Knowing the basic settings, you can not worry about unwanted calls and SMS messages.  Of course, you cannot completely protect yourself from talking with unwanted subscribers.  However, creating a blacklist will allow you to block some contacts in the iPhone without difficulty. </p>
