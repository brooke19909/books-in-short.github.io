    <h2>  Ecotourism in the Altai Territory </h2><p>  <span>In fact, this is not all the charms of the wild nature of this region.</span>  <span>The most desperate and courageous tourists who go hiking in the Altai mountains, climb upstream for the very first and largest Sedoy Falls.</span>  <span>There is a gorge, in which there are six more small waterfalls with a height of not more than 6 meters.</span>  <span>The landscapes here are simply amazing, but, again, getting there is extremely difficult.</span>  <span>Only the very most go to it - those who came for extreme sports, people who are not looking for easy ways.</span> </p><p>  <span>Now the whole area around is mapped and divided into routes with the designation of all trails, waterfalls, etc.</span>  <span>Previously, tourists went on a tour of the Altai Mountains at their own peril and risk, exchanging among themselves useful information to overcome the most difficult areas.</span>  <span>Since then, popular names have been assigned to seething rapids.</span>  <span>So, the Sedoy Falls received a number of exotic names: Giraffe, Beard, Silver.</span>  <span>The next Rassipny waterfall began to be called Yogi or Double Jump.</span>  <span>The steps or waterfall after the first two waterfalls were fondly called the Tender Mirage and Tramplin.</span>  <span>Such a number of names contributed to the spread of some confusion in tourist guides, for various compilers included different names in their cartographic notes.</span> </p>
