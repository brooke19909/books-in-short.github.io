Much for today's historians is still a mystery.  For example, the so-called <span>Time of Troubles, the reasons for</span> which were, first of all, in the difficult economic situation of Russia after the Livonian War.  It led to the fact that there were big obstacles to the process of centralization of the country.  The long Time of Troubles in Russia lasted 10 years.  At the same time, the country had practically no opportunity to develop. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Time of Troubles" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10462/3700.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  According to V.I. Klyuchevsky, the Time of Troubles is an indicator that our country did not have the features of a genuine state.  The historian believes that the power itself represented two principles: the tsar and the <span>patrimony, which</span> positioned Russia not as a single state, but as property, the inheritance of the sovereign.  Thanks to the Time of Troubles, these remnants were destroyed, and the country embarked on a path of genuine development. </p><p>  The Time of Troubles, the causes of which have been studied by historians, had rather profound consequences.  After the death of Ivan the Terrible, his sons, Fedor and the young Dmitry, who soon died, remained on the throne.  Fedor could not hold the throne for a long time and died seven years later, which led to the end of the rule of <span>the Rurikovich dynasty.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After this event, <span>Boris Godunov</span> came to power <span>,</span> whose <span>rule</span> was relatively short-lived and led to an even greater split of Moscow society into warring communities.  Godunov himself was distinguished by special views on the rule of the country: he believed that the problems were mainly connected with the enslavement of peasants and planned to abolish <span>serfdom,</span> which strongly opposed him the bulk of the boyars. </p><p>  But to take any measures the new ruler was prevented by the economic crisis that arose due to crop failure and, as a result, famine in Russia in the 90s of the 16th century.  A solution to this problem could be found by depriving the nobility of a number of rights, which was completely impossible in those days.  The famine provoked a series of uprisings, the largest of which occurred in 1603 on the outskirts of the country among free Cossacks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Time of Troubles in Russia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10462/3705.jpg" width="384"></div>

    <p>  In 1605, Tsar Boris Godunov dies.  At this time, False Dmitry began to appear on the territory of the country, each of which speaks of itself as a surviving prince Dmitry.  Historians believe that these were attempts by the Poles to capture Russia.  After all, the Time of Troubles, the reasons for which lie in the discord of state power, was an extremely successful period for intervention. </p><p>  The attempt by foreigners to seize Moscow was successful.  Hiding behind an agreement with the government of Vasily Shuisky, Sweden also begins military operations against Russia, and Polish troops enter Moscow, abandoned in panic by the boyars.  And only thanks to the uprising of Minin and Pozharsky, the country was able to free its territories from invaders.  The Time of Troubles in Russia led to heavy losses. </p><p>  Most likely, this served as a sign for the nobility, and as a result of the decision of the <span>Zemsky Sobor</span> in 1613, sixteen-year-old <span>Mikhail Romanov</span> ascended the throne <span>,</span> who founded the Romanov dynasty, which ruled Russia for more than three hundred years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="troubled time is" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10462/6202.jpg"></div>

    <p>  History is a lantern that shines from the past to the future.  The Time of Troubles, the reasons of which historians are studying to date, is a bitter example of what the fragmentation of the state leads to. </p>
