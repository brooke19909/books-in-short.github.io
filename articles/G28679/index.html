    <h2>  Agios Nikolaos </h2><p>  This small town is sometimes called ‚ÄúGreek Nice‚Äù or is compared to St. Tropez.  After all, it is considered the most comfortable resort in Crete.  It is located around Lake Vulizmeni, which connects to the sea by a canal, but at the same time the water in it remains fresh.  The day and night life of the city is very different.  A measured and contemplative, even somewhat lazy rest, is suddenly replaced by evening lights and violent dancing at parties and in nightclubs.  It is on this border of relaxation and ‚Äúpartying‚Äù that the Ariadne Beach Agios Nikol 4 * hotel is located.  Reviews say that such a location of the hotel is just perfect.  Yes, and during the day you can wander through the colorful streets and markets, look at local cafes.  Do not miss the archaeological museum of Agios Nikolaos.  In terms of variety and number of exhibits, it ranks second in Crete. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Infrastructure Features </h2><p>  The nearest airport to the Ariadne Beach Agios Nikol 4 * hotel is in Heraklion, sixty kilometers from the resort.  Charters fly from Russia there in season.  You can sail to Heraklion by ship, for example, from Athens (ferries from Piraeus) or from other islands.  The hotel is very close to the beach.  The center of Agios Nikolaos is also not far - no more than eight hundred meters.  The hotel was built in nineteen seventy-fifth, but in 2010 there was a major overhaul and a complete renovation.  The hotel area is very small, it consists of a parking lot, a swimming pool, a garden, a restaurant, a bungalow complex and two bars.  The hotel has its own lobby and luggage room.  For most of the services and entertainment, guests need to walk along the path along the sea to another resort complex - Miramare Village. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ariadne Beach Agios Nikol 4 Crete" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1542220.jpg" width="600"></div>

On the sandy shore, entry into the water is better for children.  Sun beds and umbrellas on Almiros are paid, since the coast is municipal.
