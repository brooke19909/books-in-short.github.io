But not only they are interested in this legendary warrior of the seas.  Everyone who knows at least a little history is aware of the important role this ship played during some events.

    <h2>  Military glory </h2><p>  Even foreigners, hearing the word "Aurora", understand what people are talking about.  This ship earned such fame.  Therefore, before considering where the Aurora cruiser is at a given time, let's recall what happened to this ship, starting with its launching.  This happened in May <span>1900,</span> and the royal family attended the ceremony.  This was a significant event.  After three years of testing on the water, the cruiser was sent to the Russo-Japanese War.  There he showed himself to be the best warship.  Participating in battles and sieges, the cruiser was, of course, damaged.  Therefore, after peace was signed with Japan, he began to be repaired, and then returned to the Baltic Sea, to his homeland. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At first, after restoration, its function was to patrol the Gulf of Finland, and the cruiser did not have any combat losses, but then he was sent to the Tsushima Strait.  After a hot battle and the death of fifteen crew members, the ship went to Manila, and in 1905 the war ended for him.  The ship was sent to Petrograd and became for major repairs.  There, our hero met the beginning of the First World War. </p><h2>  Single shot </h2><p>  Here begins the very interesting period in the life of the ship, which even a small child knows about when he hears the word "Aurora."  They planned to leave the cruiser in St. Petersburg for a long time.  Learning about this, the captain vehemently protested, because who knew the team better than him.  He predicted that sailors would succumb to agitation and would certainly get involved in revolutionary events. </p>

    <p>  And he was right, at the same time at the cost of his own life.  The team not only leaned to the side of the factory workers agitating them.  They became part of the protesters.  The captain and officers tried to prevent the capture of the ship, and were killed.  As a result, the cruiser was at the disposal of the revolutionary forces.  He served as a kind of headquarters, and also occasionally made small raids.  Just in one of these raids, that famous single shot was fired, allegedly serving as a team for the storming of the Winter Palace. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the Civil War, the ship was in Kronstadt and was there until 1923. </p><h2>  The fate of the cruiser </h2><p>  But during the Great Patriotic War, the ship had to tight.  Firstly, absolutely all guns were removed from it.  They made an artillery battery from them, which later died from attacks by German tanks and aircraft.  All that remains is an anti-aircraft gun.  Seeing from the air where the Aurora cruiser stands, the fighters repeatedly hit, and in the end the ship sank. </p>

    <p>  After the war, he was lifted from the bottom and towed to the Gulf of Finland, where the ship stood for a long time, being attacked by metal hunters.  Seeing that the repair of the Aurora cruiser seemed impossible, it was decided to use a rotten and looted hull as a breakwater, but transportation problems arose.  So he stayed, stuck in the silt of the Gulf of Finland, where only divers and souvenir hunters see him.  Instead of a real case, they later made another, a fake. </p><h2>  Life anew </h2><p>  It's funny that the real hull of the ship greatly avenged such an attitude.  Two weeks after the flooding, the famous PUTCH arrived in the country.  Since that time, both in the country and on board the ship, God knows what is happening.  A real pornographic film was shot on the ship, which in itself is blasphemy.  They handed over the cruiser for corporate events, and they were not always decent.  In addition, many political actions took place here, and all this lasted until serious people of the state became interested in the fate of the legendary ship.  Overhaul of the cruiser Aurora was ordered by Minister S. Shoigu.  On his orders, the ship was towed back to Kronstadt for a complete upgrade.  The ship arrived back restored and beautiful already in June 2016. </p><h2>  We go to the museum </h2><p>  To get to the famous museum, located on the deck, you need to understand where the cruiser Aurora stands.  After the renewed ship was returned to its hometown, it is constantly located on Petrograd embankment.  This is where you need to get if you want to see part of the story with your own eyes.  The museum began its work in August 2016 and still pleases tourists.  Every day, from 11:00 to 18:00, you can get here.  Non-acceptable days are Monday, Tuesday. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about the cost of a ticket to the museum, then for residents of Russia and the Commonwealth countries, the visit is estimated at 200 rubles for children, and 400 rubles for adults.  Children under 6 years old admission is free.  If you are a foreign citizen, then for you a ticket will cost 600 rubles, and for your child - 400 rubles.  And such a distribution can be understood, because the museum needs to be maintained and maintained in excellent condition. </p><p>  People traveling on their own, without a guide, need to know that they need to get to the metro station called Gorkovskaya.  If you buy a book-guide to the city, then there will definitely be indicated the path along which you need to go from the metro station. </p>
