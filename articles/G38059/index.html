    <p>  Today, more than 16 thousand passengers are accepted by the railway station every day.  Samara, therefore, is an important transportation hub through which you can reach almost anywhere in the Russian Federation, as well as to the CIS countries and neighboring countries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Station History </h2><p>  The construction of a modern station was started in 1996, in the summer.  On the eve of Railroad Day, the first stone was laid in the foundation, which symbolized the beginning of the construction of a new transport hub.  At the same time, the station was fully functioning.  Samara is a station through which both passenger and freight trains passed.  For this, temporary technologies were organized that played the role of the station. </p>

    <p>  1999 was marked by the opening of the first launch complex of the railway station.  The contest was a spacious waiting room, which for the convenience of passengers was equipped with an elevator, <span>an alarm system,</span> as well as an electronic scoreboard.  Security was provided by more than 150 cameras that made video recordings throughout the entire facility. </p><p>  In mid-2000, the second building of the railway station was commissioned.  The new comfortable building has become a hotel, where every interested passenger at a low cost can rent a room for living. </p><p>  At the end of 2001, just before the New Year, the third building of the railway station was commissioned.  The building houses cozy waiting rooms for passengers, cafeterias, a service center, a cultural zone for those waiting, and a technical department.  The administration plans to erect the second stage of the railway station. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Interesting facts about the railway station </h2><ul><li>  The modern station building is the tallest room for sending trains on the territory of modern Europe.  Height - 100 meters, which was achieved by the construction of a massive building, on the roof of which is equipped with a metal spire. </li><li>  The twin of the building is Matabiau (station).  Samara, therefore, has ongoing cooperation with the French city of Toulouse.  The agreements were signed between the representative of Russian Railways Sergey Abramov and Sophie Bouissard, who is the director of the French National Railways division. </li><li>  This station allows you to enjoy and learn the history of the Kuibyshev highway.  Samara has a long history of the formation of railway transport infrastructure.  So, the starting date for the formation of the highway is considered to be 1874.  The main historical milestones are presented in the exhibits of the museum, located on the second floor of the railway station. </li></ul>
