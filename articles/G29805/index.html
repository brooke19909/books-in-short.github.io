    <h2>  Tips for choosing an electric meat grinder </h2><p>  So, let's figure out how to choose an electric meat grinder for the house?  The reviews of those who have been using such a device for a long time have become basic.  On their basis, you can really make the right choice.  The first thing you should pay attention to is power and performance.  These indicators are the main ones.  Productivity of the device directly depends on power.  And the higher the indicator, the faster the meat grinder will cope with the task.  Currently, the power range in devices varies from 400 to 2200 watts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second thing you need to pay attention to is the material of parts and housing.  The Scarlet meat grinder is available in several versions.  The case can be made of stainless steel, plastic or light alloys.  Important: the material must be intended for food.  Stainless steel case more practical.  It does not scratch, does not deform, does not rust. </p><p>  Parts and nozzles are no less important elements.  The screw is responsible for the movement of meat inside the meat grinder.  It is made of metal.  The complete set must have at least two grating disks: for coarse and fine grinding.  It is important to look at the knife well.  He should sit tight on the auger.  After installing it, there can be no distance between it and the disk.  The longevity of the meat grinder will depend on the transmission mechanism of the screw movement.  In budget models, it is made of plastic, but metal ones are considered to be of higher quality. </p><p>  Reverse and number of speeds are also important.  This function allows you to grind veiny meat as quickly as possible.  The most popular models are those that are equipped with several speeds.  It is important to pay attention to the time period of continuous operation.  The optimal indicator for grinding raw meat is 10-15 minutes.  In addition, all electrical appliances must have protective systems installed that protect the engine from overheating or power surges. </p>
