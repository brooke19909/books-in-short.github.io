    <p>  It can be sold, left by will, given, used as collateral or for settlements.  If you urgently need to return a large amount of money, and there is no time to run to the bank, then you can simply hand the certificate to a third party instead of cash.  The most important thing is that its validity does not expire.  This is a great advantage of this type of securities.  The client can independently choose for what amount he should open the <span>Savings</span> Certificates <span>deposit</span> .  In some cases, Sberbank of Russia goes forward and issues forms in excess of the stipulated amount.  This Central Bank is a reliable tool for storing funds, as it has several degrees of protection.  It should be purchased by people who intend to transfer large sums, but do not want the tax to be known about this operation.  That is why the Ministry of Finance proposes to exclude this financial instrument from circulation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Purchase </h2><p>  To complete the transaction, you only need a passport.

    <h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  The main disadvantages of the Savings Certificate product of Sberbank: </p><ul><li>  Interest and risk are very high.  These securities do not participate in <span>the deposit insurance system.</span>  The interest that the bank would pay the DIA, it returns to the client.  Therefore, in the event of the issuer's bankruptcy or license revocation, individuals will not be able to receive the funds accumulated on such securities; </li><li>  in case of loss of a non-registered Central Bank, a third party may present it for payment to Sberbank; </li><li>  certificates (interest is calculated using a simple formula) do not provide for capitalization; </li><li>  securities are repaid by no means in all branches of a credit organization; </li><li>  in case of early presentation, the rate is reduced to 0.01% per annum; </li><li>  it is impossible to extend the validity of the Central Bank. </li></ul><h2>  Some statistics </h2><p>  In February 2015, the maximum average certificate rate was 13.28%.  According to the Central Bank, a similar indicator for deposits approached the mark of 13.85%.  This is more than the average interest rate on registered securities (12.92%), but less on bearer certificates (15.71%).  The maximum rates for this product are 18% (FiaBank) and 16.5-17% (UBRD). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="certificates of Sberbank to bearer interest" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/724802.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Insurance is still possible </h2><p>  With the growing attractiveness of this service, DIA suggested that the banking community consider the option of providing certificates worth 3 million rubles.  Credit institutions need long-term liabilities.  The sources of their formation may be certificates.  According to the DIA, over the past 5 years, Russians have invested 1.4 trillion rubles in these securities.  Which conclusion follows from this?  Given that the average turnover period was 3 years, the likelihood of using certificates as sources of long-term liabilities is very high. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Having free cash, individuals can invert them into financial instruments.  For example, to issue bearer certificates of Sberbank, the interest on which is higher than on other deposits.  To conclude a transaction, you only need a passport.  It is better to present the form for payment at the end of its validity period, otherwise the interest rate will drop to 0.01% per annum, which is extremely unprofitable.  The high rate of return is due to the fact that payments on such investments are not guaranteed by the Deposit Insurance Agency.  Therefore, the bank pays the client a higher fee. </p>
