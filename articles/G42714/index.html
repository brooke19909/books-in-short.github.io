    <p>  The smartphone turned out to be quite attractive.  The use of aluminum and steel gives the device not only a share of solidity, but also strength.  We also paid attention to the front side of the device.  The phone received a completely glass front part. </p><p>  There were no significant changes in the location of external parts.  The front side has become a haven for the speaker, display, indicator and sensors.  <span>The control buttons</span> are located directly on the display.  The back side got a camera, flash and, of course, a logo.  The butt on the right placed on himself a volume control, card slots and a power button.  On the side at the bottom is a speaker, microphone and USB jack.  The plug for the headset is located on the upper end with a microphone. </p><p>  All external elements are also made of metal.  The case is solidly assembled, so it is impossible to detect squeaks and gaps.  The manufacturer said that the device is made of a single piece of aluminum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The overall design of the device is amazing.  Combining solidity and elegance in one device, the manufacturer added unusual colors.  The Huawei P8 smartphone will be available in colors such as champagne, as well as titanium gray. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  Huawei P8 Lite has got 13 megapixels with a Sony module.  In addition, the device received an RGBW matrix, <span>image stabilizer,</span> autofocus and many useful settings.  The quality of the photo is excellent.  The camera has the necessary sharpness and saturation of the image. </p><p>  There is also a video recording in the device.  The phone shoots HD movies at 30 frames per second.  Accordingly, there is no doubt in the quality of the recording. </p><p>  Equipped with Huawei P8 Lite and an 8-megapixel front camera.  Such a front camera will be a godsend for lovers of self-portraits.  The front camera also has a ton of settings and various shooting modes. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The screen installed in the Huawei P8 did not fail either.  The review will appreciate the presence of a 5.2-inch diagonal with an IPS matrix.  The smartphone received 1920 by 1080 pixels and 424 ppi.  An interesting feature was the ability to work with a gloved display. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The number of pixels corresponds to Full HD quality.  Does not cause complaints and the behavior of the apparatus in the sun.  The brightness is more than enough, and the display almost does not fade.  The Huawei P8 will be pleased with the review of angles.  No image distortion.  In fact, one glance is enough to appreciate the best sides of the screen. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  They equipped the device with the new HiSilicon Kirin 930 processor, which has two blocks of four cores with a frequency of 2.0 GHz and 1.5 GHz.  It should be noted that the processor is 64-bit.  The RAM is as much as 3 gigabytes.  The role of the graphics accelerator in the device is performed by Mali-T628. </p><p>  In general, the "filling" turned out to be excellent.  It is noticeable that the manufacturer decided not to save on hardware and install the best in his flagship. </p><p>  Not bad things are with the native memory.  The device has acquired 16 gigabytes, but a little more than 10 GB is available.  Expanding a flash drive is possible up to 128 GB, but there is a drawback.  To install a memory card, the owner will have to abandon one SIM card. </p><p>  The smartphone turned out to be quite powerful.  The hardware part will cope with absolutely all programs and modern games.  The only thing is that the phone heats up a bit under heavy load. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  The smartphone is running on Android 5.0 and will soon be able to switch to 6.0.  The user will install the new version through FOTA or custom firmware without any problems. </p><p>  On top of the system is a proprietary EMUI 3.1 interface.  The shell is perfectly optimized and works perfectly.  Unfortunately, a separate folder for applications was not allocated, and the programs are located directly on the desktop. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  There are also minor flaws.  The device received, definitely, a small battery, a total of 2680 maH.  This would be enough for the middle class, but not enough for an advanced flagship. </p><p>  With average use, the battery will last 8 hours, but active work will reduce its life to four hours.  This is a pretty bad indicator especially for the flagship.  Deteriorating position and non-removable battery.  The only option is careful use of charge and saving on display brightness. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Together with the device there is a set of elements familiar to the modern flagship.  In the box of the device are a headset, adapter, USB cable, instructions, as well as a clip for SIM cards. </p><h2>  Price </h2>

    <p>  The cost of the Huawei P8 cools somewhat.  The price fluctuates around 18-30 thousand rubles.  Of course, the cost is much lower than that of competitors, in fact, this device is attractive. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  An incredible number of advantages makes the Huawei P8 attractive.  Responses of owners note the saturated and bright display.  High resolution has almost eliminated the display pixel. </p><p>  A reliable detail was the reliability of the smartphone.  Users note the excellent assembly and the absence of extraneous squeaks.  Although this is not surprising with such a detailed study of the design. </p><p>  The hardware of the Huawei P8 does not leave indifferent.  Reviews highlight the performance and speed of the device. </p><p>  A well-optimized shell has become a nice feature.  Very often, the device freezes due to a proprietary interface, but in P8 there are no problems with this. </p><p>  Fans of pictures liked the device‚Äôs camera.  Many additional features and detailed settings contribute to high-quality photos. </p><p>  An equally important quality is the rather low cost for the flagship.  The price is more than affordable and able to persuade many users in favor of Huawei. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  An unpleasant moment was the battery of Huawei P8.  Reviews report depending on the outlet.  Some owners noted that the device does not accept car charging. </p><p>  There is also a smaller flaw in the Huawei P8.  Owner reviews are perplexed by the need to sacrifice a SIM card for a flash drive.  A similar problem can be solved only by opting for a 64 GB version of the device. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  We can say that Huawei has found the perfect balance of functionality, design and value.  The novelty has everything that is necessary even for the most experienced user.  Undoubtedly, the P8 will find many fans. </p>
