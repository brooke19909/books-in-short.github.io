    <p>  The first state to establish a fascist regime was Italy.  This system was born here.  The history of fascism began in this country. </p><p>  The state was in the midst of specific political, social, and economic difficulties.  Arising in the 19th century, these problems were exacerbated by the First World War.  As one of <span>the victorious countries, Italy</span> was more than other powers exhausted by the war.  The crisis was in industry, the <span>financial system,</span> and agriculture.  No country in the world has such poverty and unemployment. </p><p>  Italian fascism began to flourish at the end of the war.  The first organizations began to form with an appropriate management system. </p><p>  Despite some setbacks, Italy was one of the victors in the war.  As a result of the battles, the country received Istria with Trieste and South Tyrol.  The government of the country had to cede the Dalmatian coast in favor of Yugoslavia, and the city of Riska (Fiume) was declared free.  It should be noted that the public was unhappy with this behavior of the allied countries and the alleged instability of the Italian government. </p><p>  Against the backdrop of nationalist sentiments, the country's leadership did not dare to intervene in the occupation of Fiume by Italian troops led by Gabriele D'Annunzio (the soldiers did not obey the order to retreat).  For sixteen months, the "black shirts" soldiers ruled the city.  From that moment, Italian fascism with all its elements began to develop actively. </p><p>  The political style, founded by D'Annunzio, took Mussolini as a model.  The latter united its movement into the National Fascist Party.  For a fairly short period, Mussolini managed to form a mass movement, numbering by 1921 about two hundred thousand participants ("black shirts"). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Italian fascism had a militarized appearance, which attracted not only former socialists along with nationalists, but also youth and participants in the war.  All these people saw in the new movement the only force that could radically solve not only national, but also personal problems of the population. </p><p>  The political tactics developed by Italian fascism, in essence, contributed to the transition of the World War into a civil confrontation. </p><p>  The country's leadership not only did not intervene in the actions of the new party, but, on the contrary, encouraged them in every way.  <span>The fascist regime</span> received the patronage of the powerful confederation of landlord unions and industrialists. </p><p>  In 1921, October 27, by order of Mussolini, a <span>campaign</span> began <span>on Rome.</span>  Although the "black shirts" were virtually unarmed, the police and the country's leadership again decided not to intervene in the situation. </p><p>  Instead of preventing the coup, the <span>king of Italy</span> appointed Mussolini as the country's prime minister. </p><p>  In 1924, on April 5, in the parliamentary elections, the fascist party of Italy, together with the liberals (on the general list), received almost two-thirds of all seats.  On the one hand, Mussolini‚Äôs power was based on the king‚Äôs appointed head of government, and on the other, on a single party subordinate to him, as the leader. </p><p>  Since October 1925, the establishment of fascist organizations in Italy began.  These corporations put an end to the free trade union movement.  Twenty-two organizations were created in the country (in accordance with industries). </p><p>  After the establishment of the "corporate system" Mussolini was able to easily get rid of the remnants of parliament.  After that, a chamber was formed of fascist corporations and organizations. </p><p>  Already in November, the "highest laws of fascism" began to be published.  These acts significantly expanded the power of Mussolini by expanding the powers of the government, completely subordinate to the new system. </p><p>  By early 1928, a new election law was passed.  In accordance with it, the "big council of the fascists" made up one list of candidates.  Voters could reject or accept it as a whole.  As a result, in Italy the entire parliamentary system was replaced by a dictatorship. </p>
