Preparation of Russia for the general battle with the horde began with the accession of Prince Dmitry Ivanovich on the Moscow throne.  The Golden Horde in the middle of the XIV century was significantly weakened by twenty years of turmoil.  Khan Berdibek laid the foundation for it by the murder of his father and brothers; Berdibek himself was killed two years later in 1339 by his brother, and over two rulers were replaced on the Horde throne over two decades.  The troubles were ended by the coming to power of <span>Khan Tokhtamysh.</span>  During the time of troubles, the ascent of the Temnik of Mamai occurred, which, being not a legitimate heir, could not seize power in the Horde. </p>

Gathering a huge army, he invited Prince Dmitry Ivanovich to pay a tribute comparable to that which Russia had previously paid to the Golden Horde rulers.  At first, the prince did not want to pay Mamaia, knowing his real status.  However, comparing the strength of the Khan‚Äôs army and realizing that Mamai was currently stronger, he preferred to pay with gold than the life of his people.  However, the Horde Temnik was not satisfied with the tribute, and began to prepare a new campaign to Russia.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Dmitry also decided to prepare for a rebuff.  The gathering of troops began in August 1380, the troops were concentrated near the city of Kolomna.  On August 26, the Russian army set off on a campaign.  Initially, the route was along the river.  Oka, at the mouth of the river.  Lopasnya troops crossed the Oka River and moved south to the source of the Don.  The need for such a route was interpreted as a desire to divide the troops of the Tatars and Lithuanians, as well as an unwillingness to move through hostile Ryazan lands.  Ryazan at that time acted on the side of Mamaia. </p><p>  <span>Kulikovo field</span> is located between the rivers Nepryadva and Don, its landscape is most suitable for battle.  Wet and forested flanks did not give room for the active use of the Tatar cavalry.  Russian troops deployed in battle formation, a guard regiment stood at the forefront, called upon only to engage in battle, substituting the Mongol troops for shelling of Russian riflemen, and then rapidly retreating.  Behind the guard there was a forward regiment, which was to weaken the first blow before the main army entered the battle.  The third line was a large regiment, which was supposed to take on the entire main blow of the Mongol-Tatar army.  On the flanks were the shelves of the left and right hands.  An ambush regiment, led by experienced voivode <span>Dmitry Bobrok-Volynsky,</span> hid in a small fishing line <span>.</span> </p>

The battle began with a duel between the monk Peresvet and the Mongol hero Chelubey, as a result of which both died.  The Tatar cavalry attacked the center, crushing the guard and front regiments, for three hours she tried to break through the defense of a large regiment.  Then Mamai dealt a second blow to the left flank, forcing Dmitry Ivanovich to launch the first reserve, but, unable to withstand the onslaught of the Tatars, the left flank was broken and the Russian troops were on the verge of encirclement.  At that moment, an unexpected blow was inflicted by an ambush regiment, which decided the outcome of the battle, putting the Mongol army on the run.  Russian troops drove the Tatar troops even more than fifty kilometers, the battle on Kulikovo Field was victoriously completed.

It was the beginning of the end of the Tatar-Mongol yoke.  After it, for two years, before <span>Tokhtamysh‚Äôs campaign in Moscow,</span> which he took with the false promises of Novgorod merchants, Russia did not pay tribute to the Horde.  But even after, payments became more and more conditional.  The invasion of Mamaia on Russian land was to completely destroy Russia, turning it into the Horde of Mamaia, who, having not achieved recognition on his land, decided to become a ruler in a stranger.  The battle on the Kulikovo field and the decisive rebuff of Dmitry Ivanovich, nicknamed after the battle - Donskoy, showed the Horde the strength of Russian weapons.

    <p>  The year of the Battle of Kulikovo became the starting point, after which the Mongols no longer risked engaging in open confrontation with Russia.  <span>The Battle of Kulikovo</span> had a huge impact on the self-consciousness of the Russian people, who realized that the Tatars were not only possible, but also needed to be defeated. </p><p>  Exactly one hundred years ago, Russia was officially considered a vassal of the Golden Horde, whose power was completed by the great confrontation on <span>the Ugra River,</span> although none of the parties decided on active hostilities, the Mongols left with nothing. </p>
