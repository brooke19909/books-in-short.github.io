    <h2>  Boxed version </h2><p>  The Samsung Grand Prime phone, as noted earlier, belongs to the entry-level device segment.  Therefore, expect an impressive configuration from him is not necessary.  But still he has some features in this regard.  In addition to the smartest phone, the package includes the following components: </p><ul><li>  Modest entry-level headphones.  It is not necessary to expect a phenomenal sound from them, but for most this will be quite enough. </li><li>  Charger 1A. </li><li>  A familiar interface cord that is used either to charge the battery or to exchange information with a PC. </li><li>  <span>Battery</span> with a capacity of 2600 mAh. </li></ul><p>  On this, the list of all complete accessories is exhausted.  There is nothing remarkable in it, but the list of documentation for this device is different.  In addition to standard operating instructions and a warranty card, there is also a list of supported accessories, and a list of telephone hotlines of the South Korean giant for different countries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The appearance of the smartphone and the convenience of working on it </h2><p>  The design of the S2 and Samsung Grand Prime smartphones has a lot in common.  Reviews without fail indicate this feature of this device.  All the same rectangular apparatus with rounded corners.  The front panel is made of ordinary plastic.  To spoil its surface is not difficult, and without a special <span>protective film</span> in this case can not do (it will have to be bought separately - it is not included in the delivery).  On the front panel is a large 5-inch display.  Under it, three main <span>control buttons</span> are displayed (2 touch and 1 mechanical).  The display has a speaker and a camera for making video calls.  There is no <span>light sensor</span> in this device, and you have to adjust the brightness of the display manually using the slider in the top menu of the operating system.  A typical arrangement of controls and interface ports of this device is, as for the Galaxy line of devices.  A 3.5-mm audio port is brought to its upper edge.  In turn, on the lower edge of the device there is a microUSB format port and a conversational microphone.  The volume control swing is displayed on the left side of the smartphone, and the shutdown button is on the right side.  On the back of the gadget there is a main camera, conventional LED backlight and a loud speaker.  Also here is the logo of the manufacturer.  The sides and the back cover are made of matte plastic.  Damage it is not difficult.  Accordingly, it will be difficult for the owner of this device to do without a cover, and the situation with it is exactly the same as with the protective film - it will have to be bought separately. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Snapdragon 410 is the computing foundation of the Samsung Grand Prime gadget.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  distinguish it a fairly high level of performance.  This is Qualcomm's latest entry-level CPU.  It is based on 4 computing modules ‚ÄúA53‚Äù, capable of functioning at a maximum frequency of 1.2 GHz.  An important feature of it is that it can work with 64-bit programs.  Now this feature cannot be used due to an outdated version of the operating system.  Otherwise, this chip allows you to run any application today.  It is safe to say that its computing capabilities are more than enough for the next 2 years. </p><h2>  Graphics and I / O Subsystem </h2><p>  Not bad is the situation with the graphics card on the Samsung Grand Prime phone.  The characteristics of her "stars from the sky do not grab," but her computational performance is more than enough to solve a problem of any complexity.  We are talking about Adreno 306. This video accelerator allows you to run any of the most demanding toy to date.  And in the next 2 years, problems with this should not arise.  The diagonal of the display, as mentioned earlier, is exactly 5 inches.  It is based on a high-quality TFT matrix.  Of course, such a decision by the developers raises certain complaints, but the image quality of this smart phone is impeccable, and the angles are close to 180 degrees.  Its resolution is 540 x 960. Of course, this is not an ‚ÄúHD‚Äù quality, but the pixel density is sufficient and there is no graininess of the image.  The phone supports up to 5 touches to the screen at the same time, and this is enough to solve any problem. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Photos, videos and cameras </h2><p>  An excellent situation with the main camera of the Samsung Grand Prime device.  Her characteristics are quite average, as of the current moment, but the quality of photos and videos is good.  There is autofocus, an image stabilization system and LED backlight.  It is also based on a 8 megapixel sensor.  The developers were not too lazy to equip its interface with a number of software settings that allow you to configure the camera in 2-3 clicks and get high quality pictures.  The <span>front camera is</span> slightly weaker <span>.</span>  She has a 5 megapixel sensor.  With it, you can also get high-quality photos and pretty good videos.  But she copes with her main task (making video calls) simply "perfectly." </p><h2>  Memory subsystem </h2><p>  The memory subsystem in the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime model is well organized.  Her characteristics in this regard are as follows: </p><ul><li>  1 GB of RAM the most common standard DDR3 to date. </li><li>  8 GB is the capacity of the built-in drive.  At the same time, about 3 GB is occupied by system software, and the remaining 5 GB are allocated to the user's needs. </li><li>  There is also an additional slot for installing an external memory card.  Its maximum capacity can be 64 GB. </li></ul><p>  In any case, these parameters are quite enough for comfortable work on this device. </p>

    <h2>  How long will the battery last? </h2><p>  A sufficiently capacious battery is used in the Samsung Grand Prime phone.  The instruction indicates that its nominal capacity is 2600 mAh.  If a battery with such a characteristic were used in a smartphone with a 4-inch display and a 2-core processor, then it could boast of phenomenal autonomy, which would be 4-5 days with an average level of use.  But this device is much larger.  It has a screen diagonal of 5 inches and a 4-core processor.  Therefore, the battery life will be shorter for the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime model.  Characteristics in this regard are clearly more modest.  With an average load on this gadget, one battery charge will last exactly 2-3 days.  If you watch a movie on it, then this value will decrease to 10 hours.  But there is also a maximum battery saving mode in this smartphone.  In this case, one charge is enough for 4 days, but some of the functions in the device will be disabled. </p><h2>  System software </h2><p>  Under the control of the most popular OS for mobile devices - ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù - this gadget is functioning.  Currently, its version is 4.4.  It is because of this nuance that it is impossible to fully reveal the full potential of this device.  A 64-bit processor is installed in the Samsung Grand Prime phone.  Reviews highlight this nuance in this gadget.  But the current firmware version is 32-bit.  To fully reveal the potential of this device, the OS version must be at least 5.0.  Therefore, the owners of this model of smart phone will have to wait for the update, which should appear soon enough.  Only after that it will be possible to fully reveal the potential of this mobile device. </p>

    <h2>  Gadget Game Features </h2><p>  In terms of support for modern toys, there are no complaints about the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  They say that all gaming applications are currently running on it.  This is ‚ÄúSubway Surfers‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAsphalt 8‚Äù, and ‚ÄúGTA: San Andreas‚Äù.  Everything is within the power of this smart phone.  Moreover, this situation, as noted earlier, will continue over the next two years.  Its performance will be enough even for those applications that have not yet been released. </p><h2>  The interface set of this smart phone </h2><p>  There is nothing unusual in the communication set against the background of similar devices with the Samsung Grand Prime DUOS smartphone.  Reviews highlight such of them: </p><ul><li>  Two SIM cards that work flawlessly on 2nd and 3rd generation networks.  The data transfer rate can reach 7.2 Mbps.  This is enough to download a file of any size. </li><li>  Significantly higher <span>data transfer speed</span> in the case of using the technology "Wai-Fay".  In this case, it can reach a decent 150 Mbps. </li><li>  There is also a Bluetooth standard transmitter version 4.0.  With it, you can connect a wireless stereo headset to your smartphone or exchange a small amount of data with a similar mobile device. </li><li>  The developers did not forget about the "ZHPS".  In this case, both the American GPS and the domestic GLONASS are fully supported. </li><li>  There is MicroUSB.  This port is universal.  If you connect a smartphone to a PC using the interface cord through it, you can exchange data with it.  But when connected to a charger, the battery will be charged. </li><li>  A 3.5 mm audio port allows you to connect headphones with a microphone to your smartphone. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Phone cost </h2><p>  $ 180 is the average cost of a Samsung Grand Prime 530 phone.  Reviews say that it is slightly overpriced.  But, on the other hand, the quality of this device is an order of magnitude better than that of competitors.  Still, a brand is a brand.  In any case, you have to pay extra for owning a quality item.  So in this case: for a quality smartphone you need to pay an additional amount. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of a Phone Based on Reviews </h2><p>  Only two significant flaws in the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime model.  The reviews highlight a low screen resolution (but for an entry-level device this is not so critical) and an outdated version of system software that does not fully allow using the computing capabilities of a smart phone (an update is expected to resolve this issue in the foreseeable future).  But the advantages of this gadget are much greater - productive CPUs and a graphics adapter, an impressive amount of internal memory, a good degree of autonomy.  The list goes on. </p>

    <h2>  What is the result? </h2><p>  The Samsung Grand Prime turned out to be very balanced.  Reviews indicate that this is a great budget smartphone.  It has a 64-bit processor with 4 computing modules on board, and a graphics adapter that can solve any problem, and there is more than enough memory.  He also has no problems with autonomy.  In general, the marketers and engineers of the South Korean giant worked hard "perfectly" - the device turned out to be almost flawless. </p>
