    <p>  Reviews on the Pyaterochka card from Post Bank are mostly positive. </p><p>  As we have already noted, the client receives bonus units not only for purchases at Pyaterochka, but also for all other acquisitions.  If you decide to purchase at another supermarket, you will receive two points for each of twenty rubles, only regardless of the amount of the check.  Thus, your cashback will be 1 percent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Pyaterochka card can be used simply as a funded card.  Suppose you pay with another bank instrument or in cash.  But in this case, you are entitled to bonuses.  There will be a different accrual system.  You get 1 bonus unit for every twenty rubles if the amount in your check is less than 555 rubles.  And 1 bonus - for every 10 rubles, if the amount of the check is higher.  Thus, in this case, the client receives 5 bonus units for every hundred rubles, and the cashback is equal to half a percent. </p><p>  As for the basic bonuses, when calculating with a card at the checkout they will be credited instantly.  In all other cases, they arrive at the buyer's account within fourteen days from the date of purchase.  This also applies to acquisitions in other stores.  You can track the receipt of bonuses either through your personal account on the trading network website, or by looking at this information in a check. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="five card postal bank reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56264/2180623.jpg"></div>

    <p>  We will consider the reviews on the Pyaterochka card from Bank Post below. </p><h2>  Write off points </h2><p>  The course is calculated from a ratio of 1 ruble - this is 10 bonus units.  What is noteworthy, you can pay your entire purchase with bonus points.  But it‚Äôs important to know that after 12 months your bonuses are burned out. </p><p>  There are exceptions to accruing bonus units - these are some low-cost retail products, cigarettes, and some alcohol. </p><h2>  Card activation </h2><p>  The client has several possible ways to activate the card - through a personal account on the website of the Pyaterochka trading network, using a call to the hotline number or SMS message to the short number 7555. In this message you must indicate the card number, your name and your day birth. </p><p>  By the way, only one Pyaterochka card can be registered on one telephone number.  Immediately after activation, you get a personal account and access to it.  It will be convenient here to watch the bonuses and the current balance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="free credit card five" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56264/2180621.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  In the event that even before receiving this card you already had a "Revenues" card, then you will have to choose which of the two you will use to accumulate bonus units. </p><h2>  Informing via SMS </h2><p>  If you signed a notification service via SMS on the day you conclude an agreement with Pochta-Bank, then for two months it will be free for you.  Then she will have to pay - 49 rubles a month.  But if during the billing period you did not perform any operations on the Pyaterochka card, payment for SMS-info services will not be required.  It is important to know that you cannot disable SMS data through a mobile bank or via a hotline - this can only be done at a bank branch. </p><h2>  Reviews on the Pyaterochka card from Bank Post </h2><p>  Despite the obvious advantages of the card, which is discussed in this article, the Internet is full of a variety of reviews about it.  A large number of those who expressed their assessment are satisfied with the availability of the card, many gladly took advantage of the offer available at the first purchase using it, etc. </p><p>  There are those who are dissatisfied with paying for SMS info or performing third-party card transactions.  After all, the card can be used both for withdrawing and for crediting cash, and third-party banking terminals will ask for a commission for this.  But this is a standard situation for all bank cards. </p><p>  There are also complaints about failures in the mobile application and the operation of the Internet bank.  Some people are dissatisfied with the voice menu that turns on when calling the hotline: it is mainly devoted to lending and is made inconveniently, users say. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bank card pyaterochka from bank mail conditions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56264/2180620.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined all the benefits of owning a free Pyaterochka credit card.  Its functions are much wider than that of a regular bonus card.  When used for its intended purpose, the benefits are obvious.  And if you use it as a debit card, it is better to carefully study all the conditions in advance to avoid unwanted fees. </p>
