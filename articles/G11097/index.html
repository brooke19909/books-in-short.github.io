This, of course, concerned primarily the decrees of 1801 and 1803.  The first made it possible for <span>Russian peasants,</span> along with other estates, to buy land as property, thereby destroying the existing monopoly of the nobility to own this property.  The second, which went down in history as the "Decree on Free Tillage", was intended to determine the order of emancipation or vacation of peasants along with the land.  The latter, however, were obliged to pay the landlords ransom in installments, thereby obtaining ownership of the land allotment.

Every year she worsened.  And serfdom at the same time became less and less effective.  Moreover, a similar state of the peasants caused a murmur not only among themselves.  Representatives of other classes were also dissatisfied.  However, the tsarist government did not dare to abolish <span>serfdom</span> : the nobility, being a privileged estate considered the main support of the emperor, categorically did not agree with such cardinal changes.  Therefore, the king had to compromise, maneuvering between the desire of the elite and the needs of the economy. </p>

    <h2>  Year 1803: “Decree on Free Tillage” </h2><p>  He had a very important ideological significance for Russia.  Indeed, for the first time in history, it approved the possibility of freeing peasants together with the land in revenge for ransom.  It was this provision that became the main component of the subsequent reform of 1861.  Adopted on February 20, 1803, “Decree on Free Tillage” provided for the peasants the opportunity to be freed both individually and in whole villages, moreover, with mandatory land allotment.  For their will, they had to pay a ransom or perform duties.  If the obligations of the peasants were not fulfilled, then they were returned to the landowner.  The estate that received the will in this way was called free.  However, they went down in history as free cultivators.  Since 1848 they began to be called <span>state peasants.</span>  And it was they who became the main driving force in the development of the vastness and resources of Siberia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The implementation of the decree </h2><p>  By the mid-nineteenth century, almost one hundred and fifty thousand male peasants had been freed under this law.  At the same time, historians believe that the results of the "Decree on Free Tillage", in force in Russia for more than half a century, were very small. </p><p>  Having switched to a special estate, the "free cultivators" now received and could dispose of their own land.  They could carry out duties exclusively in favor of the Russian state.  However, according to statistics, during the entire reign of Alexander, less than half a percent of the total number of serfs passed into their category. </p><p>  For example, from 1804 to 1805, although peasant landlords were given personal freedom in the Ostsee region, they still had to carry out duties for the allotments of landlord lands at their disposal: corvee and quitrent.  Moreover, free cultivators were not exempt from recruitment. </p>

    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  In addition to the above reasons, another very specific event has become another issue for the publication of the Decree on Free Farming.  Count Sergei Rumyantsev, known for his radical views, expressed a desire to free some of his serfs along with the land.  At the same time, he put forward a condition: peasants had to pay for their own plots.  It was with this request that Count Rumyantsev turned to the emperor to allow him to legitimize the deal. </p><p>  This case became a prerequisite for Alexander to issue the notorious decree, after which free cultivators appeared in Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Paragraphs of the decree </h2><p>  Ten points were introduced into the law, according to which: </p><ol><li>  The landowner could let loose his peasants along with the land.  At the same time, he had to personally agree with his serf on the terms of the ransom and his alleged obligations. </li><li>  The obligations around which the parties agreed were inherited. </li><li>  If the peasant did not execute them, then he and his family and land had to return to dependence on the landowner. </li><li>  Liberated serfs had to be called free. </li><li>  Free farmers had the right to switch to another class: to become artisans or traders, etc. </li><li>  Both released and state peasants were obliged to pay the state tax.  Moreover, they had to fulfill recruiting duties. </li><li>  The farmer was to be judged in the same institution as the state peasant. </li><li>  The released serfs, who had fulfilled their duties to the landowners, could freely dispose of their land allotment.  They could also move to live in other provinces, having notified the Treasury Chamber in advance. </li><li>  Free farmers received state rights. </li><li>  If the land of the peasant or he himself was mortgaged, then at the request of the former owner, he himself borrowed this debt with the permission of the creditor. </li></ol><p>  I must say that the landowner could not use the right received, so the decree was exclusively of a recommendatory nature, and not binding. </p>
