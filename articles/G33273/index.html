Description and feedback</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Astrid Lindgren Museum in Stockholm is located on Djurgården Island.  It is in the very center of the Swedish capital.  It is called Unibakken.  But this museum is completely different from what we are used to.  There are no meritorious shelves with exhibits, no inscriptions "do not run" and "do not touch."  Children's museums in Sweden, and especially Unibakken, are completely different.  Rather, they look like entertainment centers.  Everything here is dedicated to making the guys have fun.  Children can run, jump, have fun as much as necessary and grab everything with their hands.  So the writer herself wished.  Therefore, Unibakken is dedicated not only to Astrid Lindgren.  But let's talk about this in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Astrid lindgren museum in stockholm how to get" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1578607.jpg" width="571"></div>

    <h2>  Stockholm Museum Astrid Lindgren: how to get there </h2><p>  Djurgården Island has a lot of greenery.  There are several museums here - for example, Vasa, dedicated to ships, and an exposition of the northern countries, where there is a real shamanistic drum.  All of them are located in a green area called Galerparken.  Most visitors reach the children's museum on foot.  Indeed, most often tourists come there who walk around the center of Stockholm.  Once on the island, turn right.  And there you can easily find the Astrid Lindgren Museum by numerous signs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The books of the famous writer became the main topic of an interesting exhibition.  In addition, in front of the entrance is her monument.  City transport stops near the island, as well as tourist buses.  And on the island itself, you can sail to the island by boat (river bus).  The museum is open all year.  It is open from ten in the morning until five in the evening.  In the month of July, when white nights arrive, the work of the exhibition is extended to six in the afternoon. </p>

    <h2>  Where fairy tales live </h2><p>  The Astrid Lindgren Museum in Stockholm was opened in 1996.  More than four hundred thousand people come here every year.  The museum is a real square with streetlights, but unusual houses.  The heroes of author's tales live there.  But not only the characters of Astrid Lindgren were allocated a place there.  There are Mummy trolls, Carlson, and Peppy Longstocking, and other heroes of the narratives created by Swedish and Scandinavian storytellers, for example, the Jack of all Trades, the talking kitten Findus, and many others.  Children can go into any home and get to know all the characters, if they are, of course, at home.  He is not forbidden to cook Mummy-mums in the kitchen.  They also offer little visitors to ride a roller coaster, sit on a fabulous throne, fly a plane and ride a Mullah Mek scooter.  Here, children often read the books themselves, watch illustrations for them made by the best artists, and are a little distracted from online games. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  A train </h2><p>  Of course, children come to this museum not alone, but with their parents.  And if they already know all the tales by heart or visited the Astrid Lindgren Museum in Stockholm a long time ago, when they were kids themselves, then they help their offspring by taking the time for them to take a special train.  He is also fabulous.  This train is considered the most interesting museum attraction.  His trailers give you the opportunity to travel to the real world, created by a Swedish writer.  They ride up, down and turn so that small passengers can visit different scenes from books.  They were created according to the drawings of the famous artist, who was a friend of Astrid Lindgren and illustrated her fairy tales.  But know that you can’t take pictures here.  During the trip, the guide reveals the secrets of a fabulous country.  He speaks twelve different languages, including Russian. </p>

    <h2>  Peppy Longstock House </h2><p>  After a train tour, the Astrid Lindgren Museum in Stockholm offers children another interesting place.  This is the Chicken Villa.  This is the famous house where Peppy Longstock lives.  There they can ride horses with a capital letter.  After all, this is her name.  The horse is Peppy's dream come true.  This girl has amazing physical strength, and when she drinks coffee in the garden, she carries the animal with her.  The horse lives on the terrace.  A theater called “Unibakken” also works in the house.  Here the actors represent different tales and stories. </p><h2>  Exhibitions, shops and restaurant </h2><p>  The Unibakken Museum, like all institutions of its kind, has many additional interesting places.  This is an exhibition.  Unlike a permanent exhibition, they change and, as a rule, are gaming.  The restaurant, where parents and children have a snack after a busy tour, looks like a traveling circus.  In addition, they are treated to an excellent raspberry drink, delicious homemade buns.  And from here an amazing view of Stockholm and its canals opens.  And what can visitors of a place like the Astrid Lindgren Museum take with them?  Books of the writer, of course, but still there are toys, various souvenirs, films, posters. </p>

    <h2>  Stockholm Museum Astrid Lindgren: reviews </h2><p>  People who come to Sweden with children often come here.  Many tourists, including those from Russia, who visited Unibakken, write that he has one and only drawback.  These are huge lines.  And the Swedish mentality is such that one cannot take a seat.  If for some reason you had to step back, you must stand at the end again.  But in all other aspects, this museum is, according to visitors' reviews, just a fabulous paradise for children.  Here, adults can plunge headlong into the world of Scandinavian imagination.  But they feel a little sad, because they understand that childhood can not be returned.  And the kids here are just happy.  It’s very difficult for mothers after excursions to get their child out of here.  Children are ready to spend the whole day here and are in complete delight.  The park around the museum is also very beautiful, especially in summer.  Flowering trees, bushes, <span>singing birds.</span> </p>
