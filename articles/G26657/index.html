It is called the <span>Nokia Lumia 620.</span> In general, before buying a particular model, you will have to work hard initially to find out the characteristics and true reviews of the smartphone.  Indeed, in the modern world, this is not so simple.  Especially when you take into account the fact that many opinions on otzovik sites are simply bought.  So let's try to understand this difficult matter.  But first, it‚Äôs worth understanding what the Nokia Lumia 620 is about in terms of specifications.  After all, it is they who make us pay attention to one or another phone.  And, of course, everyone wants to get a powerful and modern smartphone at an affordable price.  If these conditions are met, then the model very quickly receives huge ratings and becomes popular among peers. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  To begin with, for many customers it is now extremely important to have a phone with a good display.  That is, with a big one.  And it is believed that the bigger it is, the better.  But still, this should not interfere with convenience.  For example, for women and children it is better to find a smaller display.  It will be much more convenient than a "shovel" in the hands.  <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 620 has a very good screen in this sense.  But with all this, it is considered non-standard.  After all, by modern standards, this is a pretty small phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 620" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/957467.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The fact is that the screen of this smartphone is only 3.8 inches.  To be honest, most modern models are already 5 inches long.  However, rather small sizes do not particularly interfere with the popularity, versatility and quality of the model.  The display resolution, in fact, is also not very large.  Only 800 by 480 points.  However, for Internet surfing and many games this is more than enough.  But the Lumia 620 is very easy to store in your pocket or small handbag.  So the screen sizes here are quite acceptable. </p><p>  In addition, on the display you will see a very bright and high-quality image.  After all, the Lumia 620 is a phone that can transmit up to 16 million colors.  True, many buyers now are not surprised.  They are used to the fact that all modern models are endowed with such parameters.  However, if you have not used the latest innovations before, then you should try to start with Nokia.  This is a pretty good and high-quality model that pleases everyone with its characteristics. </p><p>  The touchscreen for <span>Nokia Lumia 620 is</span> made with the latest technology.  This makes it quality and resistant to damage.  In addition, the touchscreen reacts extremely quickly to the slightest touch.  Even in the coldest weather, it will work without unnecessary problems.  So you can not worry about this characteristic.  In terms of quality, it surpasses even many modern innovations that are considered more popular among buyers. </p><p>  In addition, this display has its advantages.  For example, scratching it, as already mentioned, is very difficult.  And this is a significant plus.  In addition, such a screen is easy to clean, and also shows the "picture" well in sunny weather or in rain.  Also, the display on the model allows you to quickly remove moisture from it.  Do not be afraid if you are exposed to rain.  After all, the Lumia 620 characteristics allow the surface to retain moisture for some time without harming the components of the phone.  Just what modern buyers need so much. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dimensions and Weight </h2><p>  The Lumia 620 is not that big.  And to notice this was already by the characteristics of the display model.  So now it‚Äôs worth making a little specificity at the moment.  Indeed, sometimes it is the size and weight of equipment that plays an important role in the matter of purchases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 620 specifications" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/957466.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Fortunately, storing the Lumiya 620 is very easy.  After all, it is 115.4 mm long, only 61.1 mm wide, and 11 mm thick.  In principle, an ultrathin model cannot be called.  Nevertheless, it is still quite convenient.  It is especially popular among children and adolescents, as well as women with small handles.  They Lumia 620, reviews about which you and I have to learn, perfectly lies.  So you can pay attention to this model.  Even if you need a powerful smartphone only for games. </p><h2>  Space </h2><p>  For any phone, its memory is also very important.  And here we are talking about two types.  The first is operational.  She is responsible for the power of the model, as well as for the ability to simultaneously use several functions.  The bigger it is, the better.  The Lumia 620 has such characteristics that the RAM corresponds to the quality of the smartphone.  It is 512 MB.  In fact, for a modern phone this is not enough.  You will not be able to run the latest games on it.  But the program is easy.  So no worries.  After all, ‚ÄúLumiya 620‚Äù is not a game model.  Rather, it suits the average business music fan client.  And a lot of RAM is simply not needed here.  Especially if modern toys are not so important to you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You also need to take into account such a factor as ordinary memory.  In other words, the one to which data will be written.  To be honest, this factor often plays an extremely important role.  No matter how good the phone is, with a small space it will quickly lose its popularity.  And this will not particularly affect the manufacturer.  So many try to introduce as much memory as possible into the phone.  In total, Nokia Lumiya 620 has 8 GB of internal memory.  This is not so much, but for most of the population is enough.  True, you can slightly expand this space. </p><p>  How?  Simply take and insert a memory card into your phone.  Unfortunately, this feature is now not available on all smartphones.  And this upsets the buyers.  But the Lumia 620 has it.  You can optionally insert a microSD memory card up to 64 GB in this device.  And with all this, do not worry that the phone will stop working normally.  Even with maximum filling, it will function well.  But it‚Äôs better not to ‚Äúhammer‚Äù all 64 GB.  Leave 1-2 GB of space in reserve.  This will help improve device performance.  Yes, many modern phones offer memory cards up to 128 GB, but they are gaming.  And they are often extremely expensive.  And ‚ÄúLumiya‚Äù is a rather affordable and universal option both for business and entertainment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="touchscreen lumia 620" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/957465.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  System and processor </h2><p>  The operating system and processor for any phone is very important.  And many buyers pay a lot of attention to these items.  Often, the performance and basic characteristics of the device depend on this. </p><p>  To begin with, the operating system of the Lumia 620 is Windows 10 or Windows 8. Depending on the update.  Nevertheless, the base remains the same - Windows.  And this fact pleases many consumers.  After all, this means that your phone will be easily and simply synchronized with your computer.  The Lumia 620 firmware allows you to do this without unnecessary problems.  So the only thing you have to get used to here is with a non-standard interface for the phone.  This is especially true for buyers who are accustomed to working on the "Android". </p><p>  The processor of this smartphone is also quite powerful.  It is dual-core, with a clock frequency of 1 GHz.  In principle, for a modern device, this is not so much.  Only here for business people and those who care about quality, and not the ability to play modern cool toys, at the moment does not interfere.  Especially in cases where you just want to buy an affordable and high-quality phone at a decent price that will serve you for a long time.  To be honest, this is ideal for the average user.  It may seem that a small processor power will adversely affect the performance of the device.  But not in this case. </p><p>  This phone also supports the simultaneous launch of up to ten applications.  On the one hand, this is a lot.  On the other hand, sometimes for a modern user this indicator is sometimes not enough.  After all, I want to simultaneously use many applications and games.  In principle, a modern user with moderate "appetites" in this regard will have more than enough resources.  Don‚Äôt worry about that. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 620 battery" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/957464.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The touchscreen Lumia 620 is of high quality, the screen is also.  The processor and operating system are also quite high quality.  But a more important point in our today's question is the means of communication provided.  After all, initially the phone was created in order to always be able to communicate information quickly to each other.  Well, or just chat.  Of course, over time, communication developed.  And the phones began to support wireless Internet and other signals.  What do we have about Nokia in this sense? </p><p>  The fact is that in this regard, our smartphone is not much different from modern counterparts.  It supports 2G and 3G connectivity.  In addition, it has GPS and GPRS.  Just what is so necessary for people who do not remember somewhere well.  Among other things, you will have the ability to connect to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  It seems to be nothing bad or supernatural.  But there is one small but that can upset some potential customers. </p><p>  More recently, 4G communication was invented.  It is considered the fastest, best, high quality and reliable.  But only the latest smartphone models can support it.  But here ‚ÄúLumiya 620", unfortunately, does not have such an opportunity.  In truth, this is not critical so far.  After all, the 4G signal is not yet fully implemented in the modern life of ordinary people.  But after a couple of years, this smartphone model is likely to lose its relevance.  Especially if 4G will dominate among all other communication options. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Another important point is the battery life of any smartphone.  Everyone wants to get a model that turns out to be powerful and durable.  Of course, it will have to work without recharging for a long time.  Fans of the "Android" are often faced with fast discharge.  What do we have regarding our smartphone? </p><p>  The fact is that the Lumia 620 battery is removable and powerful.  Just like other Nokia phones.  To be honest, this manufacturer is really famous for its batteries.  They work for a long time and almost do not break.  Batteries are also protected from overheating. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 620 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/957463.jpg"></div>

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <p>  How much does the Nokia Lumiya 620 phone work?  It all depends on the intensity of use of the device.  So, for example, in standby mode, he is able to lie for 2 months, with one conversation (stable, but short-lived) - about 3 weeks.  In the case of a long and continuous dialogue, the operating time is 12 hours.  But with the active use of all the device‚Äôs resources at the same time (or with constant games and the Internet turned on), Nokia will last about 4 days.  In principle, this indicator is actually exemplary for most modern smartphones.  Indeed, most models "with a stretch" during the period of active use last 3 days. </p><p>  In addition, the smartphone charges relatively quickly - about an hour and a half.  This time is enough to fully recharge the battery, even if you have brought your phone to a state where it no longer turns on.  Quite decent performance.  And this cannot but rejoice.  For this reason, despite some minor flaws, the Lumiya 620 smartphone is very popular and may be called a worthy device. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The phone of the modern model should be able to perform many functions.  And among them you can find items such as video recording and photography.  So, the camera for the smartphone is also important.  Sometimes you have to refuse to buy a particular model if it has a bad camera. </p><p>  What about the Lumia 620?  To be honest, everything is not so bad as it might seem at first glance.  Like most smartphones, this model has 2 types of cameras - front and rear.  The first is located above the display and serves for selfies and video calls.  Its quality is usually not very good.  In this smartphone, the figure is 0.3 megapixels.  Which, of course, is not very pleasing.  But this is usually enough for a phone.  After all, the main role is played by the rear camera. </p><p>  What it is?  An ordinary camera, which is located on the back of the smartphone.  It is used for photographing and recording videos.  And pictures depend on its quality.  The Nokia Lumiya 620 has a 5MP rear camera.  This is enough to get high-quality photos and shoot good video.  Of course, the Full HD format is not considered here, but nevertheless you will still receive decent videos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="touchscreen for nokia lumia 620" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/957462.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Also there is autofocus, flash and 4x zoom.  You can still set geographical marks, manually edit the picture.  You can even "paint" it in a special editor.  In general, the camera inventory is decent.  He will surely please you. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Now let's try to figure out what prices are on the Nokia Lumia 620.  Description of the characteristics - this is all undoubtedly good.  But it‚Äôs only quite important that the price tag matches the quality of the device.  Nobody wants to overpay. </p><p>  If you need an inexpensive smartphone, then this is a great option.  The fact is that the Lumia 620 costs from 5,000 rubles.  But now in many regions the price is 7,000. And this is the maximum price.  In principle, quite affordable.  Especially when you consider all the opportunities offered to us. </p><h2>  Quality </h2><p>  What can be said about the quality of the phone as a whole?  To be honest, it really pleases.  It is not in vain that Nokia has long been famous for its long-lasting and "tenacious" smartphones. </p><p>  What do customers think about this?  Customers claim that there is no more reliable phone.  It is not only quite powerful for its characteristics, but also ‚Äútenacious‚Äù.  This model does not break - to do this, you need to try hard.  In addition, it transfers water and humidity normally.  Yes, and provides quality communication.  Including the Internet.  So this smartphone is worthy of attention. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Well, now it's time to take stock.  Should we buy a Lumia 620 smartphone with you?  In general, of course, everyone decides for himself.  And no one has the right to point us. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 620 windows 10" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/957461.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  But pay attention to the model is worth it.  Especially if you need to buy a quality smartphone at a decent price.  But just not gaming.  In this case, it would be better to refrain from Nokia and pay attention to Samsung.  It is this company that has recently been producing gaming phones.  But the price of such devices may not please you. </p>
