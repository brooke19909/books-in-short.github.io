    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Residence Mahmoud can be called urban.  Indeed, from the center of the resort of Hammamet it is only a half kilometer away.  The beach is three hundred meters, although the hotel is on the third line.  The location of the hotel is such that it allows guests to find out what the Tunisian coast and its boardwalks, beaches, and visit various interesting places in the region.  Near the hotel there are boardwalks, many cafes and various shops.  Nearby are two nightclubs: Latino and La Pasha.  Among the attractions near the hotel is George Sebastian's villa with a chic garden and amphitheater.  Tourist areas are located to the right of the hotel, the city center - Medina - to the left.  You can get there by taxi, you can along the shore.  The new part of Hammamet - Yasmin with shopping and entertainment centers - is nine kilometers away.  Right next to the hotel is the bus stop 105, which goes to the <span>city ​​of Tunisia.</span>  Opposite the hotel you can catch a minibus next to the city center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Residence Mahmoud 3" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/532293.jpg" width="500"></div>

The famous thalassotherapy is very developed here.  Hammamet is also famous for its beautiful sandy beaches.  Hotel Residence Mahmoud 3 *, the photo of which you see, is just standing near one of the best.  Nevertheless, the area has a good nightlife.  Discos, clubs, bars and restaurants of various categories - at every step.  But people come here not so much to “break off” as to relax at sea, improve their health and, most importantly, to fall into the hands of skilled thalassotherapy specialists who can work wonders.  For this, tourists flock to Tunisia (Hammamet).  5-star hotels in these places are mainly located in the new Yasmin district, while more modest hotels are located in the northern and central parts of the city.  Shopping and entertainment, including for children, are also available in Hammamet.  For them you need to go to the modern Yasmin walking center, where the beautiful Carthageland Park, the Phrigia Zoo and several golf clubs of world significance are located. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Residence Mahmoud" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/534166.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  <span>Tunisia, Hammamet.</span>  3 Star Hotels </h2><p>  Holidays in this country can be convenient and at the same time extremely democratic.  Three-star hotels here are much better than their "cousins" in class in Turkey and Egypt.  The level of service in them is excellent, the food is excellent, and from the sea they are a maximum of five hundred meters.  Young people have a great time here, travel enthusiasts, as well as those who do not want to make a dent in the budget, but have a good time.  Mostly these are city hotels, but each of them has a garden and green areas, a pool and a spa.  True, many procedures are paid, and meals, as a rule - half board.  But the cost of various services in such hotels is always very small.  Treshki can be placed both by the sea and in the city.  The hotels of the latter type are good in that you can always go for a walk, and you do not need to order a taxi to return in the evening.  Residence Mahmoud is one of the best hotels of its kind.  But “Mediterrani”, “Bel Air”, “Club El Busten”, “Furati”, “Zenith” are also very popular with him.  Reviews about them are also very good, especially from tourists who do not bother much about top-class services.  Although masks, body wraps and massages in such hotels can compete in quality with similar procedures in luxurious and “untwisted” hotels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Many aircraft from Russia fly to Tunisia.  Almost all of them arrive at three airports - the capital, Monastir or Enfid.  From there, tourists are usually taken by transfer buses.  But people traveling on their own can get to Hammamet by minibuses (in the local “puage”).  You can still take the train, but the train station is too far from the hotel.  Have to take a taxi.  Therefore, it is better to use a bus.  For example, from Tunisia to Hammamet there is a 105 minibus that stops right outside the Mahmoud Residence Hotel.  From here you can independently go to Carthage, Nabeul or other tourist cities of the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Residence Mahmoud Tunisia" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/533276.jpg" width="550"></div>
