  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Active and passive 3D: which 3d glasses are better?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Due to the fact that human vision is binocular, we have been trying for a long time to reproduce a three-dimensional image of the world in static stereo pictures and movies.  At the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, the film industry is developing at a lightning pace, offering us all new 3D television technologies.  In 2011, the dispute between manufacturers over which 3d format is best sharpened. </p><p>  Leading companies producing three-dimensional televisions have opted for using one of the technologies for creating stereo images.  Namely, LG and Vizio use passive 3D technology, while Samsung, Panasonic and Sony have chosen the active option.  Everyone proves the advantages of their products, and we ask reasonable questions, which 3d technology is better and when, finally, it will be possible to enjoy 3D video without any glasses?  It should be noted that Toshiba is already trying to market the equipment for which glasses are not needed.  In the meantime, buying a 3D TV, you still need to decide which 3d glasses are better - passive, or active. </p><p>  <strong>Passive 3D</strong> </p><p>  Passive stereo glasses are devices that do not require a power source when viewing 3D content.  There are two main subspecies - anaglyph and polarization.  Their main advantage is a low cost.  The cheapest anaglyphs are made of cardboard and glass in two colors.  Creating a certain volume effect, they at the same time make the picture dull and faded, losing some of the color information. </p><p>  Polarized 3D glasses also have two subspecies: linearly polarized and circularly polarized.  To see a stable three-dimensional picture, using glasses with linear polarization, you need to keep your head in an exclusively vertical position.  The reason is that when the content is displayed, one eye observes a vertically polarized image and the other a horizontally polarized one.  This drawback is corrected in the circular polarization method, but its use requires a special filter and a projector, so it is unlikely that such 3D glasses will become widespread. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The advantage of passive technology over active technology is that the viewer sees two images at the same time and the frame rate is not halved. </p><p>  <strong>Active (with shutter) 3D glasses</strong> </p><p>  When asked which 3d <span>glasses are better,</span> manufacturers of active models will confidently name their products.  And to some extent, they will be right.  The image quality in such glasses is really higher (color brightness is not lost) and most consumers choose this type of glasses. </p><p>  For active stereoscopic glasses, you need a source of energy that feeds the shutter mechanism in the lenses.  At the same time, a synchronization device operating using infrared rays is built into the TV display.  Liquid crystal lenses, opening and closing alternately, show each eye a separate image.  Glasses are powered by small batteries. </p><p>  Such glasses are much more expensive than passive ones, due to the high cost of production.  Prices range from 50 to <span>100 dollars.</span>  Most 3D TVs come with only one pair of stereoscopic glasses, so you need to purchase a few more for collective viewing.  The lack of active models can be uneven movement and noticeable jerks.  Image quality depends on the frame rate - the higher it is, the better the effect. </p><p>  To date, the question of which 3d glasses are better remains open.  Passive technologies are pleasing at a low price, but upset by not too high quality.  In active for a smooth picture, you need a high resolution Full HD 1080p, which most recently only plasma panels owned.  Another drawback of active glasses, in addition to their high price, is the rapid fatigue of the eyes and possible headaches.  But while we argue which 3D glasses are better, 3D-TV technology without glasses is rapidly developing, and soon this, today acute, question will disappear on its own. </p>
