Real estate in Krasnodar</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Krasnodar Territory, due to its beauty and unique natural factors, is called paradise on Earth.  Many Russians dream not only to relax here, but also to move here to live from other regions of the country.  The capital of the region, Krasnodar, located about the same distance from the Black and Azov Seas, enjoys deserved popularity.  Real estate in Krasnodar is offered a wide variety - from housing in the private sector to apartments of various price categories in modern residential complexes.  Construction in the city is carried out on a spectacular scale.  Every year, new buildings or entire housing complexes are rented here.  Among them, the Gravity LCD has a rather high rating, the final deadline for which is scheduled for early next year.  We offer a detailed overview of this complex. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  It can be confidently stated that the developer has chosen the ideal place for the construction of RC ‚ÄúAttraction‚Äù.  Krasnodar, like any other city, has several microdistricts that differ in the level of improvement and transport accessibility, as well as remoteness from the center.  The ‚ÄúAttraction‚Äù complex is being built in the micro-district of spare parts - a promising and one of the youngest.  It is only a quarter hour drive from here to the city center by bus or car, and you can even walk on foot if you wish.  The journey will take about an hour. </p><p>  The residential complex "Attraction" occupies a plot of 36 hectares, located in the square of the intersection of Moscow and Solnechnaya streets, which are one of the central.  The official address of the facility in question is Moskovskaya Street, building No. 118. Investors and equity holders find this location very convenient, since there is all the infrastructure necessary for life, including schools, kindergartens, hospitals, shops, banks, and social services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  LCD "Attraction" in Krasnodar has many advantages.  One of them is good transport accessibility.  The most "popular" means of transportation in the city is the tram.  Literally 400 meters from the erected complex there is a ring (end point) of five tram routes at once, using which you can get to any city object.  In addition, buses and minibuses ply along Moskovskaya Street.  Their stop is also next to the complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Attraction Krasnodar" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1948603.jpg" width="497"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  For motorists, the location of the LCD ‚ÄúAttraction‚Äù is also convenient, because so far you can get to any end of Krasnodar without traffic jams and quickly enough or go to Rostov highway.  However, in the future, experts predict some difficulties, due to the large-scale housing construction in the microdistrict and a significant increase in the number of its inhabitants. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Relative to the natural environment is well located LCD "Attraction".  Krasnodar is not an environmentally problematic city in Russia.  The main source of pollution here is motor vehicles, but this is the scourge of any metropolis.  A new complex is being built next to one of the central streets, which means that it is also a busy street, which, of course, is a small minus.  However, the multiple alleys and squares available in the microdistrict significantly improve the situation.  A plus can be considered and beloved by the townspeople park, called Chistyakovskaya Grove, to which residents of the residential complex "Attraction" will be able to walk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="real estate in Krasnodar" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1948598.jpg" width="492"></div>

Regarding Moskovskaya Street, we can confidently say that here the water level rises very slightly, so there are no floods. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  For people who seek not only to acquire property of a European level, but to live in a modern, built using advanced technologies house with a beautiful and convenient house adjoining territory, the ‚ÄúAttraction‚Äù residential complex is oriented in Krasnodar.  It has the level of ‚Äúcomfort plus‚Äù and includes 2 letters, both 17-story.  Externally, the buildings are very stylish and spectacular, although they are not without elements of building classics.  They are built using monolithic-brick technology, which makes them reliable and durable.  Inter-apartment brick walls are made with a thickness of at least 200 mm, and the outer walls are made with a thickness of over 400 mm.  They have three layers: a heater (80 mm thick) is laid on a monolithic base, and then - silicate brick.  The first letter of the complex consists of 7 sections, in which there will be 4509 m <sup>2 of</sup> housing.  The second letter is three-section, its area is almost 2200 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="residential complex Attraction" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1948614.jpg" width="496"></div>

Each building will have several passenger elevators and ramps for disabled people and mothers with wheelchairs.  It will be possible to leave the vehicle for the baby (a stroller or a bicycle) in the entrance area, where it is planned to allocate a special place for this. </p><p>  The builder agrees to equip the adjoining territory of the ‚ÄúAttraction‚Äù complex as much as possible, plant a lot of trees and shrubs on it, including evergreen species, to plant flower beds, tiled paths, build playgrounds for children and sports, to establish comfortable benches for older people. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  In the microdistrict with an already developed and fairly developed infrastructure, the LCD ‚ÄúAttraction‚Äù is being built in Krasnodar.  Feedback from real estate investors about this side of the project is only good.  Diversified shops are located just a few minutes walk from the future complex, among which there is a large Magnit supermarket, specialized stores of building materials, children's clothing, and gastronomic goods.  Near the LCD there is a polyclinic, a hospital, bank branches, a sports club, several kindergartens, a school, and one of the buildings of KUBSTU.  In addition, offices and social facilities will also be located on the ground floors of the letters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Attraction Krasnodar reviews" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1948609.jpg" width="493"></div>

    <p>  A big plus for the LCD will be the so-called third letter, that is, an underground parking lot for 530 cars.

    <h2>  LCD "Attraction" in Krasnodar: construction stages </h2><p>  The developer of this complex is the popular and, according to experts, one of the most reliable construction company SpetsStroyKuban in the region.  She specializes in the construction of residential buildings and is characterized by commitment, high quality work, delivery of facilities on time.  In Krasnodar, SpetsStroyKuban built the complexes Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãCascade, Flotilla, Pirouette, and Trilogy.
