Particularly at risk are mobile devices with which people now almost never part.  They are often dropped.  And it‚Äôs good if the phone fell on a soft surface.  Even if you fall on the asphalt there is a chance that nothing bad will happen.  But if the device fell into a puddle, or did not even fall, and got wet in some other way, this is already unpleasant.  In such a situation, you need to act quickly, without hesitation.  Therefore, it is necessary to know the sequence of actions.  What to do if water gets into the phone? </p><h2>  What you do not need to do? </h2>

    <p>  There are some strange methods, for example, to put the device in a bag of rice, which will draw out all the moisture.  It is also advised to completely fill the phone with alcohol.  What to do if water gets into the phone?  Certainly not to follow such advice.  All this is ineffective, and then it will become clear why. </p><p>  The most dangerous liquids for phones are sea water, water with washing powder or, attention, jam.  Yes, they drop it into him.  And also liquids containing alkali, salts and so on are dangerous. </p><p>  Even if the water that gets into the phone is distilled, not passing electric current, then the garbage that certainly exists inside each device can lead to unpleasant consequences.  What to do if water gets into the phone?  Immediate action must be taken immediately.  After all, even if you dry the device without disassembling it, then over time all the tracks on the board will still oxidize and collapse.  A month later, irreparable problems may already begin.  A drowned phone will still work, but for a long time he will not be able to live like this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, what sequence of actions is needed?

And you need to do the following: </p><ul><li>  Remove the back cover and remove the battery. </li><li>  Brush off all visible drops. </li><li>  Find a dry rag or towel. </li><li>  Remove the housing and remove all fluid inside the device. </li><li>  The board must be washed with alcohol. </li><li>  The same can be done with all other metal parts (this can be done with a brush or in an ultrasonic bath). </li><li>  Dry the device for at least 12 hours. </li></ul><h2>  Detailed description of actions </h2>

    <p>  Removing the battery can not be delayed for a second!  What to do if water gets into the phone?  You need to get it out of the water if it falls there, because even a couple of seconds is enough to get a significant amount of moisture into the holes for the headphones and memory card.  Even worse, if it is water with washing powder.  So housewives should take their phones away while washing.  The battery must be removed as soon as possible, as a short circuit may occur.  In the process of disassembling the device, the SIM card and drive are removed.  All this must be put on a dry towel. </p><h2>  Disassembling the phone </h2>

    <p>  Many users, of course, will carry the recessed device to the service center, but not all masters make high-quality repair of equipment.  Especially if it's a wet phone.  Some do only part of the repair, after which the device can work no more than a month.  Therefore, it is better to understand this issue and do everything with your own hands.  After all, the user himself will treat his gadget much more carefully than the master, who does not care about other people's property.  And with their "help" you can easily and irretrievably lose all valuable information. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  First you need to find instructions on how to disassemble just such a phone model as the user on the Youtube website.

    <p>  This process is probably the most painstaking.  It is better not to use cotton wool, because too much pile remains from it.  It is better to choose a cotton cloth or napkins. </p><p>  Do not use solvent in any case!  In order to wash the board of the device, you can take ordinary ethyl alcohol from the medicine cabinet.  After all, it is available. </p><p>  It is necessary so far to remove the speakers, the microphone and the display.  Then they can only wipe contacts.  Outside, the case does not need to be wiped with alcohol, as this can leave stains and stains, which will ruin the appearance of the device.  The board itself can be dipped in alcohol.  All impurities and oxidations are cleaned from it.  If you do not do this immediately and efficiently, then after a while it will be too late, and you will need to solder it.  If there is an <span>ultrasonic bath,</span> then the board after brushing can be dipped into it. </p><h2>  Alcohol drying </h2>

    <p>  Sometimes it happens that water gets into the phone screen.  What to do?  In most cases, it needs to be replaced with a new one, since even small droplets are undesirable.  The cost of the screen is not very high, but you can find it in specialized stores.  You can also ask for repairs there. </p><p>  If a decision is made on an independent replacement, then you need to do the following: </p><ul><li>  Disassemble the device. </li><li>  Separate the sensor itself from the screen.  If there is a sticky layer, then it can be erased with a fleece soaked in nail polish remover. </li><li>  Install the sensor purchased at the store. </li></ul><p>  Attention, before buying it, you need to make sure that the matter is not in the connector or cable, since often due to corrosion the contacts simply deteriorate. </p><p>  It also happens that water has entered the speaker of the phone.  What to do in this case?  There is no choice: it only needs to be changed to a new one.  The speaker is no longer subject to recovery.  And if water got into the phone‚Äôs camera?  What to do then?  It‚Äôs fifty to fifty: either when it is parsed and dried, the moisture in it will completely dry, or especially sensitive elements will refuse to work and you will have to carry the device to a service center, where they will most likely say that the camera needs to be replaced. </p><p>  These actions will help if your mobile phone gets into the water.  What if this happened?  The main thing is not to panic.  If everything is done correctly, then in a day there will be no consequences.  But it is best to be careful and make sure that the mobile phone does not appear near moisture sources. </p>
