The length of the artificial reservoir is approximately 100 km, and the width is up to 30 km. </p><p>  There are different versions of the origin of the name "Kapchagay".  From the language of ancient Turkic translation means "stone gorge" or "gorge".  According to another version, during the raids of the Dzungars, Kaptagai-batyr (Kazakh commander) crossed over the river in this place and wanted to block its channel with sandbags (for Kazakh ‚Äúcap‚Äù - ‚Äúbag‚Äù). </p><p>  This artificial pond was created to provide the Kapchagai hydroelectric station with water supplies.  It should be noted that this power plant has no analogues in the world of structures of this type.  This unique "sea" is the city of Kapchagay.  The distance from it to the city of Almaty is 76 kilometers.  Residents of many cities of Kazakhstan, and not only come to a water park in Kapchagai. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark in Kapchagai" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2188439.jpg"></div>
