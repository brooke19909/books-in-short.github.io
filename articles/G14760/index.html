    <h2>  The essence of the coefficient </h2><p>  Back in 2013, it was decided to divide the pension received by citizens of the Russian Federation into 2 parts: funded and insurance.  The first component of payments is accrued in the same way as before the reform.  This means that everyone who was born after 1967 will have a funded part of their pensions. </p><p>  Another thing is with insurance charges.  Now this part of the payments is determined according to a special formula for calculating the individual pension coefficient, according to which each citizen receives a certain number of points for the entire time of work.  The main condition, as before, is that the employer annually pay certain contributions for each employee. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Calculations </h2><p>  <span>An individual pension</span> coefficient is determined by dividing two values: </p><ul><li>  The numerator represents all the contributions that were paid by the employer for the year.  At the same time, payments can be made at one of the two existing tariffs today (10% or 16%). </li><li>  The denominator used is ten times the amount of insurance payments for the year.  In this case, the size of the salary is taken into account. </li></ul><p>  The maximum value of this indicator is determined by government bodies.  Today, the salary with which you can take pension contributions can be no more than 80% higher than the average salary in the country. </p>

    <p>  The employer must pay 22% of the employee‚Äôs salary to the pension system.  At the same time, 6% of this amount is an obligatory part.  The remaining 16% can be divided into several shares (depending on the wishes of the employee).  Most often, 6% is allocated to the funded part of the pension, and 10% goes to insurance.  However, at the request of the employee, all 16% can be left to the insurance part.  In this case, the maximum <span>PKI (individual pension coefficient)</span> will be 10 by 2021.  If the funded part is formed, then this value will be equal to 6.25.  To date, the maximum value of the IPC cannot exceed 7.39, when it comes to 10% for the insurance part and 4.62, provided that all 16% is allocated for insurance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of calculating pensions </h2><p>  After the introduction of the individual retirement coefficient, the algorithm for calculating funds for elderly people has changed.

    <p>  If a citizen retires later than the accepted term, then the IPC is additionally multiplied by another amount, depending on the excess of the term of employment.  Also, fixed bonus payments, if any, are added to this amount. </p><h2>  The maximum and minimum value of the IPC in 2017 </h2><p>  An individual retirement coefficient taken into account when calculating a pension has acceptable limits.  If a pensioner refuses the funded part and transfers everything to the benefit of the insurance share, then the IPK will grow annually and reach 10. If the pension is divided into 2 parts, this value will reach 6.25.  However, when the reform started in 2015, for all groups of pensioners there was the same maximum individual pension coefficient (equal to 7.39). </p><p>  For 2017, one IPC point costs 78.75 rubles, and a fixed pension amounted to 4813 rubles.  To start receiving payments at a higher rate, a citizen must confirm the length of service (at least 8 years) and have at least 11.4 points.  Next year, these numbers will change slightly.  In order to receive the insurance part of the pension in 2018, it will be necessary to confirm the 9-year work experience and get at least 13.8 points in the reserve. </p>

    <p>  By 2025, the minimum threshold of the IPC will be about 30 units.  Accordingly, if a citizen does not gain the required number of points, then he can only count on the minimum payments at the base rate. </p><h2>  Individual retirement rate: calculation formula </h2><p>  As stated earlier, calculating the IPC can be done independently.  In order to get the value of an insurance pension, you must use the following formula: </p><p>  (PV * KPV) + (IPK * KPV * SPK) = SP </p><p>  According to this calculation, the fixed payout is multiplied by the bonus coefficient.  The latter is accrued at a later retirement.  After that, the number of points accrued is repeatedly multiplied by the bonus payment coefficient and the cost of one unit of IPC.  After this, the values ‚Äã‚Äãare added up and the final value of the insurance pension is obtained. </p><p>  According to this formula, it becomes obvious that going on a well-deserved rest a bit later is much more profitable. </p><h2>  Example </h2><p>  Consider the calculation of the individual pension coefficient in more detail.  Suppose that a certain citizen Petrova worked as a technologist and now plans to retire.  In 2016, she submitted all the necessary documents to the pension fund, which accrued 6099 rubles to her.  insurance part of the pension and 4,001 rubles.  instant payment. </p><p>  To calculate points, you need to clarify how much at that time was the cost of 1 unit of IPC.  In 2016, this value was 71.41 rubles.  Based on this, it is enough to divide the insurance part of the pension by a coefficient.  The result is 85.4 - this is the number of points earned. </p>

    <p>  However, it should be borne in mind that citizen Petrova worked not only after the pension reform, but before that.  Based on this, it is necessary to add the IPC by 2015 and a similar coefficient after this period, then it will be possible to obtain the current value. </p><h2>  Uninsured cases </h2><p>  When calculating the pension and coefficient, it is necessary to take into account some of the subtleties that were also introduced in the new bill.  These include periods when a citizen received social charges that were allocated to him in connection with: </p><ul><li>  Caring for children under 1.5 years. </li><li>  Passage of conscription service.  In this case, for each year, the coefficient is additionally multiplied by 1.8. </li><li>  Care for the elderly over the age of 80 and disabled people of the 1st group. </li></ul><h2>  System flaws </h2><p>  As in any other model, the new reform has certain disadvantages.  For example, today it is quite difficult to accurately calculate the amount of payments that awaits future retirees.  This is due to the fact that no one knows how much 1 point will cost in a few years.  According to the old model, a pension could have been calculated without problems as a young man.  To do this, it was enough to divide the savings into 19 years. </p>
