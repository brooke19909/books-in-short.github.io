Holidays in Corfu</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Greece includes 1,400 islands, each of which is a gem thrown by the Creator's generous hand into the Adriatic Sea.  Not all of them are settled, and only on 78 islands the number of inhabitants exceeds 100 people. </p><p>  Corfu enjoyed the deserved love of travelers at all times.  A convenient location favored the development of trade and crafts, and modern residents of the island, if not involved in the tourism business, grow olives or grapes.  Since ancient times, these places were famous for their olive oil, wines and the famous Corfu cheese.  They are also popular now, but the main thing that local residents can offer is an unforgettable <span>vacation in Corfu.</span> </p><h2>  Sidari - a beach with all amenities </h2><p>  According to tourists' reviews, although the island is small (64 km long and 32 km wide), the beaches in different places are very different.  Sidari is one of the best among them.  Here is what tourists value most on the sea coast: </p><ul><li>  clean sand; </li><li>  clear warm water; </li><li>  convenient entry into the sea; </li><li>  developed infrastructure. </li></ul><p>  Sidari has it all, plus low housing prices here, which makes it even more attractive in the eyes of vacationers.  If you do not take into account the central beach, crowded with families with children, since there is strong shallow water and you will have to walk about 200 meters to a decent depth, then it is better to turn a little to the side to get to a quiet place. </p>

    <p>  The area is as if divided into 3 parts by rocky ledges extending 300 meters into the sea, forming small bays with a surprisingly beautiful color of water.  There are not many people here, so renting a sunbed and an umbrella is not difficult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Equipped paths lead to any part of Sidari beach from hotels, and Vasilia 4 * <span>(Corfu) is</span> no exception, and traveler <span>reviews</span> confirm this. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Just half a kilometer from the resort village of Sidari, a small hotel Vasilia 4 * is comfortably located.  The northern tip of the island attracts tourists with its unusually picturesque area.  Here are the most beautiful bays and sunsets, the turquoise sea and pristine nature.  Fans of nightclubs and round-the-clock entertainment will not be interested here, as they are concentrated in the central and eastern part of Corfu.  But for travelers who crave silence, beautiful nature and beach holidays, Vasilia 4 * (Greece) is the best suited. </p><p>  The hotel consists of two-story and one-story buildings located in a garden full of vibrant colors and palm trees.  Perhaps the laziest ones will be unhappy that he is on the second line from the sea, but in fact, it takes no more than 5 minutes to go to the beach.  It should be prepared for the fact that the coast in this part is pebble, but fully equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Smooth entry into the water with a gradual increase in depth is ideal for couples with small children. </p>

    <p>  As noted by hotel guests in their reviews, the rooms in it are not distinguished by sophistication, but they have everything for a comfortable stay.  Sometimes there are complaints that the staff does not speak Russian, so he is not obliged to do this.  The main way to communicate on the island is Greek and English. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and entertainment </h2><p>  On the territory of the Vasilia 4 * hotel (Corfu), customer reviews say this, there is a beautiful outdoor pool, and this is perhaps the only entertainment here.  But on the beach you can try different kinds of water sports, parachute, ride a catamaran or just feel like a ‚Äúseal on a rookery‚Äù, surrendering to the power of the sun and the Adriatic. </p>

    <p>  The main guests of the hotel are married or elderly couples, so there is no reason to demand entertainment from him, especially since there are villages with excellent taverns and bars within a short drive where you can arrange a ‚Äúbelly festival‚Äù and get to know the local cuisine very closely.  Most taverns are located on the coast, and they own their own section of the beach, so that you can combine business with pleasure. </p><p>  50 meters from the hotel there is a supermarket where you can buy all the little things you need on vacation and groceries. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Although in every issue of <span>Vasilia 4 * (Corfu),</span> reviews of tourists mention this, there is a fully equipped kitchen, few people use it more than for brewing coffee or tea.  Local taverns and fish restaurants offer such a varied and inexpensive menu that it is simply a sin to deny yourself the pleasure of enjoying the local delicacies. </p>

    <p>  It is important to know: according to local tradition, cafe owners daily put up a sign indicating the dishes and their prices, so you can, without even going inside, decide what you want more or what is more tempting for the price. </p><p>  The menu is dominated by meat and fish dishes with numerous sauces and hot gravy, as well as the famous Corfu cheese and olives of this size and amazing taste, which can only be tasted in their homeland - Corfu. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel Vasilia 4 *? </h2><p>  The international airport is located near the capital of the island, only 38 km from the hotel.  Public transport runs regularly and a one-way trip per person will cost 2.5 ‚Ç¨ if you take the ticket directly from the controller, or 1.5 ‚Ç¨ - in the machine at the bus stop. </p><p>  The island is famous for its good roads, and here you can easily and inexpensively rent a car so as not to depend on anyone. </p><h2>  Attractions nearby </h2><p>  Holidays in Corfu leave no one indifferent, as the generous nature of this island, the hospitality of its inhabitants, numerous entertainments and sights make it possible to make a trip here unforgettable.  Each part of the island has its own set of ‚Äúlures‚Äù for tourists, for example, for couples with children and couples in love, the resort village of Sidari, where the Vasilia 4 * hotel (Corfu) is located, is better. </p><p>  The description given above gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsilence and tranquility, which is characteristic of this place, but this is only an appearance.  Once you move a few hundred meters, you find yourself in a noisy and bright water park with breathtaking slides and pools.  Swim here for free 5 days a week. </p>

    <p>  Also, literally 35 kilometers from it is the capital of the island of Kerkyra (it is also called Corfu Town), where everyone can find entertainment to their taste.  Particularly impressive is the history of the island, which is based on its constant capture by the Spartans, then the Romans, then by the Turks or the Venetians, and the stubborn desire of the locals to find freedom. </p><p>  At one time, representatives of the royal families rested on this island, thanks to which there are palaces in its architecture, and the Old and New fortresses built during the Venetian rule testify to the defense. </p><p>  No less than architectural monuments are of interest to the guests of Vasilia 4 * (Corfu), the reviews of most of them confirm this, the holy places and natural attractions that this place is famous for, because it is not for nothing that Jason and Medea were once married on this island.  At least local legends claim this. </p><h2>  Legend of sidari </h2><p>  One of the most legendary and romantic places on the island is the beach with the Channel of Love, located just six hundred meters from the Vasilia 4 * hotel.  He is famous for the fact that if a lonely person manages to swim along it, then he or she will be destined to meet his soul mate. </p><p>  Oddly enough, but apparently, the passionate desires of unmarried women are doing something with this place, since some tourists who have conquered the Canal of Love really get married in a fairly short time.  For married couples such a swim guarantees a long and happy life in marriage. </p><p>  Such legends are a guarantee that the Corinthians will not end in the clientele, but the island itself conquers the hearts of the guests. </p>
