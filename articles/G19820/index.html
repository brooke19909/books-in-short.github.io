Often they are faced with a problem such as a lack of space in the refrigerator.  In addition to ready-made dishes, it is also necessary to place in it products that are stored under special temperature conditions.  Buying two units is not always cost-effective, so <span>manufacturers of household appliances</span> offer an alternative solution - double-leaf refrigerators for the home.  They are distinguished by their original design.  The buyer will also be pleased with the innovative technologies that such devices are equipped with.  The non-standard approach of the developers allowed us to get a roomy and functional refrigerator in the end result. </p><p>  The assortment includes freestanding and built-in models.  The first ones are still more popular, however, the second option is gradually gaining its customers.  Due to the fact that there are many furniture sets on sale that are equipped with a special mounting system, installation will not take much time.  Operational characteristics will satisfy even a demanding user, and a modern stylish design will only complement the already large list of advantages. </p><p>  Prices for double-wing refrigerators are rather big.  The cost of budget models starts at around 40 thousand rubles.  And for those units that are equipped with additional functions, you will have to pay over 100 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="double wing refrigerators" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1879555.jpg" width="583"></div>

Double wing units have two doors.  Each of them has a separate camera.  The freezer can be located both on the side and bottom (in the entire width of the device).  Inside, a large number of shelves and drawers are equipped.  They are designed for different groups of products.  Optimal storage conditions are provided by specially selected <span>temperature conditions.</span> </p><p>  <span>The double-wing refrigerator</span> has impressive <span>dimensions</span> .  The total volume of the camera is more than 500 liters.  The width of the case can vary from 80 to 125 cm. The maximum depth indicator is 91 cm, for built-in units - 60 cm. As for the height, the largest models reach 2.15 m. The volume of the freezer starts from 180 l, and the refrigerator - in with an average of 300 liters. </p><p>  Design and dimensions are not the only differences between this type of refrigerator.  The heat exchanger in them is located in the lower part, and this allows you to install it close to the wall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="double wing refrigerator" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1879556.jpg" width="446"></div>

    <h2>  Filling </h2><p>  The double-wing refrigerator impresses with the volumes of the <span>inner chambers.</span>  A significant advantage is that the developers have optimally thought out their content.  Each camera is competently divided into zones.  The compartments maintain the optimum temperature calculated for certain product groups.  Such conditions make it possible to store them for a long time without loss of useful properties. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What is behind the doors of these refrigerators?  Two <span>cameras: freezer</span> and refrigerator.  The latter is divided into compartments: </p><ul><li>  for drinks; </li><li>  with zero temperature; </li><li>  with adjustable humidity. </li></ul><p>  The beverage storage area cools more than the rest of the chamber.  The difference is about three degrees.  For ease of use, the height of the shelves can be adjusted. </p><p>  The zero-temperature compartment is cooled by a stream of air from the freezer.  Used for storing <span>perishable foods.</span>  Many users call this compartment a "freshness zone." </p><p>  A special place is intended for storing greens, fruits and vegetables, in which humidity can be regulated.  If necessary, the user can, at his discretion, turn on the supply of dry air. </p><p>  There are several drawers in the freezer.  They maintain the temperature regime from -18 ¬∞ C and below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="double door refrigerators for home" class="if" height="490" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1879557.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Technical equipment </h2><p>  All double-wing refrigerators are equipped in accordance with modern requirements.  The most popular technology is No-Frost.  Thanks to its use, there is no need to frequently defrost the unit.  Inside the device, special fans are installed that circulate air throughout the chamber.  Also, using this technology, when closing the door, the temperature regime is quickly restored to optimal values.  With the formation of condensate, an ice crust does not appear in the chamber, since it flows into special compartments, after which it evaporates naturally. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the assortment range, manufacturers represent units equipped with inverter compressors.  These models have significant advantages.  First of all, they work completely silently, while consuming little electricity.  They provide for smooth temperature control.  Such refrigerators are characterized by a long service life. </p><p>  The disadvantages of units with an inverter compressor include a high price.  Also, they are undesirable to use in those places where power fluctuations often occur that will provoke system failures.  In such conditions, it is better to install devices with linear compressors. </p><p>  It is also worth talking about the protection systems that double-wing refrigerators are equipped with.  Almost all models emit an open door signal.  The set temperature is controlled by thermostats.  There is also protection from children. </p><h2>  Additional functions </h2><p>  Refrigerators with two doors are often equipped with additional options that significantly affect their cost.  The most common is ice production.  The device works by means of a special generator, which is connected to a pipe with drinking water.  It is important not to refuse to install a cleaning filter, as this may affect the operation of the unit. </p><p>  In more expensive models, there may be such functions as a built-in bar, a system for absorbing odors and self-diagnostics, the ability to connect to the Internet and other options. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  If buyers still have doubts about whether to purchase double-leaf refrigerators, then the list of advantages will finally dispel them. </p><ul><li>  The lower location of the heat exchanger, which allows you to install the units close to the wall. </li><li>  The presence of a system that prevents the formation of dust greatly facilitates the maintenance of equipment. </li><li>  High protection of the radiator with a metal shield. </li><li>  Excellent quality of the walls of the inner chambers, guaranteeing their durability and durability. </li><li>  Tempered glass shelves that do not scratch or bend under the heavy weight of pots. </li><li>  Unique automatic defrost system - No Frost. </li><li>  Low noise during operation. </li><li>  When the refrigerator is disconnected from the power supply, the optimum temperature inside the chamber is maintained for at least five hours. </li><li>  A wide range of models with different colors. </li><li>  Using innovative technologies. </li><li>  Optimum thought over zoning of cameras and big capacity. </li></ul>
