An exception is the territory called Sunny Beach.  Every tourist who has visited the country at least once knows about this resort.  Versatility brought him fame, because family people with children and young people looking for adventure can relax here.  The first type of visitors is better to settle in the north, where a more relaxed atmosphere.  Young people from Europe usually settle in groups closer to the center.

You can choose a place of residence to your taste, the only question is price.  A separate advantage of this resort are the beaches that are marked with the ‚ÄúBlue Flag‚Äù.  This is a sign of the highest quality, because on the entire Black Sea coast it is better not to find a place with fine sand.  Those who come here with children should be wary.  The entrance to the sea is not gentle enough for babies to swim and the waves are too active in this part of the sea. </p><p>  Another small drawback is the ability to meet the trash, although cleanings are carried out regularly.
