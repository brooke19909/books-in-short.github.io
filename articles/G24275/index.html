Among all known platforms, iOS has distinguished itself.  It allows you to set a variety of passwords on your smartphone / tablet.  For example, for a lock screen or an Apple ID account.  Next, we will try to find out how to bypass the password on the "iPhone" in a particular case.  How good is this?  And is it possible to encounter failure in the process of implementing the task? </p><h2>  Bypass option </h2><p>  Can I bypass the password on the iPhone?  And if so, what needs to be done? </p><p>  Unambiguous answers to the questions asked will not work.  The thing is that users can reset the password of the lock screen of the "apple" device, but nothing more.  Hacking the key from Apple ID does not work.  If you try to do this, your smartphone / tablet will turn into a useless pile of plastic and metal. </p><h2>  Ways to bypass the lock screen </h2><p>  How to bypass the password on the "iPhone"?  The code from the device‚Äôs lock screen can be reset in various ways. </p><div class="photo" data-original="4pda.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="password reset via 4uKey" class="if uuid-3127272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3127272.jpg"></div><p>  For example, using a special utility or by using: </p><ul><li>  iCloud </li><li>  iTunes </li><li>  recovery mode. </li></ul><p>  All of these methods will be discussed below.  As a rule, there is nothing difficult in their implementation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hacking apps </h2><p>  How to bypass the password on iPhone 5?  You can use a special utility.  She is called 4uKey.  With its help, it will be possible to reset the settings of the "apple" device and install a new firmware. </p><p>  Guidelines for working with this application are as follows: </p><ol><li>  First you need to run 4uKey.  This application must be installed in advance on a computer. </li><li>  Connect the "apple" gadget to the PC using a cable. </li><li>  Wait for device synchronization. </li><li>  Agree to install new firmware on a mobile device. </li><li>  Wait for the process to complete. </li></ol><p>  The system will inform the user about the successful reset of the password and the installation of the firmware on the iPhone.  Thus, you can hack the phone quickly and easily.  But this technique cannot be considered official. </p><h2>  ITuns and password </h2><p>  I wonder how to get around the password on the "iPhone"?  The next method of solving this problem is to work with a proprietary application called iTunes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ibobr.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to reset lock screen password" class="if uuid-3127275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3127275.jpg"></div><p>  Want to reset your Apple Phone Lock Screen Password?  To do this, you need: </p><ol><li>  Connect the smartphone to the computer, while launching IT. </li><li>  Select a particular phone in the menu of synchronized devices. </li><li>  Open the "General" section. </li><li>  Click on the button with the signature "Restore". </li></ol><p>  Next, you will be prompted to select a recovery point for your smartphone.  At the end of the operation, the user will receive an unlocked iPhone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cloud service </h2><p>  How to bypass the password on iPhone 4?  It was previously said that a similar task can be carried out through iCloud.  This reception will have to be prepared in advance.  Namely - enable the option "find iPhone".  Without it, the mentioned solution will not work. </p><p>  To reset the set of numbers from the iPhone lock screen through a proprietary "apple" cloud service, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Visit the iCloud homepage. </li><li>  Log in to your Apple ID. </li><li>  Click on the "find iPhone" button. </li><li>  In the window that appears (above), select the device whose password you need to reset. </li><li>  The reset button is pressed and wait for the result. </li></ol><p>  Now what?  The user must carefully study the system warning, and then confirm the reset of the mobile device.  Just a couple of minutes - and you can use your phone again. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to bypass password on iphone 5" class="if uuid-3127359" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/3127359.jpg"></div><h2>  Reset Mode for Reset </h2><p>  How to bypass the password on the iPhone in another way?  If the previously studied tricks did not satisfy the user, he can resort to another interesting method.  It's about working with the device recovery mode. </p><p>  In general, the instruction for the implementation of this technique has the following form: </p><ol><li>  Connect iPhone to computer and iTunes. </li><li>  Enter the gadget in recovery mode. </li><li>  Select the "Reset" command among the proposed options. </li><li>  Wait. </li></ol><p>  It is done.  As soon as the operation is completed, the user will be able to use the "apple" device - the screen lock will disappear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="support.apple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Password reset" class="if uuid-3127273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3127273.jpg"></div><h2>  Password Reset Features </h2><p>  We figured out how to get around the password on the iPhone.  What will the use of one of the proposed techniques lead to? </p><p>  The phone will be reset to factory settings, and the content will be erased.  You can restore it, but only using authorization in Apple ID.  Leave the content, but you can‚Äôt get rid of the numeric combination of the lock screen. </p><h2>  How to activate recovery mode </h2><p>  Some users are wondering how you can enter an "apple" phone in recovery mode.  The answer to this question directly depends on the model of iPhone used. </p><p>  For devices of iPhone 6 and older versions, the recovery mode is activated by holding down the Home and Power buttons.  If you need to enable the mentioned option on newer devices, you will have to use the "Power" and "Volume Down" elements. </p><h2>  About Apple ID Password </h2><p>  I wonder how to get around the password on the "iPhone 5" or any other "apple" device?  The answer to this question will no longer make you think twice.  But what if you need to bypass the Apple ID? </p><p>  In this case, you can reset your password using e-mail or security questions.  It is also allowed to return access to the "apple" account through the support service.  For example, by phone or by filling out a special request form. </p><div class="photo" data-original="setphone.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reset password apple id" class="if uuid-3127279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3127279.jpg"></div><p>  During password recovery, Apple ID content will remain intact.  The user will simply change the data for authorization in the system.  At the same time, the settings and user information, subscriptions and utilities on the smartphone will remain intact. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We got acquainted with all the existing ways to reset the password on the "iPhone".  Even a novice Apple user can cope with this task. </p><p>  Hacking an Apple ID, as already mentioned, is not recommended.  Any attempts to find out the combination from the "apple" profile will lead to the collapse of iOS. </p>
