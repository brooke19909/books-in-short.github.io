Overview, description and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Israel is popular with Russian tourists, and not with them alone.  Pilgrimage to holy places (Jerusalem is recognized as a special city in three world religions), <span>mud</span> treatment of the <span>Dead Sea</span> and, of course, beach holidays.  Israel, despite its modest size, can boast of the length of the coasts.  From the northern borders of the state, the “city of the crusaders” of Acre, to Eilat, magnificent beaches stretch along the border with Egypt.  And the pearl of the Mediterranean Sea among the resorts of Israel is Netanya.  This city is not in vain gathering its tourist harvest every year, from May to October.  The resort is famous as the most party place in Israel.  As many as eleven kilometers of beaches guarantee everyone who wants a place in the sun.  And where to stay at this resort?  In this article we will look at the best hotels in Netanya.  In the preparation of the review, we first of all took into account the reviews of tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Netanya Hotels" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1488255.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Netanya specifics </h2><p>  This resort is the exact opposite of ancient and pious Jerusalem.  Netanya is full of ultra-modern buildings, wide promenades, and shopping centers.  But the main distinguishing feature of the resort is the feeling of endless celebration.  Discos, bars, clubs, cafes on the beach - this is what attracts the youth of Netanya.  Hotels in the city for the most part have two to three stars.  Reasonable prices for housing and food make the resort even more popular.  It is chosen not only by tourists from abroad, but also by Israeli youth in the capital.  After all, from Tel Aviv to Netanya, only an hour and a half by car.  Eleven kilometers of the coast is divided into eight beautifully equipped beaches: from Blue Bay to Poleg.  They have everything that your heart desires.  Shower, toilets, fountains with drinking water, paths for people with disabilities, changing rooms, sports grounds and much more.  Enough in Netanya and attractions.  So the rest at this resort promises to be eventful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Netanya hotels reviews" class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1488256.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are fabulously luxurious hotels and modest hotels without any stars.  But the level of service in them will still be very high.  In order to find suitable housing for a low price, you do not need to go to the outskirts of the city.  Almost the entire hotel base is concentrated in a few minutes of leisurely walking from the central square of Ha Atzmaut.  You can go along the trading artery of Netanya - Rehov Ha-Meleh David - to the north or go down the big streets to the south - you will find a lot of hotels.  Moreover, due to the elongation of the resort along the coastal strip, it will be within easy reach of the sea.  Reviews say that in Netanya, you can rent apartments from private individuals.  The minimum rental period is three days.  More tourists say that prices are very dependent on dates.  In summer, on weekends and on Jewish holidays, they take off almost twice.  Private sector prices in summer range from fifty to seventy-five euros per person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="3 star hotels Netanya" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1488257.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Five Star Hotels in Netanya </h2><p>  There are not many of them, but still they are.  Those who like a quality vacation and “do not stand the price” have plenty to choose from.  With a rating of "very, very good" and a rating of 8.4, the See Seasons Hotel leads (from one hundred and fourteen euros per night).  This hotel stands on a cliff in the very center of the city.  It offers panoramic views of the Mediterranean Sea, and a private beach with elevator access.  Another hotel - Ramada Hotel &amp; Suites also earned a large number of compliments.  It is located on the front page near the sports complex "Sar-Tov" (Netanya).  Hotels “David Tower” and “Island Suites” conquer the level of service and luxury rooms.  In the first hotel, Peter Hammel, a legendary man, works as a chef.  To try the dishes prepared by him, tables are reserved in advance.  Island Suites is owned by the Oceanos hotel chain, and that’s it.  The luxurious rooms of the hotel have two bathrooms, a kitchen, bright and spacious bedrooms, decorated in stylish black and white colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Residence hotel netanya" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1488262.jpg" width="600"></div>

Of these, King Solomon enjoys the highest demand among tourists.  This hotel with breakfast is located on the first line of the sea, and it takes ten minutes to reach the famous beach with an elevator.  The central Independence Square and Herzl Street are even closer.  The Blue Weiss Hotel is located on the Sironit promenade, in the heart of Netanya.  Hotels in this area are most in demand among tourists.  Sironit Beach is accessible from the Blue Weiss Hotel by a special elevator.  "Carmel" reviews are called apart-hotel.  The rooms have everything you need for self-catering.  And this hotel is located on the first line of Herzl beach.  Another great Quartet is Blue Bay.  It is located in the northern part of the resort, away from the hustle and bustle, but on the first line of the Mediterranean Sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel residence netanya israel" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1488264.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Three-star resort hotels </h2><p>  3 star hotels in Netanya are the most requested.  After all, the resort uses the image of a youth vacation spot.  Therefore, these inexpensive, but quite decent hotels can not be counted here.  The ideal ratio for the price and quality of the reviews was called “Mizpe Yam Boutique Hotel”.  It is located in the center, on its roof there is a sun terrace and, among other things, there at any time (except Shabbat) they give free coffee, tea, cocoa, drinking water. </p><p>  “Zhinot Yam” was liked by tourists for its location.  Leonardo Central Square is a three-minute walk away.  In general, reviews are advised to choose three-star hotels on the second line.  And not far from the sea, and prices are lower (with the same quality of services).  Margoa Hotel Netanya is located in a prestigious area, close to the elevator.  There are very comfortable rooms, pleasant in communication Russian-speaking staff.  The Galil Hotel impresses with the fact that there is a supermarket directly opposite and there are many cafes around.  This hotel is located on the second line. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best hotels of netanya" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1488270.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Residence Netanya Hotel (Israel) </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists repeatedly mention this hotel.  She leads the user likes rating.  Travelers especially like the location of the hotel.  It is located on a high bank, so the panorama from the balconies of the rooms opens up simply gorgeous.  The elevator to Sironit beach is just around the corner, the wonderful city promenade is half a meter away.  The rooms have a refrigerator, an electric kettle, sets for self-preparation of hot drinks.  But there are pluses in this “treshka” that you cannot subtract on the hotel’s official website.  Reviews say the Residence (hotel, Netanya) is the humble sister of a more expensive hotel.  And guests of the "treshka" can access the pool, gym and sauna of the "four", owned by the same owner, for free.  It’s called like - “Residence Beach”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Netanya hotels israel reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1488285.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Budget hotels </h2><p>  The place of youth parties, Netanya, provides hotels with any thickness of a purse.  Among the hotels there are those that even a student can afford.  And here Israel presents surprises.  It turns out that cheap is not always bad.  Take, for example, the Kew Hotel.  There are only two stars on the facade.  What's inside?  Pool, gym, in-room fridge, coffee / tea maker, safe, TV, minibar, hairdryer in the bathroom, free high-speed internet access ... Tourists' reviews say that at first they did not even believe that such a level of service could be funny money.  But budget hotels are small.  Groups are not populated there, they are designed for independent travelers. </p><h2>  Travel tips for tourists </h2><p>  Netanya hotels reviews are described as quite decent.  Of course, there is no capital charm in them, as in the hotels of Tel Aviv, but the level of service remains high.  Reviews advise against choosing first-line hotels.  Netanya stretched a narrow strip along the sea, to the beach from any place at hand.  Another thing is the central regions.  If you want to be close to the fun cycle, choose a hotel near Sironit Beach.  Given the high cost of food in Israel, it is better to stay in apart-hotels with a kitchen. </p>
