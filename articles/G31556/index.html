  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to unlock the phone?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among the many existing ways to unlock the phone, well-tested ones stand out, suitable in most cases for absolutely all models of modern mobile devices.  The article will describe several general principles with which you can try to solve a similar problem. </p><p>  <strong>How to unlock a phone with a pin code?</strong> </p><p>  Locking the phone due to the owner forgotten PIN code, which is required to be entered after turning on the device, happens most often.  To avoid such troubles, immediately after purchasing the device, turn off the function in the settings to display the mention of entering the code each time you turn it on.  If this option is not acceptable, do not forget to record the code in paper or electronic version and save it in an easy-to-remember place.  If the code is completely forgotten and it is not possible to remember it, you can contact the mobile operator in the service center, which will help solve the problem by restoring it. </p><p>  <strong>How to unlock the phone using special programs?</strong> </p><p>  In the case when a special password is used to protect the phone, which one user knows and is forgotten, this is also not a cause for panic.  Those models of cell phones that can be connected to a computer (and this is almost all modifications) lend themselves to flashing, which in no way affects the continued smooth operation of your phone.  This is done in the following way: several small programs for generating the unlock code are downloaded from the Internet, their subsequent application can unlock almost every model.  In a similar way, only using other programs, you can easily unlock the phone‚Äôs <span>memory card</span> .  The software on some sites is available free of charge for free download or for a fee. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>How to unlock the phone code using the operator?</strong> </p><p>  It also happens that when buying a mobile device, it is necessary to adhere to the previously agreed conditions for connecting to a particular telecom operator, excluding the possibility of using another SIM card.  In Russia, this option is not so relevant, but, nevertheless, it must be considered.  The first step is to make a call to the service provider to the support service and ask a question about a possible unlock, and if they refuse you, there‚Äôs a direct way to find a site where you can get a code via IMEI phone.  On such sites, most phones of currently popular brands lend themselves to unlocking. </p><p>  <strong>How to unlock the phone by contacting a service center?</strong> </p><p>  In the most <span>hopeless situations,</span> you have to take the last opportunity and take the phone to the service center, where after you pay, as a rule, not too much money, they will try to help you.  Well, if this doesn‚Äôt help either - a truly unique phone is in your hands, it‚Äôs impossible to use it (sorry, of course). </p><p>  <strong>How can I unlock a phone, for example, a Samsung brand?</strong> </p><p>  We must try to remove the lock using the partial reset code (Custom Eeprom Reset) - * 2767 * 2878 #. </p><p>  But you should not count on the fact that this method will be able to unlock the SIM card or performed by the operator.  To unlock, try the following: </p><ul><li>  remove the SIM card and turn on the mobile device without it; </li><li>  enter the code * 2767 * 2878 #; </li><li>  the phone should disconnect; </li><li>  press the power button; </li><li>  inclusion will not occur, but the phone will blink intensely; </li><li>  after the LED stops flashing, turn on the cell phone again; </li><li>  by default, the code will be set to ‚Äú0000‚Äù (‚Äú00000000‚Äù) on the phone. </li></ul>
