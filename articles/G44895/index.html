    <p>  Tavda (Sverdlovsk region) received the status of a city only in 1937.  The name was given in honor of the river on whose banks it stands.  And the word ‚Äútavda‚Äù itself came from the Mansi dialect ‚Äútaut‚Äù, which means ‚Äúriver‚Äù. </p><h2>  Infrastructure development </h2><p>  Thanks to the railway station, the town begins its path of industrialization.  In particular, there are mechanical and hydrolysis plants, a cloth factory, a fish factory.  Due to its proximity to the forest area, plywood production, a timber mill and a ski factory are developing in the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Characteristic </h2><p>  Tavdinsky urban district, the center of which is the city of Tavda (Sverdlovsk region), consists of 43 settlements.  All are subordinate to the administration.  The nearest major cities are Yekaterinburg (360 km away) and Tyumen (100 km away). </p><p>  Transport in Tavda - bus and rail.  A few years ago, transportation was carried out by river, but now they have stopped. </p><h2>  Economic crisis </h2><p>  Until recently, the city of Tavda was one of the largest centers of the <span>woodworking industry in the</span> country.  However, after the crisis of the 90s and 2000s, most enterprises ceased to exist.

    <p>  Agriculture is practically not developing here.  There are several private small farms, the main direction of which is dairy cattle breeding. </p><h2>  Holiday Village "Spring" </h2><p>  On the outskirts of the city is a spa.  It is worth noting that <span>hot springs of the Sverdlovsk region</span> are famous throughout the country <span>.</span>  Tavda is a city where people come to improve their health.  The recreation center "Rodnik" is in the top 5 of the "Best Hot Springs of the Urals".  The Tavda hydropathic clinic has been operating since the middle of the 20th century.  It was in 1959 that a source of thermal water was discovered, saturated with useful trace elements.  Scientists have revealed in it a high content of iodine, bromine and sodium chloride.  Such water is useful as bathtubs and a drink for problems of the musculoskeletal system and gastrointestinal tract. </p><h2>  Administrative divisions and attractions </h2><p>  The city itself is not very large in area.  In total there are about 260 streets.  The main one is st.  Lenin.  It contains the largest administrative and cultural buildings of the city.  One of the attractions is the Museum of the forest and woodworking industry.  Initially, he positioned himself as a local historian.  However, over time, the forest became the main component of the museum: interesting exhibits on the nature of the region, industry and the indigenous population were opened.  The museum itself is very informative, containing a variety of information within its walls. </p>
