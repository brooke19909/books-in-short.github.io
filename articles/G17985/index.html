    <p>  The hotel is open throughout the tourist season until the beginning of October.  It is best to go here in July and August.

Hotel "Dolphin" 3 *, reviews of which are both positive and negative, noticeably loses to many of them as a service.  However, it has its advantages: </p><ul><li>  Good location.  To the beach to go just a few minutes on a small log beam.  Other activities are nearby. </li><li>  Small but tidy and tidy room.  Cleaned efficiently, linen changed on time. </li><li>  Monotonous but very tasty breakfasts.  There is always a lot of food, so none of the visitors will remain hungry. </li><li>  All windows overlook the sea.  Moreover, the higher the floor, the more beautiful the view and the quieter the decor.  And on the ground floor, trees obscure the entire view. </li><li>  The hotel is far from the youth part of Sunny Beach, so it is always quiet and calm. </li><li>  Quick check-in by numbers, no need to wait for several hours at the reception. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Tourists are generally satisfied with their stay at this hotel.  But he also has its drawbacks.  For some, they are insignificant, but for someone they can pretty much spoil the impression of relaxation.  We list the main disadvantages that guests who have visited the Dolphin Hotel note: </p><ul><li>  The rooms are in need of repair.  There is no hairdryer in the bathroom, and soap is given out once for the whole rest. </li><li>  Monotonous breakfasts. </li><li>  There are a lot of insects everywhere, day and night.  Often from their squeak it is impossible to fall asleep. </li><li>  Shallow sea.  Reaching buoys, an adult will plunge underwater only to the waist.  But such a depth is suitable for children. </li><li>  The staff speaks Russian poorly. </li></ul><h2>  Draw conclusions </h2><p>  "Dolphin" can be advised to those tourists who want to relax inexpensively, but efficiently.  The hotel does not offer its guests something special, but it is quite capable of satisfying their standard needs.  Most of the people here gather in the summer months.  Fans of a relaxing holiday can choose the first days of autumn for a vacation.  But it is worth remembering that the temperature in Bulgaria in September is very variable. </p><p>  Staying here is most beneficial for couples with children, as well as small friendly companies that, if desired, can easily get to the main nightclubs of the resort.  The hotel is suitable for those people who do not like to spend a lot of time on the beach.  For travelers who want to travel all over Bulgaria, it will be a great place to spend the night. </p>
