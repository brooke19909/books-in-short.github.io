Initially, the figures were used in religious rites, and only representatives of the upper classes owned the folding technique.  In the sixties of the last century, origami began to spread throughout the world, and today it has become a real international art.  So why not do this work and make your own New Year origami for the holiday? </p><h2>  Paper stars </h2><p>  There are many schemes by which you can collect stars with a different number of rays both to create a garland, and as independent toys.  The basis for any crafts (including New Year's origami) is usually a square made of paper.  To make a star, you must first fold it in half (at the corners, not the sides).  Get a triangle.  The action must be repeated.  Repetition is needed to outline the middle line.  The last parts of the triangle are added (from the corner to the center).  Then you need to bend the paper as shown (steps 5-6).  It is necessary to make several repetitions, and then it remains only to turn the upper triangle to the side to make a star using the origami technique. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mama66.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami star" class="if uuid-2630378" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2630378.jpg"></div><h2>  Modular stars </h2><p>  You can make modular New Year origami from paper.  Such crafts are more difficult, but they look spectacular.  The principle of modular origami is that at first separate identical parts are added in the right amount, and then connected together.  So from the same elements completely different figures are obtained.  How to make New Year origami?  You need to bend both sides of the square to the center to draw a fold line, and then fold both sides to the center.  The lower small triangle also needs to be bent up.  Then turn the figure over and bend the lower corners to the center (as in the picture).  Fold corners with accordion.  The modular element is ready.  Now you need to add at least three more of these figures, connect them with "harmonica" with each other to make a star. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="IgOl1SveLLQ" data-url="https://youtu.be/IgOl1SveLLQ" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/5/7/0/4/5704.jpg"></div><h2>  Christmas tree for decor </h2><p>  Origami Christmas toys can look very stylish and even be used to decorate the office.  Modular Christmas trees will create a New Year's mood in any atmosphere.  You can make them from colored or white paper, but crafts made from kraft paper or packaging look much more beautiful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="new.fatare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami christmas crafts" class="if uuid-2630389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2630389.jpg"></div><p>  The basis is a square of any size (the size of the figure will depend on the size of the square).  Fold the square along two diagonals and iron it well to outline the fold lines.  Now you need to bend the shape along to make a rectangle.  Then along the last bend line you need to fold the triangle.  You get the so-called clapper triangle.  The right and left sides must be bent to the center, combined and smoothed.  The part must be turned over and the faces of the triangle in the center line aligned.  The resulting bend lines, along which it will be convenient to fold the figure further. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Each resulting bend needs to be straightened.  The result is a quadrangle that needs to be folded along the midline.  So gradually quadrangles and triangles alternate.  The bends can be gently pressed with scissors so that the New Year origami figure fits well.  The resulting figure needs to bend the corners, which are then tucked inside the Christmas tree. </p><p>  Now it remains only to use scissors to make horizontal cuts on the sides of the Christmas tree.  Then the corners are bent to the side (to the center line).  Such a New Year origami craft will become a stylish desktop decoration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vnitkah.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami tree" class="if uuid-2630384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2630384.jpg"></div><p>  Video will help to do everything right. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="zlwDwiiMkH0" data-url="https://youtu.be/zlwDwiiMkH0" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/5/7/0/3/5703.jpg"></div><h2>  Simple paper snowman </h2><p>  With very young children, you can make a very simple snowman using the origami technique with your own hands.  Christmas crafts will be a good decoration for the Christmas tree, can be used as a decorative element for gift wrapping or applique element.  The great difficulty in creating such a figure is not even the snowman himself, but his scarf.  You will need a sheet of white paper, a sheet of green or any other colored paper, red and black felt-tip pens (to draw button eyes, carrots and a bucket on your head). </p><div class="photo" data-original="vishivashka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami snowman" class="if uuid-2630374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2630374.jpg"></div><h2>  Folding technique </h2><p>  To make a snowman, you need to take a square sheet of paper and bend it in half to make a rectangle.  Unscrew any three corners of the rectangle back.  Now you need to take a sheet of colored paper and bend in half diagonally to outline the fold line.  Expand the square and bend in half, and not along the midline (so that a thin white stripe remains at the top of the resulting triangle).  It is necessary to bend the triangle from bottom to top, alternately in different directions.  Get one strip - a scarf. </p><p>  The item must be placed under the snowman figure so that a little less than one-third of the craft remains on top (there should be an acute angle at the top, not a bent corner), and bend.  The final touch is to draw the bead eyes with a black marker, a carrot and a bucket (draw an acute angle). </p><h2>  Santa Claus from paper: costume </h2><p>  To make a cute Santa from two squares of red colored paper, you need only material and a few free minutes.  Put the first square with the colored side up, bend the small strips above and below, and turn the figure over.  On the other hand, outline the center line of the resulting rectangle (vertically) and bend the edges to it.  Now you need to deploy the upper triangles to yourself to get a figure resembling Santa's cloak.  The upper part is bent under the craft.  It turns out a costume of Santa Claus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami santa claus" class="if uuid-2630367" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2630367.jpg"></div><h2>  Origami Santa: head and hat </h2><p>  Next, you need to separately make the head of Santa Claus.  The upper left corner of the square and small strips from below and to the left are bent over.  The figure needs to be flipped to the other side (there will be a white side on top), bend the side triangles to the center.  Now the top of the hood bends backward (away from you).  Repeat the last action with a small corner on the tip of Santa's hat.  Now you need to connect the figures, and on the face of Santa Claus draw eyes, nose, beard. </p><h2>  Penguin </h2><p>  Cute penguin - a great New Year's craft.  Origami is made up of a square of blue colored paper.  It is necessary to bend the upper and lower corners to the center in order to outline the center line.  Then narrow corners are folded to the center, the right angle of each element bends twice to make a foot.  The figure is folded in half along the midline.  Now you need to turn the resulting triangle, bend the upper corner towards you, and wrap the right one under the penguin‚Äôs ‚Äúfoot‚Äù.  Now it remains only to make a foot at the bottom and form a muzzle.  The last step is to draw your eyes on the penguin's face. </p><div class="photo" data-original="luntiki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami penguin" class="if uuid-2630391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2630391.jpg"></div><h2>  Christmas wreath </h2><p>  A simple origami Christmas wreath can be made from several strips of paper.  It is better to take a different one so that the wreath turns out to be bright.  Strips need eight pieces, each should be 4 cm wide and 8 cm long. Each of them first folds in half along, the corners need to be bent from top to bottom.  Then the figure bends across.  From these blanks, you can collect a wreath, alternately inserting one into the other. </p><p>  If you take strips of kraft paper or with Christmas ornaments, you will get a very stylish decoration for your home or Christmas tree.  If you proportionally increase the strips of paper (for example, cut them 8 cm wide and 16 cm long or another size), then the wreath will be larger.  Such crafts can decorate the front door to the room. </p>
