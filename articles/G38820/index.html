All tourists dream of catching sunbathing, swimming, wandering along the sunlit streets and getting tired of hiding from the midday heat.  But what if there is no way to organize a summer vacation or want to get a completely new experience from the trip?  What is the Crimea good in November and is it worth going there this month? </p><h2>  Climatic features </h2>

In November in this region there are very warm, and sometimes even hot days, but not uncommon and cool, cloudy or rainy.  Rainfall is often short-lived, and the general variability of the weather is rather a plus for tourists.  This is a unique chance to see the same landscapes in a variety of colors in one week.  The air temperature can range from +20 to 0 degrees.  Crimea in November is an incredibly beautiful place, trees still do not think to part with their autumn outfits.  Foliage usually falls only in December, in the last <span>autumn month</span> you can fully enjoy the beauty of nature.

    <h2>  Is it possible to swim in the Crimea in November? </h2><p>  A significant number of tourists come to seaside resorts for the sake of a traditional beach holiday.  Those who travel to Crimea for the first time in November are largely concerned about the question: will they be able to swim?  The water temperature is usually about 11-15 degrees.  The sea begins to cool and every day it gets colder.  However, do not be surprised, on the beaches you can still meet lovers of tempering procedures or vacationers from the northern regions of Russia, accustomed to much lower temperatures.  The last month of autumn in Crimea is ideal for walking along the embankments.  The sea looks incredibly beautiful, there are almost no tourists here.  It is at this time of year that you can see the true face of local cities and attractions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Crimea in November: photos of attractions and leisure activities </h2>

However, the <span>cities of Crimea,</span> freed from visitors, invite their few guests to walk along their streets and thoughtfully explore interesting sights. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea november reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1030097.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the end of autumn, nature also looks quite different.  Even without stepping off the trail, you can feel in a magical lost world.  The mountain air seems to be even cleaner and filled with the scents of wilting forests.  Crimea in November is a paradise for lovers of hunting, fishing and picking mushrooms.  Also this month you can still find inexpensive fruits and vegetables of a fresh harvest, try new wine and preparations for the winter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A great reason to forget about the hustle and bustle </h2>

Crimean cities fall asleep in November.  Many cafes, entertainment centers and gift shops close.  Overly intrusive taxi drivers, tour guides, hotel representatives and local residents who rent out housing disappear from the streets.  Crimea at the beginning of November looks like one big village.  Nobody is in a hurry here, people are busy with simple household chores, start repairs and get ready for next summer.  What recreational opportunities does such an atmosphere create?  Believe me, even choosing a mid-range accommodation, you can relax no worse than during a trip to a fashionable spa hotel.  Cancel the obligatory early rise, learn to contemplate and relax.  You can devote a significant part of your time to walking or sitting quietly on the beach and looking at the waves, reading a book in a city park, meeting sunrises and seeing off sunsets.  If you go to rest with a group of friends, then there will be no problems with entertainment.  Try not to make too much noise: this is not accepted here in the fall.

    <h2>  What do people who rested in Crimea in the fall say? </h2><p>  Tourists who have already tried to organize non-standard vacations in late autumn are divided into two categories.  One of these options for recreation is incredibly liked, others are rather not impressed.  Crimea in November has positive reviews among fans of ecotourism and calm contemplation.  At the end of autumn, you can explore all the sights, go hiking or wander through half-empty cities, enjoying architecture, uninhabited embankments and the lack of fuss.  Another important plus is very low prices and increased attention to every visitor.  The cost of accommodation, excursions and related products / services may be reduced several times.  At the same time, they are not trying to deceive tourists when calculating, to drag them into a new cafe or a sightseeing trip.  On the contrary, it‚Äôs enough to tell that you are non-native, and they will advise you in detail and politely which institution to visit, tell interesting legends about local attractions and offer help. </p><h2>  Memo for those traveling for the first time on an autumn vacation </h2>

Take with you a variety of things: from lightweight T-shirts and shorts to windbreakers and sweaters.  Remember that the weather sometimes changes dramatically during the day.  It will be useful to pre-book accommodation.  In autumn, the problem is not that there are no places, as happens in the summer.  On the contrary, due to the lack of guests, many hotels are closed before the New Year holidays or next season.  But the rest program, painted by the day, is not necessary.  You can write down your main vacation plans.  The vagaries of the weather in the autumn Crimea do not allow planning for several days in advance.  During such a vacation, it is much more convenient and pleasant to choose an activity to your liking only after you get out of bed in the morning and look out the window.  Crimea in November has positive reviews from tourists, among those who can independently plan and organize their holidays.  If you are ready for new experiences and an unusual vacation format, pack your bags and do not deny yourself this pleasure.
