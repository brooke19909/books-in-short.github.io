This was the era of the Great <span>geographical discoveries,</span> which will soon lead the whole world to large-scale changes, significantly transforming its appearance.  In addition to the simple emergence of new territories at the disposal of Europeans and the emergence of new states on them in the future, these trips led to a change in the whole worldview of Old World society.  Proven fact that </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amerigo vespucci" class="if" height="241" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/147190.jpg" width="320"></div>  the land is round, it did not become decisive in the rise of humanism and the principle of scientific knowledge, but he made his important contribution to the <span>liberation of Europe</span> from the religious scholasticism of the Middle Ages.  In addition, the opening of new trade routes, new forms of large-scale slavery, the creation of a colonial system, and the emergence in Europe of the myriad gold reserves of Mesoamerican civilization led to a change in socio-economic and political relations in the Old World.  All this contributed to the emergence of capitalism, civil society, the concept of nations, in general, the world as we know it now.

    <p>  Monument to the Discoverers </p><p>  Of course, the time of great achievements could not but leave in the memory of Europeans and their heroes.  They became those who personally participated in travels, creating the prerequisites for a new world and those who through their labors made these voyages possible.  Today, a monument to the discoverers rises in Lisbon, immortalizing 33 figures in stone, who contributed to the discovery.  The monument rises on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, and its faces are directed into the blue distance, to the place where ships sailed five hundred years ago in search of new worlds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Who is Amerigo Vespucci? </p>

However, he no less than others influenced the development of events.  Amerigo Vespucci was the son of a Florentine notary public.  In his youth, he received a good education, having mastered physics, astronomy, seafaring, Latin and theology.  In 1490 he entered the service of a trading house located in Seville and owned by his compatriot Donato Berardi.  This was an important moment in the fate of the young man, since it was this trading house that sponsored the travels of Christopher Columbus for some time.  Obviously, during this period their acquaintance took place.

    <p>  So who discovered the New World? </p><p>  Today, many people know which continent Amerigo Vespucci discovered, and who does not know, it is not difficult to guess which continent the name is consonant with.  However, our memory also suggests that <span>Christopher Columbus</span> became the first European to discover the New World <span>.</span>  Then why did it happen?  Why was the mainland named after Amerigo Vespucci - America?  For the first time in <span>modern times,</span> Europeans </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which continent discovered americo vespucci" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/147193.jpg" width="396"></div>  landed on the islands near this continent in 1492.  It was the expedition of Christopher Columbus, and no one today disputes his right to discover.  However, the traveler did not understand and until his death (in 1506) did not know that he had found not a new way to India, but a new mainland.  This discovery belongs to Amerigo Vespucci, who, inspired by the successes of other travelers, makes his own voyages to the mysterious lands in 1499 and 1501.  After exploring the coastline and returning to Europe, he was the first to say that, obviously, a new mainland had been found across the ocean, not Asia or the islands at all, and he was waiting for his study.  In particular, this is indicated in the letter of Amerigo to the Medici in 1503.  The continent‚Äôs name was also influenced by the fact that the Florentine published a series of notes on his travels, introducing Europe to the overseas world.  What Columbus did not do.  However, it is fair to say that Amerigo never initiated the name of the continent in his honor and probably did not even know about it until his death.  The initiative belongs to European booksellers of the beginning of the 16th century, familiar with discoveries, mainly from the news of the Florentine.
