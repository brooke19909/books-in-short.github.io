    <p>  This is a man who is several decades ahead of his time and has remained incomprehensible to contemporaries. </p><h2>  Biography of Lobachevsky Nikolai Ivanovich </h2><p>  Nikolai was born on December 11, 1792 in a poor family of a petty official Ivan Maximovich and Praskovya Alexandrovna.  The birthplace of the mathematician Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky is Nizhny Novgorod.  At the age of 9, after the death of his father, he was transported by his mother to Kazan and in 1802 was admitted to the local gymnasium.  After graduating in 1807, Nikolai became a student at the newly founded Kazan Imperial University. </p><h2>  Under the tutelage of M.F. Bartels </h2><p>  Grigory Ivanovich Kartashevsky, a talented teacher who deeply knew and appreciated his work, was able to instill a special love for the physical and mathematical sciences in the future genius.  Unfortunately, at the end of 1806, due to disagreements with the university leadership "for the manifestation of the spirit of rebellion and disagreement," he was dismissed from university service.  Courses in mathematics began to be taught by <span>Mikhail Fedorovich</span> Bartels, a teacher and friend of the famous Karl Friedrich Gauss.  Arriving in Kazan in 1808, he took patronage of a capable, but poor student. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The new teacher approved the successes of Lobachevsky, who, under his supervision, studied such classic works as The Number Theory by Karl Gauss and The Celestial Mechanics by the French scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace.  For disobedience, perseverance and signs of godlessness in the senior year over Nicholas, the probability of expulsion hung.  It was the patronage of Bartels that contributed to the abduction of the danger hanging over the gifted student. </p><h2>  <span>Kazan University</span> in the life of Lobachevsky </h2><p>  In 1811, at the end of the <span>university,</span> Nikolai Ivanovich <span>Lobachevsky</span> , whose brief biography arouses genuine interest among the younger generation, was approved by the Master of Mathematics and Physics and left at the educational institution.  Two scientific studies - in algebra and mechanics, presented in 1814 (ahead of schedule), led to his elevation to associate professors (associate professors).  Then Lobachevsky Nikolai Ivanovich, whose achievements will subsequently be correctly evaluated by his descendants, began to engage in teaching himself, gradually increasing the range of courses he taught (mathematics, astronomy, physics) and seriously thinking about restructuring mathematical principles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lobachevsky Nikrlai Ivanovich achievements" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1170659.jpg" width="239"></div>  Students loved and appreciated the lectures of Lobachevsky, a year later awarded the title of extraordinary professor.

Universities underwent the first cardinal checks.  In March 1819, M. L. Magnitsky, a representative of the main board of the schools, who cares exclusively about his own career, arrived at a <span>higher educational institution in</span> Kazan with a revision.  According to the results of his verification, the state of affairs at the university turned out to be extremely deplorable: the lack of knowledge of the pupils of this institution entailed causing harm to society.  Therefore, the university needed to be destroyed (publicly destroyed) - with the aim of an instructive example for the rest. </p><p>  However, Alexander I made the decision to rectify the situation by the hands of the same inspector, and Magnitsky with special zeal began to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù the walls of the institution: he removed 9 professors from work, introduced strict censorship of lectures and a severe barracks regime. </p><h2>  The wide activity of Lobachevsky </h2><p>  Biography of Lobachevsky Nikolai Ivanovich describes the difficult period of the church-police system established at the university, which lasted for 7 years.  The strength of the rebellious spirit and the absolute employment of the scientist, which did not leave a minute of free time, helped to withstand difficult tests. </p>

    <p>  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky replaced Bartels, who left the walls of the university, and taught mathematics at all courses, also headed a physical office and read this subject, taught students of astronomy and geodesy while I.M.Simonov was on a world trip.  Huge work was put by him into putting the library in order, and especially filling its physical and mathematical part.  Along the way, the mathematician Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, being the chairman of the construction committee, led the construction of the main building of the university and for some time served as dean of the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Non-Euclidean Lobachevsky geometry </h2><p>  A huge number of current affairs, extensive pedagogical, administrative and research work did not become an obstacle to the creative work of the mathematician: 2 textbooks for grammar schools - ‚ÄúAlgebra‚Äù (condemned for using the <span>metric system of measures)</span> and ‚ÄúGeometry‚Äù (not published at all <span>)</span> came out of his pen )  On the part of Magnitsky, strict supervision was established for Nikolai Ivanovich, because of his impudence and violation of established instructions.  However, even in these conditions, acting humiliatingly on human dignity, Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky worked hard on the strict construction of geometric foundations.  The result of such <span>painstaking work</span> was the discovery by the scientist of new geometry, made on the path of a radical revision of the concepts of the Euclidean era (–Ü–Ü–Ü century BC). </p><p>  In the winter of 1826, a Russian mathematician carried out a report on geometric principles, which was passed on to recall by several eminent professors.  However, the expected review (neither positive, nor even negative) has been received, and the manuscript of a valuable report has not reached our times.  The scientist included this material in his first work ‚ÄúOn the Principles of Geometry‚Äù, published in 1829-1830.  in the Kazan Gazette.  In addition to presenting important geometric discoveries, Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky described a refined definition of a function (clearly distinguishing between its continuity and differentiability), undeservedly attributed to the German mathematician Dirichlet.  The scientists also made thorough studies of trigonometric series, evaluated several decades later.  A talented mathematician is the author of a method for the numerical solution of equations, which over time has unfairly been called the ‚ÄúGreffe method‚Äù. </p><h2>  Lobachevsky Nikolai Ivanovich: interesting facts </h2><p>  The inspector Magnitsky, who had been fearful by his actions for several years, expected an unenviable fate: for many abuses revealed by the special audit commission, he was removed from his post and sent to exile.  Mikhail Nikolaevich Musin-Pushkin was appointed the next trustee of the educational institution, who managed to appreciate the vigorous activity of Nikolai Lobachevsky and recommended him to the post of rector of Kazan University. </p>

    <p>  For 19 years, starting in 1827, Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky (photo of the monument in Kazan, see above) worked hard at this post, seeking the dawn of his beloved brainchild.  On the account of Lobachevsky - a clear improvement in the level of scientific and educational activities in general, the construction of a huge number of office buildings (physics room, library, chemical laboratory, astronomical and magnetic observatory, <span>anatomical theater,</span> mechanical workshops).  The rector is also the founder of the strict scientific journal "Scientific notes of Kazan University", which replaced the "Kazan Gazette" and first published in 1834.  In parallel with the rectorship, Nikolai Ivanovich managed the library for 8 years, was engaged in teaching activities, and wrote instructions to teachers of mathematics. </p><p>  The merits of Lobachevsky cannot be attributed to his sincere heartfelt concern for the university and its students.  So, in 1830, he managed to isolate the school grounds and carry out thorough disinfection in order to save the staff of the educational institution from the cholera epidemic.  During a terrible fire in Kazan (1842) he managed to save almost all the educational buildings, astronomical instruments and library materials.  Nikolai Ivanovich also opened to the masses free access to the university library and museums and organized popular science classes for the population. </p><p>  Thanks to the incredible efforts of Lobachevsky, the authoritative, first-class, well-equipped Kazan University has become one of the best educational institutions in Russia. </p><h2>  Misunderstanding and rejection of the ideas of Russian mathematician </h2><p>  All this time, the mathematician did not stop at the ongoing research aimed at the development of new geometry.  Unfortunately, his ideas are deep and fresh, so contrary to the generally accepted axioms that contemporaries could not, and perhaps did not want to appreciate the work of Lobachevsky.  Misunderstanding and, to some extent, mockery did not stop Nikolai Ivanovich: in 1835 he published Imaginary Geometry, and a year later, The Application of Imaginary Geometry to Some Integrals.  Three years later, the light saw the most extensive work, ‚ÄúNew Beginnings of Geometry with the Complete Theory of Parallel‚Äù, which contained a concise, extremely clear explanation of his key ideas. </p><h2>  A difficult period in the life of a mathematician </h2><p>  Having not received understanding in his native land, Lobachevsky decided to acquire like-minded people beyond its borders. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="biography of lobachevsky nikolai ivanovich" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1170650.jpg" width="233"></div>  In 1840, Lobachevsky Nikolai Ivanovich (see photo in the review) published his work with clearly stated main ideas in German.  One copy of this publication was presented to Gauss, who himself was secretly engaged in non-Euclidean geometry, but did not dare to speak out publicly with his thoughts.  After reviewing the work of a Russian colleague, the German recommended that a Russian colleague be elected to the Gottingen Royal Society as a corresponding member.  Gauss praised Lobachevsky only in his diaries and among the most trusted people.  The election of Lobachevsky still took place;  this happened in 1842, but it did not improve the position of the Russian scientist: he had only 4 years to work at the university.

    <p>  The government of Nicholas I did not want to appreciate the many years of work of Lobachevsky Nikolai Ivanovich and in 1846 removed him from work at the university, officially naming the reason: a sharp deterioration in health.  Formally, the former rector was offered the position of assistant trustee, but without a salary.  Shortly before the dismissal and deprivation of the professorship, Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, whose brief biography is still being studied in educational institutions, recommended instead the teacher of the Kazan gymnasium A.F. Popov, who defended his doctoral dissertation perfectly.  Nikolai Ivanovich considered it necessary to give the right path in life to a young capable scientist and found it inappropriate to occupy the department under such circumstances.  But, having lost everything at once and finding himself in an absolutely unnecessary position for himself, Lobachevsky lost the opportunity not only to manage the university, but also to somehow participate in the activities of the educational institution. </p>

    <p>  In family life, Lobachevsky Nikolai Ivanovich from 1832 was married to Varvara Alekseevna Moiseeva.  In this marriage, 18 children were born, but only seven survived. </p><h2>  last years of life </h2><p>  Forced removal from the work of his whole life, rejection of the new geometry, gross ingratitude of contemporaries, a sharp deterioration in financial standing (due to ruin, the estate of the spouse was sold for debt) and family grief (loss of the eldest son in 1852) had a devastating effect on physical and spiritual health Russian mathematician: he noticeably haggled and began to lose his sight.  But the blinded Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky did not stop attending exams, came to ceremonial events, participated in scientific disputes and continued to work for the benefit of science.  The main work of the Russian mathematician Pangeometry was written down by students under the dictation of the blind Lobachevsky one year before his death. </p><p>  Lobachevsky Nikolai Ivanovich, whose discoveries in geometry were evaluated only tens of years later, was not the only researcher in a new field of mathematics.  The Hungarian scientist Janos Boyiai, regardless of his Russian colleague, submitted his vision of non-Euclidean geometry to his colleagues in 1832.  However, his works were not appreciated by contemporaries. </p><p>  The life of an outstanding scientist, entirely devoted to Russian science and Kazan University, ended on February 24, 1856.  They buried Lobachevsky, who was never recognized during his lifetime, in Kazan, at the Arsky cemetery.  Only after several decades has the situation in the scientific world changed dramatically.  A huge role in the recognition and acceptance of the works of Nikolai Lobachevsky was played by the studies of Henri Poincare, Eugenio Beltrami, Felix Klein.  The understanding that Euclidean geometry appeared a full-fledged alternative, significantly influenced the scientific world and gave impetus to other bold ideas in the exact sciences. </p>

In honor of Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky was called a crater on the moon.  The name of the great Russian scientist is the scientific library of the University of Kazan, to which he devoted a huge piece of his life.  Also, Lobachevsky streets are available in many cities of Russia, including Moscow, Kazan, Lipetsk. </p>
