We offer to fulfill our beautiful dream in Africa, in the wonderful modern hotel complex Splashworld Venus Beach 4 *.  Tunisia, Hammamet - these are two geographical names with which the hotel is directly associated, and which have already become incredibly popular not only among Russians, but also around the world.  Tunisia is a small, but very proud and freedom-loving country, where ancient traditions and modern technologies coexist peacefully.  Hammamet is perhaps the best resort here with incredible beauty of the coast and developed infrastructure.  Why did we choose Splashworld Venus Beach 4 * from many of its hotels?  Tunisia can be recognized in many ways.  Someone seeks to visit the desert, someone is attracted to cheap shopping, and someone is interested in sights.  But absolutely everyone loves the sea, on the banks of which this hotel was built, and in addition to a beach holiday there is the opportunity to have fun in your own water park as much as you like.  Let's see what else is remarkable for this place and how the rest goes on here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In a beautiful corner of the African Mediterranean, in the bay of Hammamet, which is cozy and closed from restless winds, which from Arabic translates quite logically - ‚Äúa place where you can swim‚Äù, in 1985 a luxurious hotel called Caribbean World Venus Beach was built.  Over the past 30 years, renovations have been carried out here repeatedly so that tourists like Tunisia and Hammamet as much as possible.  Magic Splashworld Venus Beach 4 * - this is the new hotel name given to him after the last renovation.  It was held in 1015, that is, more recently.  Therefore, many brochures and maps still retain the old name, which we draw your attention to. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Splashworld Venus Beach 4 Tunisia Hammamet" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1453131.jpg" width="519"></div>  The city of Hammamet with the bay of the same name is secretly divided into the old part (Medina), where there is a classic Arab market near the ancient stone walls, and the new one (in Russian, Jasmine), where there is also a market, and, in addition, a popular supermarket.  Just 2 km from the new part and 8 km from the old is Splashworld Venus Beach 4 *.  Hammamet lies relatively close to other major <span>cities in Tunisia.</span>  So, it is 102 km to Mahdia, 62 km to Sousse and to the capital of the country, and quite a bit to Enfida, only 37 km.  It is important to know these distances when choosing which airport to fly to and where to go on an excursion.

Magic Splashworld Venus Beach 4 * is located closest to Enfida <span>Airport,</span> 38 km away and where flights from Russia are most often offered.  At the exit from the airport, tourists, as a rule, are waiting for a shuttle that can drive to the hotel in half an hour.  A flight to Tunisia's airport called Cartage is also acceptable.  From here you will have to go by transfer for about an hour.  The least successful option is to fly to Monastir.  If you booked the hotel yourself, you can get there from Enfida only by taxi, and from Carthage you can change trains, but it‚Äôs cheaper to take bus number 05, departing from the bus station. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia Hammamet Magic Splashworld Venus Beach 4" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1453137.jpg" width="524"></div>

Fans of relaxation will appreciate the SPA-salon, where a sauna, a bathhouse, massage rooms are equipped.  Tour operators claim that a fitness center is also available at Splashworld Venus Beach 4 *.  Reviews about it, however, are not entirely satisfactory, since this object is a small-sized room with a couple of the simplest working simulators and several non-working ones.  But the sports grounds at the hotel are good.  There is also a games room with billiards and tennis tables for sports lovers.  For some vacationers, the advantage is that there is a golf course 2 km from the hotel. </p><p>  In the daytime and evening, guests are entertained by a group of groovy animators.

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The bulk of people for the sake of a chic coast and beach vacation travels to Splashworld Venus Beach 4 *.  Tunisia / Hammamet have very good beaches, both owned by hotels and municipal ones - wide, sandy, with smooth entry into the water, well equipped.  This is the property of the hotel in question.  Walk to him from the buildings a couple of minutes through a beautiful shady area.  On the beach there is a fenced area with sunbeds and umbrellas, which do not allow outsiders.  That is, neither merchants nor barkers in salons and excursions interfere with rest there.  Since Hammamet is located in the bay, the sea here is warm most of the year, and the waves are small.  You can swim in open water from the end of April until the very last days of October, and you can sunbathe in sunny weather even in winter.  The minimum air temperature here is +15 ¬∞ C during the day, but evenings in the winter are quite cool (+7 ... +8 ¬∞ C), so you need to bring woolen clothes with you. </p><p>  Those who like to relax actively on the beach can go kiting, windsurfing, parasailing, ride a banana, kayak or catamaran, scuba dive to the depths and look at the underwater inhabitants. </p><p>  The only minus of the beach is the Arabs, conducting along the sand of camels.  They offer a ride on an exotic animal or take a picture with it.  There is nothing wrong with that, but camels leave behind feces that no one removes. </p><h2>  Entertainment outside the hotel </h2><p>  Some tourists go to Hotel Splashworld Venus Beach 4 * (Hammamet) to make successful purchases and explore Africa.  Tunisia is a very original and interesting country.  Here the traditions of the ancestors are carefully cherished, ancient crafts are not forgotten.  If we talk about excellent shopping, it can be done without leaving Hammamet.  In the city, which is famous for linen fabrics, there are two markets (medins) - old and new, many boutiques and supermarkets.  For unique pottery it is advisable to go to Nabeul, which is no more than 12 km away, and to buy exclusive silk it is better to go to Mahdia, although it is somewhat far away, as much as 107 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Splashworld Venus Beach 4" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1453132.jpg" width="511"></div>
