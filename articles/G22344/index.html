They were a connecting link for trade and allowed to enrich the cities and regions where they took place, and also served as threads for cultural and religious ties.  It is thanks to these paths that in ancient times people had the opportunity to exchange news and knowledge. </p><h2>  What is a trade route </h2><p>  In ancient times, trade routes were the only way for people to exchange goods.  The fact is that in those days travel was a great danger, and only together could travel more or less safely.  The danger increased when it came to merchants, because the robbers were always happy to profit from the gold of merchants and dealers. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, in the period earlier than the 10th century, routes began to be laid, which for centuries remained unchanged.  So, the Volga trade route was the first of the three most famous tracts.  Two others were the famous "From the Varangians to the Greeks", connecting Byzantium and the north, as well as the <span>Great Silk Road,</span> leading from Middle-earth to the east. </p><h2>  What cities were included in the Volga trade route?  Scroll </h2><p>  The Volga trade route passed through many lands and tribes.  The cities through which wanderers traveled have long ceased to exist or have been renamed.  In fact, the path was truly enormous - it passed through the territory of 22 modern countries! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Volga trade route began in the Netherlands, in the city of Dorestad, which now does not exist.  It passed through Northern and Eastern Europe, Russia, and then the Middle East and ended in the city of Tanja (modern Tangier), in Morocco.  Among the most famous cities on the Volga Route are such settlements as Antwerp, Hamburg, Cologne, Astrakhan, Sevastopol, Tbilisi, Yerevan, Istanbul and many others. </p>

    <p>  Note that the Balto-Volga trade route, as it is sometimes called in a different way, included both waterways (along the Volga, Black and Caspian Seas) and land routes. </p><h2>  What goods were transported along the Volga trade route </h2><p>  The main purpose of the paths in the old days is trade.  The Volga trade route connected the north with the south, as well as Asia with Europe, so the goods that were transported along it were very diverse.  So, exquisite fabrics, jewelry, fruits, glass and metal products were brought from the south.  The northern peoples offered furs, metals and weapons, as well as walrus bones and skins, which surprised the rest of the tribes.  Eastern Europeans sold amber and jewelry made from it, furs, grain and ceramics on the way.  Volga tribes and Slavs traded cattle, furs, honey, ceramics, grain, flax, and also supplied weapons on this way.  Separately, it is worth mentioning the trade in Slavic women who were welcome guests in Arab harems. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, the slave trade was actively developing on the Volga route.  This was connected with the era itself, because in those days wars were fought unceasingly.  Particularly strong slave trade flourished in port cities, where rowers were always required. </p>

    <p>  Note that the farther away the goods were taken, the more valuable it was.  On the way he could be outbid many times before things fell into the hands of the buyer.  The most valuable on the road were female slaves.  A little cheaper it was possible to buy men.  Horses were already sold at half the price, and much cheaper goods followed. </p><h2>  History of the Volga Trade Route </h2><p>  In fact, the Volga way began its history in the VIII century BC.  e.  Archaeologists found confirmation of the development of trade relations back in those days, but, of course, it was still too early to talk about the path itself, because in those days the connections were not very strong, since there was no special need for them.  Real trade begins to unfold only at the end of the VIII century.  And already in the IX century.  The Volga trade route is becoming the most developed of all. </p>

    <p>  This state of affairs continued until the 10th century, when the main trade shifted to other paths.  Historically, the Volga Trade Route did not always serve as a guide for trade, and often there were troops of individual tribes who robbed neighbors. </p><p>  At the end of the 10th century, the <span>Khazar Khaganate,</span> which occupied the entire south of the road, was suppressed by Kievan Rus.  After that, the Pecheneg tribes finally blocked the road for travelers.  Therefore, the main flow of trade shifted to the path "From the Varangians to the Greeks." </p>
