Let's try to find out about it!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you are planning a vacation in the Dominican Republic in September, you first need to find out the local weather for this period.  Well, at the beginning of autumn, climatic conditions are not much different from summer ones, except that it gets a bit cooler both day and night.  The sea is still hot as <span>fresh milk, the</span> air is humid, and the amount of precipitation is reduced very slightly.  The Dominican Republic in September is characterized by high humidity, cloudiness, but at the same time, you can spend a lot of sunny days here and enjoy a full vacation. </p><h2>  Features of the local climate </h2><p>  The weather conditions in the <span>Dominican Republic are, in</span> principle, the same all year round.  The change in temperature here can be traced within 1-4 degrees, but humidity can "jump" in a wider range.  In general, the Dominican Republic in September will delight you with tropical summer heat, and the sun, and warm sea water.  It will rain here almost every day, but they will not drag out for a long time.  Rainfall, as a rule, lasts an hour or two, no more, after which under the scorching southern sun there is no trace left of it, and even the sand by the sea dries and warms up completely.  True, such a circulation of water in nature generates a very high humidity, which is not always favorable for most tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic in September" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/478258.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The cost of the tour in early autumn </h2><p>  A somewhat deserted and not at all fussy resort is the Dominican Republic in September.  Prices for trips during this period fall almost to a minimum, since most tourists prefer to visit this country in winter or spring.  You can buy an ordinary tour for 60-80 thousand rubles, and a hot ticket will result in an even smaller amount.  Similarly, the fee for most of the services that are provided by hotels is reduced.  Many unlimited openings for tourists who came here in early autumn.  The only negative can be considered that some services do not function at this time, as there is simply no influx of vacationers familiar to the southern tourist country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in the Dominican Republic in September" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/478259.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <h2>  The warmest September sea </h2><p>  If, perhaps, many people think that in the beginning of autumn the weather in the Dominican Republic let us down a little, then no one can say for sure about the sea.  After the incredible summer heat in this area, the waves of the Caribbean warm up to more than 30 degrees.  Therefore, even if you are standing on the beach and you feel a cool, light breeze blowing in you, you just have to plunge into the sea, when the chills pass immediately.  The water is warm, like in a jacuzzi, clean and very pleasant to the body.  And even the slight waves that sometimes rise here cannot spoil a good impression of the water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in the Dominican Republic in September" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/478260.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  It is important to choose a resort </h2><p>  In order for you to enjoy as many sunny clear days as possible, it is worth choosing the resort area in which there is least rainfall.  Therefore, we provide a brief summary of the weather in the Dominican Republic in September in its various cities and regions.  Santo Domingo - the capital of the country - is one of its wettest places.  The city is located in the south of the island, and all resorts that are in the same zone are characterized by rain, high humidity and cloud cover.  In turn, the Northern Dominican Republic in September is a completely different matter.  Here showers occur mainly at night, and during the day the southern sun bakes.  Therefore, you can safely go to Puerto Plata and all the cities that are located next to it, and enjoy the summer and warmth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic in September prices" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/478261.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Keep track of weather forecasts </h2><p>  As in any other region of the world, the Dominican Republic does not have year after year.  September can be both a very dry and hot month, and a cool, rainy and cloudy one.  Therefore, if you intend to go there specifically this year, it is best to listen to weather forecasts for the next ten days, which are the most accurate.  Also, an excellent solution would be to find an opportunity to contact or phone with a person who is already there, and reliably find out from him about all the climatic conditions that are now being traced there. </p><h2>  What to do here in September? </h2><p>  The beginning of autumn in the <span>Dominican Republic</span> is considered an excellent time for holding various festivals and carnivals.  The first event is a cooking contest held in Santo Domingo.  The best chefs of the country gather here and compete with each other in their own culinary abilities.  Guests at this celebration can taste the cooking prepared by local chefs.  Also in September, the Dominican Republic celebrates many religious holidays.  Among them, we note St. Mercedes Day, as well as <span>St. Michael's</span> Day <span>.</span>  Well, in conclusion, we note that it is thanks to the winds and clouds in the beginning of autumn that good waves rise here.  This is a great habitat for windsurfers.  Having rented all the necessary equipment, you can ride on the waves of the <span>Caribbean Sea</span> at least all day and get a lot of new impressions. </p>
