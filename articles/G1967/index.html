    <p>  On the same territory with Hellas there are several more hotels.  The terrain itself is incredibly picturesque, although not very large.  Visitors celebrate the excellent design of the landscape.  Conventionally, the territory can be divided into two parts.  The first includes the promenade, restaurant and buildings of some complexes.  The second is on a hill.  From one part to another you can get on foot or drive a local car.  The hill offers a picturesque view, the surrounding area is very well-groomed. </p><p>  All hotels, including Hellas, and the restaurant are in the same style.  From the side it looks very impressive.  Poseidon Restaurant welcomes guests of the Hellas Hotel who have ordered a buffet.  In the evening, the restaurant is open as usual.  The water in the pools is chlorinated, but there is practically no smell.  There is a children's area.  The cleanliness is constantly monitored by staff. </p><p>  There is a first-aid post, shops and a pharmacy on site.  Prices are overpriced and the selection is small. </p><p>  You can get to Alushta by bus, which runs three times a day (the schedule can be checked at the hotel).  It is also possible to order a taxi. </p><p>  The hotel employs qualified massage therapists who, for a small fee, conduct not only a massage session, but also provide valuable health advice. </p><h2>  Beach area </h2><p>  For those who prefer a beach holiday, Crimea will become especially hospitable (Alushta, Semidvorye).  Hotel "Hellas" has its own equipped beach.  Also on the territory are the beach areas of other hotels.  You can choose any of them. </p><p>  There are always free sun loungers on the beaches.  But sunbeds under a canopy must be occupied in advance, in the morning.  Umbrellas are available at an additional cost. </p><p>  Storm at sea in this region does not happen often.  But at this time, it is better to refrain from swimming.  Waves lift debris and algae from the bottom.  Also, the waters of the local river carry a stream of dirty water into the sea.  There is a drain near the Hellas beach, therefore the water here is the cleanest. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  The promenade is simply strewn with numerous cafes.  There are also restaurants at the top.  The most favorite places for tourists are Lemon, Lavender and Da Vasco.  The last two have open terraces with a pleasant design.  They serve very quickly and efficiently.  The menu is varied.  Of the minuses, it can be noted overpriced, but for the resort it is excusable.  On the beaches you can buy delicious chebureks with various fillings and ice cream. </p><p>  The buffet in the Poseidon restaurant is quite varied, but there is not much choice for children.  You can eat on the menu, but for this it is better to choose other restaurants, since here they serve an order for a very long time.  But at the same time, everything is very tasty, especially desserts.  Sitting on the open veranda, parents can watch children playing outside.  In the evening, a truly romantic atmosphere reigns here.  Live music is playing, the moon is shining, a barely audible noise of the sea surf is heard. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2>

    <p>  Those who do not like to spend time with their children should not go here.  There are few children's entertainments, but they are still there.  On both sides of the embankment are inflatable trampolines with labyrinths.  For 150 rubles you can stay unlimited time.  Near the pool of the Hotel Ellada there is a playground. </p><p>  Animation is sometimes carried out, but the presentation, say, by an amateur.  Near the pool, both children and adults can attend exercises, water aerobics and water polo classes. </p>

    <p>  Evenings can be spent walking along the promenade.  It is also worth visiting the picturesque park of the reconstructed pension "Semidvorye", located nearby.  Sitting on the balcony in your hotel room, you can listen all evening as the sea waves rush to the shore.  During these moments of complete relaxation, a person is able to forgive all the shortcomings that the Hellada Hotel (Alushta) can upset.  Photos cannot convey the whole atmosphere of calm and tranquility that reigns here.  In this place you can really relax and soul and body. </p>
