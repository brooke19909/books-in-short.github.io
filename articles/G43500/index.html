That's right - get a new one and replace it.  However, sometimes such a simple action becomes simply impossible.  The battery of a device may fail at the most inopportune moment (for example, on the road).  What to do if the gadget is necessary, and its operation is impossible due to the battery?  In today's article, we will talk about how to extend the life of batteries at least for a short while, what it will take, and is it worth it at all.  At the same time, it is worthwhile to understand not only the finger elements, but also their lithium counterparts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.altomdata.dk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Finger batteries" class="if uuid-3144241" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3144241.jpg"></div><h2>  When life extension of galvanic cells is possible </h2><p>  Many people know that simple finger-type batteries cannot be recharged.  This is indicated even by a special inscription on some of them.  However, this statement is not entirely true.  In fact, there are several ways to extend the life of a finger-type battery. </p><p>  It should be understood that there are cases in which the restoration of the charge of the battery is impossible.  It is a partial or complete destruction of one of the electrodes (in the case of a finger battery - the central rod).  The remaining cases are completely solvable.  This applies even to options where <span>the battery has expired</span> and the electrolyte has dried out.  It is worth considering the simplest ways to restore a dead battery in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="emerginggrowth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The difference between rechargeable and conventional batteries" class="if uuid-3144266" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3144266.jpg"></div><h2>  Option number 1: the simplest steps to revitalize a galvanic cell </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worthwhile to figure out how to extend the life of batteries by restoring their charge for a short period of time (one to two days).  This can be achieved by heating a galvanic cell or by tapping on its body with an object.  From what may be on hand on the road, a metal spoon is best. </p><p>  Most often, this method leads to a complete failure of the supply element.  This happens if you overdo it when you hit the battery and damage the central graphite rod.  Also, do not bite the body of the element with your teeth.  With such a "recovery" the battery will not last more than an hour.  In general, in such cases, any, even the slightest deformation of the outer cup is undesirable. </p><p>  You can learn about another method from the video below. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="fZDlKsWuY5c" data-url="https://youtu.be/fZDlKsWuY5c" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/6/3/2/15632.jpg"></div><h2>  Option number 2: what to do if the electrolyte in the supply element is dry </h2><p>  It is believed that expired batteries can only be disposed of, but this is not so.  It is worth trying to restore their performance.  You can find many tips on how to extend the life of batteries that are dry, but the best one is the following. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the side, closer to the edge, you need to make a hole.  Vinegar or even plain water is pumped into it with a syringe.  After the liquid is no longer absorbed, the hole is smeared.  To do this, you can use simple plasticine.  It remains to leave the battery for half an hour, after which it can be used. </p><h2>  How to extend the battery life of iPhone or Android </h2><p>  Modern gadgets are equipped with large screens that quickly eat up the battery charge.  But the fact that their batteries run out so quickly is not the fault of the display, but of the running applications that load the processor.  There are 2 options to keep the gadget up and running for as long as possible. </p><ol><li>  Disable applications that are currently unnecessary through the menu, without the need to not use the Internet.  In this case, you can extend the performance of the smartphone by more than a third of the time. <div class="photo" data-original="www.nintendolife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The necessary data on the battery" class="if uuid-3144244" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3144244.jpg"></div></li><li>  If you plan a long-term outing, it is better to take care of a device such as Power Bank in advance.  Such external high-capacity batteries will allow several times to fully charge the smartphone in the absence of an electric network.  Another option is how to extend the battery life of your phone - mobile solar panels.  Today, the manufacturer offers similar equipment in the form of small bags.  Inside them is a battery, and on the side walls are solar cells that convert solar energy into electrical energy. <div class="photo" data-original="www.latestgadget.com.ph" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="external battery with solar panel" class="if uuid-3144242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3144242.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Some nutrition tips </h2><p>  In order that the question of how to extend the life of batteries does not arise at all, some rules for its use should be followed.  The main thing here is the use of exclusively original chargers.  Their parameters are calculated by the manufacturer for perfect match with the battery.  Of course, this is not always possible, but you need to strive for this. </p><p>  Another prerequisite is to prevent the battery from completely discharging.  This can happen if the gadget is disconnected, and the owner is in no hurry to charge it.  In this case, self-discharge occurs to full zero, which is detrimental to the battery. </p><p>  Do not urgently need to connect the adapter if more than 30% of the battery is left.  The fact is that each battery is designed for a certain number of ‚Äúcharge / discharge‚Äù cycles.  This means that any inclusion of the gadget in the network will reduce the battery life, regardless of how long the power was supplied.  Also, you can not leave a smartphone or other gadget in the area in direct sunlight.  Overheating of the battery, as well as overcooling, significantly reduces the battery life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.srcyrl.sinosolarcharger.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="consequences of non-compliance with operating rules" class="if uuid-3144254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3144254.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  There are plenty of ways to extend battery life, but not all of them are safe.  It is best from the first day to monitor the battery and use it correctly, than subsequently to acquire a new one instead of a failed one.  And it‚Äôs good if the element just stops working.  Cases of ignition and even explosions of lithium batteries are known, and this is already unsafe. </p>
