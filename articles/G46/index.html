  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to crochet a panda: schemes and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Perhaps pandas are the cutest animals.  These funny black and white cubs are as if created for the game.  Maybe that's why they compete even with Teddy bears. </p><p>  The hand-made movement has long gained strength.  What models the craftswomen did not come up with!  Among the workshops there are tips on how to crochet a panda.  For this, the technique of making Japanese amigurumi toys is suitable. </p><p>  All of them fit together using similar patterns that create three-dimensional shapes: ball, sphere, hemisphere, cone, drop.  The same principles are used to create a teddy bear. </p><h2>  How to crochet a panda </h2><p>  You can imagine the toy in the form of several separate parts: head, torso and limbs.  The head of a panda fits in according to the pattern of the ball, the torso - according to the pattern of a drop or ball.  The paws begin like a ball, but then go into the cylinder and end with a sphere.  A separately connected hemisphere muzzle is sewn to the head.  Ears knit in a semicircle.  Tail - a chain of air loops, which are then sewn to the product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet panda" class="if uuid-3188401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3188401.jpg"></div><p>  To create a ball in each row, add six loops, reaching the desired diameter, begin to reduce each row of six loops.  To make a cone, six loops are added through a row. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Schemes of the torso, legs and head </h2><p>  The image below shows how to crochet a panda.  Symbols are standard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Panda knitting pattern" class="if uuid-3188604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3188604.jpg"></div><p>  Work begins with the Amigurumi ring.  A yarn thread is wound around the finger, forming a ring.  Six single crochet columns are drawn from it (in the diagrams they are indicated by crosses).  Adding and decreasing loops are indicated by a double tick.  If its ends look down, then two stitches are knitted into one.  If up - two are tied from one loop. </p><h2>  Head manufacturing procedure </h2><p>  The sequence of knitting individual parts is not so important.  After all, then they will all be gathered together, and there you will need to act strictly according to the instructions: first sew one element, then another.  However, in the crocheted panda there is one subtlety: its eyes have black glasses, as it were.  If you try to knit a pattern on such a small model, it will turn out very sloppy and rude.  A panda can even take a threatening appearance (if the elements are square). </p><p>  Therefore, for a crocheted amigurumi panda, sewing a chain of air loops into the place of the ‚Äúglasses‚Äù is provided.  Carefully, row after row they lay the chain in a circle and fix with black sewing threads or floss matching with a matching shade.  Eyes are sewn onto the finished ‚Äúglasses‚Äù or factory-made elements with fasteners are used. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="yarnutopia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Option for knitting panda &quot;points&quot;" class="if uuid-3188468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3188468.jpg"></div><p>  After this operation, a muzzle connected in the form of a hemisphere is sewn.  Sewing threads are also used for her.  It is very important to ensure that the stuffing does not accidentally fall into the seam, does not come out in the corners, and the muzzle does not warp.  It is convenient to sew it before the head of the teddy bear is full.  And it will take less time. </p><p>  When these operations are performed, the head is stuffed with syntepuh to half and continue to knit to reduce the volume, gradually reporting the filler and closing the loops at the end. </p><h2>  How to assemble a toy </h2><p>  When knitting does not work identical parts.  This is understandable, because manual work is characterized by some deviations from the ideal.  But in the assembly there is an important point: before sewing, the limbs are fixed with pins.  This is necessary to determine the center of gravity of the product.  It will be a shame if the teddy bear cannot stand or sit, but will fall to one side or prostrate itself in front of its creator. </p><p>  When assembling, the procedure is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Connect the torso and forelegs.  If they are supposed to be movable, a large needle is passed through the legs and torso through and sewn on a button on each outer side of the limb.  It is better to choose small fittings matching the legs with two holes for fixing. </li><li>  Sew on the head, having verified the center of gravity first.  Torso stuffing is done denser so that the head is more stable and does not hang out. </li><li>  Fasten the legs, pulling the thread tightly when securing with buttons.  The tummy of the toy should stick forward.  Only then can the panda stand well. </li><li>  Lastly, the ears are fixed, the nose, mouth, claws, antennae are embroidered.  On a white background, black floss threads are used in four additions, on black - white. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pdfkitapciniz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Little panda amigurumi" class="if uuid-3188472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3188472.jpg"></div><p>  Some craftswomen use the same yarn to bind details as in work.  In this case, do not use the needle, but work with a hook.  Linking a panda amigurumi is difficult only at first glance.  The more details, the prettier the toy turns out. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Schemes help novice needlewomen to connect the selected model.  Over time, just by looking at the toy, you will understand how to crochet a panda or some other animal.  A true artist is not one who knows the art of drawing.  The main thing is to see the beauty.  So in any creative business, knitting is no exception. </p><p>  Understanding of what elements a toy‚Äôs shape is made of is the basis of knowledge.  What follows is their development in practice.  I wish you success in this hobby! </p>
