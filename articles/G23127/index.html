No one is safe from this.  But if there were such malfunctions with a smartphone or tablet, do not panic right away.  You can try to figure out how to reset the iPad to the factory settings.  This solution often helps owners of Android devices, although it is impossible to consider it a panacea for all problems. </p><h2>  What is it? </h2><p>  Resetting to factory settings is not an easy process, especially when it comes to an Apple device.  It so happened that the "apple" company is working on the safety of its devices, so the complete removal is not as simple as in other smartphones and tablets. </p><p>  However, resetting to factory settings has a similar algorithm.  After it, the user receives a completely new system.  All personal data of the user, his settings and configuration are deleted from the device.  Account data is also erased. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="IPad Recovery" class="if uuid-2986528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2986528.jpg"></div><h2>  For what? </h2><p>  How to reset the iPad to factory settings, not everyone knows.  But faced with software failures, you have to understand this matter. </p><p>  Most often, such drastic measures are needed in serious system failures.  If the iPad stops responding to commands, the system lives its own life, etc. This option is especially useful if viruses penetrate the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, such an operation is needed in case of sale of a device or purchase of a used one.  So that the new owner does not receive your data, you will have to clean the device completely.  This method is the surest. </p><h2>  Reset </h2><p>  How to reset iPad to factory settings?  There are several ways to do this.  It all depends on the situation that happened with the device. </p><p>  The operation can be carried out using the standard device menu.  This option is the simplest and does not require additional tools.  All you need is a tablet and possibly a charger. </p><p>  You can reset the settings through the new profile.  This option is not the easiest, so you should consider whether to choose it or not.  As usual, you can solve the problem using iTunes.  Or use Recovery Mode. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.johnlewis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Delete data from iPad" class="if uuid-2986531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2986531.jpg"></div><p>  But before proceeding with this, you need to save all personal data. </p><h2>  Synchronization </h2><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you know or not how to reset your iPad to factory settings, the first thing you should deal with is synchronizing your device.  As mentioned earlier, the process leads to the deletion of all data from the device.  To save them, you will have to create a backup. </p><p>  You can do this through iTunes or iCloud. </p><h2>  Sync via iTunes </h2><p>  To do this, connect the tablet to the computer and run the program.  Do not forget to check its updates before this, as it may not work correctly.  Next, on the main panel, select "Overview". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Information appears on the right.  You will need to find the button "Create a copy now."  The backup can be encrypted, just enter the password.  Do not forget to write it down, otherwise you will not be able to download the information to the restored device afterwards. </p><h2>  ICloud sync </h2><p>  For this case, you do not need to use a computer.  It is enough to connect to the Internet, preferably to Wi-Fi.  Now you need to go to the tablet settings.  There we look for the name of the account on which the device is registered, and after that we go directly to iCloud. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lifehacker.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Backup copy" class="if uuid-2986537" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2986537.jpg"></div><p>  Below you can mark the data that you want to save, and which will be permanently deleted.  Below this list is the ‚ÄúBackup‚Äù section.  You need to go there, turn on the switch and click "Create". </p><h2>  Menu reset </h2><p>  You can reset the iPad 2 to factory settings from the device menu.  To do this, go to the settings, and then select the "Basic" tab.  A large number of options will be available here.  You have to choose the one that you need. </p><p>  For complete deletion, select the "Reset content and settings" section.  Thus, all information will be destroyed.  Here you can delete network data, geo-configuration and device configuration. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="gurugadgets.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Erase content and settings" class="if uuid-2986536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2986536.jpg"></div><h2>  New profile </h2><p>  Resetting the iPad Mini to factory settings is possible after creating a new profile.  It is worth saying right away that this option does not delete the phone data.  It only creates a new profile with factory settings.  It is also worth noting that the option is suitable for those who have a jailbreak device.  Without administrator rights, nothing can be done. </p><p>  You need to install any file manager and go to the Library folder.  Find the Preferences folder in the list and rename it. </p><h2>  Use iTunes </h2><p>  Sometimes it happens that the tablet does not turn on and does not respond to the user.  In this case, you need to reset the buttons to the factory settings of the iPad.  You will have to use iTunes to do this. </p><p>  This is Apple's proprietary application.  It is the main tool in the operation and management of the device.  Thanks to it, you can synchronize data, transfer content, make a backup or change the firmware.  Therefore, in this case, it will also help to reset. </p><p>  You need to update the program before starting it.  Next, connect the device to the computer.  In some cases, you will need to enter the device password.  A tablet is displayed in the program window, with which you can work.  To do this, click on it, go to the menu and click on "Restore". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.apple-iphone.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Device recovery" class="if uuid-2986541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2986541.jpg"></div><p>  If everything is in order, then resetting the iPad 2 to the factory settings with the buttons will not be needed.  But often at this stage failures occur, so you need to use another method. </p><h2>  Recovery mode </h2><p>  This option is suitable in different cases.  Most often it is used when the device password is forgotten.  For this process, you need to turn off the tablet and wait a couple of minutes. </p><p>  Now you need to start Recovery Mode.  This can be done in different ways.  It all depends on the model of the device.  Usually, for this you need to hold down the Home button, while holding it, connect the tablet to the PC.  In iTunes, the device appears. </p><p>  Then it will be possible to select the ‚ÄúRestore‚Äù option.  After that, a window appears in which you need to select "Check".  This starts the automatic update check.  After it you need to select "Restore and update."  Usually the process does not take much time.  It all depends on the speed of the Internet and computer performance. </p><h2>  Alternative option </h2><p>  Resetting iPad 3 to factory settings can also be done using iCloud.  This option is less commonly used because it is more profitable to use iTunes.  However, once an alternative exists, it is impossible not to mention it. </p><p>  For this process, you need to go to the iCloud website from any device that is convenient for you.  Next, you need to log in there through your Apple ID account.  In the tab with devices you need to find the connected one.  In order for everything to work out, the Find iPad feature must be active on the tablet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="9to5mac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Factory settings" class="if uuid-2986529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2986529.jpg"></div><p>  After your device is displayed on the site, just click on the ‚ÄúReset‚Äù button.  Next, confirm the action by entering the password.  The update will start, the device will be reset to the factory settings. </p><p>  If you ignore the password, the tablet will become a "brick", and you will have to carry it to the service center.  So in the process it is important to be careful not to spoil the system. </p><h2>  Mindfulness </h2><p>  Restoring a system or resetting it to factory settings is a serious matter.  If you do not have experience or do everything with your sleeves down, you can ruin the gadget.  To prevent this from happening, try to study the issue before this process.  Check out the tutorials and various reviews.  If you don‚Äôt want to go to the service center, contact your friends who already know how to do this for help. </p><p>  It is important to be very careful and not to rush anywhere.  Otherwise, instead of a tablet, you will have a ‚Äúbrick‚Äù in your hands, which even specialists may not be able to handle. </p>
