    <p>  Nokia seems to have done decisively more than ever to conquer the compact smartphone market.  The 5310 release immediately after the 6500 Classic looks like an attempt to prove that the production of phones less than 10 mm thick is not a problem for the Finns.  In addition, Nokia XpressMusic 5310 seems to be trying to win the hearts of music lovers, who are many among users of modern gadgets. </p><p>  Thinking about the position in the mobile phone market, we can confidently say that the Nokia 5310 will face competition from Ericsson W880 and Sony W890.  Other potential rivals are Samsung ultra-thin phones with high sound quality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  There are a fairly large number of bonuses offered with Nokia XpressMusic 5310. In some cases, you can find a 2 GB MicroSD memory card in the package, but it depends on the country of import, so it will not always be present. </p>

    <p>  Other things that a user can find in a medium-sized box are a DC charger and a two-part hands-free device (a remote control with an 3.5 mm audio jack and a pair of headphones).  In addition, there is a MicroUSB cable. </p><p>  The software CD (drivers for the Nokia 5310 XpressMusic) and the user guide complete the list of Nokia 5310 packaging contents. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  As already noted, Nokia 5310 is another thin device from a well-known Finnish manufacturer.  It has a total of 9.9 mm thickness.  Of course, this cannot be called a world record, but, of course, this is a great achievement.  The gadget fits perfectly into almost any pocket, and its other dimensions (height and width 103.8 and 44.7 mm, respectively) are also very compact.  In addition, a weight of just 71 grams ensures that he will not burden pockets of clothing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Nokia 5310 mobile phone comes in two colors - red and blue, both of which look very stylish.  As follows from user reviews, the blue version looks more solid. </p>

    <p>  However, regardless of the color version, the Nokia 5310 XpressMusic case includes aluminum panels on the front of the device, one of which contains music player controls.  The headphone jack and light sensor are located in the center of the top of the front panel.  Below them is a 2-inch display. </p><h2>  Management and Connections </h2><p>  To the left of the display are separate music keys used to control the music player or FM radio.  As can be seen from user reviews, they are both highly functional and easy to use. </p><p>  At the bottom of the front of the phone you can see the D-Pad.  It is surrounded by two keys - select and call, as well as a call end button.  All of these controls are large enough and convenient.  The keyboard is also located in front and deserves special attention.  A lever located on the right side of the keyboard completes the list of front-end phone controls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  On the left side of the Nokia XpressMusic 5310, you can easily see the plug for the charger, while the right side contains volume buttons and a strap hole (to carry the gadget on your hand or neck). </p><p>  The bottom of the phone is completely smooth, and it does not contain any operational elements.  At the top of the device, in the left corner, is the power button.  The standard 3.5 mm audio jack is located on the opposite side, while the MicroUSB port is between them. </p><p>  The only elements located on the back of the Nokia 5310 are a 2-megapixel camera and three acoustic speakers.  Unfortunately, there is no flash, and this means that night shooting is impossible. </p><h2>  Nokia 5310 XpressMusic: battery and memory features </h2><p>  Opening the battery cover allows you to see the BL-4CT battery and the SIM card slot.  The battery capacity of 860 mAh allows the smartphone to work 300 hours in standby mode or 5 hours and 20 minutes in talk mode.  Of course, these figures cannot be called record, but with them you will not be forced to carry a charger everywhere. </p>

    <p>  At first it might seem that the SIM card can be inserted / removed without removing the battery, but this is actually impossible due to the lock of the SIM holder. </p><p>  Another place hidden under the battery cover is the memory card slot.  The reviews claim that it‚Äôs not very convenient, because you have to remove the cover every time you want to access your memory card. </p><h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  The Nokia 5310 keyboard has wide buttons.  This makes it easy to find keys on different lines, but it is almost impossible to do the same within the same line.  This causes some orientation problems if you rely solely on touch.  Nevertheless, the size of the keys really helps in a quick error-free typing. </p>

    <p>  The backlighting is very uneven, but it works quite well.  In the dark, the device will not cause any problems in use, but other gadgets look much more attractive in this regard. </p><p>  The Nokia 5310 is a 2-inch QVGA display capable of displaying up to 16 million colors.  It pleasantly surprises with image quality and intelligibility in direct sunlight.  On the other hand, according to user reviews, its small size can be called a significant drawback. </p><p>  In addition, neither the backlight nor the contrast are user configurable.  In the menu, you can set only the phone‚Äôs behavior in power saving mode.  Animated screen savers can be set by converting the screen saver into a displayed digital clock, the current date and an icon indicating missed events, if any. </p><p>  All of these readings are quite legible in any light.  In the menu you will also find a sleep mode option with which the display turns off completely. </p>

    <h2>  Telephony </h2><p>  As you might guess, the signal reception and call quality in Nokia 5310 are of high quality.  In conversation, audibility remains loud and clear at both ends.  The vibration of the phone is moderate. </p><h2>  Interface </h2><p>  <span>The Nokia 5310</span> uses <span>the</span> Series 40 5th Edition <span>user interface</span> .  As it became known, Nokia developers decided to skip the 4th edition and went straight to the 5th from the 3rd.  But as user reviews say, the navigation and control of the phone are almost the same as in the previous edition, and identical to the <span>Nokia 6500 Classic.</span>  The mobile phone offers a huge number of customizable options, but this is feasible due to the complicated menu structure and navigation. </p><p>  When the display is in standby mode, by default it renders pre-selected wallpapers plus signal strength, battery status and time (in the top panel).  Under the top panel are the operator‚Äôs logo and date.  The lower bar is intended to describe the functions assigned to the central navigation and two context keys.  The central navigation button opens the main menu, and for the soft keys you can assign a function of your choice.  The font on the main display can be any color. </p><p>  If necessary, the active standby mode is activated.  It consists of several elements that can be edited or moved according to the preferences of the user.  By default, the upper area is reserved for quick access to frequently used functions indicated by the corresponding icons.  The central square provides instant access to the music player.  At the very bottom, events from the calendar for the current day are displayed. </p><p>  The main menu of the Nokia 5310 XpressMusic (factory firmware) can be visualized in one of four different ways: a grid of icons with or without signatures, a list of items and tabs.  Although each of them has its pros and cons, most user reviews recommend a typical type of grid with signatures. </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  Without a doubt, the music player is one of the most important applications in the Nokia 5310. Therefore, do not be surprised that Nokia developers have made great efforts to make it very good.  The presented version does not have any major improvements in functionality, but some of the innovations are very pleasant and are well suited to the overall design of the phone. </p><p>  Dedicated music control keys are also advanced.  They are used to control the music player and FM radio. </p><p>  In addition, the control contains typical functions of a music player, and also sorts songs by artist, album and genre.  The player works with the formats MP3, MIDI, <span>AAC, AAC +,</span> WMA.  Naturally, the A2DP profile is also supported, which allows you to listen to music via Bluetooth using wireless headphones. </p><p>  If you do not like the headset that comes in the factory packaging, you can easily replace it with another one - a standard 3.5 mm jack is present on both the phone and the remote control. </p><p>  According to reviews, the smartphone Nokia 5310 XpressMusic, whose price today is about 3,000 rubles, is suitable for undemanding users who do not need modern functions and ‚Äúbells and whistles‚Äù.  As a device for communication and a compact player, this gadget has proved to be excellent. </p>
