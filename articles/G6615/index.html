Those who do not want to overpay should pay the full amount immediately, but not everyone can boast of such financial opportunities.

The construction company cooperates with many financial institutions.  The client can independently choose with which bank to conclude an agreement. </p><p>  Interest-free installments are also possible.  However, in this case, the full amount will need to be paid before the house is put into operation. </p><p>  Not only the Arsenal construction company offers good apartments in the Orange residential complex.

The partitions between the apartments are made of thick aerated concrete blocks, providing high-quality sound insulation.  Each staircase has a high-speed silent elevator.  The apartments have false ceilings, painted walls. </p><p>  If you believe the reviews, all the described residential complexes are perfect for life.  However, before making a choice, it is worth weighing all the pros and cons.  To blindly trust the opinions expressed on the Internet is not worth it. </p>
