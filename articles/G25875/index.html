    <h2>  The principle of operation of LED lamps </h2><p>  In electronic equipment, light emitting diodes have been used for a long time.  It all started with light indicators, dashboards, information and advertising displays.  The development of technology has allowed the use of LED lamps for lighting.  From the incandescent lamp, the LED design is characterized by a minimum loss of heat when converting AC to DC.  The luminous intensity directly depends on the strength of the current: more current - brighter light.  LED lamp, 220V voltage, much more economical and safer than many other light sources. </p><h2>  LED lamp design </h2><p>  As can be seen from the diagram, the principle of LED illumination is based on the passage of an electric current through it.  A special control device is placed in the device - a microcircuit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED lamp 220v" class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1078792.jpg" width="426"></div>  A converter is also built into the design, which changes the current of the general power supply network to the operating parameters of the lamp components.  The LED lamp (220V) differs from other alternative devices to the incandescent lamp in that in its circuit there is no energy-consuming component - a transformer.  This affects the efficiency of the device.  The principle of operation of the LED lamp is the same for all models, regardless of the shape of the ceiling, light and color radiation, power.  Differences can only be in the value of the operating voltage.  Typically, these are standard values ‚Äã‚Äãof 4;  12 and 220 volts.

Cost-effectiveness </h2><p>  The main <span>feature of the characteristics of LED lamps</span> is a low consumption of electric energy, but at the same time a large light output, maximum light flux.  The spectrum emitted by lighting devices is determined by the color temperature.  This value is usually expressed in degrees on the Kelvin scale.  The warmer (closer to yellow) the light, the smaller the numerical value. </p>

    <p>  A familiar, traditional lamp with a tungsten filament has a color temperature of 2700 to 3500 K. At the same time, the color temperature of the cold white glow emitted by LED fluorescent lamps reaches 6500 K. The low-temperature, yellow color is most pleasing to the eye, it is at a minimum degree blocks the secretion of melatonin.  Having paid attention to this, the industry began to produce LED lamps of low color temperature, using a combination of various LEDs - LED-RGB.  However, the price at the same time becomes incomparably high. </p><h2>  Cap </h2><p>  Another feature that affects consumer qualities.  Modern lighting fixtures and equipment are available with different cartridges, in the same way the base elements of LED lamps are distinguished.  They can be pin, pin, spotlight, focusing, telephone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED bulbs" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1078788.jpg"></div>  Nevertheless, by far the most common in everyday life is the classic model of the threaded base of Edison.

Its dispersion contributes to the radiator.  This is an aluminum, graphite or ceramic part integrated into the device.  In accordance with accepted standards, the operating temperature should not exceed 70 degrees.  As a rule, the radiator is protected by a thermoplastic casing. </p><h2>  Variety of choices </h2><p>  LED lamps differ in design.  A variety of forms allows you to choose a model for any type of lighting fixtures or to the style of the interior.  Round, plum, spherical, standard.  In closed plafonds, lamps with transparent bulbs that do not hide the internal "filling" are used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="replacement of lamps with LED" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1078791.jpg"></div>  To create an aesthetic, design effect, a matte finish is indispensable, giving a soft, uniform light.  If directional lighting is required, a mirror lamp will create it.  The most popular LED lamp "candle".  They perfectly fit various decorative lamps, creating the illusion of light from a burning flame.  The design of the bulb is very original:

You also need to pay attention to the marking of the base.  It must match the type of cartridge.  So, the lamp with the designation G9 can only be installed in the <span>cartridge G9.</span>  The pairing of the cap with the bulb should be strong, excluding loosening.  If there are <span>illuminated switches</span> in the mains <span>,</span> then it is not recommended to complete it with LED lamps. </p><p>  How to choose a LED lamp for the house in which dimmer devices are used?  Most lamps do not respond to dimmer adjustments, but turn on and work continuously.  But gradually the market is saturated with <span>dimmable LED lamps.</span>  A specially assembled driver allows, using a dimmer, to adjust the brightness of the lamp.  This property is marked with the appropriate marking on the lamp or packaging. </p>

    <p>  Lamp life may be affected by the manufacturer's specified life.  Usually claimed from 20 to 50 thousand hours.  But practice does not confirm these figures.  There is a direct relationship between the durability of the device and the quality factor of components and thorough assembly.  Low-quality Chinese consumer goods breaks down in a matter of months.  Well-known brands guarantee the normal operation of lamps for 3-5 years.  This is due to the process of degradation of crystals, they slowly lose their brightness and completely stop the glow. </p><p>  Another way to choose a LED lamp for the home is to evaluate the spectrum of its glow.  Most lamps emit an unpleasant, inanimate white light.  According to psychologists, it negatively affects the well-being.  In the home interior, LED lamps of a soft yellow glow should be purchased. </p><p>  Poor build quality causes pulsation of radiation.  Such a flaw is not noticed by the human eye, but strongly affects the nervous system, provoking rapid fatigue.  The presence of such a defect can be established using a mobile phone, its camera.  The image of the pulsating lamp on the screen will blink. </p><h2>  Manufacturer and price </h2><p>  How to choose a LED lamp for home?  An important criterion is price.  The low cost of the lighting device, of course, indicates the poor characteristics of the purchased goods.  Quality products cannot be cheap.  This applies to well-known foreign brands.  There is an opinion among consumers that the most high-quality and reliable LED <span>fluorescent lamps are</span> imported from abroad.  This is not entirely true, if we analyze and analyze the modern lighting market in detail, we can conclude that some Russian companies also demonstrate high quality and stability of their products.  Domestic manufacturers have taken a big step forward and their products are also trustworthy. </p>
