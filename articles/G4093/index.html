There are many <span>park areas,</span> as befits any metropolis.  Some have been equipped since the Soviet Union, but there are completely new ones.  The Moscow government promises to refine all parks by the end of 2018. </p><p>  Many of them have already been put in order, some should be worked on.  The mayor of the city says that several recreational areas were practically created from scratch.  At the moment, there are more than 100 recreation areas in Moscow. Their number continues to grow, which is good news. </p>

    <h2>  Park in place of garages </h2><p>  Where the bases of the Zhilishnik GBU used to be, now there is a new Akademichesky park.  The main <span>hallmark of this</span> recreation area is the green hills, they occupy most of the territory.  At first glance, it might seem that these are golf courses.  As it turned out later, trees and bushes are planned to be planted here in late autumn. </p><p>  Previously, on the site of the new recreation area there were garages, farm buildings and a cleaning equipment park.  This, of course, did not create any comfort.  Now there are many beautiful winding paths covered with tiles, there are playgrounds, arbors, benches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We finished landscaping the park at the end of summer.  Residents of nearby houses were incredibly happy with such a surprise, because it is much more beautiful than garages and untidy territory. </p><p>  The new park in the Academic region of Moscow pleased local residents, because now the recreation area is a few steps from the house.  Appreciated the park and lovers of running in the morning. </p>

    <h2>  New attraction of the Academic region </h2><p>  The park covers an area of ​​just over 16 hectares, is located near the Endocrinology Center.  The park has several entrances, which greatly simplified the life of the residents of the area.  Previously, they were forced to bypass this territory, but now the path to a kindergarten, store or school can be shortened through the park. </p><p>  The Academic Park on <span>Dmitry Ulyanov</span> was created, rather, as an attraction and a recreation area for residents of the district.  It is unlikely that anyone will want to go through all of Moscow to look at the hills and benches.  But if you are going through, then be sure to stop by.  It was created according to the modern requirements of landscape design. </p>

    <h2>  Fashion on the hills </h2><p>  The area on which the park is now located was very prominent.  This feature was made the main highlight of the recreation area.  The hills are covered with artificial rolled grass.  This creates the effect of English lawns and makes the area very neat.  Beautiful pedestrian paths meander between the hills.  In the evening and at night they are highlighted, which creates an indescribable romantic atmosphere. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To see the new recreational area with your own eyes, you need to get to the <span>Akademicheskaya metro station.</span>  The park is located on D. Ulyanov Street, so you can move right along the sidewalk and turn right before refueling.  You can immediately go towards school number 199.  If you pass by a kindergarten, the Red Cross Museum, you will find yourself in a park. </p>

    <h2>  Park pergolas and gazebos </h2><p>  The main attraction of the park can be considered the main square and a large semicircular pergola.  Eleven smaller pergolas, arbors and benches are scattered throughout the park. </p><p>  Akademichesky Park has become a lifesaver for adherents of active pastime.  Here they equipped a sports and game zone.  It includes a football field, horizontal bars, a basketball court and the latest treadmills.  There are several sports fields, including for physiotherapy exercises.  Special zones are also reserved for children.  One of them is decorated with designer models of chemical elements.  There is room for kids to jump and climb: on swings, slides and other attractions. </p><h2>  Ads by Darwin </h2><p>  If you go through the main entrance, you can see three monuments to dinosaurs.  First, the thought comes in that it is a Jurassic theme park, but no.  This is an advertising move.  It is likely that many children will be interested in these creatures, and to learn more about them, you can visit the Darwin Museum, which is very close. </p>

    <h2>  Minor flaws </h2><p>  At the entrance to the park we see signs, but they are sent not to where you need to.  If the tourist trusts this information, then you have to wander around a bit.  Perhaps the people who worked on the improvement of this zone did not know where it was or showed inattention.  Or the vandal’s hand touched the pointer. </p><p>  Another disadvantage is the proximity to a gas station. </p><p>  Through the park scattered gazebos are scattered.  They are beautiful, wooden, painted with brown stain.  From a distance it’s nice to look at them, but sitting in them is not particularly comfortable, because a path passes through the arbor.  This design of the gazebo makes it awkward for both seated and walking. </p><p>  The park is not only a place of entertainment, conversation, but also a way to retire, read a book, draw, enjoy nature.  Apparently, the organizers did not think it through very well.  Pergolas and benches are also located in the passage zones. </p>

    <p>  The paths are winding, with smooth bends, very harmoniously fit into the general atmosphere of the park.  Since the terrain is hilly, the designers decided to emphasize this with stairs and ramps that smoothly go into the paths.  By the way, they are paved with <span>granite tiles.</span>  If someone is worried that in the cold season these sidewalks will be slippery, then it’s not worth it.  If water gets in, such a coating does not slip even in winter.  This is an absolute plus. </p><p>  In some places instead of granite tiles, paths are paved with broken flat stones, gaps are covered with gravel.  This gives the park even more flavor, but walking along such an authentic road is not convenient, especially for high-heeled girls.  But here you get beautiful selfies. </p><p>  In the vicinity of the park there is a snow melting point, which also does not give it romance. </p><p>  In general, the Akademichesky park is beautiful, but you won’t be able to hide from the hustle and bustle, but it’s nice to walk around and enjoy the fresh renovation of the territory. </p>

    <h2>  About the most important disadvantages </h2><p>  The park is beautiful, tidy.  It was created not just as a passage zone with benches, there are sports grounds, specially equipped paths for running, which implies a long stay for vacationers.  However, there is not a single toilet in the entire park with an area of ​​16 hectares.  We hope that the Moscow government will soon solve this problem, because the park is new and some of the nuances are not yet complete. </p><p>  The second serious drawback of the Akademichesky city park is the lack of stalls.  Usually you want to drink coffee, eat ice cream or a hot dog sitting on a bench.  To do this, you will have to go to the Tchaikoff store, which is located on the avenue of the 60th anniversary of the October Revolution, Von Wakano to Vavilova, Taste of Lotus to Ulyanov or to the school cafeteria.  There is another option: to bring sausages, bread and cucumber with you - this is the standard beach set of our grandfathers and grandmothers. </p><p>  Well, and, of course, the lack of cover.  Do not hide from the rain neither in the arbor, nor in the pergola.  There are trees, but they are few.  The park was opened in the fall, if the situation does not change until next summer, then you can come here to sunbathe, because you can’t hide from the sun either. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Akademichesky park in Moscow has already become a favorite place for residents of the district.  It can not yet be called a full-fledged vacation spot, rather, a beautifully designed walk-through area with benches and an outlet for lovers of dynamic relaxation.  The creators still have work to do to create a complete comfortable zone. </p>
