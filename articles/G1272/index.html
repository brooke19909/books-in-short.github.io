    <h2>  Peresvet Biography </h2><p>  Alexander's date of birth is not known for certain.  A number of sources indicate a boyar origin.  That is, belonging to the upper class.  Boyars held leadership positions and owned land.  In the <span>14th century,</span> every boyar was trained in military craft from childhood.  Place of birth - Bryansk.  Presumably, Alexander Peresvet participated in campaigns and wars.  At one point, he was tonsured a monk.  The ceremony was held in Rostov.  Since there are practically no authoritative sources that could reliably report on certain events, historians still have discussions about the biography of Peresvet.  The problem also lies in the fact that ancient writers often resorted to allegories and exaltations.  That is, famous personalities were credited with feats and qualities that they did not actually possess.  And it‚Äôs quite difficult for modern scientists to distinguish fiction from reality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One way or another, we can safely say that by 1380, Alexander Peresvet was a monastic shimonakh.  It was in this rank that he approached the Battle of Kulikovo, which brought him eternal glory. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  In the 14th century, Russia was exhausted under the Mongol-Tatar yoke of the Golden Horde.  At the same time, the influence of the Moscow kingdom intensified.  Several Russian princes were able to gain several victories over the Tatars, which gave strength to the resistance of the occupation.  In 1376, Russian troops began to liberate their land, crowding the Horde to the south.  During the retreat, the khans of Mamaia ravaged several principalities, but did not enter into open battle. <br>  In mid-August, the Russian army arrives in Kolomna.  Warriors gather in different ways from all over Russia to repulse the Tatars once and for all.  Horde leader Mamai believes that Dmitry is afraid to cross the Oka and hopes for Lithuanian ambulance.  But by early September, the Russians crossed the river and moved through the Ryazan lands to Mamaia.  Among the soldiers was Alexander Peresvet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Warrior monk" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/969423.jpg" width="406"></div><br>  Such a Dmitry‚Äôs maneuver was regarded as a rash step.  Panic rumors spread throughout Russia about the imminent defeat of the coalition of princes.

    <h2>  Kulikovo battle </h2><p>  On September 8, the famous <span>Battle of Kulikovo</span> and the duel between Peresvet and Chelubey took place.  The day before, Russian troops crossed the Don River.  Grand Duke Dmitry gathered from his banners from 40 to 60 thousand people.  The Moscow regiment was the core.  Arriving Lithuanians and Ryazans stood on the flanks.  On the night of September 7, a review of the troops took place.  Dmitry understood the huge responsibility that was assigned to him.  Because in case of defeat, all lands to Moscow would have been open to the Tatars.  Therefore, the review was carried out very carefully. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Relight and Chelubey" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/969424.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  Alexander Peresvet was most likely in the central regiment with the court of the Moscow prince.  Deep in the night, scouts from both sides examine the enemy‚Äôs positions.  Only in the morning the first skirmishes occur.  Tatars led about 100 thousand people to the Kulikovo field.  Since medieval sources tend to significantly increase the number of troops, it is quite difficult to determine the true number.  Some sources indicate up to 40 thousand Russian soldiers and up to 60 thousand Tatars. <br>  On the morning of September 8, Rusichs lined up in battle formations.  The legendary heroes of the ensuing battle made speeches.  A thick fog lay on the field, and the Russians, for several hours in a daze, waited for the battle to begin.  A few hours later the Tatars with a thick wall left the forest.

This unwritten rule was observed inviolably.  The fight lasted until death and no one had the right to intervene.  The origins of this custom go back to BC.  Ancient legends indicate that instead of a battle between two troops, a battle between two people could occur.  The losing side receded.  Of course, in reality, most likely the battle began regardless of the match.  But he had a very important psychological significance for the fighters.  For many, he was a kind of superstition. </p><h2>  Relight match with Chelubey </h2><p>  From the side of the Tatars came the famous Chelubey.  According to ancient legends, he was famous for his tremendous physical strength and military cunning.  He was the best in fights.  It was for these purposes that the Tatars hired him.  Before the Battle of Kulikovo, he did not know defeats.  In horse battles, he used a spear, a meter longer than usual, which allowed him to kill the enemy before the collision.  He moved away from the Tatar army on a white horse, dressed in gray clothes. <br>  Alexander Peresvet was in crimson robes and stood under the ‚Äúblack‚Äù (red) Russian Orthodox banner.  The troops froze in anticipation of the battle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Legendary heroes" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/969427.jpg" width="499"></div><br>  Peresvet and Chelubey dispersed and rushed to each other with straightened spears.  They faced all the gallop.  Spears simultaneously pierced the fighters.  Peresvet and Chelubey died simultaneously.  But Alexander managed to stay on the horse longer, which meant his victory.  Encouraged by the victory of their fighter Rusich got furious.  A foggy morning broke the howl of trumpets, and the Russian army rushed to the attack.

    <h2>  Relight with Chelubey on <span>Kulikovo field:</span> another version </h2><p>  According to another version, Peresvet went on a trick and self-sacrifice intentionally.  The hero who fought with Chelubey before the Battle of Kulikovo knew about the enemy‚Äôs long spear.  Therefore, he specially stripped himself of all the armor so that the spear of the Tatar favorite passed through Alexander‚Äôs body quickly and this would allow him to hit the enemy.  The warrior monk put on a church outfit with an Orthodox cross.  A self-confident Chelubey pierced Peresvet, but he, with a spear in his body, reached for the enemy and defeated him.  In the dying agony, the Russian warrior managed to jump to his troops and only there fell. </p><h2>  Battle </h2><p>  Inspired by victory and heroic self-sacrifice, the Russian troops screamed out at the enemy.  The parties clashed in a fierce battle.  Tatars outnumbered.  But the Russians left in ambush a regiment of governor Serpukhov.  At a decisive moment, he struck the rear of the Tatar troops.  Horsemen chopped from behind, Tatars faltered.  They stampeded and almost all were killed. <br>  The defeat of the Horde in the <span>Battle of Kulikovo Field</span> became the starting point for the liberation of Russia from the Tatar-Mongols.  Inspired by the victory, the Russian princes decided to rally around Moscow. </p><h2>  Hero's Burial </h2><p>  The body of Alexander Peresvet was taken to Moscow.  There he was buried with military honors near the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin in a private crypt.  Legendary heroes of the battle, such as <span>Rodion Oslyabya,</span> were buried with him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Relight with Chelubey on Kulikovo field" class="if" height="495" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/969425.jpg" width="369"></div>  In the 18th century, builders found an ancient tomb under the bell tower, in which Alexander Peresvet was supposedly buried.  Some historians consider this information implausible.  After restoration, the temple was supplemented with a tomb and a tombstone was placed.  It lasted until the 20s of the 20th century.  Now in the refectory of the church a new tombstone has been put up, which repeats the cast-iron sarcophagus of Peresvet.  The grave is open to visitors.

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The hero of the Battle of Kulikovo was numbered by the Russian Orthodox Church.  September 7 is considered to be Alexander Peresvet's Memorial Day.  The Moscow State Academy keeps a <span>pectoral cross,</span> which supposedly belongs to Peresvet.  During the time of the Russian Empire, several warships were named after Alexander.  Today there are several streets, as well as a city in the Moscow region, named after Peresvet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Relight match with Chelubey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/969426.jpg"></div>  In 2006, the special detachment VV Peresvet was formed.
