Each of them takes home his impressions, but here is a list of what the guests agree on: </p><ul><li>  The hotel staff is always respectable, friendly. </li><li>  The hotel is striking in its cleanliness: not only are the rooms cleaned, but throughout the large territory of the hotel it is almost impossible to find garbage or dirt. </li><li>  Pleases a lot of entertainment.  There are options not only for active pastime (for example, volleyball, futsal or golf), but also the opportunity to undergo a massage session, attend evening shows, and so on.  The main thing - all this can be done without leaving the hotel. </li><li>  It is very convenient to relax with children.  For them, clubs are provided by age, where they are offered various entertainment. </li><li>  The Swedish line pleases with a wide variety of fresh and tasty dishes.  For adherents of a healthy diet, there is a diet menu.  Also, vegetarians will not stay hungry.  A wide variety of fruits, seafood, wines and so on. </li><li>  If you want to have a snack between serving dishes at the buffet, then the hotel has a snack bar and cafe. </li><li>  Towels are changed every day, as is room cleaning. </li><li>  The hotel has a convenient location: close to the beach, and the road passes through various shops where you can buy groceries, clothes or souvenirs.  At the same time, Atlantic Park is not on a busy street, so it‚Äôs relatively quiet around. </li><li>  Check-in is after 14 hours.  But if the number is prepared, then it is possible to check in earlier than the specified time. </li><li>  The largest number of vacationers here is from the category of either tourist groups or families with children. </li><li>  The apartments are large, bright and airy.  The mattresses are very comfortable, and the pillows are hypoallergenic. </li><li>  The hotel staff is Russian-speaking, so tourists from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and other CIS countries will not have problems with the language. </li><li>  Mini cosmetics (shampoos, toothpaste, soap, and so on) are updated daily as they are used. </li><li>  Room service at a high level. </li><li>  The pool area is quite large.  Even with large occupancy, there will always be free sunbeds. </li></ul><h2>  Negative comments from visitors </h2><p>  All that is described above are the positive aspects of the HSM Atlantic Park 4 * hotel.  But the hotel has a few points that guests cause negative emotions: </p><ul><li>  Audibility in the apartment is above average.  Therefore, quite often it is well audible not only passing along the corridor, but also its neighbors. </li><li>  The balconies are closely located to each other, so if someone enters the neighboring terrace, then you can‚Äôt retire.  The partitions themselves are thin and medium in height. </li><li>  Due to the fact that the windows overlook the pool area, the rooms are quite noisy at lunchtime. </li><li>  Room cleaning is sometimes not on schedule. </li><li>  Nearby there are two hotels, which often host noisy companies. </li><li>  The temperature of the water in the bathroom quite often changes from very hot to cold.  This happens very unpredictably, so during the shower you can experience inconvenience. </li></ul>

    <p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the resort itself.  It focuses more on the British, so local restaurants and cafes often serve English dishes.  Yes, and tourists are mainly from England.
