York, a city in the UK, unfortunately, is not familiar to everyone.  And this is really unfair, since the atmosphere of this small city will win the heart of any of its guests.  It impresses not only with its magnificent nature and architecture, but also with the spirit of history in the air. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  There is evidence of people living in the modern city of York already during the Mesolithic.  And the sources call the official date of the founding of the city 71 year of our era.  This event was preceded by the subjugation of the brigants by the ninth legion.  In honor of their victory, they built a wooden fortress near the confluence of the rivers Uza and Foss. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="york city in uk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69285/2208798.jpg"></div>  The amazing city of Great Britain York got its original name from the Romans.  Its roots go back to Latin, and initially it sounded like Eboracum.  There is no official translation of this word, but there are speculations that it could mean "the area in which yew trees grow" or "Eborasa field."

    <p>  In 866, after the capture of the Vikings, the city was renamed, its new name was Jorvik.  At the same time, he became the capital of the Kingdom of Yorkshire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And only after the Normans conquered the territory of England, he gained the name familiar to modern people - the city of York.  In the UK, the very first mention of it already under its modern name appeared in the 18th century. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  York is a medieval English city.  In the UK there are many cities that have kept castles and cathedrals on their territory, but York can rightfully receive the title of a city-history.  For almost 2 thousand years, York was the capital of the north.  It is not surprising that George the Sixth himself called the history of this city a reflection of the history of all of England. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="england york city in uk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69285/2208796.jpg"></div>  After the city was founded in 71, the Romans assigned him an important mission, setting up a military base in it.  He was such until the beginning of the 7th century, when Archbishop Paulinus opened a new direction in it, bringing the Christian religion to the city.  As a result, in 627 AD, the first cathedral was erected.  Later, the city of York in the UK, according to information, also became an educational center.

    <p>  Over time, the city gained new statuses, including the administrative center and the residence of the archbishop.  Prior to mass industrialization, the city of York in the UK was second only to London in economic development and importance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thus, in the process of active industrialization, some cities overtook York, however, this did not prevent him from preserving his uniqueness. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  Statistical detailed information about the city of York in the UK can be difficult to find, because it is very small, it is impossible to compare with megacities.  At present, about 208,400 residents live in the city, and the population density is 687 people per square kilometer.  More than 90% are representatives of the Caucasian race. </p>

The average wage is lower than the average in the UK.  Perhaps for this reason, many residents prefer to work in neighboring cities.
