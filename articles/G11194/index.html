    <h2>  Negative Resort Reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there were some shortcomings in Hotel Asdem Beach Labada 5 *.  Hotel reviews contain a number of negative comments: </p><ul><li>  Unfortunately, at the moment the hotel does not correspond to its five-star status; </li><li>  air conditioners are rather weak and can not cope with the Turkish heat; </li><li>  due to a poor ventilation system in the bathroom there is a stale smell, and mold appears on the walls; </li><li>  half of the outlets in the rooms do not work; </li><li>  because of a leaking pan, water is constantly standing on the floor in the bathroom; </li><li>  even if you leave a good tip to the maid, the cleaning will be very mediocre (besides, it will not be daily); </li><li>  soap supplies in the bathroom are not replenished even after persistent appeals to the administration; </li><li>  in the minibar of drinks there is only a couple of bottles of mineral water; </li><li>  Wireless Internet catches only near the reception desk, but no more than 10 people can simultaneously connect to it; </li><li>  a cracked mirror in the elevator that you can cut into or ruin your clothes; </li><li>  long lines are constantly going to the food desk in the restaurant; </li><li>  the air conditioning does not work in the dining room, and therefore, going there, all your appetite disappears; </li><li>  the territory once had an artificial pond, which now turned into a fetid puddle, around which mosquitoes circled; </li><li>  the hotel is very old and, despite the fact that the hotel was recently renovated, it is all old and dilapidated; </li><li>  guests who arrive at the hotel late at night are not offered any snack (the maximum you can count on is tea); </li><li>  inflated prices for excursions with hotel guides; </li><li>  even if the ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù sign hangs on your door, this does not mean at all that the maids will not burst into your room with cleaning (it is better to close the door with a lock). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Many tourists are disappointed when they arrive at the Hotel Asdem Beach Labada 5 * hotel.  The description of the five-star hotel, which they could read in the brochures or on the booking sites, is not entirely true.  Of course, many years ago, when this hotel was just starting its work, it fully corresponded to its status.  But, apparently, at some point its development stopped, and the stars still falsely attract tourists.  Although, the low cost of a trip could alert travelers.  Although, if you are more interested in the clear sea, rather than the living conditions at the hotel, then you can safely go here. </p><p>  A separate topic is the living conditions at the Hotel Asdem Beach Labada 5 * hotel.  The rooms are very old and untidy.  It seems that the entire reconstruction of 2012 consisted exclusively in a superficial cosmetic repair.  At the same time, all communications, wiring, electrical appliances, plumbing, etc. remained in the same state.  Entering the room, you will immediately feel an unpleasant smell, which can be found, perhaps, in old and dusty apartments.  It is musty and damp.  And this situation arose not only because of a poorly functioning ventilation system and outdated furniture.  If the maids were more conscientious in their work and at least sometimes did a full-fledged cleaning, the atmosphere in the rooms would be much more pleasant.  And what is especially surprising is that even impressive amounts of tips and appeals to the administration do not save the situation.  And what is really surprising for a five-star hotel - there is not even a bar of soap in the bathroom, not to mention shampoos, shower gels and other excesses.  Cases of theft in rooms are also known, but it is difficult to prove something here. </p><p>  It is also worth saying a few words about the staff.  It is important to note immediately that almost all employees are fluent in Russian.  This greatly facilitates the registration process, and just human communication.  Nevertheless, if you have any problems associated with living and resting, then the workers sharply forget all their Russian language skills, pretending that they absolutely do not understand you.  Because of this, scandals at the reception desk are a common occurrence for this hotel, which you get used to in a couple of days.  Most conflicts arise due to the requirements of guests to move them to another room, more suitable for living (which is a completely fair claim). </p><p> Of course, this hotel could not do without positive aspects.  The first thing worth noting is nutrition.  Varied, tasty, hearty and fresh Turkish food captivates the hearts of guests and makes you forget about many shortcomings.  Although the atmosphere of the dining room leaves much to be desired (which is just the lack of air conditioning and constant queues for distribution).  But alcohol is completely substandard.  It is apparently diluted.  But this is a problem for almost all hotels, regardless of the stardom and cost of the trip. </p><p>  The territory makes a dual impression.  On the one hand, it is spacious and comfortable.  There is a lot of space for walking, a huge amount of greenery, birds sing.  There are even hammocks on which it is very pleasant to relax in the shade of trees.  Nevertheless, at every step you may encounter signs of desolation and abandonment.  What is only a half-dried pond, the water in which has long stagnated and bloomed.  The hotel's beach is also very groomed and dirty.  Nevertheless, crystal clear water makes you forget about everything.  And in order not to hurt your feet on the stones, it is recommended to go into the sea in special slippers. </p><p>  Thus, this hotel is for active and picky tourists who do not want to spend a lot of money on vacation.  If you are looking for the sea and the sun, then you will get them.  In addition, the hotel boasts a very convenient location.  So you can visit the entertainment centers, restaurants, and museums, and go to neighboring settlements on a regular bus.  If you are ready to close your eyes to some of the shortcomings, you can have a great time at this hotel. </p>
