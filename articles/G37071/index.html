Recreation facilities, hotels, housing prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Illichivsk is famous not only for its beautiful Black Sea coast and warm climate.  It should be noted that it is also an important industrial community - there are many factories and one of the largest ports of Ukraine.  However, even with such an economic factor, it remains a clean and ennobled resort of the Black Sea region.  Here is exactly what attracts modern tourists so much - alleys, parks, fountains, streets where you can spend a relaxing holiday and breathe in the healing air. </p><p>  The port and all enterprises operating through it are located in the Liman bay.  Due to this, the industry does not affect the environmental status of the residential sector.  It is separated from these structures by a wide park area. </p><p>  By the way, in 2016 Ilyichevsk was renamed to Chernomorsk.  This is where the Bulgarian Golden Sands begin.  The clean beach that is here is interrupted by the mouth of the Danube. </p><p>  This resort area has become popular due to the fresh and healing air, the beautiful sea, the warm sun and the “golden” beaches.  Housing here is inexpensive, which allows people of any income to find good places.  The shore is filled with park areas, groves.  Here are <span>recreation centers, pensions,</span> hotels and hotels. </p><p>  A lot of restaurants, cafes, bars, nightclubs are located in a city like Illichivsk.  <span>Rest (recreation facilities</span> will be discussed below) promises to be unforgettable.  Thanks to summer areas and gazebos, a romantic evening or dinner with the family will be forever remembered. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Local hotels, as a rule, do not have large sizes.  Almost all are built on the coast.  Near them there is definitely a cafe or restaurant, pharmacy, shop. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ilyichevsk recreation" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1421219.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Housing choice </h2><p>  Various housing options are offered by Illichivsk.  <span>Rest (the</span> most popular <span>recreation centers</span> ) can be spent in expensive comfortable apartments, as well as in cheaper rooms.  Even without paying attention to the fact that the city is small, it should be noted that the range of housing offered will compete with any major resort. </p><p>  In addition to recreation centers and hotels, apartments and rooms in houses that are located near the coast in the private sector are often rented here.  Approximate prices - $ 12-16, but in the summer, the cost increases many times. </p><p>  In the private sector there are hotels and guest houses.  In the latter, the average cost of a room is $ 8-12.  In hotels, prices are much higher: from $ 30 to $ 120.  There are options for rooms with access to the courtyard, private parking. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  For a small fee you can stay in comfortable rooms of local hotels.  The leaders were Nika and Elite Tennis Club.  On the territory of the latter there are various tennis courts, which allow vacationers to learn to play or maintain their level, even during vacation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The elite complexes “Fountain” and “Villa on the Embankment” set the average cost of $ 60-200.  They are famous for Ilyichevsk.  <span>Recreation (recreation centers</span> and these institutions are constantly competing) is proposed in the following rooms to choose from: </p><ul><li>  Suite (family, exclusive); </li><li>  standard (double); </li><li>  two-level room (5-6 people). </li></ul><p>  The price may include meals, parking and Internet.  However, all institutions need to clarify this issue. </p><h2>  Recreation facilities </h2><p>  The minimum cost of living at recreation centers of Illichivsk is $ 4.  As budget options, you can offer complexes "Panorama", "Dolphin", "Flower", "Bukovina."  In them rooms for two people per day will cost from $ 14 to $ 22.  The boarding houses “Fairy Tale”, “Bay” and others will cost a little more. Their average room price is $ 20-60. </p><p>  Most of the local complexes have their own equipped beach.  This especially pleases guests who decide to visit Illichivsk.  <span>Rest (recreation centers of</span> this city have unprecedented demand) can be spent on sports grounds or wander in a nearby forest.  Gardening is the issue that greatly worries the city administration and the institutions themselves.  In summer, you need to book a room in advance, as you may find that there are no free options.  Moreover, the longer the lease is, the more expensive accommodation will be. </p><h2>  Laguna South </h2>

    <p>  The cost of the house per person is $ 4.  Before the change of leadership, this complex was constantly visited by tourists.  They knew that it was always clean, and the food was delicious in the dining room.  However, now the recreation center "Lukomorye" (Illichivsk) is constantly receiving negative reviews from vacationers.  The most common complaints are theft.  They open the houses during the day, and after that the administration evicts people and sends them back home. </p><h2>  "Falcon" </h2>
