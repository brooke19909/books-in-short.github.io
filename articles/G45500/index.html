What to do in winter in the Abkhaz resorts, whose climate is slightly different from the coast of the Krasnodar Territory?  The correct answer is to enjoy your winter break.  Abkhazia attracts with low prices and transport accessibility.  You can get here by train, plane or bus.  What is especially nice - the residents of Russia will not need a passport or a special permission to enter.  It is warm enough here in the winter months; New Year is celebrated in Abkhazia on a grand scale.  At the same time, there are much fewer tourists than in the summer months, and many attractions are available for visiting.

Many large motels and small hotels don‚Äôt even think of closing for ‚Äúoff-season‚Äù and throughout the year please tourists with entertainment, treatment and rehabilitation.  For the New Year and Christmas, as well as school <span>winter holidays</span> , ready-made tours are offered.  You can find packages with or without food, with treatment.  Buying a ready-made tour, you can be sure that the New Year in Abkhazia will be a real holiday, not overshadowed by domestic problems.  Any hotel or medical and preventive complex pleases its guests with a festive banquet and show program on the night of December 31 to January 1.  In the following evenings, discos and children's daytime parties await holidaymakers.  However, not everyone likes the option of buying a finished tour; many vacationers like to plan their vacation on their own and personally choose every little thing.

In the tourist "off season", many private owners lose their main source of income, due to which there is a fierce struggle for vacationers choosing this accommodation option.  And this means that every tourist will receive maximum attention and the best conditions.  Why is it good to rent housing from local residents for the New Year in Abkhazia?  The private sector is an accommodation option that will allow you to enjoy the coziness and informal atmosphere.  For a small fee (and sometimes without it), you can enjoy national cuisine, fresh fruits and vegetables, natural wine and chacha.  Abkhazians are very hospitable, during the holidays, homeowners will help solve all domestic problems, plan tourist excursions and will be happy to tell many interesting legends and introduce tourists to local traditions.

Most local resorts operate year-round, offering discounted treatment programs during the winter months.  But still, the most popular seasonal procedure is bathing in thermal springs.  It is believed that such natural baths help get rid of many diseases and have a positive effect on immunity.  The maximum benefit can be derived precisely in the cool season, since the combination of warm water and cold air enhances the effect of such therapy.

Most of those who have already tried this trip are satisfied.  Low prices, sincere atmosphere, lack of language barrier - all this is New Year in Abkhazia.  Reviews of tourists are mostly enthusiastic.  In the summer months, this country is incredibly beautiful, but there are too many tourists.  And in winter here, on the contrary, you can relax peacefully, with a soul, and see the real Abkhazia.  The mere contemplation of deserted beaches and sea waves is worth a lot.  However, some tourists manage to swim during the New Year holidays.

    <p>  Unhappy, some vacationers remain specific hotels, restaurants and other public institutions.  The nature and <span>climate of Abkhazia</span> in the winter are extremely pleasing; leisure options are also sufficient.  If you want to celebrate the New Year in Abkhazia, negative reviews should not scare you.  Feel free to go on vacation, and even if something goes wrong, do not focus on the festive banquet menu or the design of the hotel room, but try to get the most out of your winter vacation! </p>
