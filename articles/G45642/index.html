Umbrellas and sun loungers are provided for free use by guests.

There are always free sun loungers, even during rush hours.  If water is suddenly forgotten, you can ask for it from rescuers who are on duty right there.  It is the latter that make sure that outsiders do not penetrate the beach of the boarding house.  The entrance to the sea is gentle, the sea itself is clean. </li><li>  The beach is small but well maintained.  When compared with the territory belonging to neighboring hotels, he wins undeniably.  Here it is impossible to meet people who drink or smoke, which is important when families are resting with their children.  The sand is soft, golden.  Deck chairs are always there. </li></ul>
