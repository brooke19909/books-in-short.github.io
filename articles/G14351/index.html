Hotels, the prices of which are more than affordable, offer our compatriots the highest quality service.  Well, is that not a reason from the whole variety of tourist destinations to choose this wonderful country to visit?  So, for example, in a Vera <span>Verde Resort</span> 5 * hotel (de Belek), which operates on the OI system (all inclusive), the daily price for a room starts from 3.5 thousand rubles.  However, in addition to cheapness and high-class services, Russian tourists are attracted by interesting historical and natural sights, as well as wonderful beaches of the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vera Verde Resort 5 * (Belek)," class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/486777.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Belek City (Turkey / Antalya): Features of Rest </h2><p>  This wonderful sea town is part of the resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe famous Antalya.  It is one of the youngest tourist centers in all of Turkey.  Exactly 30 years have passed since the start of development on this section of the coast of tourism infrastructure, which is quite a bit.  However, if thirty years is not age for the entire resort, then for the first old-timer hotels, this is a "diagnosis", because most tourists prefer to stay in modern hotels that meet current standards and are built with the latest technology.  Hotel administrations, given this circumstance, constantly carry out renovations and re-innovations in their establishments, and today it can be said with full confidence that almost all Belek hotels and hotel complexes are modernized and can guarantee their guests a high-class vacation.  By the way, the biggest chip that Turkey can offer tourists is a vacation with children.  Belek, in addition, attracts with its wonderful golf courses.  This city is considered one of the best golf centers in the whole world, so every year many fans of this elite sport come to this cute cozy town on the coast of the most affectionate Mediterranean Sea to relax and enjoy your favorite game.  This is probably why all the hotels in the city are either 4-star or 5-star, and only 3 bright stars shine on rare signs.  Therefore, Belek is a relatively expensive resort on the Turkish coast, and here you can rarely find noisy youth companies who are attracted by the possibility of a democratic holiday in budget hotels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is interesting in Belek? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are practically no historical sights here, however, this area is interesting for its beautiful coniferous and eucalyptus forests that enclose the entire 20-kilometer coast of this resort with a dense wall.  In these forests there are many exotic birds, including the owl tuto-alba, which is considered a symbol of the city of Belek.  Not far from the town is Kursunlu Waterfall - a beautiful place in all of Antalya.  Here tourists can relax to the sound of falling waters and enjoy the singing of wonderful birds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Turkey.

    <h2>  How to get to Belek? </h2><p>  If you are going to <span>the Belek</span> Vera Verde Resort 5 * <span>hotel</span> and think how to get there, then the best option is to fly to <span>Antalya Airport,</span> and from there go by bus or taxi first to Belek (25 km), and then to the Kadriye village , two kilometers from which the hotel you need is located.  However, tourists who come to rest in deluxe hotel complexes usually do not hesitate to pay for the transfer in advance, and they are met upon arrival by travel agency staff and transported to the hotel reception by car. </p><h2>  Kadriye </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the description of Vera Verde Resort 5 *, we think it will not be out of place to talk a little about the village on the outskirts of which it is located.  So, Kadriye is a completely new tourist town in the vicinity of Belek.  Its beaches are considered the best in the whole region, and some of them were repeatedly awarded with the blue flag of the European Union.  The climate in these parts is subtropical, it has a rather long holiday season, although May-June and September-October are still considered the best months to relax.  In mid-summer, the thermometer can rise to a 45-degree mark, which interferes with a comfortable rest.  Although for residents of the northern latitudes this is more of a plus than a minus.  By the way, Kadriye is famous for its oriental bazaar, which opens on Tuesdays.  Here you can buy many interesting products, such as jewelry and wardrobe items, etc.  The main attraction of Kadriye is the ‚Äúgarden of religions‚Äù, where Christian, Muslim and Jewish temples peacefully exist next to each other. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Turkey, Vera Verde Resort 5 (Belek / Kadriye) </h2><p>  This beautiful modern hotel, as already noted, is located just two kilometers from Kadriye.  You can even say that it is located on the outskirts of this village.  Vera Verde Resort 5 * was built in 2008 and was then called differently: Innova Resort and SPA.  In 2012, before entering the Vera Hotels &amp; Resorts hotel brand, it underwent a complete renovation.  The hotel consists of a main 5-storey building on the second line (900 meters from the beach).  All hotel windows face the park.  The absence of sea view from the windows is perhaps the only drawback.  Hotel Vera Verde Resort 5 * is located on a vast territory of 20,000 square meters.  m, on which in addition to the main building there are several swimming pools, restaurants, cafes, shops, golf courses, basketball, volleyball, futsal, tennis courts, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="City Belek (Turkey /" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/486776.jpg" width="600"></div>
