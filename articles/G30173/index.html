The city stands at the confluence of two seas: the Aegean and the Mediterranean in a picturesque bay, surrounded on all sides by hills and mountains covered with dense vegetation.  Until the eighties of the last century in its place was a small fishing village.  But everything changed when French tourists sailed here from neighboring Rhodes.  They were struck by nature and climate, so they found it an ideal place to relax.  Soon, the first hotel was built in Marmaris.  And then the resort began to develop rapidly. </p><h2>  general information <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Emre Hotel 4" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2030388.jpg" width="550"></div></h2><p>  Today Marmaris is called Mecca for lovers of fun, Turkish Ibiza.  Young people from different countries come here.  A few years ago, the main contingent of vacationers were the British and Dutch, who, as you know, know a lot about relaxation.  Their choice of Marmaris is due to several advantages of this resort.  Firstly, an ideal climate - after all, even in July and August there is no exhausting heat.  Secondly, the sea in Marmaris is calm, because the city is located in a closed bay, and there are never waves here.  The resort is considered to be youth: here life is in full swing day and night.  Hotels that are designed for party people are located directly in the city.  Of these, you can easily and quickly get to bars, clubs and discos.  Hotel complexes with a vast territory were built either in the nearest villages or in a park zone.  They are more suitable for families.  One of them is Emre Hotel 4 *.  The description of this hotel, its infrastructure, the concept of food, as well as the reviews of those Russians who have already visited it, are presented in this article.  Here you can see photos of this hotel complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Hotel Emre Hotel 4 * is located two kilometers from the center of Marmaris, in a cozy area called Cityeler.  It is one hundred kilometers distant from <span>Dalaman</span> International <span>Airport</span> .  This, of course, is a fairly large distance for those who come to rest with infants, however, it must be borne in mind that guests are met on comfortable shuttle buses, so the transfer time flies by unnoticed.  The Emre Hotel 4 * complex itself consists of two buildings: Emre and Emre Beach.  The first is located directly on the seashore, and the second is built on the main highway, only forty meters away.  Hotel guests use the common infrastructure - the beach, restaurants and bars, swimming pools, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Emre Hotel 4 Marmaris" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2030384.jpg" width="450"></div>
