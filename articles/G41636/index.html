At the same time, the <span>appearance of</span> these animals has not undergone any changes since the dinosaurs.  Apparently, nature has created a very reasonable and convenient form. </p><p>  Types of turtles are classified according to the environment in which they live.  For example, marine reptiles have fins instead of legs, since almost their entire lives pass in the water.  Freshwater turtles are more likely to be on land.  In this regard, they have legs, but the membranes that are between the fingers allow them to be excellent swimmers.  All types of <span>land turtles</span> have a powerful physique and short, less sharp claws. </p><p>  The most basic distinguishing feature of these reptiles is their carapace.  Its structure, which includes several plates, allows it to grow with the animal. </p><p>  All <span>types of turtles</span> are cold-blooded.  Their body temperature is directly dependent on the environment.  In cold seasons, these reptiles turn into a state of suspended animation, which is characterized by a slowdown of all processes in the body to a minimum.  Land turtles prepare deep burrows for wintering, and waterfowl dig into the silt located at the bottom of their habitat. </p><p>  These reptiles have a peculiar flattened body shape.  Their jaws lack teeth, but often have a horny beak.  Four limbs of turtles can have claws.  The skin of reptiles contains ossification. </p><p>  All types of turtles are very phlegmatic.  Reptiles grow slowly.  For breeding, they lay eggs on land, which are placed in special nests located in the ground. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Turtles are divided into two main groups: </p><p>  1. Brushless.  <span>These reptiles</span> have a skin skeleton consisting of non-assembled individual elements.  They also lack horny shields and claws.  The extremities of the brushless turtles are fin-shaped.  The largest and oldest representative of this group is a <span>leatherback turtle.</span>  This reptile can be found in the seas located in a hot belt. </p><p>  2. Shield.  Representatives of this group have a well-developed dorsal and ventral carapace. </p><p>  Scutellaria turtles, in turn, include three groups: </p><p>  - secretive heads, folding when pulling the neck in a vertical plane like the letter "S" and possessing a basin that has not fused with shields; </p><p>  - labial, which retract the neck with the help of its addition relative to the horizontal surface, as well as having fused shields of the abdominal and dorsal parts; </p><p>  - soft, the nature of the retraction of the neck of which coincides with the secretive heads, however, there is a lack of horny scutes, the limbs of this group of reptiles have membranes for swimming. </p><p>  Types of domestic turtles can include both freshwater and land reptiles.  Most often, lovers of these animals give birth to eared, marsh, Central Asian animals.  Any kind of turtles can be kept at home, except for giant ones. </p><p>  Rubella reptiles are greenish animals that have reddish spots on their heads.  These turtles belong to the species of freshwater.  To create normal conditions, they also need land.  They feed on fish and plant foods.  This species of reptile is most popular among lovers of turtles.  They are active even at relatively low temperatures.  Representatives of this species are growing rapidly.  In five years, the little turtle turns into a large adult turtle, which will require a change in the aquaterrarium. </p><p>  Central Asian reptile representatives at a young age are more helpless.  They grow more slowly than the red-eared, but in adulthood they have the same size.  At low temperatures, the Central Asian reptiles are very slow. </p><p>  What types of turtles do you get for your home aquatorrarium?  It will depend on your tastes and preferences. </p>
