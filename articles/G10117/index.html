Good?  And who is arguing?  On the other hand, there is a stereotyped pattern ... but truly original things come across not so often.  And so I want to be extraordinary, boast (at least to myself) exclusive.  This simple desire to stand out to some extent served as an impetus for people doing needlework, began to attend various master classes and combine business with pleasure.  Let's follow suit.  Let us turn our eyes to ... calendars.  With your own hands you can make a real masterpiece!  Well, let's get started? </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY calendars" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/359401.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Painting </h2><p>  The easiest way <span>to create calendars</span> with your own hands is to draw them with your children.  If it is a wall calendar, you will need a Whatman paper, if a pocket one is just a small piece of white cardboard.  First of all, you need to think about how the numbers will be placed on paper.  There are many options.  In the case of Whatman, months and numbers can be placed around the entire perimeter, as if creating a <span>clock dial.</span>  You can also make a classic calendar, the upper part of which is occupied by a drawing, and the dates follow below.  If the calendar is pocket-sized, then the numbers will be located on one side (back), and the figure on the other, front.  <span>What can I draw?</span>  There are already options - a huge amount.  You just need to decide what you would like to admire the whole year, of course, given the age of the children.  It is worth noting that such a calendar is a great gift for grandparents who can not often see a child. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Applications </h2><p>  To make calendars with your own hands, you can resort to the application technique.  The creation process itself will be similar to the previous one: you need to come up with a plot, and also decide how the numbers will fit.  If you have an idea, you can get down to business.  First, prepare the numbers.  So, you can cut everything out of newspapers or magazines, trying to choose about the same font and letter size to indicate months and numbers - for dates.  After sticking the calendar itself in the remaining place, you need to depict some kind of drawing.  Options - darkness, again, everything will depend on the desire and interests of the master. </p><h2>  Buttons </h2><p>  We suggest you create an interesting wall calendar.  With your own hands, almost everything will be done here.  So, we make a removable button calendar.  What will be needed to create it?  Frame, plywood, fabric (thin for the base and felt for letters), Velcro, buttons (the same size).  First you need to cut the main fabric to the size of the frame itself (given the allowances for the bend).  Now you need to decide how the buttons will be placed.  Most likely, you will need to make seven columns and five rows.  Above and to the right, you need to leave a little space for inscriptions (names of the month and days of the week).  Now, for each button on the reverse side, you need to sew a part of Velcro, the other part is sewn onto the fabric exactly in the place where the buttons with dates will be attached.  Yes, the buttons must be glued pre-printed and cut out numbers.  Thus, you will get a universal calendar on which every month it will be possible to change buttons without problems and arrange them in the right places.  Now it remains to work with the inscriptions (they will also be attached to a pair of Velcro).  The basis for them can be made of felt, and on top you can sew or stitch rather thick paper on which this or that name of the month will already be written or printed.  That's all, the original and up-to-date calendar is ready! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Sewing </h2><p>  You can also try stitching calendars with your own hands.  To do this, you need a fairly dense fabric.  The calendar itself will change the numbers every week.  First you need to stitch among themselves six previously cut squares of the desired size, which will be responsible for the first six days of the week.  Sunday will be placed at the very bottom, stretching across the entire calendar.  The foundation is ready.  Now you need to stick the Velcro in the place where the numbers will be located (the ideal option is at the bottom right of each square).  On the left, a small pocket window will be placed in which you can write what is important should happen on this day.  It will also be possible to leave memo notes there: what needs to be done or whom it is necessary to congratulate.  From above, in the remaining place, you can sew something interesting: the sun, a cloud, a flower - everything that only the soul desires.  Where we left a place for Sunday, you will need to put the name of the month (again, with Velcro).  Below, if desired, you can make several pockets to store pieces of paper and a pen for notes.  That's all, the original calendar, which is perfect, for example, for a children's room, is ready! </p><h2>  Quilling </h2><p>  And now we will tell you how to make a do-it-yourself desk calendar using the quilling technique.  So, for the base you will need a <span>designer cardboard</span> (so the finished product will look very colorful and original), which folds into a triangle so that it perfectly adheres to the base.  Next, you need to print and paste the calendar itself in about the center of the stand.  The remaining space on the left is for decoration, on the right you can glue a small block with tear-off leaves to make notes.  Now fill the remaining (left) part.  If a person only gets acquainted with the <span>technique of quilling</span> (skillful paper- <span>rolling</span> ), you need to choose a simpler decor, for example, unpretentious and at the same time very beautiful curls.  Also, everything can be decorated with leaves and flower petals, which are quite easy to make using such a technique.  Now everything is glued to the base.  Such calendars, created with their own hands, will be an excellent decoration and complement to the interior. </p>

    <h2>  A photo </h2><p>  You do not know what else to come up with so unusual?  Try to make your own calendars with photos.  This will, again, be a great <span>gift for grandparents</span> or other relatives who live away from you.  So, you can make a tear-off calendar, where for each month the corresponding photo will be glued.  Alternatively, you can go to the printing house and make a large wall calendar using the layout, the background of which will be your photo or the photo of your friends, if you want to make it pleasant.  This is a great idea that many people will like. </p>
