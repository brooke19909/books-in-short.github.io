How to pay a loan by contract number: instructions and methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tinkoff Bank currently provides several types of loan services at once: credit cards with a limit, cash loans for debit plastic and mortgages through financial institutions of partners.  The product line of this structure is rather narrow.  But recently, this company has gained a large client base (more than six million people), in this regard, the question of how to pay a loan to Tinkoff Bank is quite popular.  Let's consider it further. </p><h2>  Feature of the financial organization </h2><p>  To begin with, it should be understood that the lack of logistics and banking infrastructure (in fact, this is what Oleg Tinkov is proud of) forces the organization to use someone else's.  No one will provide it for free.  Accordingly, such costs are included in interest rates or in separately charged financial resources for customer services.  Next, we consider the instructions and options for making a loan payment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.roboxchange.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff Bank to pay a loan" class="if uuid-3192357" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192357.jpg"></div><h2>  Credit loan payment methods </h2><p>  They are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Free repayment option. </li><li>  With writing off the commission. </li><li>  In offline mode. </li><li>  Or online, when everything is done remotely via the Internet. </li></ul><p>  That is, the client can choose any method convenient for him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How can I find out the number of the loan agreement and what is it for? </h2><p>  The loan agreement number can be compared with the unique code used to identify the borrower.  Many customers, receiving loans and plastic cards for payment, think that their numbers must necessarily coincide.  But this is an erroneous opinion: the plastic number is not connected in any way with the numbering of loan agreements.  In addition, the document abbreviation and bank account details do not match.  From the card or directly from a personal account, you can pay any expense by transferring money at certain details.  One of these is the number of the loan agreement. </p><p>  Tinkoff Bank customers will not be able to pay a loan under a labor agreement: you can use the Internet or visit an affiliate network branch.  You can find out the document number in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  Open a paper version of the loan agreement: the number is indicated immediately on the first page. </li><li>  Go to the personal account of the online bank, in the section called ‚ÄúLoans‚Äù and run the loan information. </li><li>  Call the customer support service by phone (the operator will ask you to announce the passport data with a code). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.creditkarma.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff Bank pay loan by number" class="if uuid-3192359" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192359.jpg"></div><h2>  Instructions for paying a loan offline without commission </h2><p>  It is worth repeating that the organization does not have offices, and any cash transactions are carried out through partners.  Thus, in the case of talking about how to pay a Tinkoff Bank loan without charging an offline commission over the phone, I must say that you can deposit funds through the following companies: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Banks that are partners. </li><li>  Communication salons (for example, MTS along with Beeline, Megafon, Svyaznoy, Euroset). </li><li>  Payment terminal "Eleksnet". </li><li>  Financial transfer systems like Golden Crown, Contact, Unistream and so on. </li><li>  Post of Russia. </li></ul><p>  The affiliate network of this bank is quite extensive, therefore the most familiar and popular companies are indicated above.  The simplest option is replenishment through the self-service terminal of Svyaznoy, Euroset and Eleksnet.  It is also very convenient to pay a Tinkoff Bank loan by card number, since you don‚Äôt have to queue for an operator at the bank to do this.  And if the client will make replenishment through the employees of the above institutions, then they will also request a passport.  And you need to have it on hand, and not just call numbers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankrate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pay a Tinkoff Bank loan by contract number" class="if uuid-3192360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192360.jpg"></div><h2>  Payment in the communication salon </h2><p>  The action scheme will be as follows: </p><ul><li>  We must go to the terminal. </li><li>  Find a section called ‚Äúloan payment‚Äù. </li><li>  Select "Tinkoff" in the list. </li><li>  Enter the card number. </li><li>  Deposit money in one banknote (which is very important), press ‚Äúok‚Äù and wait for the check to be printed. </li><li>  Or you can approach the employee and say that you need to deposit funds to pay off the loan at this bank.  Provide with a passport. </li></ul><h2>  Repayment of a loan through an affiliate bank </h2><p>  Actions will be as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  You should contact an employee (through an ATM, reception will often be prohibited). </li><li>  Tell him about your desire. </li><li>  If there is an additional program from Tinkoff, then it will be enough just to give the card number and give a passport. </li><li>  If they do not have it, then you will have to generate a full payment order. </li></ul><p>  But you won‚Äôt have to pay for it.  In this case, the procedure will take some time (in most situations, from ten minutes or more), a person will need the details of a bank, credit account, all this, as a rule, is indicated in the service agreement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="3dnews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to pay a loan through the Tinkoff Bank application" class="if uuid-3192362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192362.jpg"></div><p>  Speaking of affiliate banks, it must be said that it is more convenient and faster to replenish a card using an ATM, however, such an opportunity may not be provided.  Indeed, each financial institution has its own firmware in the device, which limits a lot of things and does not allow it.  Reprogramming such for counterparties is not everyone will be.  It is also worth knowing that when choosing such methods for depositing cash with partners, a limit on the amount is possible.  But there is a significant plus in the form of instant crediting a money transfer. </p><p>  We will talk about how to pay a Tinkoff Bank loan according to the contract number below. </p><h2>  Offline with commission by contract number </h2><p>  In those cases when you need to pay a large sum at a time or by some miracle will not be in the vicinity of the offices of Tinkoff partners, you can make a bank transfer on the basis of details in cash through the cashier at any bank.  Thus, the client has the opportunity to pay the loan to Tinkoff Bank by the number of the agreement or card.  To perform this operation, a passport is required along with the details of the recipient, the number of the agreement or card, which must be indicated in the payment purpose. </p><p>  The bank transfer is not limited in amount, and crediting is carried out within one to two business days.  The necessary information is presented in full on the official website of Tinkoff Bank.  You should pay attention to the fact that for each currency there are separate details.  You can also take them in Internet banking in the section called ‚ÄúAbout the account‚Äù.  It is worth noting that the Tinkoff side does not charge a commission when crediting funds, but you need to get acquainted with the fees of the sender bank in advance, otherwise they can simply shock. </p><div class="photo" data-original="upgradedpoints.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pay credit tinkoff bank from the card" class="if uuid-3192361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192361.jpg"></div><h2>  Online with a commission from a card </h2><p>  Having the plastic of any bank, you can pay a Tinkoff Bank credit from a card or make other transfers to another payment instrument.  In the event that the issuing bank does not have and cannot provide such a service to its customers (Internet banking), the operation can be performed directly on the Tinkoff website. </p><p>  Before you pay a Tinkoff Bank loan by card number, you should be reminded about the commission costs of the operation.  The fee for the transfer service charged by the financial institution in question will be calculated automatically after filling in the payment amount.  In addition, additional deduction is possible from the bank whose card is debited, this value is specified in the issuer's tariffs.  There is a restriction on transfers in the amount of seventy-five thousand rubles, crediting is carried out from a few minutes to five days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.westpac.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff Bank to pay a loan by card number" class="if uuid-3192358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192358.jpg"></div><h2>  Through the application </h2><p>  How to pay a loan through the Tinkoff Bank application?  It should be noted that this will not work.  However, it is worth recalling for those who are not aware that in online mode you can pay loans of any third-party banks from your account at Sberbank, and there are two tools for this that have identical functionality.  We are talking about a personal account on the official website for a desktop computer and a mobile application for tablets and smartphones.  The portal is called "Sberbank Online", the scheme of actions in both cases will be unified.  Here are step-by-step instructions for using the application: </p><ul><li>  Enter the system and find two items in the menu, first ‚ÄúPayments and transfers‚Äù, and then ‚ÄúTo another bank‚Äù. </li><li>  Or in the search line enter the word ‚ÄúBIC‚Äù, after that the necessary section will immediately appear in the form of a hint. </li><li>  If the client has several Sberbank cards, then you need to choose the one on which there is money. </li><li>  To conduct BIC of Tinkoff Bank and an account number of sixteen digits. </li><li>  Next, you need a contract number (all this is indicated on the back of the loan agreement). </li><li>  Then you need to enter your name, indicate the phone number and payment amount. </li><li>  After that, a verification code is received on the telephone and entered one more time. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that the commission will be at least one percent of the payment amount, which is very convenient.  Indeed, Tinkoff has no branches, and all other banking organizations can be located quite far from home.  You can spend more money on travel.  We have already considered all possible ways of how to pay a loan to Tinkoff Bank.  Next, let's talk about the possibility of obtaining mortgage lending in a financial institution. </p><h2>  Mortgage </h2><p>  Tinkoff does not personally issue a mortgage, but it helps to draw up documents from partner banks, such as Absolut, along with URALSIB, Metallinvestbank, SMP, UniCredit, Gazprombank and others.  The listed organizations have retail offices, in this regard, after receiving a mortgage loan, it will be possible to deposit cash in payment of the loan through the cashier at absolutely any branch of the financial institution that issued the loan.  This is always done without commission.  You can read about other methods separately on the portal of each company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thelendersnetwork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff Bank to pay the loan under the contract" class="if uuid-3192355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192355.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, the institution represented over the years of its presence in the financial market and because of its position (does not have its own infrastructure) managed to acquire a fairly extensive network of partners, both institutions and banks.  It is possible to deposit cash in order to pay a loan at Tinkoff Bank not only within the home region, but throughout the entire territory of Russia in three hundred thousand partner points.  And also at any time on the bank‚Äôs website, making an online transfer from a card to another payment instrument. </p>
