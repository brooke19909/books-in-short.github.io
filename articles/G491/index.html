    <h2>  Great-grandfathers </h2><p>  The modern Mikhalkovs are descendants of the Golitsyn princes.  Princess Elizaveta Nikolaevna Golitsyna married Vladimir Mikhalkov, and the family inherits 720 acres of land from the Golitsyns with the village of Nazaryevo.  The estate was a dowry from the princes Golitsyn. </p><p>  Vladimir Sergeyevich Mikhalkov, the great-grandfather of the poet, came from a rather noble family of Mikhalkovs.  Their family estate was partially preserved in Rybinsk.  The new family began the construction of their own estate.  It was a two-story building, decorated in the Gothic style. </p>

    <h2>  Grandfathers and parents </h2><p>  Alexander Mikhalkov, landowner of the Moscow, Kostroma and Yaroslavl provinces, captain and honorary magistrate, was the grandfather of the poet.  Grandmother Anna Miller, his wife, was also of noble origin. </p><p>  Alexander Mikhalkov and his wife Anna also lived in Nazarievo, where their son Vladimir, the father of a famous writer, was born. </p><p>  The family of Vladimir and Olga had three sons - Sergey, Mikhail and Alexander (Mikhalkov).  The writer‚Äôs childhood passed in the nest of his ancestors near Moscow.  But these were difficult revolutionary times. </p><p>  After the revolution, the estate was nationalized, and the family moved from Moscow to Pyatigorsk.  Parenting in the family was Spartan.  The governess of German descent was engaged in the education of boys. </p><h2>  Creativity and life </h2><p>  Despite the noble blood, Mikhalkov accepted the political system and perceived the collapse of the USSR as a great tragedy.  Until the end of his life, he asked me to call him ‚ÄúSoviet man‚Äù and was glad that his peers did not live to see the collapse of Soviet power. </p><p>  In the century of Sergei Mikhalkov, twelve rulers and four regimes were replaced.  The Stalinist government loved Mikhalkov, but, as an apolitical man, he simply appreciated the opportunity to work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Mikhalkov is known as a children's poet, but he wrote not only for children.  He wrote the script for the famous film ‚Äú3 + 2‚Äù with his hand.  A lot of children's fairy tales were filmed from his works.  Until the end of his days, he remained editor-in-chief of the satirical magazine The Wick.  Sergei Vladimirovich worked until the end of his life, for creativity was for the poet the meaning of life. </p><p>  Sergei Mikhalkov is not just the author of hymns and children's poems, on which more than one generation of Soviet children grew up, he is the father of famous actors and directors Nikita and Andrey.  Their films have received more than one award. </p><h2>  Brotherly relationship </h2><p>  Very little is known about the fate of Sergey Mikhalkov‚Äôs brothers, many data are still classified.  After the release of the memoir ‚ÄúTwo Brothers - Two Fates‚Äù, many learned that the poet had two more brothers.  The book has very scarce data about Alexander and <span>Mikhail Mikhalkov.</span> </p>

    <p>  Alexander Mikhalkov is known as an engineer who was engaged in local history.  He was clearly interested in ancestors and noble origin.  In 1996, he managed to publish the work "Essays on the History of Moscow Merchants, whose Enterprises Served Moscow after the Revolution."  It was this work that made him famous. </p><p>  From the memoirs of the employees of Moskovskaya Pravda it is known that Alexander Vladimirovich Mikhalkov appeared in the newspaper without a call and did not like to talk about his famous brother.  The circulation of his work is only 1,500 copies; now it is on the lists of recommended literature for studying the history of Russian entrepreneurship. </p><p>  The younger brother Mikhail also excelled in the literary field and wrote an autobiographical novel, ‚ÄúIn the Maze of Deadly Risk,‚Äù where he told his own story of the struggle. </p><h2>  Rybinsk </h2><p>  Data on the Mikhalkov family and its noble origin were stored in the family archives of the estate in Rybinsk.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, archives were handed over to relatives and the truth about the life of the Mikhalkovs ancestors became available to relatives. </p>

    <p>  About the estate in Rybinsk it is known that before the advent of Soviet power many works of art were stored there - paintings and ancient household items passed into the hands of the state and were forever lost to a famous family. </p><p>  Now the park in Rybinsk has the status of a monument of landscape gardening art.  Shady alleys and centuries-old trees preserve the memory of the glorious noble family of Mikhalkov. </p>
