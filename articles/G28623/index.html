By bus, as well as by metro, you can reach anywhere in Moscow. </p><p>  So, with transport everything is clear, in this regard, Upper Fields is a pretty good area.

    <p>  Another attraction is the alley of young families.  This alley is a <span>residential complex</span> in which the state provides apartments exclusively for those who have recently married.  The alley of young families is equipped with many playgrounds, a park and three supermarkets are located nearby.  Nearby is a kindergarten specifically for residents of the alley and there are two hardware stores.  The construction of the alley was carried out under the guidance of the Mayor of Moscow and with the help of the state under the program of support for young families. </p><p>  Summing up, we can confidently say that the Lublin region, and in particular the Upper Fields, is wonderful for the life of all segments of the population.  It has everything you need, and even more.  The area is perfect for student teachers, for young families and for older people too.  If you still pay attention to the Upper Fields, you are unlikely to regret it.  The area is promising and continues to develop further. </p>
