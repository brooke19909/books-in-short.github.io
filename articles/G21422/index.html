Modern cooking enthusiasts often use special bread machines for this, presented in the wide range of household appliances on the market.  Among the leading manufacturers of this type of device are Panasonic.  One of the most popular bread machine models produced by a Japanese company is the Panasonic SD-ZB2502.  Its Russified name is also widespread - the Panasonic SD 2502 bread machine.  What is the specifics of this device?  What do its owners who have gained experience in using the device write? </p><h2>  What is a bread machine </h2><p>  First, let's study the specifics of devices of this type.  A bread machine in this context is a miniature device with a size comparable to a pan, which is intended for the manufacture of bakery products using electric heating.  Often this type of device is equipped with useful auxiliary functions - for example, a dough kneading, a timer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bread maker Panasonic 2511" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/389469.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Almost all modern bread makers have built-in programs that are adapted to produce a specific type of product - bread, French baguettes, donuts, etc. As for the most modern devices, which also include the Panasonic 2502, they can also include programs, not directly related to baking flour products.  For example, those that involve making jam. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Using a bread machine, the manufacture of the corresponding products lasts about 2-6 hours.  It all depends on the specific recipe, as well as on the quality of the ingredients.  Many of the bread machine models can bake products in an accelerated mode.  As a rule, in the process of making bread, various ingredients can be added to the device to give the product a special flavor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bread processor Panasonic 2502 reviews" class="if" height="192" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/760292.jpg" width="600"></div>

Also, the products of the Japanese brand are characterized by exceptional reliability.  It can also be noted that Panasonic offers its customers modifications of bread machines in a wide range.  So, lovers of home baking can always buy an inexpensive, but at the same time sufficiently functional device. </p><p>  Now let's move on to the study of the features of the Panasonic 2502. For a start, consider the characteristics of the device.  Then we examine the features of its functions, as well as user reviews. </p><h2>  Device specifications </h2><p>  The Panasonic 2502 bread machine, reviews of which are widespread on the pages of online stores specializing in the sale of household appliances, and thematic online portals, has the following main characteristics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bread maker Panasonic 2501" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/760293.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The device power is 550 watts.  The bread machine is intended for baking loaves weighing up to 1250 grams.  It provides 12 cooking programs for various types of pastries, including, for example, muffins.  It can be noted that the device has a stylish, effective design.  The case is made of <span>stainless steel,</span> which has a high degree of resistance to mechanical damage.  The baking dish has a diamond fluoride coating, which also helps to improve the quality of the device. </p><p>  The device is controlled through a special panel with a large display.  Among its components are two dispensers: for yeast and for adding the necessary ingredients to the dough (it can be, for example, nuts).  One of the most remarkable characteristics of the breadmaker is its microprocessor, which controls the temperature during the preparation of bread.  Among other useful functions of the device is protection against voltage failures. </p><h2>  What can I bake? </h2><p>  What types of products can the Panasonic 2502 bread machine produce?  Reviews on the functionality of the device are the most positive.  The fact is that with the help of this device you can bake bread, muffins, baguettes, sweets, as well as yeast-free and gluten-free products.  Among the most useful functions of the device is a dough kneading, as well as a choice of crust color.  There is also an interesting program, using which you can cook fruits in syrup. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Attractive design is among the indisputable advantages of the Panasonic 2502 bread machine.  Reviews from many users confirm this.  The device, as we noted above, is made of stainless steel.  The cover of the bread maker is polished.  The device is available in two primary colors - steel and black.  The device is equipped with a rectangular display, near which are the control keys.  The device is placed on special legs that give the device a stable position on the table. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bread maker Panasonic 2512" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/760295.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Compactness is another notable attribute that the Panasonic 2502 has.  Reviews from the device owners confirm this.  So, the height of the device is only 383 mm, the width is 256 mm, and the depth is 389 mm.  At the same time, the bread machine does not weigh very much - 7.6 kg. </p><h2>  Opportunities for a bread machine </h2><p>  Consider the specifics of some features of the device.  As we noted above, the bread maker has two convenient dispensers.  The first is used to add various additional ingredients to the bread during baking.  Its capacity is about 150 grams.  Another dispenser is for adding dry yeast to bread.  Its capacity is about 12 grams.  The duration of the process of making bread using the device depends on the recipe and can vary greatly - from 2 to 6 hours.  You can use the accelerated cooking mode or normal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bread Machine Panasonic SD" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/760290.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A bread machine, as we noted above, can make pastries through 12 different programs.  Each of them involves following a specific recipe.  Apart from the main programs, the device is adapted for baking single-grain bread, as well as products that do not contain gluten or yeast. </p><p>  Also, the bread maker includes 10 programs, with the help of which the dough is kneaded.  Therewith, there are corresponding algorithms adapted for the preparation of bakery products, as well as those with which to prepare a fresh <span>dough for dumplings</span> and dumplings or yeast for pizza.  The uniqueness of the bread maker is that, among other things, it is able to prepare delicious jams, as well as, as we noted above, fruits with syrup, in accordance with a special recipe. </p><h2>  Noteworthy features </h2><p>  We‚Äôll explore some of the notable features of a Panasonic device. </p><p>  First of all, it should be noted that there is a special timer in the bread maker.  Using it, you can postpone the baking process for 13 hours.  You can, for example, program cooking for the night and at the same time set the automatic addition of the necessary ingredients to the bread using a dispenser.  Another noteworthy function of the bread maker is to keep the finished bakery product warm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bread processor Panasonic 2500" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/760291.jpg" width="359"></div>

    <p>  The owner of the device from Panasonic can set the desired size of a loaf of bread.  There are three possible options when working with this function: the choice of a large roll - from 1 to 1.25 kg, medium - about 800 grams, and also small - about 600 grams.  As we noted above, the bread machine also allows you to set the desired color of the crust: it can be light, dark or corresponding to an average degree of bread baking. </p><h2>  Analogs </h2><p>  Consider what are the analogues of this device. </p><p>  Among them - the Panasonic 2511 bread machine.  In general, its characteristics are very similar to model 2502. But the Panasonic 2511 bread maker has more programs - 14. It can also be noted that this device has an accelerated baking function. </p><p>  The functions of the model 2511 are close enough to the Panasonic 2512 bread maker.  Its most important difference in terms of capabilities: the maximum baking weight can be 1250 grams.  It can also be noted that the Panasonic 2512 bread maker is not made of plastic, like the 2511 model, but of metal - like the 2502nd. </p><p>  What other options are closest in characteristics to the 2502nd?  Probably, the Panasonic 2501 bread machine belongs to those.  In general, the device has similar capabilities, but it has a plastic case.  Like the device 2511, the Panasonic 2501 bread maker has the function of accelerated baking. </p><p>  Which of the 2502's counterparts are noticeably cheaper than this device?  Among them - the Panasonic 2500 bread machine.  It has, in principle, similar capabilities and costs about 7,500 rubles.  While the model 2502 - about 10 900 rubles.  The Panasonic 2500 bread machine has a plastic case and 11 baking programs. </p><p>  All of these models are now actively sold in Russia.  But there are modifications of bread machines that are rarely sold, but nevertheless deserve attention.  Among them - the Panasonic 255 bread machine.  It has 9 programs, and the same functions as the model 2502, however, there is no support for baking French baguettes.  The Panasonic 257 bread maker is very similar to model 255. </p><h2>  Price of bread machines </h2><p>  Let's try to rank those devices from Panasonic, which are now actively sold in Russia, at a price.  The most expensive model is 2512. It costs about 14,500 rubles.  This is followed by model 2511. It can be bought for about 11,900 rubles.  The modification under consideration will cost a little cheaper - 2502, it costs about 10,900 rubles.  The Panasonic SD 2501 bread machine is slightly cheaper: its purchase will cost about 9,700 rubles.  A version such as 2510 is also produced and sold in the Russian Federation. Its price is approximately 8800 rubles.  The most affordable model is 2500. As we noted above, it costs about 7500 rubles. </p><p>  We see that there is a wide variety of models on the market, within which the Panasonic bread maker is produced.  The price of devices can also vary significantly.  But this makes the products of the Japanese brand accessible to everyone, regardless of the budget. </p><p>  The opinions of the owners are another important aspect in which we will be interested in the Panasonic 2502 bread machine.  User reviews of the device are the most diverse.  They relate to the quality of bread, the convenience of using the device and its functions, as well as the reliability of the device.  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><h2>  Reviews: bread quality </h2><p>  Users of the bread machine note that the bakery products baked with it are of excellent quality.  Unless, of course, follow the appropriate recipes.  It is important that all the ingredients are not expired, and ideally - the freshest (especially with regard to the components of the dough). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bread maker Panasonic instruction" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/760289.jpg" width="534"></div>

    <p>  The capabilities of the stove, as noted by the owners of the device, make it possible to set up the most daring experiments on endowing baking with original taste shades.  The pastries are of high quality, judging by the reviews, regardless of the specific variety - whether it is molded bread or French baguettes.  Japanese bread maker copes with its tasks perfectly - its owners are sure. </p><h2>  Reviews: usability and features </h2><p>  Positive opinions are also expressed regarding the usability of the device.  So, the package that includes the Panasonic bread maker is included in the instruction, and it, as the owners of the device note, is sufficiently detailed.  Using the device is carried out without significant difficulties. </p><p>  As for the variety of functions, the bread machine is also characterized by positive reviews.  People are impressed by a large number of programs, the convenience of dispensers, the presence of a timer, as well as various additional features of the device - such as, for example, kneading dough or making jam. </p><p>  Some users note that the bread maker, despite its relatively high power, consumes relatively little energy per one loaf of bread.  Apparently, the device implements certain energy-saving algorithms. </p><p>  Ease of use is another important characteristic of the device, as many owners of a bread machine think.  Literally in the process of the very first preparation of bread, you can master the basic functions of the device.  In this context, instructions are often praised - for the clarity and detailed description of the process of using the bread machine. </p><p>  Among the disadvantages of the device, noted by the owners, is the lack of a power button.  That is, it is necessary to supply power to the device by connecting its wire to the outlet.  However, in practice, as many users note, this is not so inconvenient. </p><h2>  Reviews: Reliability </h2><p>  The owners of the bread maker express a positive attitude regarding its reliability.  In principle, the fact that the Japanese brand produces reliable products is not in itself a sensation.  But the bread machine is among the most technologically sophisticated products.  It works at high temperatures and is associated with cooking, which implies high demands on its environmental friendliness and level of hygiene. </p><p>  According to users, the bread maker meets all these criteria.  The device works without significant malfunctions, provided, of course, adequate operation: in accordance with the provisions of the instructions, as well as following the recipes for making bread. </p><p>  It can be noted that reviews of this type - with regard to the functions, convenience and reliability of the device - are also true with respect to analogs of the device, in particular, modification 2502. This suggests that the Panasonic brand holds the brand of the supplier of reliable devices also in the bakery segment. </p>
