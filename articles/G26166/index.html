  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to update maps on the navigator at home</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Navigator for a car - this innovation has become in the modern world an integral and convenient part of driving a car, as well as an important touch of the car interior.  But often it happens that it does not contain enough information during the acquisition necessary for faster and safer movement.  What to do in such a situation if the service of downloading new cards is not cheap at professional service centers?  I will tell you how to update maps on the navigator at home, without resorting to the expensive help of professionals. </p><p>  <strong>What should be considered before updating maps in the navigator?</strong> </p><p>  First of all, you need to make sure whether this update is suitable for your navigator.  In order not to waste extra time, even before updating the maps on the navigator, you should clearly know the name of your program and whether there are updates for this particular program.  Then you can connect the navigator to the computer and download the desired file in the designated folder for it.  If all this is observed, then with the right boot everything will surely work out.  And you at the next trip by car will simply enjoy the world around you, having a real idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe right direction of movement. </p><p>  <strong>How often do you need updates?</strong> </p><p>  Many drivers want to always be aware of any changes that occur where they move, which is why it is recommended that maps on navigators be updated regularly.  But what is this regularity?  How long can I use the newly loaded cards with confidence?  These questions are not easy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In fact, there is a certain interval between the required updates - a quarter, but not all manufacturers adhere to it, but only value their reputation and the circle of users of their products.  The fact is that each company that produces navigators is individual in these actions.  The interval for updating cards from manufacturers varies from a month to six months.  On the one hand, when you frequently update, it may be nice to always be in the know, but on the other, it‚Äôs not always convenient to change them so often, constantly think about it, and not everyone likes to spend money every month. </p><p>  <strong>How to update navigator maps</strong> </p><p>  Basically, the navigators already contain a program for downloading updates, but even if it is not there, just having the Internet is enough, in the search engine enter the model you need, the program - and that‚Äôs all.  You can, of course, resort to the help of professionals, but updating the maps on the navigator is not so difficult for yourself.  Therefore, why spend money on what you can do at home for free, especially since it doesn‚Äôt take so much time? </p><p>  <strong>Nuances you may encounter</strong> </p><p>  How to update maps on the navigator?  To do this, you need to take into account some points. </p><p>  First, you need to know the navigator model, the name of the program. </p><p>  Now a new version of the multifunctional program has appeared, upon downloading which it automatically gives out when it is time to update the maps, when these same updates arrive and all this regardless of the model of your navigator.  She independently selects the necessary update specifically for this model and its capabilities.  That's just the assurance that this program does not carry any viruses with it that can destroy not only your navigator and its contents, but also your computer, with which updates will be downloaded, no. </p><p>  Secondly, you must be sure that the program that you will be updating (the very cards) is a really new version. </p><p>  Thirdly, if you decide to find out exactly how to update the maps on your navigator yourself, you should only use trusted sources for updates, since the Internet is full of various fake versions, whose manufacturers profit from inexperienced users. </p>
