Are there any features of this procedure or is everything done very quickly and without much effort on the part of the subscriber?  Let's try to understand. </p><h2>  How is everything going? </h2><p>  Let's start by clarifying a few points regarding how to switch to another operator while maintaining the number.  First, we introduce such concepts as the donor operator (this is the one that the subscriber does not like) and the recipient operator (the new subscriber operator).  In order to change the operator, you first need to write a statement in the company where you want to go, which will create the basis for concluding a new agreement for servicing your SIM card.  Further, the recipient operator through the database of transferred numbers informs his predecessor of the application for changing the mobile network, and if there are no circumstances that could prevent the transfer to another operator while maintaining the number, the donor stops servicing the SIM card, and the number of the new card , which the subscriber received from the recipient, changes to the declared one. </p>

    <p>  The procedure itself, as promised, will take no more than thirty days (taking into account all approvals), the maximum time for which the subscriber can remain without communication after the previous operator has refused it and took on a new one is three hours.  If, for some reason, it is decided to refuse the service "Transfer to another operator with the preservation of the number", then before the recipient operator approves the application, you can write a request to refuse the transition.  The number of operations to change the operator is not limited, as is the frequency of these operations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reasons for Delays </h2><p>  Yes, there are certain circumstances in connection with which the transition may be delayed.  Firstly, the donor operator cannot have any debts on its personal account - until the subscriber repays it, the old operator will not let it go.  Moreover, if you have several numbers from one operator, and you want to refuse one, then you will have to pay all the remaining debts.  A positive balance in the donor account to the recipient will not be transferred.  There will be no problems with payment via terminals - the database of transferred numbers, which was already mentioned above, will record the number belonging to another operator. </p><h2>  Transfer Features </h2><p>  This service is available for both individuals and legal entities - operators do not make any difference between subscribers.  Moreover, there is no difference which number you want to transfer - an elite bronze / gold / silver (with a certain number of repeating digits) or a very standard one - you will have to pay only one hundred rubles for this.  The law on the transfer of numbers applies to absolutely all operators, regardless of whether they are regional or all-Russian, but you can only change the number within the boundaries of one region or region. </p><p>  When the subscriber has filed an application for the transfer of the number, he will remain with the donor operator for some time and only after all the checks will he transfer to the recipient.  At each stage of the process, that is, consideration of the application, approval of it, refusal of one operator and acceptance of another, the subscriber will receive notifications.  There are no special features in servicing the ‚Äúnewbie‚Äù - he will obey the rules of the recipient operator, however, initially there will be some restrictions - the new subscriber will be able to use only calls, SMS messages and Internet access, but soon he will open all the available functionality.  If, for some reason, the subscriber decided to terminate the contract with the recipient, then his number will be returned to the previous operator. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should be noted that if a subscriber uses a phone purchased on the network of a certain operator, that is, programmed to work with a specific card, it is likely that he will refuse to work when transferring the number and, in principle, will not accept a new SIM card. </p><h2>  "Megaphone" </h2><p>  Switching to another operator with saving the Megafon number allows without problems.  If you want to join this mobile network, the first thing you need to do is leave a request for this operation - there is no difference here, online or in the operator‚Äôs office. </p>

    <p>  With an online application, after it is considered, Megafon employees will contact you and deliver the necessary documents and a new SIM card to conclude a new agreement.  At the same stage, a tariff plan is selected within this network and a payment of one hundred rubles for the operation is charged.  When filling out an application at the office, the service fee is charged immediately, as is the issuance of a new card with an already selected tariff plan.  Then, within a period of a week to six months, the number will be transferred to the Megafon network itself, which you will be additionally notified with a message. </p><h2>  MTS </h2><p>  It does not prohibit switching to another operator while maintaining the MTS number.  Here, however, has its own characteristics.  The application is filled out only in the operator‚Äôs office, you must have a passport with you if the number is registered for you, or a power of attorney from the owner of the number ‚Äî you must confirm that you have the right to carry out such actions. </p>

    <p>  Then you pay for this transition and choose a new tariff already in the MTS network, at the same stage you get a temporary number, which then, after all approvals, will be replaced with a portable one.  Then, for several days, mobile operators get to resolve all the formalities among themselves on technical issues, and the day before the proposed transfer, MTS sends you a message indicating the exact time when your card was serviced by the old operator - at this time you need to insert the recipient's SIM card. </p><h2>  Beeline </h2><p>  Switching to another operator while maintaining the Beeline number is as easy as Megafon.  Moreover, the process of carrying out this operation is similar for them - the same application is either online or in the office, the same terms and the general procedure for providing the service.  Beeline courier can also bring a new card and an agreement on its service to your convenient address. </p>

    <p>  But a separate advantage of this operation for new Beeline subscribers who nevertheless decided to carry out all the necessary manipulations in the company‚Äôs office is the ability to book online for a specific time, rather than sitting indoors, waiting for their turn. </p><h2>  "Tele 2" </h2><p>  Switching to another operator while maintaining the ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù number is also welcome.  Anyway, any company will be glad to new subscribers. </p>

    <p>  The rules are the same as for other mobile operators, the only caveat is that the number can be transferred only in the official salons of the company - no online transactions or dealers. </p><h2>  Rostelecom </h2><p>  And the last mobile company that will be pleased to switch to another operator with the preservation of the number - Rostelecom. </p>
