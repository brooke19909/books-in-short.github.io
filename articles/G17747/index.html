  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dictatorship of the proletariat</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The proletariat is the working class.  According to Marx, the revolutionary rule of the workers is the only <span>form of government</span> in the transition of society from the capitalist to the communist system. </p><p>  The general regularity of the revolution and the building of socialism is the dictatorship of the proletariat.  This power is necessary to carry out transformations in society and suppress the resistance exerted by the exploiting class. </p><p>  Lenin pointed out that within the framework of a fierce confrontation between the bourgeoisie and the working masses, either the domination of the first or the dictatorship of the proletariat will remain, and the third path does not exist. </p><p>  The essence of the rule of the working masses, like that of another power, is determined in accordance with its main tasks and class nature.  The dictatorship of the proletariat is the power of one class, which, by implementing the appropriate policy, ensures the construction of socialism.  At the same time, in their leadership of the state, the working masses rely on numerous layers of working people (petty bourgeoisie, intelligentsia, peasantry, etc.).  The highest principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat, Lenin considered the union of peasants and workers. </p><p>  In addition to suppressing the resistance that the overthrown exploiting classes have, the power of the workers protects the state from attacks by imperialist powers and strengthens international ties with the international working masses.  The dictatorship of the proletariat promotes the development of international cooperation. </p><p>  The main tasks of the workers' power include carrying out socialist changes in the cultural, social, economic, political sphere, and ensuring the improvement of the material well-being of workers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All these positions quite clearly reflected the slogans of the Bolsheviks.  Along with this, they carried out the leadership of the peasantry and other strata for their final separation from the class of the bourgeoisie and involvement in the building of socialism. </p><p>  According to Lenin, the dictatorship of the proletariat was not only violence against the class of exploiters.  The main essence of power, its leading side is the <span>creation of a socialist</span> society, the fulfillment of creative tasks. </p><p>  Lenin considered the dictatorship of the proletariat a new type of democracy.  In his opinion, this democracy allowed workers to enjoy their freedoms and rights.  Moreover, in a proletarian state, democracy is limited for the exploiters - their counter-revolutionary actions are suppressed, and attempts to conduct propaganda against socialism are suppressed. </p><p>  The dictatorship of the working masses has differences not only in its content, but also in the forms of its implementation.  They (based on certain historical conditions) can be quite diverse.  In the practice of the revolutionary movement, there were such types of dictatorship of the proletariat as the <span>Paris Commune,</span> Soviets and more.  It should be noted that regardless of its <span>form, the power of the</span> working masses expressed a single essence. </p><p>  The implementation of the democracy of the proletariat requires a special organization capable of ensuring the decisive, active participation of all workers in public administration.  Thus, the masses are moving closer to the administrative apparatus.  The authorities in this case are formed in accordance with the principle of turnover and electivity.  Along with this, the appointment of representatives by central bodies is also allowed (as a temporary measure for the period of the formation of the social system). </p><p>  The leading role was played by the Communist Party, which combined the activities of public and state organizations, directing it toward a common goal. </p><p>  After the <span>development of</span> a <span>developed socialist</span> system, the state with the dictatorship of the proletariat turns into a nationwide one. </p>
