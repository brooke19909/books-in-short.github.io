After all, hand-made jewelry looks original, beautiful and stylish.  The choice in favor of home-made accessories is also based on the fact that making such a decoration is very easy from improvised materials at home.  From this article you will learn how to quickly make any jewelry, and believe me, it will look no worse than the purchased one. </p><h2>  DIY jewelry </h2><p>  For the manufacture of home-made jewelry you will not need special skills, as even a novice craftswoman will cope with this.  However, to make the jewelry look stylish and original, all manipulations should be performed very carefully.  Material for jewelry can be any: </p><ul><li>  Leather. </li><li>  Beads. </li><li>  Beads. </li><li>  Lace. </li><li>  Felt. </li><li>  Linen. </li><li>  Bugle. </li></ul><p>  Although this is only a fraction of what a stylish accessory can be made from.  Among other things, for the manufacture of jewelry it is necessary to prepare the following handy tools: </p><ul><li>  Universal adhesive. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Centimeter. </li><li>  Threads. </li><li>  Needles. </li><li>  Accessories for jewelry. </li></ul><p>  Note that everything you need can be purchased in a specialized store or remodel an old, noticeably annoyed decoration. </p><h2>  Tassel earrings </h2><p>  Earrings are one of the most popular and favorite accessories among women.  Currently, each fashionista has at least 5-6 pairs of earrings.  However, not only ready-made accessories are designed to decorate, you can make them yourself, from improvised materials. </p><p>  In order to make tassel earrings, we need: </p><ul><li>  Thin fishing line. </li><li>  Needle. </li><li>  Beads. </li><li>  Schwenzy. </li><li>  Beads. </li><li>  Fixing pin with ring. </li><li>  Scissors. </li></ul><p>  It is not difficult to make such earrings, but it is very important to do this in stages, namely: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  At the first stage, you need to insert the line into the needle and string the beads on it.  There should be at least 10 such bead threads.  The length and color of bead threads should be chosen depending on your preference. </li><li>  Prepared bead threads should be tied in a knot at the very bottom of the fishing line. </li><li>  The resulting bead brush must be secured to the mounting pin and decorated with beads. </li><li>  At the final stage, the resulting workpiece should be attached to the sleeves.  By the way, shvenzy can be any: in the form of a clip fastener, with the English lock and in the form of a hook. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tassel earrings" class="if uuid-2701695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2701695.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, making jewelry with your own hands is not difficult, but the result will surely please you and give your image originality and sophistication. </p><h2>  Delicate spring necklace </h2><p>  Recently, the necklace has again become fashionable and has firmly consolidated its position.  Such an ornament will enliven the image and give it a certain share of romance.  However, it is not necessary to run to the store for the next piece of jewelry, as you can make necklaces from beads and beads yourself at home. </p><p>  In order to create such a delicate decoration, we need the following components: </p><ul><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Glue. </li><li>  Fishing line. </li><li>  Pink beads. </li><li>  Pink beads. </li><li>  Clasp for necklace. </li></ul><p>  Making homemade jewelry from beads and beads is very easy.  To do this, you must: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Using glue, glue the pink beads in the shape of a flower.  There should be 20-30 such flowers. </li><li>  String pink beads and the resulting flowers on the fishing line in this way: beads 1 cm, flower, then again beads 1 cm and flower again (ideally, the length of the necklace should be 20-25 cm). </li><li>  At the final stage of making jewelry with your own hands, fasten the clasp on the necklace. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaded necklace" class="if uuid-2701690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2701690.jpg"></div><p>  The ‚ÄúSpring‚Äù flower necklace is ready, it can be worn both on a date and on holidays.  And if you like something more concise, then pay attention to the following model. </p><h2>  Necklace made of beads "Girl's Tears" </h2><p>  A fringed beaded necklace does indeed resemble flowing droplets, like girl‚Äôs tears or rain.  To make a jewelry yourself, you will need: </p><ul><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Fishing line. </li><li>  Clasp. </li><li>  The beads are white. </li><li>  Needle. </li></ul><p>  Perhaps this is the easiest decoration to perform, and even an aspiring craftswoman can make it affordable.  However, accuracy is very important in this seemingly simple matter.  To make such an ornament, the following manipulations should be performed: </p><ol><li>  Take a fishing line 25 cm long and put on beads. </li><li>  Then cut 10 pieces of 5 cm from the fishing line and put on the beads too. </li><li>  Fix the obtained bead fringe on the bead thread at the same distance. </li><li>  Attach the clasp to the semi-finished necklace. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bead necklace" class="if uuid-2701694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2701694.jpg"></div><p>  This necklace will serve as a great addition to your everyday look and beyond.  By the way, if you use multi-colored beads for making such a necklace, you can create a bright, elegant jewelry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Brooch in the style of boho </h2><p>  Until recently, the boho style was used only in clothing.  However, as it turned out later, it can also be used for the manufacture of accessories.  In stores you can buy bags, belts and even boho-style jewelry, but we will go the other way and craft a leather brooch on our own. </p><p>  To make such a boho-style jewelry, we need: </p><ul><li>  Burgundy leather. </li><li>  Lace. </li><li>  Beads. </li><li>  Beads. </li><li>  Universal adhesive. </li><li>  Clasp for brooches. </li><li>  Accessories in the form of petals. </li></ul><p>  Since the boho style implies layering, the manufacture of such an instrument implies a phased implementation, namely: </p><ol><li>  Cut a strip of 1 cm wide and 10 cm long from the skin. A volumetric rose should be formed from the prepared strip by stitching or gluing it together. </li><li>  A circle with a diameter of 5 cm should be cut from lace. The circle must be gathered and stitched with folds. </li><li>  A leather rose should be glued to the resulting lace blank. </li><li>  Beads and beads should be glued to a rose.  And accessories in the form of petals should be sewn or glued under a rose. </li><li>  From the skin it is necessary to cut a circle corresponding to the diameter of the brooch, and stick it to the wrong side of the brooch. </li><li>  At the final stage, the clasp should be glued to the brooch. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="presentperfectcreations.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leather brooch" class="if uuid-2703376" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2703376.jpg"></div><p>  Such a leather brooch will certainly noticeably revive a boring blouse or dress and allow you to look original in any way. </p><h2>  Classic brooch </h2><p>  Love the classic style of clothing and don‚Äôt know what accessories would be more appropriate to complement the look?  Opt for classic style brooches, especially since it is very easy to craft it yourself.  To make such an ornament, we need: </p><ul><li>  Leather. </li><li>  Clasp. </li><li>  Large oval or round button (5 cm in diameter). </li><li>  Universal adhesive. </li><li>  The chain is 4-5 cm long. </li><li>  Thread with a needle. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Letters for initials. </li></ul><p>  It is necessary to cut a piece of leather (with a small margin) corresponding to the size of the button.  The resulting blank should be glued to the button.  On the back of the brooch you need to glue the clasp, and on the front side in the center of the initials.  At the final stage, decorate the brooch with a chain, sewing it around the edge. </p><h2>  Pearl bracelet </h2><p>  Do you like to wear bracelets?  Perfectly!  This accessory perfectly emphasizes the tenderness and beauty of the hand, therefore, every girl (woman) should have such a decoration and preferably not one.  Bracelets can be any: gold, silver, made of beads, beads, leather, but the most beautiful and delicate is a pearl bracelet.  Let‚Äôs try to create a simple <span>bracelet with your own hands from pearls,</span> especially since it is not at all difficult, and for its manufacture we need a minimum of materials: </p><ul><li>  Pearl beads (large and small). </li><li>  Fishing line. </li><li>  Lock. </li><li>  Needle. </li><li>  Scissors. </li></ul><p>  In order to make a pearl bracelet, you need to cut the fishing line to the size of your wrist, leaving 3-5 cm in stock. Beads must be strung on the fishing line with a needle, alternating 2 small and 1 large.  Then the resulting blank should be tried on your wrist and cut off the excess fishing line.  At the final stage, you should fix the lock on the fishing line, and now the jewelry, made by yourself, is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wrightsjewelleryshop.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pearl bracelet" class="if uuid-2701684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2701684.jpg"></div><h2>  Braided Bead Bracelet </h2><p>  Which of us in childhood was not fond of weaving?  It's time to remember these skills and weave a bead bracelet.  In order to weave an elegant bracelet, you will need a special machine.  However, you can make it yourself by scoring cloves on a plank from two sides. </p><p>  So let's get started.  To weave a bracelet, we need: </p><ul><li>  Threads. </li><li>  Needle. </li><li>  Clasp. </li><li>  Beads. </li></ul><p>  The bracelet weaving technique is as follows: </p><ol><li>  The machine must be pulled in 5-6 rows. </li><li>  5-6 beads should be strung on a thread with a needle and weaved them into threads on the machine, prying them from above, then from below. </li><li>  Thus, the entire bracelet should be woven. </li><li>  At the very end of the bracelet, loop fasteners should be formed. </li><li>  On the received loops fasten a fastener. </li></ol><p>  By the way, the bracelet can be both plain and colored, patterned.  To make a color bracelet, you should alternate beads of different colors, according to a pre-compiled scheme. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.allthegoodgirlsgotoheavenblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bead bracelet" class="if uuid-2701677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2701677.jpg"></div><p>  In such a simple way, you can make any jewelry that can later be worn by yourself or presented as a gift to relatives or friends. </p>
