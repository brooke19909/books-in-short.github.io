    <p>  Climatic conditions in this area are famous for warm winters and extremely hot summers.  Against the background of high humidity, doctors categorically do not recommend a stay in Egypt in the summer.  The average temperature in July is +37 ¬∞ C. By autumn, the heat decreases and the season begins.  It should be noted that the amount of rainfall is very small, so the climate is considered to be tropical desert.  In winter, it is warm enough in Hurghada, but for the bathing season, a temperature of +20 ¬∞ C is quite cool.  At this time of year the beaches are empty. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can visit local attractions in the Dahar area.  The beaches of the city deserve a separate discussion. </p><h2>  Hurghada beaches </h2><p>  Someone likes to lie down by the pool, and someone hurries to the beach.  To come to the Red Sea coast and lie by the pool is the same as not to visit the main attraction.  The Red Sea is famous for its purity and unprecedented beauty. </p>

    <p>  Formally, the city is divided into two districts - El-Dahar and Sakkala.  The third area is a stretch of hotels stretching along the beaches. </p><p>  All tourists who visited this region at least once could notice that the lagoons at some hotels were created by human hands, and not by nature.  This creates a specific entrance to the sea.  It is worth paying attention to coral reefs.  They are clearly visible from the shore.  If they are located right on the shore, then the entrance to the water can be considered safe only with special shoes.  Pontoons in this region are a rarity.  Each hotel provides its vacationers with sun loungers and umbrellas in the beach area, with the exception of city hotels adjacent to paid beaches, and those that promise budget service at an extremely low price. </p><p>  Hotels stretch along the beach line of the city one after another.  From such an abundance is difficult to choose.  Our close attention today will be turned to one hotel in the city of Hurghada.  Hurghada Grand Hotel 4 * is a hotel with excellent service. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Grand Hotel 4 (Hurghada) is located near the airport, so there is no need to get to it for a long time.  It is a large complex right on the beach.  This place has a very good entry into the sea and clean sand, which is an advantage for the city of Hurghada. </p><p>  <span>Hotel Grand Hotel 4</span> is a member of the Red Sea Hotels group of hotels.
