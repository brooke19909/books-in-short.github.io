  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to crochet a triangle - all basic methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sometimes a lace product is created by assembling individual (triangular, square, round) elements into a single whole.  Each motive is sequentially tied to another, guided by the pattern.  Elements can be either plain or knitted from several multi-colored threads.  They can be flat or with the content of a knitted flower. </p><p>  Triangles can also be useful for making toys, such as paws or wings.  Shawls, bactuses and scarves are also triangular in shape, and such things can be connected from one triangular piece. </p><p>  <span>Crocheting a</span> triangle for beginners is not difficult.  How to do this, the article will tell.  Consider methods of knitting such motifs in various ways. </p><p>  Abbreviations used in the text: </p><ul><li>  in.  p. - air loops; </li><li>  in.  n. for sim.  - air loops for a symmetrical pattern; </li><li>  in.  n. p. - lifting air loops; </li><li>  Art.  without nak.  - single crochet posts; </li><li>  Art.  with nak.  - columns with 1 double crochet; </li><li>  Art.  - half columns. </li></ul><h2>  Triangle with the direction of knitting from the corner </h2><p>  So, how to crochet a triangle from a corner?  To do this, dial 2 in.  item and the second from the hook knit 3 tbsp.  without nak.  Next is the increase - its meaning is to knit two tbsp.  without nak.  in each row in the first and last columns of the previous rows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pikoclub.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="triangle pattern from the corner" class="if uuid-2670667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2670667.jpg"></div><p>  Because of these additions, there is an increase in the size of the triangle in both width and height. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A triangle made from the center of the bottom edge </h2><p>  And how to crochet triangles for the edge of a rug made by a "grandmother" square?  The motive that is made from the center of the lower edge will help. </p><p>  At the beginning of the work, you need to dial a chain of six in.  item and close item item.  Now we continue knitting according to the attached scheme. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="triangle from the middle of the bottom edge" class="if uuid-2670675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2670675.jpg"></div><h2>  Triangles from the bottom edge with different options for reducing loops in each row </h2><p>  The simplest and most commonly used methods are knitting triangles from the bottom up.  Before crocheting a triangle, determine the size of its base.  Dial the chain from to.  n., equal to this length, and continue to work, reducing evenly the loops from the edges.  Decreases can be performed from the beginning of the row and ending it, but it is possible only at the end of the rows.  The slope or, on the contrary, the steepness of the sides of the resulting motive will depend on these manipulations. </p><p>  Below is a diagram for knitting a triangle from the base, where the loops are reduced by knitting two tbsp.  with nak.  one loop at the end of the rows. </p><p>  Let's tie the pattern.  The dialed loops are a multiple of two + 1 in.  n. to rise + 1 in.  n. for sim.  Let's say 20 century.  n. we should be enough.  Work is going on according to the scheme. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pikoclub.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="triangle pattern with loops at the end of the rows" class="if uuid-2670671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2670671.jpg"></div><p>  The second option involves reducing the loops in each row at the beginning and at the end.  From the beginning of the rows, the loops decrease due to a set of two c.  item and immediately knit art.  with nak., and at the end they fit 2 tbsp.  with nak.  together. </p><p>  If you compare triangles connected in two ways, you will definitely notice that the sides of the first motive are longer than the relatively short base, and the triangle itself is as if extended upward.  Whereas the second element turned out to be more squat, although the length of the base side is the same in both cases. </p><h2>  The motive with the direction of knitting from the center </h2><p>  How to crochet a triangle in which knitting will go from the center and in a circle?  There are many variations, but they all come from one principle: a chain from to.  n.  with nak.  or Art.  without inc., thereby forming each side of the triangle and its angles. </p><p>  In order to make a sample, dial 4 in.  item and close in the ring item item.  Next, we knit into this ring 9 tbsp.  without nak.  In the next row, repeat 3 times from * to *: 2 tbsp.  without nak, in the third loop of 3 tbsp.  without nak.  In the following rows we knit art.  without nak., and in the corners we knit three tbsp.  without nak. </p><p>  Rows can be closed with half columns, or you can knit in a circle. </p><p>  So, we figured out how to crochet a triangle: there are four main methods.  And although there is a huge mass of varieties, patterns and methods of knitting triangular motifs, it would seem, completely different from each other, but they are all derivatives of these basic options. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.winwickmum.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a triangle connected from the middle by a &quot;grandmother&quot; pattern" class="if uuid-2671001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2671001.jpg"></div><p>  How to crochet a triangle according to the pattern?  Everything is very simple - you just need to read it very carefully.  Symbols are given above. </p><p>  Crocheted triangular motifs are quite interesting and are very popular among knitters.  Very often a banner is assembled from them, but sometimes triangles are also used as an independent product.  Stitched with each other, they form wonderful and unique things: handbags, hats, hats, scarves and much more. </p>
