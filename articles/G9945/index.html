  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to remove the pattern from the "Android"?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The screen lock is used to protect the device from strangers.  In the latest devices, among other things, it allows the use of a fingerprint, in all others it is usually used a digital password or a graphic key.  However, sometimes the pattern of the graphic key is forgotten.  As a result, access to the phone is impossible.  In this article you will find information on how to change the pattern in several ways. </p><h2>  How to change the lock if you remember the combination? </h2><p>  If it is possible to unlock the mobile device, then removing the graphic key in the settings is not difficult.  To do this, follow the step by step instructions: </p><ul><li>  open the Settings tab on your tablet or phone; </li><li>  select the "Security" section and go into it; </li><li>  open the ‚ÄúScreen lock‚Äù item; </li><li>  in the window that appears, select "No" or "Scroll". </li></ul><p>  After these steps, the mobile device is easy to unlock even to an unauthorized user.  If necessary, you can set another graphic key or a digital password in the same menu.  After changing the password, it is recommended to write it down somewhere in order to further eliminate problems with blocking the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="poandroidam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="remove the graphic key" class="if uuid-3185298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3185298.jpg"></div><h2>  Making a call </h2><p>  Sometimes it happens that the user forgot the pattern of the graphic key, especially if it is installed recently.  What to do in this case?  You can unlock the Android-based device by calling it.  On older models, during an incoming call, it is possible to enter the menu without using a graphic key. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, during the call we perform the actions: </p><ul><li>  You must press the Home key. </li><li>  Then proceed to the device settings and, according to the previous scheme, change or remove the graphic key. <div class="photo" data-original="www.compsmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove the pattern key" class="if uuid-3185305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3185305.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Low battery </h2><p>  You can try to remove the lock, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the device through a signal informing of a low battery.  The process takes time, but sometimes there may not be another way. </p><p>  How to do it: </p><ul><li>  When the display shows a low battery message, it becomes possible to open the Settings tab. </li><li>  In the window that appears, open the "Security" section and disable the graphic key. </li></ul><p>  We must act very quickly.  After all, before the device is completely turned off, there is not much time. </p><h2>  If there is a Google registration </h2><p>  To remove the graphic key, if you forgot it, and unlock the gadget, you can use the registration in Google.  To do this, follow the step by step instructions: </p><ol><li>  You must make at least five attempts to enter the pattern.  Since they are all entered incorrectly, the device remains locked.  At the same time, the display will prompt you to try again after a while. </li><li>  If there is a Home button on the mobile device, after incorrect attempts to enter a graphic key, this key is displayed.  If it is not, then you need to try to enter the key several times.  It is worth noting that this method only works if you have an Internet connection, in other cases you need to use other unlock options. </li><li>  The principle of solving the problem is that by clicking the "Home" button, the user gets the opportunity to use his Google account and change the picture.  To log in, you need to enter the email login information and password, and then click OK.  If the data was entered correctly, the user will be logged in and will be able to change the graphic key to a new one. </li></ol><p>  This option is suitable only if there is a registration in Google, the username and password are not forgotten, and an Internet connection is established. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove the graphic key in the settings" class="if uuid-3185321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3185321.jpg"></div><h2>  File manager </h2><p>  During the installation of the graphic key, a separate file is created in the device system that stores information about the lock.  If you delete it, the password will be canceled and access to use the device will be open.  To do this, you need a special program, for example, File Manager, and your smartphone must also have CWM or Recovery.  In order to remove the graphic key, you must follow the following step-by-step instructions: </p><ol><li>  Download the file manager and leave it unzipped.  It must remain in ZIP format. </li><li>  Using a computer, a program is downloaded to the device‚Äôs memory card.  You can also use a card reader or other phone. </li><li>  The SD card is inserted into the device you want to unlock. </li><li>  Pressing the volume and power buttons at the same time reboots Recovery. </li><li>  Then select the item ‚ÄúInstall ZIP from SD card‚Äù with the archive. </li><li>  After that, you need to confirm the action, and the file manager will start. </li><li>  Then you need to open the DATA / SYSTEM folder and find the gesture.key file.  or password.key and delete. </li></ol><p>  Thus, the password will be deleted, and the phone will be unlocked.  All that remains is to change it and this time remember or write down the lock combination. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="pro-android.pp.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove the pattern from the android" class="if uuid-3185311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3185311.jpg"></div><h2>  ADB program </h2><p>  If the previous method could not be implemented for any reason, you can apply an alternative method of a similar principle of action and remove the graphic key from the "Android". </p><p>  To do this, it is recommended to use the computer program ADB.  It is designed for a variety of operations, including deleting the gesture.key file.  In order to use it on the phone, the USB function must be activated.  Also from the Internet you need to download the corresponding script to perform all the actions.  To unlock the device, you need to follow the instructions: </p><ol><li>  Install the ADB program on the computer and then save it to drive C. </li><li>  Through the USB cable, the device is connected to the computer. </li><li>  Then run the downloaded script, which will open the command line. </li><li>  The file deletion is confirmed, and after the offer to restart the device, click "allow". </li><li>  At the moment when the reboot begins, the smartphone is disconnected from the USB cable. </li><li>  After rebooting, you will need to enter a new password, then go to settings and delete the pattern. </li></ol><p>  Thus, you can open the smartphone without using a password.  It should be clarified that there are no programs that can pick up a graphic key, so only such options are used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ilyarm.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove a forgotten graphic key from android" class="if uuid-3185341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3185341.jpg"></div><h2>  We use third-party SMS Bypass applications </h2><p>  You can remove a forgotten graphic key from the "Android" using a third-party application.  To use this method of unlocking a smartphone, you must have administrative rights and the ability to install such a program. </p><p>  The principle is simple: when the display is locked, a special message must be sent to the smartphone.  SMS at the same time serves as a code that allows you to deactivate the pattern.  To implement this method, you must follow the instructions: </p><ol><li>  Access your account using root privileges. </li><li>  Go to the Play Market and enter in the search engine SMS Bypass, then install the utility in Android.  It is worth noting that the program is paid. </li><li>  Open the application and go to settings, change the password and provide administrative rights. </li></ol><p>  The application is ready to go.  How does it work?  Messages with the text XXXXreset are sent to the blocked device (x in this case, the password for resetting the key).  After a message arrives on the device, an automatic reboot will begin.  You can then reinstall the pattern or use a different locking method. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the application can be installed on a locked smartphone, but only through root-rights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spyboy.blog" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove a forgotten graphic key" class="if uuid-3185317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3185317.jpg"></div><h2>  If nothing helps </h2><p>  If after applying all kinds of methods it was not possible to unlock the device, the last option remains - to reset to factory settings.  The main drawback is the loss of all data: contacts, photos, music and other files that cannot be restored if there is no backup. </p><p>  To perform a reset, you must perform several steps: </p><ol><li>  Turn off the smartphone. </li><li>  By simultaneously pressing the volume and power buttons, go to the engineering menu. </li><li>  Find and select the Clear eMMC line or wipe data / factory reset. </li><li>  After the removal is complete, select the Reboot System line. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.renewandroid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove the pattern if forgot" class="if uuid-3185319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3185319.jpg"></div><p>  After completing the described steps, the mobile device will return to the original settings, and the graphic key will disappear.  After a reboot, the device will be completely clean, like new. </p><p>  If you have problems remembering the pattern, you may need to choose a different locking method. </p>
