However, summer sweaters are called a variety of types of clothing: from pullovers to tops.  They are knitted from yarn with a high content of cotton, linen, viscose or silk. </p><h2>  <span>Crochet: blouse</span> (pattern, general principles of knitting, photo) </h2><p>  Basically, summer products are knitted using openwork patterns.  Crochet technique, like no other, allows you to perform extremely beautiful lace patterns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blouse crochet for girls scheme" class="if" height="465" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1170715.jpg" width="334"></div>

    <p>  Recommendations regarding the use of natural yarn are justified by its characteristics: </p><ul><li>  She looks great in knitting. </li><li>  Air leaks through it. </li><li>  It does not cause allergies in contact with skin. </li></ul><p>  Alternatives to natural threads are acrylic, polyamide, polyester and microfiber.  In various proportions, they can be present in high-quality yarn, but not more than 30%.  Their presence gives the threads strength, elasticity and shine.  If the artificial fibers are greater than the specified percentage, then there is a chance that the crocheted blouse made of this material (the pattern scheme does not matter) will be hot, too stiff, and begin to roll or deform. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Simple blouse model </h2><p>  Among the simplest crocheted products - those that have a simple geometric shape and are connected by a continuous web.  An example is a crocheted summer blouse, the diagram and photo of which are given below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet blouse scheme" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1170532.jpg" width="226"></div>

    <p>  Strictly speaking, this is the top on the straps.  Its shape is a rectangle.  A feature of this product is that the parts of the front and back, from the middle and above, are connected according to one pattern, which then goes into the bodice circuit.  From the middle and below the blouse fits in a different way. </p><h2>  Arguments in defense of the pattern </h2><p>  To knit a bodice, it will be necessary to resort to reducing the loops and observing a certain shape, but this task is greatly simplified when drawing up a pattern. </p><p>  Many beginners believe that there is no need to calculate loops and draw patterns, and try to randomly achieve the desired shape of the part.  I must say that any openwork <span>blouse crocheted (a scheme of</span> such a plan lends itself very poorly to smooth reduction of loops) needs to be knitted according to landmarks.  Otherwise, you can get an uneven "ragged" edge, a significant deviation from the desired contours or a major violation of the proportions of the part. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This is true not only for knitting a bodice, but also for parts containing necks, armholes and ridges. </p><h2>  Square motif blouse </h2><p>  The next model is a bit similar in form to the previous one, but the canvas consists of separately connected square motifs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork blouse crochet scheme" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1170529.jpg" width="185"></div>

    <p>  This <span>crocheted</span> blouse <span>(motive scheme is</span> attached) looks very attractive.  By the way, for the manufacture of fragments, you can use any familiar scheme.  The principle of arrangement of elements and their connection among themselves deserves attention. </p><p>  Many magazines recommend combining such elements in the process of knitting the last row.  However, in this case, you need to constantly monitor the correct location of the fragments, lay out the canvas each time and check the dimensions. </p><p>  It is much more reasonable to stitch them after the required number of motives are ready and laid out for the pattern.  Then, if necessary, adjust the dimensions of the canvas, you will not have to dissolve what is already connected. </p><p>  The bottom of the product is decorated in the form of corners.  If desired, it can be done evenly.  Partial crochet provides this opportunity.  The blouse (the scheme is only used halfway) with this method of designing the bottom will look more complete. </p><h2>  Motives of other forms as elements of a blouse </h2><p>  Blouses made of round or hexagonal motifs look good.  Combining them is much more complicated than working with square fragments. </p><p>  In the photo, a <span>crocheted</span> blouse <span>(a motif scheme</span> can be any), which is assembled from large fragments.  To fill the space between them used circular motifs of a smaller shape. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet blouse" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1170533.jpg" width="349"></div>

    <p>  When connecting such fragments, it is extremely difficult to obtain a traditional armhole or ridge of the sleeve.  Therefore, it is better to use a <span>raglan sleeve</span> or plan to knit a wide straight sleeve (as in the photo). </p><h2>  Round element in the canvas </h2><p>  No one remembers when the circular pattern designed for napkins was first used as a yoke.  Today it is a very popular technique.  However, its successful use implies carrying out the correct calculations and regular reconciliations with the pattern. </p><p>  Below is a photo in which the blouse is crocheted (the circuit is nearby) is connected in this way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet summer blouse" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1170530.jpg" width="458"></div><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blouse crochet for girls scheme" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1170714.jpg" width="414"></div>

    <p>  To knit this particular product, the pattern was changed due to the characteristics of the yarn. </p><p>  The round fragment is very successfully inscribed in a rectangle.  The pattern may need to be adjusted if a relatively <span>thick yarn is</span> selected <span>.</span>  Then you have to use only part of the rows of the circle or narrow the width of the rectangle.  To avoid unpleasant surprises, it is better to pre-calculate the height of each row according to the control sample. </p><h2>  Round element at the waist </h2><p>  The large round element described above can be used not only as a coquette.  It looks great if you fit it in the center of the back or in front of the product.  Particularly interesting are asymmetrical blouses, tunics and dresses with such a circle around the waist or side, on the chest. </p><p>  Often, when using this technique, knitters create a pattern with concentric rays diverging from the circle.  In this way, a product for an adult woman or a crocheted blouse for a girl can be connected.  The scheme of this large circle is constantly subject to modifications, changes and additions.  Therefore, do not be afraid to make your own changes.  Only need to monitor compliance with the principle of expansion of the canvas. </p>
