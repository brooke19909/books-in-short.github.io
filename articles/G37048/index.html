    <h2>  Shell and stone souvenirs </h2><p>  Often the question arises of what to bring a child from the Crimea.  Give him a piece of the sea - a beautiful shell in which you can hear the sound of waves.  But you should be careful when choosing such a Black Sea gift.  Often, most of the sea treasures are caught, for example, in the Red Sea.  And therefore rapana will be almost the only native of this particular area.  This beautiful shell is sold both in its original form and in the form of jewelry.  In addition, they can be quite large, and therefore through them it is quite convenient to listen to how the ‚Äúsea is rustling‚Äù. </p><p>  What else can be brought from Crimea?  Not in the last place are stone products.  As in the case of shells, it is necessary to ask sellers about their origin and, of course, pay attention to the price if you want to buy a natural and valuable souvenir.  Of course, there are enough Chinese-made tinted glass trinkets.  But, for example, in Koktebel there are many master jewelers working with minerals born as a result of a volcanic eruption.  Now this is Karadag - a massive and majestic mountain, but mineral deposits are not limited to it.  Also, other regions of the Black Sea coast are generous with beautiful material for stone products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Wines and infusions </h2>

    <p>  In this case, what wine to bring from the Crimea?  Note that due to climatic conditions, grapes here become more sugary.  Because the wine from it is sweet and quite strong.  There is plenty to choose from: muscat, madeira or sherry.  In addition, if you want to present it in honor of any significant date or celebration, you can order wine of a certain year from the factory. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can I bring from Crimea as a gift" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/980769.jpg" width="443"></div></h2><h2>  Herbal Balms </h2><p>  What to bring from Crimea as a gift?  Pay attention to the Bakhchisarai herbal balms, because many spoke of them as delicious drinks.  And if before they were difficult to access even in Bakhchisarai itself, now that the tourist wave is quite high, they have begun to actively produce them.  Surprisingly, as part of the tincture, sometimes there are up to 50 herbs.  And although the quality of the drinks is not the same, no doubt, they are still unique and useful.  Yes, and you can buy tincture only in this small town. </p><h2>  Fragrant Herbal </h2><p>  Incredible in its variety of souvenirs from the Crimea.  What to bring a lover to mourn for?  The answer is simple - a collection of Crimean herbs.  Many people, both locals and visitors alike, agree that the tea that was collected in the mountains boasts an incredible aroma, taste, and most importantly - medicinal properties.  Its main advantage is that it is prepared from environmentally friendly forbs. </p><p>  Such tea, prepared in accordance with old recipes, will become an assistant in restoring strength, fighting colds and maintaining immunity.  Another positive feature of the unique Crimean tea is that it does not contain dyes, flavors or chemical additives.  Ecologically clean places exist for collecting herbs and berries on the peninsula. </p><p>  What can be brought from the Crimea from the forbs that it is rich in and so generously shares?  Let's look at the options.  So, suitable plants: </p><ul><li>  echinacea; </li><li>  motherwort; </li><li>  calendula; </li><li>  mint; </li><li>  sage; </li><li>  lemongrass. </li></ul><p>  And this is only an insignificant part of what can be found on the expanses of the Crimean peninsula.  If you decide to buy a fee, then it is best to do it in a specialized store.  Most of the positive reviews received such brands of manufacturers as "Teas of the Crimea" and "Fiolent."  But the herbs acquired from the hands are no worse.  After all, they also grew up on the local slopes, which means they have the same properties. </p><h2>  Essential oils </h2>

    <p>  Still doubting what souvenirs to bring from Crimea, pay a little your attention to essential oils.  Such a gift will be not only pleasant, but also useful, because it can be used for aromatherapy or taking a bath, as well as during inhalation.  Moreover, when buying oils, you will receive advice from the seller, and something else about their application can be read both on the label and on the package. </p><p>  It is important to remember that essential oils are sold in small glass jars, on which there must be appropriate labels.  In Crimea, such enterprises as the Crimean Rose plant, the Alushta essential oil state farm plant, and the Crimea-Aromat plant are engaged in their production.  And in order to avoid collision with fakes, make purchases in souvenir shops or cosmetics stores.  The reason for this is the storage conditions of the oil: it retains its properties and does not deteriorate at a temperature of +15 degrees.  From which it follows that the goods, which lay on a table in the sun, are probably already unusable. </p><h2>  Handmade soap </h2><p>  What to bring the fairer sex from Crimea?  For this case, there is a product that is becoming more and more popular every year - cosmetics and handmade soap.  Moreover, it is sold by weight or in original branded packaging, such as cardboard boxes or canvas bags.  This soap can be presented as a souvenir, and you can use it yourself with great pleasure. </p><p>  From handmade, of course, there is one name, and they are produced at the cosmetic enterprises of Crimea.  But do not rush to be disappointed.  They are made according to the recipe of a real handmade: when creating such things they do not use artificial dyes, but many natural components, as well as useful additives. </p>
