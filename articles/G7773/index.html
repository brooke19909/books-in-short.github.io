Enthusiastic sea lovers smell the sea water and see the open sails of frigates in front of them.  What is most surprising is how great travelers could survive their adventures in reality, showing so much perseverance and resourcefulness.  Thanks to them, the world learned about new lands and oceans. </p>

    <h2>  The reality of dangerous travel </h2><p>  It is unfortunate that, in fact, the great travelers could not always feel the taste of romance: their ships were wrecked, and the whole team could get sick with an illness unprecedented in those days.  The sailors themselves, who ventured into new discoveries, had to endure hardships, and death often overtook them.  It is not surprising that today many are so delighted with their courage and determination!  One way or another, thanks to some of the travelers, new continents were discovered, and some of them made an invaluable contribution to world geography.  With the help of historical documents that contain eyewitness accounts or notes from ship's logs, we can have plausible information about their wanderings.  However, it is unfortunate that the great geographical travelers rarely achieved what they were striving for. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  <span>Christopher Columbus</span> chasing spices and gold </h2><p>  It will be about a man who all his life dreamed of going on a long voyage.  Like any other who appeared in his place, he understood that it was not enough for him to manage without financial support, and it was not so easy to get it from the rich and not wanting to share their finances.  Where did the desperate traveler want to go?  He wholeheartedly wanted to find the shortest western route to India, which at that time was famous for its spices, which were worth its weight in gold. </p>

    <p>  Trying to prove his case, Columbus continued to repeatedly come to the Spanish king and queen for a long eight years.  It is worth noting that in his plan there were many flaws.  Despite the fact that scientists were already convinced of the spherical shape of the Earth, the question was what strip of the oceans separates Europe from Asia.  As it turned out later, Christopher made two gross errors.  Firstly, he suggested that the territory of Asia occupies a much larger area than it actually was.  Secondly, a quarter of Columbus underestimated the size of our planet. </p><h2>  First Columbus Expedition </h2>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Anyway, ‚Äúknock and they will open for you‚Äù: the expedition was approved, three ships were equipped to sail.  The enterprising Spanish monarchs longed not only for profitable trade routes - they were pleased with the very idea that Eastern countries would be converted to Catholicism.  And on August 3, 1492, about 90 people went on a long voyage.  They sailed many nautical miles, but rich lands never showed up on the horizon.  Columbus constantly had to reassure his team, sometimes even downplaying the real distances traveled in a protracted journey.  And finally, as it might seem, they reached their goal!  Where did our tireless sailors get to? </p><p>  The land that his team reached was the Bahamas.  Naked natives met every now and then, and the tropical climate was conducive to relaxation.  But in any case, it was not at all what the great travelers set off on their journey, leaving their homes and families.  After a two-week rest, the sailors set off further and reached Cuba.  Columbus could not calm down at all because he could not find any spices or gold. </p><p>  Further, the odyssey continued east, where the treasured gold was discovered.  This happened on an island to which Columbus gave the name La Isla Espanyola (now Espanyola).  Christopher Columbus already dreamed of how these lands would be subordinated to the Spanish crown.  He was waiting for his return home and huge honors, as well as another trip. </p><h2>  Subsequent Columbus Expeditions </h2><p>  The following year, an entire armada, consisting of 17 ships and more than 1,200 people, went with Columbus.  Among the people there were many soldiers and priests.  The Spaniards wanted to turn the new lands into colonies, and make the inhabitants Catholics.  Columbus still wanted to reach the shores of India. </p><p>  Two subsequent voyages to eastern India only slightly increased the seafarer's happiness.  Be that as it may, the sea lanes that were designated by him contributed to the colonization of the whole continent - North America.  Thanks to his achievements, the world turned upside down. </p><h2>  Vasco da Gama - the great navigator </h2><p>  Vasco da Gama lived a little earlier than Columbus, and has already opened the way to India, circling Africa.  Preparations for his long journey began long before he was born ‚Äî how different this incident was from what happened with Columbus!  The Portuguese monarchs understood the importance of the spice trade.  Manuel I - the king of Portugal - believed that only a person who, as one historian put it, ‚Äúcould combine the courage of a soldier with the cunning of a merchant and the tactfulness of a diplomat‚Äù can become the head of an expedition.  According to the king, it was Vasco da Gama who was suitable for this role. </p>

    <p>  In terms of natural skills and enterprise, this person was very different from Columbus - he knew his job well, understood where and why he was swimming.  The first expedition, although it was associated with certain difficulties, ended in success - Vasco da Gama concluded a peaceful relationship and an agreement with the Indian ruler to sell spices.  The happy <span>king of Portugal</span> immediately ordered the organization of subsequent expeditions.  Thus, thanks to this courageous man, a new sea route was opened from Europe to Asia. </p><h2>  Great travelers and their discoveries </h2><p>  For many centuries, different people have lived who have achieved a lot in natural science and geography.  If we talk about the achievements of our compatriots, then the first <span>great Russian traveler</span> who immediately remembers is Nikolai Miklukho-Maclay.  Although his achievements, of course, cannot be put on a par with the merits of Christopher Columbus, James Cook, Vasco da Gama or Amerigo Vespucci.  Of particular interest is his conclusion that cultural and racial characteristics and differences of peoples are determined by the natural and social environment. </p>

    <p>  The question may arise: where do people have such an acute need for something unknown and distant?  The fact is that since childhood, a person has a need to know the world around him, to explore it, to find answers to the questions: "What is the meaning of life? What are we doing on our planet?"  All of us, in essence, are ‚Äúgreat‚Äù travelers and discoverers at heart.  We are so arranged, one might even say, so created to constantly know the world around us.  It is not by chance that we are on Earth and very different from animals, as though some would not try to prove that we came from our smaller brothers.  A lot of books have been written about the desire of a person from childhood to learn the world around him.  One of these stories was written by M. Zoshchenko - "The Great Travelers".  Next, I would like to briefly tell you what kind of book it is. </p><h2>  M. Zoshchenko, "Great Travelers" </h2>

    <p>  In every person, an adult or just a child, lives his own Columbus or Vasco da Gama.  From childhood, we can observe how the child wants to know the world around him.  Zoshchenko's story "Great Travelers" tells the story of three children who gathered on a distant journey around the world.  They took a lot of different things, which were very difficult to carry, and which eventually turned into unnecessary trash.  This short instructive story teaches children that knowledge is essential for great accomplishments.  The story of Zoshchenko's ‚ÄúGreat Travelers‚Äù is a miniature masterpiece. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  As we see, in each of us lives a huge craving for the unknown - whether you are a great Russian traveler or an ordinary person.  Everyone seeks to find answers to burning questions.  Great travelers and their discoveries only prove this simple and very important truth.  And in the meantime, regardless of whether we cover long distances during our short life or not, each of us will begin and end his earthly journey, full of adventure and a lifetime.  The only question is: what will we discover during this journey and what will we leave behind? </p>
