Often, such a device was bought to support the style.  On the other hand, the developers did their best to support this idea, completing the sliders with an expanded set of functions, capabilities, and entertainment. </p><p>  And if you divide the phones into segments, the majority of the sliders were premium.  If there was some kind of successful development in this segment, the slider could remain out of work.  But there was simply no development capable of competing well with him. </p>

    <p>  In 2005, when it became clear that the slider form factor was gaining momentum, Nokia released its own version.  So the <span>Nokia 8800</span> model appeared <span>.</span> The model has a two-inch color display, support for mp3, which is completely incomprehensible with a minimum amount of memory, a phone book for 500 entries and a 0.5 MP camera.  There are no memory cards. </p><h2>  Design and equipment </h2><p>  In the closed position, we see only the monitor under the glass.  The lower functional part is closed by a metal casing.  Moreover, the metal is not indicated for advertising.  The body is quite thick.  The speaker and a light decorative grille under the glass protrude slightly forward, therefore, putting the phone ‚Äúface‚Äù down, it is impossible to scratch the screen - the device will lie on these two points. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In addition to the phone and charging, in the box there is a software disk, instructions and a <span>wireless headset.</span>  Of interest is a velvet pouch and a cleaning cloth made of the same material.  The headset is mono, but the owner has the opportunity to connect any other headset through a standard jack located at the bottom, near the charging hole.  This arrangement of sockets is not accidental: when opening, the Nokia 8800 ‚Äúshoots up‚Äù, opening up access to the keyboard and functional keyboards.  The pocket is designed so that in the open position, by pushing up, the key block is in the middle of the front panel.  The set of keys is standard - 12 keys and a call, or reset.  Although all the keys are hidden under the glass, at the same time you can accept the call in the closed position by pressing the soft key, which is located on the right side of the case. </p><p>  The keys are small, illuminated with white light that evenly illuminates the entire keyboard.  They can read only one language well, so Nokia 8800 will require replacing the alphanumeric block to localize it. </p><h2>  Other modifications - Arte and Sirocco </h2><p>  A year later, in 2006, the company's engineers presented a new edition.  The main difference was the design of the new model, or rather, a slightly modified front panel, under which the numeric keypad is hidden.  The 8800 Nokia Original had a small indentation that mimicked the joystick beneath it.  The new development received a deeper cavity, and in addition, recycled ringtones, a 2 megapixel camera and radio support.  Bluerooth was added to the package - the BH-801 headset, the case became leather.  But the main difference that was noted immediately after the advent of the new model is a larger battery.  The keyboard of the new development has also undergone certain changes.  The keys did not do more, but they were built with a ladder (in rows) and solved the issue of localization.  The English font is slightly moved to the right.  To the left of the figure, which also shifted, was a localized layout.  Pretty funny effect: if the original layout is made in a ruler, the localized one is arranged in a cube.  The new development was named Nokia 8800 Sirocco Edition. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Color solutions.  Sirocco and more </h2><p>  Like its predecessor, this edition received two performances - dark and light.  The reviews note both black and steel performance.  Naturally, later this model received other designs.  The original Nokia comes from German factories, so most of the other color schemes are fake versions released in Asian countries. </p>

    <p>  The downside of both decisions is soiled.  Fingerprints easily remain on the device.  You have to constantly wipe, but taking the device the next time in your hands - you will have to wipe again. </p><p>  To conclude the color theme, we should mention the version that received the code name Nokia 8800 Siroccogold.  The steel glass of this edition has a gold plating.  This phone was released in the amount of only 1,000 copies. </p><h2>  Some coal </h2><p>  Finland, under a license from the Germans, also released improved developments of the iconic 8800. Finnish production models were code-named Arte.  At the same time, Arte has two variations, the older and the younger.  The eldest, in addition to sapphire spraying on glass (all 8800 can boast of this), also received an artificial sapphire crystal on the case, which gave the name to the version of Sapphire Arte.  Almost immediately after the release, the younger version received a modification of the Nokia 8800 Carbon Edition. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the external case, which was used <span>carbon fiber,</span> titanium, polished glass and stainless steel, the device has 4 GB of music and, at that time, a good player.  Since memory cards are not provided, you can find a cable for communication with a computer in the kit. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Even in this century of smartphones, the Nokia 8800 will remain a cult option.  Line 88, although it received a lot from other models of the brand, nevertheless became a peculiar difference.  Although it has a rich exterior decoration, but besides this, there is nothing special to boast of.  However, this phone provided calls and SMS.  In fairness, it is worth noting that for phones from Nokia it is not at all necessary to be super-smart to make good calls. </p>
