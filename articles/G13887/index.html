But after buying such a toy, you need a lot of additional devices to play with it.  In addition to a variety of clothes for your "child", you will also want a doll house, and furniture in it.  If you buy furniture in a store, it will cost parents a round sum. </p><p>  In the article, we will tell you <span>how to make furniture</span> for a doll with your own hands, what you need for work, how to decorate furniture for a doll's room.  The materials used are the most familiar and cheap that are available in each apartment.  These are plastic bottles and foam sponges for washing dishes, packaging boxes made of corrugated cardboard, cardboard packaging for eggs and matchboxes, ice cream sticks and other materials. </p><p>  How to make furniture for dolls with your own hands at home?  First you need to prepare the necessary materials, think about how to fasten the structural parts to each other.  You can use PVA glue to work with paper and cardboard.  To work with other materials, a stronger connection is required, for example, a glue gun or liquid nails, it holds well bonded parts and transparent Crystal glue. </p><h2>  Bed for a doll </h2><p>  If you still have a tight packing box, then now we will tell you how to make doll furniture with your hands, see the photo below.  You can make a single bed, or you can make a stretching second bed from below.  If the berth only needs one, then from below you can make a drawer made of cardboard, in which the child can fold the bedding for the doll's crib. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to make furniture for a doll with your own hands from cardboard with step-by-step instructions, read on.  First you need to measure the height of the doll, add 2-3 cm for the pillow and get the required size for the bed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Corrugated Bed" class="if uuid-2273709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2273709.jpg"></div><p>  Next, a drawing of the future piece of furniture is created with a simple pencil.  A long line is drawn, from it the length of the bed is measured downward, to the left is the depth of the furniture with a cutout under the drawer.  On the right you need to measure the depth of the bed.  To the left and right, add a few centimeters per hem.  Then everything is cut out along the contours.  Further, the sweep needs to be bent along the fold lines.  You get a bent part with the letter "P" with curved bases. </p><p>  Then, a box for linen is made in the same way, there is no need to make reserves for bending, but you need to add side strips to the drawing.  Further along the folds, a rectangular box is formed and a handle is attached to the front panel.  It can be made after decorating furniture, for example, from a button, bead or strong thread, on which several pieces of beads were strung. </p><p>  But that is not all.  To make furniture for your Barbie doll with your own hands, you also need to cut out the side parts - the headboards.  Again we take up a simple pencil and ruler and draw a rectangle in which the length is equal to the height of two backs plus the length of the bed itself.  After bending in the right places, an inverted letter "P" is obtained, on the bottom of which the bends of the main part of the structure are glued to the PVA. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Decoration work </h2><p>  You have already learned how to make doll furniture for your dolls from cardboard and paper, now let's see how it can be decorated.
