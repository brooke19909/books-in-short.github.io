For their accommodation in the city there are not only expensive hotels, but also quite budget hostels and hotels.  Judging by the guest reviews, cheap <span>hotels in Tbilisi</span> are famous for their comfortable service and friendly welcome, which are in no way inferior to "star" hotels. </p><p>  Of course, the closer to the city center, the higher the cost per day will be, however, there is plenty to choose from.  Many cheap hotels in the center of Tbilisi provide guests with a free breakfast and other amenities for a pleasant pastime. </p><h2>  Hotel The Family </h2><p>  If you want to find a hotel (cheap) in the center of Tbilisi with breakfast, then you can pay attention to this hotel, which is located on the street.  Mnatobi, d. 41a.  The city center is no more than a kilometer, and the nearest metro station "Marjanishvili" is about 15 minutes walk. </p><p>  To accommodate tourists, the hotel provides double rooms of 20, 30 and 35 square meters.  meters.  The cost of the smallest will be around 3,700 rubles, and for more spacious rooms will have to pay 4,300 and 5,000 rubles.  respectively. </p><p>  The hotel offers beautiful views of the garden, and visitors can use the barbecue facilities for free if desired.  Each room has a modern TV and air conditioning.  The rooms have private bathrooms, which are equipped with all necessary amenities: hairdryer, toiletries.  In addition, slippers are provided to each guest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel The Family" class="if uuid-2567297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2567297.jpg"></div><p>  On-site parking is available, so those traveling by car will not have to rack their brains over where to leave their vehicle.  The hotel also has a restaurant where you can enjoy national dishes prepared according to old Georgian recipes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Vacationers note the exceptional hospitality of the staff, the cleanliness and well-groomed rooms, as well as the very convenient location of the hotel.  Pleasantly surprised guests and the fact that the hotel staff speak several languages: Georgian, Russian, Greek and English.  Therefore, there are no problems communicating with the administration. </p><h2>  Guesthouse White Rooms </h2><p>  This hotel is located near the city center (1.7 km) on the street.  Mamardashvili, d. 22. For a double room with one double or 2 single, you will have to pay only 990 rubles.  However, breakfast will either have to be paid separately, or eat at nearby cafes, fortunately there is no shortage of them.  In addition, the hotel provides an airport transfer service, which is also not included in the price. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Guesthouse White Rooms" class="if uuid-2567383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2567383.jpg"></div><p>  Each room at this affordable Tbilisi hotel has a private bathroom, and tourists can use the shared kitchen to prepare their own meals.  There is a good internet signal throughout the guest house; you do not need to pay extra for this service.  For travelers by car parking is provided. </p><p>  Guests at this hotel note the amazing silence of the area, even though the city center is nearby.  I also liked that every day the room is cleaned, bed linen is fresh, there are no interruptions with hot water.  There are those who consider the rooms too crowded, but for such a price in the center of Tbilisi it is hardly possible to find a more worthy option. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hostel Old City Sololaki </h2><p>  You can find cheap hotels in Tbilisi (Georgia) for accommodation and a little further from the center.

Throughout the territory there is the possibility of free internet connection. </p><p>  This accommodation option was appreciated by those tourists who do not have large funds, but at the same time they like to travel very much.  There is a good combination of price / quality and the friendliness of the hostel staff.  Of the shortcomings, only the small size of the room and the not very beautiful view from the window were noted. </p><h2>  Hostel Art Tbilisi </h2><p>  The original design and affordable rooms are perfect for young travelers who are not willing to pay thousands for accommodation in 3 and 4-star hotels.  For guests here are provided triple rooms, the cost of accommodation in which will be only 450 rubles.  for one person. </p><p>  A shared kitchen is equipped with a microwave, coffee maker and kettle, as well as a stove.

According to tourists, Art Tbilisi is one of the most inexpensive hotels in Tbilisi, but quite cozy at the same time.  It is located on the street.  Hanzeteli, per.  2, d. 4, which is 4 km from the city center. </p><h2>  Hostel "Opera" </h2><p>  Tourists also include Opera Hostel, which can be found on <span>Shota Rustaveli</span> Ave. at number 24, as a good and inexpensive hotel in Tbilisi.

Negative opinions about this hotel could not be found. </p><h2>  Hostel Corner </h2><p>  An inexpensive hotel in Tbilisi called Corner invites tourists to stay in a single room for 625 rubles.
