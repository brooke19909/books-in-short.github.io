Its second name, Omega (known since the mid-19th century), is more popular.  The bay is very similar to this capital letter of the Greek alphabet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Omega Beach Sevastopol" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2076741.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The beach is sandy and shallow, only about 5-8 meters.  Only the middle part of the coast is clayey with insignificant stones.  A small layer of water warms up quickly, so the bottom is covered almost all summer with a thin layer of algae, which during the surf or storm form a beautiful fluffy green carpet on the beach. </p><p>  On one of the protrusions of the coast, Cape Peschanoy, the water is much cleaner and more transparent.  This place was chosen by divers and diving enthusiasts.  The opening views are said to be of stunning beauty.  There is also a natural mud bath here.  Sludge deposits help relieve pain in the joints, smooth the skin and raise the overall tone of the body. </p><p>  The beach is almost 30 meters wide and stretches over 700 meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  There are many different attractions open here, delights in water and trampolines delight children.  There are several cafes with menus for every taste and budget.  In the evening, discos are held on the beach and often live music is played.  For lovers of outdoor activities on the beach in Omega Bay (Sevastopol), rental points are open.  You can always rent jet skis, catamarans, beach accessories, etc. </p><p>  On the opposite shore of the bay, the private Yacht Club South offers guests to rent a yacht or windsurfing equipment.  For fishing you can rent a long boat. </p><p>  On the beach "Omega" (Sevastopol) flights are organized on kite and hang glider. </p><p>  Around the bay there are many residential buildings in which you can always find a room or a turnkey apartment for every taste and budget.  There are several hotels within walking distance. </p>

    <p>  At a distance of one public transport stop there are two markets with fresh local fruits, vegetables and wines, as well as supermarket chains and small shops of souvenirs and beach items. </p><h2>  Promenade </h2><p>  There is a well-organized recreation area.  It has many restaurants, fast food outlets, cafes and bars.  For kids and teenagers, although adults will not refuse to have fun, various attractions (ball, slides, etc.) are installed, including Crazy Cart, game labyrinths, playgrounds, all kinds of swings and carousels.  There are rental bicycles, gyro scooters, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Paddling pool" </h2><p>  This is the beginning of the beach area in Omega Bay (Sevastopol).  Unworthy swimmers, families with small children and elderly people have a rest here.  The bottom and shore are mostly sandy with small interspersed small pebbles.  The entrance to the water is gentle.  But an adult, to go into the sea at least to the waist, you need to walk about ten meters.  On the other hand, the places here are unpredictable: there are such hollows that a child can leave with his head. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to Sevastopol" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2076492.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Since this place is intended for bathing children, a lifeguard is always on duty here.  From the infrastructure in this part of the Omega beach (Sevastopol) - canopies (peers of the beach), left-luggage offices, changing cabins and rental of equipment and beach equipment. </p><p>  For children, there are several attractions, inflatable slopes and an outdoor sports ground.  Not far from the beach, at the boat station, you can rent a pedalo and take a look at the surroundings from the sea. </p><h2>  Central recreation area </h2><p>  There are two ways to get to this part of the Omega beach (Sevastopol): making your way through the rows of sunbeds or going down the beautiful promenade.  There are mobile awnings, rental of beach equipment and changing cabins.  The shore is more pebble, although sand is brought to all sections of the beach by the opening of the season.  But as guests of the city write in reviews, it is distributed fragmentarily.  Pebbles in the water are covered with algae.  Depth is gaining gradually. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gagarinsky district" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2076484.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Showers are provided, but they rarely work.  A signpost directs those eager to flush sea salt to the boat station.  But there is a paid Charcot's shower.  It‚Äôs quite difficult to enter the sea behind the pier on which it is installed, especially after a storm or high tide: algae covers absolutely everything. </p><p>  There are no webcams here.  And by the way, thin grooves flowing into the sea, this is nothing more than a channel of melt and rainwater. </p><h2>  Her second half </h2><p>  This part of the central beach is considered the most comfortable for relaxing by the sea in Sevastopol.  The water is cleaner than everywhere, the bottom is deeper and the sand is nicer.  Sunset at sea is smooth, there are special wooden flooring.  Rental offices are also open here, changing cabins and a hot shower are organized.  At the pier in the daytime, a lifeguard is on duty, who is also a medic. </p><p>  Close to numerous cafes and bars, cozy lounge areas are equipped.  For children's pleasure, an inflatable slope with a pool in which sea water was poured was installed near the Mariner bar.  At the pier guests of the resort are waiting for bananas, tablets, jet skis, etc. </p><p>  On the northern border of the beach there is a ramp and a changing room for people with disabilities.  However, the latter write in their reviews that it‚Äôs quite difficult to call in a wheelchair, and they ask the beach owners to organize a holiday according to the requirements for ‚ÄúAccessible beaches‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest by the sea Sevastopol" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2075563.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Interesting changes </h2><p>  Today, the coastline intended for swimming has been increased due to the beach area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Omega dolphins located behind the second pier.  She stretched from the boat station to the Wild Omega.  Judging by the reviews, the Omega beach in Sevastopol becomes cleaner and more comfortable from year to year. </p><p>  Prohibition signs are installed on the southern and northern borders.  It is forbidden to swim in the "game" beloved by the townspeople and on the south coast of the bay.  In the first case, the coastal zone has not been explored and, therefore, is unsuitable for swimming, in the second - there is an official parking lot for small boats. </p><h2>  How to get to Sevastopol </h2><p>  Today this is done easily and practically by any means of transport: by bus, train and ferry.  Not available while the plane.  Therefore, you will have to fly to Simferopol.  Here is the main hub of the peninsula.  In season, a bus runs directly from the airport to the center of Sevastopol.  The trip lasts almost three hours.  You can take this opportunity to ride along the beautiful and cozy streets of Simferopol to the center and from there take a taxi, electric train or bus to Sevastopol. </p><p>  The train also first arrives in Simferopol.  But in this case, just changing the platform and reseeding on the train (it runs five times a day), you can comfortably and easily get to your destination.  The road takes two and a half hours. </p><p>  With buses it is much easier.  They go directly from almost all major cities, including the capital and St. Petersburg.  The fare necessarily includes a ferry service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach holidays in Sevastopol" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2075530.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Personal car must follow the highway M-4 "Don".  After Krasnodar, you need to go onto the regional highway R-251 and go along it to the crossing across the Kerch Strait.  Next, you need to follow to Feodosia and through Simferopol to Sevastopol.  How to get to Sevastopol, understandably.  We are looking for a treasured vacation spot. </p><h2>  We go to the beach by public transport </h2><p>  It is located in the Gagarinsky district on the street of Heroes of Stalingrad.  You can get there by buses No. 107, 109, 16, 119 or minibuses No. 4, 109, 112, 110. Trolleybuses No. 14, 4 and 10 also go to this area. You need to get off at the Omega stop.  From it to the entrance to the beach just a few meters. </p><h2>  Personal car </h2><p>  Paid parking directly near the beach is not.  You can leave your car in the square or in your pocket on Antique Avenue, at the back of the beach.  Nearest guarded paid parking - on the street.  Pilots.  It is not difficult to find her: turning to the beach in Victory Park behind the battalion commander Neustroev‚Äôs area. </p>
