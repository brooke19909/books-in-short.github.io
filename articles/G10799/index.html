    <p>  One of the main advantages of the modest and cozy three-star hotel Simplitel Phuket 3 * (Phuket, Karon) is the convenience of its location relative to the main objects of the island.  Firstly, it is located on the first coastline, just 300 meters from the sandy beach, where you can enjoy the beauty and serenity of the Land of Smiles. </p><p>  Secondly, the quiet daytime streets at night turn into a carnival of colors, sounds and smells.

    <p>  The room rate includes breakfast.  It works on the "BB" system.  The dining room is located on the second floor in an open area.  It offers all guests a view of the busy street.  A great opportunity to enjoy the sun and sea air.  For those who prefer calm and silence in the cool atmosphere of air conditioners, there is a closed room.  Breakfast is served from six in the morning until ten.  Here guests of the hotel can come for lunch or dinner and use the menu with fixed prices.  Simplitel Restaurant serves traditional Thai and European dishes. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel has its own bar with drinks and light snacks - Sabaii Bar.  Opening hours - from two in the afternoon until ten in the evening. </p><h2>  Entertainment and sports </h2><p>  As a rule, economy class hotels offer high-quality, but modest service and infrastructure.  Simplitel Phuket 3 * belongs to those (Thailand, Phuket).  Karon Beach with its many water activities, massage couches, spas, cafes and restaurants is just a five-minute walk away.  Is it worth it to worry about the lack of a pool and other entertainment on its territory?  I think no.  Indeed, at an affordable price, this is one of the best accommodation options. </p><p>  The hotel has a fitness center that allows you to keep fit and healthy, even while relaxing in the tropics.  His visit is available for a fee.  It is also worth noting the presence of a library and a reading room. </p><h2>  Simplitel Phuket 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  If you believe the data of popular tourist communities, the hotel has a very good reputation and mostly good reviews.  Its rating, according to tourists, is 8.2 out of ten possible points, which is very good for a three-star hotel. </p>

    <p>  If you are a big fan of relaxed beach holidays and water activities, then the Simplitel Phuket 3 * hotel will suit you fully.  Karon Beach is one of the best in Phuket and has a developed infrastructure.  Like mushrooms after the rain, luxurious luxury hotels have grown along it, and this, of course, requires cleanliness, safety and comfort. </p><p>  The six-kilometer beach is completely open, so the waves in the rainy season are very impressive in size.  Be careful and carefully monitor the signal flag, without neglecting caution.  Sand on the beach is crystalline, quartz.  One of its characteristic features is a creak, as if walking in the snow on a frosty day.  But here everything is exactly the opposite - the heat, the scorching sun and high humidity.  The water temperature does not fall below +27 degrees during the year. </p><p>  Everyone will find entertainment on Karon Beach to their own taste.  Water species: bananas, motorbikes, skiing, diving, boat trips, etc. Gourmets will surely like numerous restaurants specializing in the preparation of freshly caught seafood and fish. </p><p>  And of course, where without Thai massage and SPA procedures.  They have long been the hallmark of the country.  Numerous salons offer services at the most varied prices, depending on the type of establishment. </p><h2>  What is nearby with the hotel? </h2><p>  One of the area‚Äôs main attractions is Wat Suwan Khiri Khet.  Despite the noisy atmosphere and the improvised market at its gates, you can still enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and coolness of the stone building.  It is open daily.  The building is made in a traditional style with an abundance of gold ornaments, red and white colors.  At the entrance, guests are greeted with dragons of an unusual green-blue hue. </p>

    <p>  The spacious Karon beach on one side is connected to another - Kata.  <span>Dino Park</span> is located directly in this area on Beach Road <span>.</span>  It is a thematic golf course with 18 holes and a variety of dinosaur statues.  Here you can eat in a restaurant in the style of the Flintstones.  The park is open daily. </p><p>  If you want to know the country and its traditions, plunge headlong into the national flavor, then go directly to the market, especially since it is located almost on the beach.  This is a popular tourist destination in the heart of Karon Beach.  The market operates twice a week, on Tuesdays and Saturdays, but you should not come here early in the morning.  The most interesting begins in the evening, when cool twilight descends on the island.  The range of products is designed primarily for the tourism audience.  Therefore, it makes sense to bargain, as well as try local food and just enjoy the atmosphere of this place. </p>
