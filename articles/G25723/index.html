Biography, photos of him are available for review in this publication.  Vasily was born in 1921 in Moscow.  His mother was Nadezhda Alliluyeva.  After her suicide, he was brought up by the head of the Stalinist guard Vlasik.  Biography of Vasily Stalin says that he graduated from the Crimean Kachin aviation school, and then Lipetsk higher aviation courses. </p>

This made Vasily a favorite of the opposite sex.  Of course, the status of the leader‚Äôs son and the fact that he was a pilot played an important role here.

He was fond of cars and motorcycles, rode horses.  In 1940, Galina Bourdonskaya married him.  It was the first marriage, but not the last.  A year later, their son Alexander was born.  An interesting fact is that one of the <span>wives of the</span> leader‚Äôs <span>son</span> was the daughter of <span>Marshal Tymoshenko.</span>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Biography of Vasily Stalin tells us that he was a member of the Second World War.  As a pilot, he made 27 sorties and shot down two German aircraft.  He started the war in the captain's rank.  For a while, Vasily was an inspector of the Red Army aviation.  In 1943 he was appointed commander of an air regiment.  In May of that year, Vasily was removed from office on the orders of his father for "revelry and drunkenness."  The biography of Vasily Stalin says that in 1944-1945 he commanded first one and then another air division.  During the Second World War he was awarded the <span>orders of Suvorov, the</span> Red Banner (twice), Alexander Nevsky.  According to the characteristics of contemporaries and leadership, the leader‚Äôs son was weak-willed and did not possess commanding qualities at all.  Basil was quick-tempered, hot, irritable.  He suffered from alcoholism and allowed assault in relation to subordinates. </p>

In the period 1947-1952, the leader‚Äôs son was deputy and commander of the Air Force of the Moscow District.  In 1949, he became a deputy of the USSR Armed Forces.  He headed the equestrian federation of the Union.  With his light hand, projects for the construction of equestrian institutions and bases were approved, and the best <span>breeds of racehorses were also bred.</span>  The son of the leader received large funding from the treasury for all his sports projects.

    <p>  It is believed that the traditionally strong sports teams of the Air Force were created precisely by Stalin Vasily Iosifovich.  His biography, however, testifies that he solved all sports problems with the help of orders, and sometimes intimidation.  In 1946, his complaint to his father caused a wave of arrests of Air Force leaders.  Among them was <span>Marshal Novikov.</span>  After the death of his father, Vasily was dismissed from the army and forbidden to wear uniforms, and soon he was arrested and sentenced to 8 years.  In 1960, the leader‚Äôs son was released ahead of schedule, restored to the rank and returned a membership card.  About a month after leaving prison, he was drunk in a car accident.  For this, Vasily was sent to Kazan, forbidding him to live in Georgia and Moscow.  He died in 1962.  An autopsy diagnosed a complete destruction of the body due to alcoholism. </p>
