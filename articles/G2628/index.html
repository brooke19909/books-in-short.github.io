Volokolamsk is located in the west of Moscow, at the 98th kilometer from the Moscow Ring Road along Novorizhskoe highway.  The locality is the administrative center of the Volokolamsk district of the same name.  Recently, he received the status of the <span>City of Military Glory.</span>  It happened not so long ago - in 2010. </p><p>  The city has its own historical center, which is located on a tributary of the Lama River, the Gorodnya River.  This settlement has a unique ancient history. </p><p>  Volokolamsk occupies a prominent place in the region, as it has a well-established industry in various fields.  For example, a <span>milk and</span> paste factory is operating here, as well as a confectionery factory.  In addition to the food industry, Volokolamsk also boasts the production of various chemical materials and other products.  The city also has an excellent location, since the Volokolamsk ‚Äì Moscow route does not take much time.  This factor also helps the community to actively develop. </p>

    <h2>  A bit about the history of the city </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, it is worth noting some historical points associated with Volokolamsk.  Of particular interest is the fact that the city is practically the oldest in the entire Moscow region.  The first mention of his education can be found in 1135.  In those days, it was called "The Lam Wolf."  So, we can safely say that Volokolamsk is indeed the oldest city in the Moscow Region: according to historical data, it appeared 12 years earlier than Moscow.  In its history, he first took over the ownership of ever new princes for a long time.  Such an active struggle was due to the fact that the city had the most important strategic and transport significance.  For some time the place was ruled by the Lithuanian prince Svidrigailo.  In times of turmoil, Volokolamsk was occupied by the Poles, in a word, his fate was rather difficult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, with the change of time, the city gradually lost its transport significance.  This happened in the XVI ‚Äì XVII centuries.  From that moment, its active development began, a development plan was developed, and also the first educational institution appeared here.  Already at the end of the 19th century, industry began to develop in the village, which included a weaving mill, brick and breweries. </p>

    <h2>  Features of toponymy </h2><p>  Nowadays, from the point of view of history, it is absolutely necessary to follow the Volokolamsk-Moscow route.  The distance between these cities is very small.  However, during the trip you can gain a lot of knowledge about the history of the Moscow region. </p><p>  Separately, it is necessary to note the origin of the name of the city, since it is very closely related to its origin and further development.  To begin with, it must be said that until the 13th century this place was called "Lamsky Wolf" or "Lam Wolf".  This name appeared for a reason.  It was here that the trade route passed, which was often used by the Novgorodians.  Here they ferried their vessels from the Lama River to another body of water - Voloshnia.  Novgorodians used this path to get to Moscow and Ryazan lands.  There is a large network of rivers in the region, and the Lama is a tributary of Shoshi, and it also flows into the Volga.  To enjoy the beauty of these wonderful places, you can go on a trip along the route Volokolamsk ‚Äì Moscow.  The distance between cities is only about 120 kilometers.  Such a trip can be done in one day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
