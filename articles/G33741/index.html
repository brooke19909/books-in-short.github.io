Step-by-step instructions and tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, electronic gadgets are an integral part of the life of almost all people in the world.  Often breakdowns occur, as well as malfunctions among tablets.  It is very important to know how to disassemble the Samsung tablet at home in order to fix defects in the device. </p><p>  First you need to decide why you need to disassemble the gadget.  These devices are quite expensive, so excess damage will be clearly unpleasant.  Therefore, if there is no obvious need to disassemble the tablet, then do not touch its internal structure. </p><h2>  Causes </h2><p>  To find out how to disassemble the Samsung tablet yourself, you need to list the factors that require this process.  They may be as follows: </p><ul><li>  Breakage or damage to one or more parts of the device.  In the event of a fall, for example, external parts may remain intact, while internal parts may suffer.  Therefore, if the gadget began to show defects in work, you should disassemble it and find out the reason. </li><li>  The element has lost its properties.  Most often this happens with the battery.  It eventually becomes less capacious and discharges faster.  To replace it, you must disassemble the device and remove the battery. </li><li>  Interest.  Many who are interested in how to disassemble the Samsung tablet may just be occupied with what is under the cover of the device.  However, as already mentioned, you should not once again touch the inside of the gadget, so as not to damage them. </li><li>  The removal of a specific part.  It often happens that some elements are taken from old devices and rearranged to new ones, if the need arose. </li></ul><h2>  Training </h2><p>  Before the process, you should familiarize yourself with the instruction manual that came with the purchase.  There may be information that is useful when disassembling the gadget.  Also, it will not be superfluous to consult with familiar masters how to disassemble the Samsung tablet with your own hands.  Still need additional equipment for the dismantling process. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Instruments </h2><p>  We need: </p><ol><li>  A set of small screwdrivers.  The base should fit under the bolts on the device.  You will need both a Phillips and a flat screwdriver.  You can also use watch tools, but of good quality. </li><li>  Plates for disassembling electrical engineering.  Such tools are quite rare, so an ordinary knife or a plastic card is suitable as a replacement.  But with a knife you need to act extremely carefully so as not to damage the microcircuit. </li><li>  Other tools: sharp knife, pliers, tweezers. </li></ol><h2>  Process </h2><p>  When all the tools are ready, you can proceed.  It is recommended that you write down or mark on paper where a particular part was located so as not to get confused during assembly.  Even better would be to record the entire process on camera. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gadget disassembly" class="if uuid-3178954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3178954.jpg"></div><ol><li>  You need to turn off the device.  This item is extremely necessary, since a sharp disconnection of the gadget as a result of disconnecting the contacts will negatively affect its future work. </li><li>  Inspect the back cover of the device.  On some models, it is bolted with several bolts to the base, which must be unscrewed for further operations.  If there are none, then you just need to pry the lid with a knife or plastic card and remove it. <div class="photo" data-original="www.fictiv.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.fictiv.com/blog/posts/50-kindle-fire-teardown"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disassemble a samsung tablet" class="if uuid-3178963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3178963.jpg"></div></li><li>  Now you can see many different chips and mechanisms.  The biggest part is the battery that needs to be pulled out. <div class="photo" data-original="handphone-dan-hp.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet inside" class="if uuid-3178957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3178957.jpg"></div>  First you need to remove all connected wiring from it, and then unscrew the bolt that holds this element.  Using the same knife or plastic card, you need to pry the battery and remove it from the device. </li><li>  Now it will not be difficult to remove the motherboard, since it is now not covered by a bulky battery.  But first, you need to disconnect the headphone jack, volume control mechanism, backlight element and screen data cable.  It is also necessary to unscrew all the fixing bolts and remove the matrix. <div class="photo" data-original="www.a7droid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pc details" class="if uuid-3178951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3178951.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  This completes the process of basic disassembly.  Many who are concerned about the question of how to disassemble the Samsung tablet will be satisfied with such a result.  However, you can still remove some parts from the device for in-depth dismantling. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  On the motherboard, the camera is dismantled with a thin tool.  They need to hook the cable and disconnect the element. </li><li>  The front camera detaches in the same way as the main camera. </li><li>  Now, having removed the metal coatings, you can see the smallest microcircuits, as well as the tablet processor. <div class="photo" data-original="nutandvoltz.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="inside tablet" class="if uuid-3178956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3178956.jpg"></div></li><li>  How to disassemble the Samsung tablet completely?  It is also necessary to remove the display surface.  This is done with a hairdryer.  You need to warm up the front panel so that you can easily detach the screen. <div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gadget screen" class="if uuid-3178974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3178974.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  On this, the complete dismantling of the Samsung tablet can be considered completed. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, disassembling the tablet does not require hard-to-reach tools, and the process itself does not require special knowledge.  Therefore, dismantling can be performed by anyone who is confident in their abilities.  You just need to be careful and follow the recommendations and instructions exactly. </p>
