    <h2>  War with the brothers for the throne </h2><p>  After the death of Prince of Russia Vladimir left many heirs and sons.  The eldest, Svyatopolk, decided to become a single ruler, for this purpose he killed the younger brothers: Gleb, Boris and Svyatoslav.  The surviving Yaroslav, at that time the prince of Novgorod, learning about the atrocities of a relative, gathered a squad and went to Kiev.  There were many battles for the throne between the brothers.  Svyatopolk, nicknamed for his evil temper and intolerant character by the Accursed, often asked for help from the Pechenegs.  The forces were unequal, and Yaroslav retreated.  But the Russian people themselves, one day, tired of an unbearable ruler, took up arms and helped the Novgorodian defeat his brother and take the throne. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A little later, he also had to enter the battlefield with Mstislav, who ruled in Tmutarakan.  Another brother who appeared also wanted to oust the more successful son Vladimir from the throne.  But here Yaroslav won.  He was very supported by both nobles and ordinary peasants.  Since then, the heyday of Ancient Russia began.  The historical portrait of Yaroslav the Wise (c. 988-1054) and today speaks of the courage and thoughtfulness of this great ruler. </p>

    <h2>  Why wise? </h2><p>  Nicknames were given to princes by ordinary people based on their style of government, habits, or character traits.  The historical portrait of Yaroslav the Wise makes it clear that he was really deep man, with a broad outlook and analytical mind.  He was given the nickname "Wise" because of his tireless enlightenment.  He not only read chronicles and books, which at that time was considered the peak of scholarship, he also did everything to ensure that literacy spread to all segments of the population. </p><p>  Representatives of the clergy, at his direction, began to teach children the art of reading and writing.  The prince also opened the first school for boys, which was located in Novgorod.  In the XI century, this was a big event that turned people's ideas about life.  Buying books in large quantities, the prince gathered a huge library and handed it over to <span>St. Sophia Cathedral.</span>  Yaroslav the Wise is an example of a historical portrait of a ruler who constantly thought about the well-being of his subjects and contributed in every way to this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Introduction of translations </h2>

    <p>  He esteemed the wisdom of representatives of other powers, especially the thinkers of Ancient Greece amazed him.  Yaroslav ordered to translate their philosophical treatises, so that people who wanted to read them would use their native language, Slavic, thereby improving it and studying it more deeply.  Adhering to this principle, he laid the foundation for the destruction of the dependence of Russian scientists on the legacy of Byzantium.  And when the question arose about the appointment of a new metropolitan, he did not call him from abroad, as was customary before, but appointed his own, Illarion, from the simple Slavic village of Brest.  The church charter, Nomokanon, was also translated into their native language, as the prince had commanded.  To be the best, not to be afraid of changes - these are the character traits that the centuries-old historical portrait of Yaroslav the Wise has demonstrated.  The history of Russia did not know such rulers before. </p><h2>  The first handwritten law in Russia </h2>

Russian history" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/553826.jpg" width="230"></div>  Yes, Yaroslav the Wise also had a hand in this good and necessary work.  He stands at the origins of the creation of the most ancient Russian monument of jurisprudence - the "Charter" ("Russian Truth", or "Court of Yaroslavl").  Modern scholars unanimously declare that this is not a simple book written by the prince, not only his thoughts and thoughts, but a very deep work in the field of law, a whole collection of laws, orders and customs, operating in those distant times.  They said that in the creation of the collection the ruler was helped by private individuals.  But even if they wrote the Charter in full, Yaroslav‚Äôs contribution cannot be overestimated.  Since at least he patronized them, gathered them all under one roof, united them in one thing and brought it to the end - he published a collection.

He stood guard over the health and life of ordinary people, provided for financial compensation for the injuries and insults.  He recommended conducting an examination, searching for criminals in hot pursuit, checking false evidence - at this as yet an initial level of development of these components of the modern law enforcement system. </p><h2>  The heyday of Kiev </h2><p>  Yaroslav the Wise (1019-1054 - the years of his reign in Kiev) rules worthily.  During this period, the heyday of the state and the capital of ancient Russia - Kiev - fell.  The prince patronized religion.  He welcomed the construction of new temples and churches.  During his reign, the first monasteries began to be erected, among them the Kiev-Pechersky, known throughout the world.  Today it is the whole Lavra, which amazes with its beauty and luxury.  This is the center of religious life in Kiev. </p>

    <p>  Yaroslav also fortified this city with a huge rampart, turning it into a real fortress.  The south entrance was framed by gates, they were called "Golden" because of church domes.  Also in the center of this part of the city was built the Metropolitan Cathedral, known as St. Sophia.  These buildings in the long-standing capital of Russian cities have survived to this day in excellent condition.  They radiate the glory and power of our ancestors.  Millions of tourists come to Kiev every year to see these man-made wonders. </p><p>  Thanks to the prince, craft began to actively develop.  Masters from all over Russia gathered in Kiev and made a whole settlement here.  Now this place is called Podil.  The capital of the Russian principality reached the climax of development and caught up with European capitals such as London and Paris. </p><h2>  Foreign policy of the prince </h2>

    <p>  Yaroslav strengthened the borders of the principality, waged an active struggle with nomads.  When they reached the borders of his state, he gathered a squad and successfully repulsed the enemy‚Äôs attacks.  He was feared and respected.  Yaroslav was a very well-mannered and <span>intelligent man,</span> he was received in the most influential countries of Europe: Britain, France, Germany, Norway, Byzantium.  The rulers of these powers drank tea at the same table with him, communicated on equal terms and considered Russia a full-fledged, developed and strong state unit of that time. </p><h2>  Dynastic connections </h2><p>  Prince Yaroslav Vladimirovich the Wise, whose political portrait is described in every history textbook today, showed what valuable marriages were made to him, made from a representative of the royal houses of Europe.  This was also manifested in his illustrious wisdom.  He himself married the daughter of the Swedish king Ingigerda, who was baptized in Irina. </p><p>  His sons also made up a good party.  Izyaslav chose the sister of the Polish king, Igor - the princess of Germany, Svyatoslav - the Austrian princess, Vsevolod - the Greek princess from the Monomakh clan, from whom another famous Russian prince Vladimir Monomakh was born. </p><p>  The daughters of Prince Yaroslav settled even better.  Anastasia married the king of Hungary, Elizabeth - for the Norwegian ruler, Anna - for the French king.  As you can see, these dynastic ties further strengthened the position of Russia in the political and economic world arena.  And they showed all the European states the strength and power of our illustrious ancestors. </p><h2>  Establishment of the Russian Imperial House </h2>

    <p>  Dynastic policy was approved at the legislative level.  Alexander the Blessed was the beginning of the Russian Imperial House.  According to this decree, the royal family did not have the right to enter into unequal marriages.  This sought even greater development of the principality.  After all, ties with the royal houses of other powers only strengthened the position of Russia, since there was little sense from other unions.  Blood ties also helped to avoid wars, in the event of an enemy attack they provided active support and assistance, enriched the treasury and developed all spheres of the principality's life. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  What were the heirs of Yaroslav, the princes of ancient Russia?  Who are they?  Historical portraits show that the Wise did not have a worthy follower.  Not one of his sons could decisively follow in the footsteps of his father, therefore Russia did not see such a development in those distant years.  All the achievements of the prince gradually faded away, the pace of development slowed down, and then completely came to naught.  Dark medieval clock was approaching, Time of Troubles.  Russia seemed to be forgotten in a lethargic dream, waiting for a new strong and wise ruler. </p>
