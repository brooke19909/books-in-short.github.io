By car, you can drive it in one day. </p><h2>  Territorial division of the island </h2><p>  97.3% of the territory of the <span>island of Cyprus</span> belongs to the Republic of Cyprus, 2.7% - a British exclave, the territory of military bases.  In fact, the situation is different.  36% of the territory after the invasion of Turkish troops in 1974 began to belong to the self-proclaimed TRNC <span>(Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus).</span>  The legitimate authorities own 59%, 2.3% - the demarcation zone, which divides the island and is protected by the UN Armed Forces.  The population of the Republic of Cyprus is 866,000.  The main language is Greek.

    <p>  Northern Cyprus is an absolutely safe, tourist destination.  TRNC is an expensive resort and designed for organized tourists.  Unique ancient monuments of the time of the Crusaders, magnificent landscapes, mild climate - all this attracts tourists from all over the world.  It is best to visit Northern Cyprus in the spring - at this time the valleys of the island bloom with emerald green grass, numerous plants bloom in the mountains.  There are few tourists at this time, and there is an opportunity to enjoy the beauty of waking nature. </p><h2>  Cyprus Resorts </h2><p>  This fabulous island has many great resorts.  All of them have their own characteristics and are designed for different groups of vacationers.  Today we will tell you about them, and you will understand which one is most suitable for you. </p><h2>  Ayia Napa </h2><p>  If you prefer to visit nightclubs, discos during your holidays, then this place is right for you.  Its daytime appearance is misleading.  At first it may seem that this is a quiet and calm town, lost between plantations of fruits and vegetables.  With dusk, the city literally lights up with neon.  Nightclubs and discos, restaurants and pubs are full of youth.  And in the morning, all vacationers will again enjoy the silence and magnificent white sand beaches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You should not think that a <span>holiday in Cyprus, the</span> photo of which you can see in our article, is just aimless lying on the beach.

    <h2>  Cyprus in August </h2><p>  Summer has exceeded its half.  The hottest month is just around the corner.  Many people, naturally, are interested in the question, what is Cyprus in August?  In the last month of summer, the weather in Cyprus is almost no different from July - it is still hot and dry.  Daytime temperatures reach +40 degrees, and sometimes higher, at night a little more than +20.  More comfortable weather in the mountains.  It is not worth waiting for rains in Cyprus in August - this is a rather rare occurrence.  And there are practically no cloudy days.  However, due to the abundance of greenery and the sea breeze, the heat is well tolerated by the bulk of vacationers. </p><p>  Do not go to the beach from 12 to 16 hours.  This time is best spent at the indoor pool.  In August, the water in the sea warms to such an extent that it does not cool even at night, so vacationers bathe at any time of the day. </p><p>  These are not the most favorable weather conditions do not prevent August from becoming the height of the holiday season in Cyprus.  Vacationers from all over the world fill the hotels and beaches of the island.  But parents planning a vacation with their children should choose May or September.  The fact is that kids are much harder than adults to withstand extreme heat. </p><h2>  Cyprus - All Inclusive Vacations </h2><p>  Many novice travelers and tourists mistakenly believe that the all-inclusive system works only in five-star hotels.  Holidays in Cyprus, the photo of which can be seen on all travel agencies brochures, convincingly proves that even modest two-star hotels use this system quite successfully.  We are not in vain talking about these hotels.  The fact is that in Cyprus, hotel service is built in such a way that the service, even in low-class hotels, meets European standards. </p>
