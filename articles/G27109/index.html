Conformism and non-conformism</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Non-conformism is the denial of generally accepted rules and principles that have entrenched in a particular group or community.  But people who are adherents of this, one might say, lifestyle, not only do not agree with any provisions, they also offer their own vision of the situation.  However, first things first. </p><h2>  One against all </h2><p>  In simpler words, nonconformism is the choice of one‚Äôs own path, and not the adherence to the one put forward by society.  Such people do not accept what the crowd dictates.  And there are really a lot of examples of such personalities - they can be cited from the sphere of science, art, politics, culture, and simply from public life.  For example, the same Giordano Bruno, rejected by society, was a nonconformist.  Why?  Yes, because in his discoveries, like Galileo Galilei, he was ahead of time.  Society did not accept this, rejected that one, that the second scientist. </p>

    <h2>  The philosophy of non-conformism </h2><p>  Non-conformism is a position with a certain point of view.  And, accordingly, he has his own philosophy.  What does it consist of?  So, the first thing to note is that there are two types of nonconformism.  The first is normal, and the second is forced.  So, simple non-conformism is rejection, as well as disagreement with certain values ‚Äã‚Äãand norms that are dominant in society.  And the second, forced, is the pressure exerted on the individual by one or another social group.  In other words, the community of people, through its pressure, forces a person to deviate from their expectations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, to be dissenting and protesting against something is normal.  After all, it was these qualities that made the primitive man develop and progress.  Times have changed, but the principle of non-conformism is not.  At all times, adventurers, rebels and even outcasts were the ones behind the initiative of the revolution of all mankind. </p>

    <p>  Nonconformists are often called oppositionists.  This is because they do not follow generally accepted norms thoughtlessly - on the contrary, they are struggling with them.  This is their uniqueness.  A nonconformist is a person who does not abandon certain norms, he simply expresses a different opinion in relation to them. </p><h2>  Two opposites </h2><p>  Conformism and non-conformism are two interconnected concepts.  But the exact opposite.  So, conformism and non-conformism are often found in various social groups.  And mainly people who are supporters of one or another point of view can be found in a community of rather mundane psychological and social development.  Indeed, in fact, the more <span>versatile a person is,</span> the less non-conformism or conformism is inherent in him.  What is peculiar to him in this case?  This is free self-determination.  That is, these are those people who independently decide what to do and what not.  Not taking into account anyone‚Äôs opinion, trusting only their own feelings.  These are individuals who need to ensure that the result satisfies their expectations, and not refutes or approves the laws that have been established in society.  You can say - the golden mean. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Outcasts or just special? </h2>

    <p>  Nonconformism ... This in psychology also means a protest reaction to life.  ‚ÄúNot like everyone else‚Äù - this is how some supporters of this point of view often think.  In fact, that conformists, that non-conformists - all think the same way.  Why?  Because some think like everyone (the first), and the rest inside out, the other way around (the second). </p><p>  What is behavioral negativity?  Perhaps in the mind of a nonconformist.  He becomes such on purpose, with the goal of being and being considered not like the rest.  It often happens that such people become outcasts of society.  What kind of team will like that they are joined by a person who denies everything that they adhere to?  But there are those who behave this way not on purpose.  These are really their independent conclusions.  They really think differently.  They have completely different values, and they sincerely do not share other, more common.  We can say that such people have their own world. </p>

    <h2>  Creation </h2><p>  It should be noted that non-conformism in art is quite common.  And most aesthetes find this style quite attractive.  What is wrong with the fact that the creators (the most common non-conformism in painting) bring something of their own to art?  Thus it turns out to dilute it, not to let it stagnate and become banal, uninteresting.  This is really important.  Indeed, on the other hand, non-conformism can be regarded as an eternal search for something fresh, new.  So it turns out to expand the scope and own vision for certain things.  For example, the same art house, which due to stereotypes that have spread in society at the speed of light, can be quite attractive and interesting.  But adherents of this style are also a kind of non-conformists. </p><h2>  Conformists and nonconformists - is coexistence possible? </h2>

    <p>  It is safe to say that it is possible.  Although you will have to work hard both one and the other.  After all, both of these phenomena are associated with social contact.  Even a person who does not agree with the majority opinion and does not receive approval and support from them can make friends with conformists.  Often, such personalities are useful to the team.  Because it is nonconformists who are the generators of new, fresh ideas.  The opposite opinion is always important.  Firstly, for comparison.  Secondly, to develop another solution to a particular issue, provision.  One that would suit everyone.  To put it simply, nonconformists help to look at things with different eyes and make you think. </p><p>  And conformists, in turn, can teach such people to interact with others, without prejudice to their interests and <span>moral principles.</span>  The main thing is mutual desire. </p>
