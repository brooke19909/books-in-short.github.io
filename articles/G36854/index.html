    <h2>  How drummers appeared and who they were </h2><p>  In the mid-1920s, the USSR government headed for the industrialization of the country.  The management needed new enterprises, factories and plants.  The country was to develop in the technical, economic and industrial sphere. </p><p>  It was at this time that the first drummers appeared.  These people can be called true patriots.  They enthusiastically and with great zeal worked for the good of their homeland, not sparing themselves, overfulfilling production standards many times.  They had important goals: to increase labor productivity, to eliminate absenteeism and injuries.  Such people were set as an example to others, newspapers wrote about them, they were respected, they were invited to party congresses and meetings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="icon drummer communist labor variety" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/2197383.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Types of awards for workers </h2><p>  Let us consider in more detail the issue of the "Drummer of Communist Labor" icon.  His varieties were as follows: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúDrummer of the 9th Five-Year Plan‚Äù; </li><li>  ‚ÄúDrummer of the Five Five-Year Plan‚Äù; </li><li>  ‚ÄúDrummer of the 11th Five-Year Plan‚Äù; </li><li>  "Drummer 12 of the five-year period." </li></ul><p>  Often you can see the "Drummer of Communist Labor" badge without information about the five-year plan.  Such icons were very different in appearance, shape, color.  They were united only by the inscription and image of Lenin.  In the background there were drawings of a combine, tractor, construction site, sickle and hammer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Communist Labor Drummer Icon Description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/2197384.jpg"></div>

    <p>  On the back of each icon was stamped or engraved - a special sign of the manufacturer.  Depending on the year of manufacture and the plant itself, the label was different in both appearance and size. </p><h2>  Who relied on such badges </h2><p>  As already mentioned, to everyone who excelled at work.  They were collective farmers, workers of state farms, engineers, teachers, designers, miners, researchers, workers of enterprises and agricultural production ‚Äî all of them received the ‚ÄúDrummer of Communist Labor‚Äù badge.  The description of these awards was different. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Communist Labor Drummer Icon Description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/2197387.jpg"></div>
