    <h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  If you prefer huge multi-story hotels, then Villa Bonita in Budva is not your option.  But those who know how to appreciate the hospitality of the hosts who personally meet each guest, the delicious home-style cuisine and cozy atmosphere, will come from this hotel complex in real delight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Villa Bonita fully lives up to its name; it is a small four-story villa with thirteen rooms.  The hotel is designed in a traditional style combining simplicity, soothing colors and modern amenities.  Many of the guests in their reviews note that they would love to return here more than once. </p><p>  <span>Hotel Villa</span> Bonita (Montenegro / Budva) was built in the late nineties, but the last renovation was carried out recently - just five years ago.  This is evident in the new furniture, excellent textiles and flawless technology. </p><p>  The hotel complex Villa Bonita belongs to the "three rubles", that is, it has three stars.  However, his guests note that this is one of the best "triples" in the resort.  Therefore, you will not be able to book a room just before the trip, in the high season the apartments are booked for five to six months.  And this indicates the huge popularity of the hotel. </p><p>  If you focus on the reviews of tourists, then we can say that Villa Bonita 3 * is an excellent option for a budget tourist.  In addition, it is recommended for families and is perfect for young people who plan to spend only nights in the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  The location of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Since Montenegro is a relatively small country, it is difficult to find resorts and hotels located at a decent distance from the airport.  Therefore, Villa Bonita 3 * in Budva has a very convenient location relative to the city center and other resort areas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you have landed in Podgorica, then you will have to drive about sixty-five kilometers to the hotel, but from Tivat, where there is also an international airport, you will need to overcome only twenty-seven kilometers. </p><p>  It is nice that Villa Bonita is located a little distance from the old district of Budva, considered one of the most important attractions of the city.  Tourists arrive here in 10-15 minutes, because the distance is not more than one kilometer. </p><p>  If you want to explore the entire resort, you can use public transport.  Two hundred meters from Villa Bonita 3 * (Montenegro) is a bus stop.  Therefore, it will not be difficult for you to get to the center of Budva or the nearby coastal villages, where you can see a lot of interesting things and try national dishes. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  It is worth noting that Villa Bonita is located on the second coastline.  Hotel guests will have to cross the road to get to the beach.  It belongs to the category of sand and gravel and belongs to the municipality. </p><p>  A total of five hundred meters separating the hotel complex and the beach area, you can walk in seven minutes.  In addition, the road near the hotel is not very busy and does not cause its guests any problems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Slovenska Plazha beach stretches for more than one and a half kilometers.  There are relaxation areas with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Please note that they are only available for a fee. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Since Villa Bonita 3 * (Montenegro) in Budva belongs to small family hotels, there are not too many infrastructure facilities on its territory.  However, it is worth noting that most hotels in Montenegro have a limited territory and are not too actively involved in the development of infrastructure.  In the country, the tourism industry is only beginning to gain momentum, so the local hotel complexes are significantly different from the similar ones, for example, in Turkey or Egypt. </p><p>  You can always rent a car at the hotel.  It is very convenient to move around the resort and its environs, so many tourists are happy to take this opportunity.  In order not to worry about the safety of the car, hotel guests leave it in free parking.  It is equipped with a small number of seats, but problems associated with their shortage never arise. </p><p>  If necessary, guests can use the laundry facilities.  For a small surcharge included in the bill for accommodation, your items will be washed and ironed while you enjoy swimming in the sea or sunbathing on the beach. </p><p>  The hotel has one cozy restaurant twined with ivy and grapes.  It is very pleasant to spend time with a glass of wine or a delicious homemade dessert prepared by the caring hands of a local chef. </p>

    <h2>  The cost of rest at the hotel </h2><p>  Montenegro does not apply to countries where vacationing will become a ruin for the family budget.  Therefore, many of our compatriots <span>book hotels on their own</span> and purchase tickets.  However, it is still better to fly to Montenegro on a tour package. </p><p>  On average, the cost of a week-long stay at Villa Bonita for two with a flight from Moscow will cost you sixty thousand rubles.  This price includes airfare and breakfast.  If you plan to take half board, then in this case the ticket will be more expensive by about seven thousand rubles. </p><p>  Some tourists claim that if you wish, you can buy a tour to this hotel for fifty thousand rubles.  It is just necessary to follow the offers of tour operators and be ready to pay almost instantly. </p><h2>  Villa Bonita 3 *, Montenegro: reviews </h2><p>  About the holidays in this hotel on the Internet is disastrously little information.  This is quite typical for Montenegro, because it is just beginning to gain recognition among our compatriots. </p><p>  After analyzing the reviews found, we came to the conclusion that the hotel causes a lot of pleasant emotions.  People write warmly about him and dream of returning here again.  Among the advantages of Villa Bonita are the following: </p><ul><li>  the hosts speak excellent Russian; </li><li>  upon arrival, the owner is always greeted by a host with a delicious treat of meat, cheese and vegetables; </li><li>  on the day of check-in, a jug with homemade wine and a fruit basket are in the room; </li><li>  the cozy atmosphere of the hotel; </li><li>  high-quality cleaning of rooms; </li><li>  quick resolution of all issues; </li><li>  tasty, although not very diverse food. </li></ul><p>  It is interesting that almost all the guests noted how friendly they were received by Montenegro in the person of the hotel owner.  With him it was possible to agree on almost everything, and in many cases he even happily replaced the guide. </p><p>  Hotel Villa Bonita is a great option for a first exposure to Montenegro.  Here you will fully enjoy the national color and appreciate the hospitality of local residents. </p>
