Many manufacturers have taken the fashion of making glass cases.  It is worth dropping such a phone and instead of a beautiful device you get just broken glass.  And the main components of the smartphone may be damaged.  Repair will be very expensive.  For this reason, ‚Äúvandal-proof‚Äù phones were invented.  These are devices with a protected case and moisture protection.  Such smartphones are designed to work in harsh environments.  We will consider the most popular models of secure smartphones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gizmochina.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="anti-vandal phone" class="if uuid-3031784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3031784.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 1.  Ulefone Armor 2 </h2><p>  The first on the list is a device from a Chinese manufacturer called Ulefone Armor 2. This incredible smartphone has an excellent rugged case and IP76 protection against water.  But it also has very good technical specifications.  On board there is a productive eight-core processor, there are 6 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of memory on the internal drive.  At the same time, the smartphone supports working with Micro-SD memory cards and has an excellent camera.  And the smartphone has an incredibly large battery, which allows it to work for as long as 3 days without recharging.  And this is with its characteristics.  Indeed, Ulefone Armor 2 is one of the best anti-vandal phones in the world.  He will be able to work in almost any environment.  with it, you can even shoot under water.  And the price is very adequate.  This is one of the cheapest secure smartphones.  Therefore, it is very popular.  But this is by no means the most unkillable phone.  There are devices much stronger. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.fonearena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the most unkillable phone" class="if uuid-3031791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3031791.jpg"></div><h2>  Ulefone Armor 2 reviews </h2><p>  What do those who have already purchased this smartphone say?  Does it work well in real conditions?  Reviews of the owners of this miracle of technology will help to answer these questions.  The owners of this smartphone consider this product the most secure phone of those that exist on the modern market (except for push-button models).  Users note that this unit works quickly and clearly.  He does not care about temperature changes, water and dust.  Also, the device has shockproof properties.  And this is primarily the owners of this smartphone.  If you believe their comments, the build quality (and the materials themselves) is at the highest level.  Even though the phone was designed and assembled in China.  But most of all, users were pleased with the price of the device.  Many believed that it was unrealistic to buy a quality smartphone for that kind of money.  And they were wrong. </p><h2>  No. 2.  Protected smartphones from Land Rover </h2><p>  The best device from this company is considered to be the Land Rover X2 MAX.  This smartphone has an excellent protected case and boasts a very good performance.  The phone runs on Android OS 6.0 and has all the necessary features of a modern device.  It has a powerful processor, a decent amount of RAM, a good graphics accelerator, a set of necessary wireless interfaces, an excellent camera (albeit not dual), a capacious battery and support for LTE networks.  This device definitely belongs to the best representatives of its class.  The device feels great in the rain and wind, and also has a very strong case.  He is not afraid of falls and various troubles.  Because "Land Rover" and is considered one of the best anti-vandal phones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="most secure phone" class="if uuid-3031796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3031796.jpg"></div><h2>  Land Rover Reviews </h2><p>  The owners of these devices are not so many, since they are not particularly popular in our latitudes.  But they are.  And they leave feedback on the work of these gadgets.  It is worth noting immediately that the reviews are not unambiguous.  The vast majority of users like the protective properties of this smartphone.  They claim that the device shows itself perfectly in extreme conditions.  Falls are definitely not afraid of him.  Even if you drop it face down on the tile.  Also, many dropped him into the water.  And the smartphone continued to cheerfully work after that.  But users did not like the performance of the device.  Against the backdrop of more productive colleagues (even from the class of rugged smartphones), the Land Rover looks poor.  He barely pulls modern toys at low graphics settings.  And this is the weakest point of this unit.  Therefore, it is not considered the best phone in the "anti-vandal" version.  But he certainly is one of the best. </p><h2>  No. 3.  Devices from Ginzzu </h2><p>  The best protected model from this manufacturer is the Ginzzu R62.  This is a push-button telephone (in the best classical traditions).  The device is distinguished by the incredible strength of the case and confident reception anywhere.  Where ordinary smartphones are unable to catch the network, this phone finds it without difficulty.  A key feature of this unit is the presence of a walkie-talkie function.  For this, a special external antenna is included.  The case of the device is made of thick metal and equipped with buffer rubber inserts.  All openings are reliably protected by rubber caps.  The back cover is screwed to the case with strong and not fake screws.  Another feature of the phone is autonomy.  He is able to work 6 days on a single battery charge.  A very useful thing when traveling.  There is a camera too.  But very weak.  Only 1.3 megapixels.  It is definitely one of the best secure push-button phones in the world.  And this is an indisputable fact. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="buyon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="land rover x2 max" class="if uuid-3031811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3031811.jpg"></div><h2>  Ginzzu Reviews </h2><p>  The owners of this device claim that the phone copes with its basic responsibilities perfectly.  Thanks to him, users are always in touch.  For many of them, the coolest features of the phone are the ability to find the network everywhere and a decent time without recharging.  And users consider this device the most unkillable phone.  And they are absolutely right.  This device is not afraid of drops, temperature drops, immersion in water and other things of the same plan.  At the same time, users liked the built-in option that allows you to turn the device into a full-fledged walkie-talkie.  This is very useful when traveling in the event that there is no Internet access and all online services operating on the basis of the walkie-talkie are not available.  This phone is perfect for lovers of extreme travel or people who have a dangerous job. </p><h2>  Number 4.  Blackview BV9000 </h2><p>  High-quality protected smartphone from the manufacturer originally from the Middle Kingdom.  It differs not only in a strong waterproof case, but also in a huge battery (10,000 mAh).  At the same time, the smartphone has a very powerful hardware platform.  A powerful eight-core processor, 6 gigabytes of RAM, a decent-sized internal drive, a powerful graphics coprocessor, all the necessary wireless interfaces and sensors are installed on board the device.

And if you take into account the cost of the gadget, it turns out that this is one of the cheapest secure smartphones.  Therefore, it is incredibly popular even in domestic latitudes.
