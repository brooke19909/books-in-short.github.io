    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  <span>Motorola C350</span> mobile phone at the time of release has replenished the segment of low-cost equipment.  It is an updated version of the already well-known C33X series.  An innovative development has become a color screen.  Other characteristics remained the same.  The device is designed to work with standard networks - GSM 900/1800.  It is equipped with GPRS (data transfer) technology. </p><p>  Of course, now such a device has long been considered obsolete.  However, about 13 years ago, he made a splash in the mobile phone market.  The manufacturer, when releasing this model, made the main emphasis on polyphonic sound and a color screen.  Buyers enthusiastically accepted the new product.  Demand for the Motorola C350 in those years was quite large. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="motorola s350 ringtones" class="if" height="469" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1569609.jpg" width="434"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  "Motorola S350", a photo of which can be viewed in the article, is a monoblock.  To make the case, plastic was used.  The device weighs only 80 g. Its dimensions: 101 √ó 42 √ó 19 mm.  The surface of the case has a silver tint.  However, in fairness it should be noted that after a few months of operation, the deposition begins to gradually fade. </p><p>  The form of the apparatus is classic.  It is practically no different from its predecessors.  It‚Äôs convenient to hold the phone in your hand, it does not slip.  Many buyers claim that at first glance there is confidence in quality and reliability. </p><p>  On the front side there is a small screen and a full keyboard.  It looks quite impressive, since the button coating is metallized.  Originally made the main control keys.  They are arranged in an oval shape.  This gives the phone originality.  The speaker hole is divided into two halves, as the company logo flaunts in the middle.  A model index is printed under the numeric keypad.  There is also a small microphone hole.  A significant advantage is the presence of removable panels.  As in previous versions, you can use cases of various shapes.  The back panel is not informative.  On it you can see only the company logo and speaker, the hole of which is made in the form of flower petals. </p><p>  Given the design features, the manufacturer positioned the model as a youth.  However, due to its solid appearance, the target audience was buyers of the age category 25-35 years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="telephone motorola s350" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1569618.jpg" width="600"></div>

It makes no sense to compare it with modern smartphones, since its resolution is only 96 √ó 64.  The screen is capable of transmitting only 4096 colors.  The picture on the display is grainy, the quality is quite low.  On the street in sunny weather the screen fades, it is almost impossible to read information.  But the level of contrast can be attributed to the merits.  The C350 model is one of the few on which icons and font are well displayed even with the backlight turned off, subject to good lighting in the room.  Most competing devices do not have this capability. </p><h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  The Motorola S350 phone is equipped with a standard keyboard.  It has a full-fledged digital unit, two soft-keys for control, buttons responsible for calling and resetting the call.  The highlight of this model is the ‚Äúarrows‚Äù designed to scroll and open the menu.  They are located crosswise, and the overall composition has the shape of an oval. </p><p>  The keyboard consists of a rubber backing covered with a plastic film and plastic keys.  The appearance of the latter is made of metal.  There are no comments from buyers.  All buttons are well pressed without making noise or rattling.  The keyboard is perfectly fixed in the slots.  In a word, using the device is very convenient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Motorola S350 photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1569646.jpg" width="255"></div>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Are customers satisfied with the battery life of the Motorola S350?  The battery has a capacity of 650 mAh.  Its type is lithium-ion.  The time to fully charge the battery is two and a half hours.  During testing, he showed the following results.  In standby mode, without recharging, the device will work for about a week.  And with a continuous conversation, the battery lasts only 3.5 hours. </p><p>  Unfortunately, these indicators are difficult to attribute to the category of advantages, since similar models of other brands, for example, Nokia, can offer significantly more battery life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Motorola S350 battery" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1569641.jpg" width="373"></div>

    <h2>  Menu </h2><p>  Describing the model of Motorola S350 phone, it is necessary to dwell on such a section as the menu.  Those who have never used this brand, at first it will be unusual.  In all models of this manufacturer, the menu is called by a special button.  It is located in the center and is surrounded by scroll arrows. </p><p>  The buyer will not see any changes in the design of the menu.  It is quite typical.  Due to the fact that a lot of minor options are included in it, the list is quite long.  The font and display method has not changed at all.  Unfortunately, this, according to many buyers, is a very significant minus.  The menu itself is too confusing and complicated.  It is immediately worth noting that it will take a long time to understand it.  And this does not add optimism to people who want to buy a convenient telephone in use for their money. </p><h2>  Functions </h2><p>  What features is this model equipped with?  Let's take a quick look at the standard set. </p><ul><li>  <em>Phone book.</em>  You can save up to 100 numbers in the device's memory.  There is a shortcut option (called "code + #").  It is possible to divide subscribers into four categories.  An indisputable advantage is that under each record you can save more than one number. </li><li>  <em>Messages</em>  This menu item contains standard functions.  These are drafts, inbox and outbox folders, voicemail, Cell Broadcast, missed, settings, and WAP. </li><li>  <em>Challenges</em>  Call information is displayed here. </li><li>  Call style.  One more mode in the Motorola S350 device.  You can choose different ringtones for subscribers, change the notification method or volume level. </li><li>  <em>Office.</em>  In this folder are the calendar, clock, alarm and calculator. </li><li>  <em>Parameters.</em>  Here you can change the phone settings. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="standard melodies of motorola s350" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1569617.jpg" width="446"></div></li></ul><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The sound of this phone is of low quality - 16-ton polyphony.  The speaker through which the signal is played is located on the rear panel.  Unfortunately, its volume is not strong enough.  Also, it is significantly reduced if you put the device in a bag or pocket.  For calls, you can set the standard ringtones "Motorola S350."  Transferring them to other phones is not provided.  If you want to change the list, you will need to change the firmware. </p><p>  The speaker is not bad.  The interlocutor's speech is recognizable, there are no noises and wheezing.  The volume can be changed directly during a conversation. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Motorola S350 is an excellent telephone that is fully consistent with its value.  Many buyers highlight significant advantages.  This is high quality and reliability.  Even after the fall, the device functions perfectly.  There are no comments on the battery operation.  For four years, the battery life does not decrease.  Reception of a network of a mobile operator at altitude.  In places where other similar phones do not catch the signal, you can always be in touch with the Motorola C350. </p><p>  However, there were some shortcomings.  Owners' comments relate to screen sizes (too small), low ring volume, poor-quality housing (scuffs quickly form), a complicated menu, and small keys. </p>
