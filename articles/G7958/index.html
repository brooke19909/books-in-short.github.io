This is not only a solidly made and assembled case, but also an improved display and camera.  In the very first days of its appearance, the device was raw, which is typical of every new product.  However, the manufacturer has already taken into account many errors, released patches that improved the system, so that now the buyer has access to a high-quality device that can no doubt be compared with many flagship models. </p><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  The new Nexus phone received the classic forms of the familiar candy bar equipped with a touch screen.  Two types of models appeared on sale - with a black and white body.  If the dimensions of the phone as a whole have not changed compared to the previous version of the line, then the diagonal of the screen has slightly increased, which means that the frames around it have become thinner.  If you look closely at the news from other manufacturers of smartphones, you can see the general trend in such a "narrowing". </p>

    <p>  In order for the screen to be protected from grease and fingerprints, it was coated with a special <span>oleophobic coating</span> with a thickness of a nanometer.  It consists of silicone and is considered an innovative development used in smartphones of some other manufacturers.  Glass is tempered so as not to break when dropped.  But the bordering frame does not protrude in any way and remains at the same level with the glass, therefore it cannot provide additional protection.  Nevertheless, with careful use, there is nothing to be afraid of for a Nexus phone.  Above the glass in the upper left corner is a chamber peephole.  A bit to the right, exactly in the middle, is the grid from the speaker, through which sound is transmitted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Edges and back panel </h2><p>  There is a key on each side.  One is responsible for volume, the other for power.  Designers made sure that the only buttons on the device are not erased from prolonged use.  Of the many solutions, the most obvious was chosen - they were made ceramic.  It is difficult to leave scratches on them, even with nails. </p><p>  The ends are equipped with the usual ports for this place - openings for headphones and a microphone, and below the USB port, with which the Nexus phone can be connected to a computer. </p><p>  A slight rounding is felt on the sides of the back of the device.  But in front, the case is deliberately angular and pointed.  Perhaps someone will not like this, because over time, such edges can rub.  To get rid of this annoying feeling, just buy a good cover.  It will not only protect the device, but also help the owner to feel more comfortable when interacting with the gadget. </p>

    <p>  The back cover is made of soft plastic coating.  It is pleasant to the touch and is an innovation for LG, on the devices of which it has not yet met.  The shape is made rounded so that the phone is easily and conveniently held in hands.  And this is true, especially since its size is quite compact. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>The Nexus phone</span> has an embossed lettering on the back with the model designation.  There you can find the lens of the main camera, protected by glass.  Under it is a high-quality flash that allows you to take pictures in the dark.  Technical information is provided below as well as the LG logo. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  A feature of the Nexus series is that each new smartphone in this line gets another sophisticated version of the Android operating system.  This time it's version 4.4 of KitKat. </p>

    <p>  The interface has remained simple and adheres to minimalism, there is nothing superfluous here that could distract the user from the task that he solves with the device.  At the same time, as mentioned above, the most modern and wide functionality is preserved.  This combination of simplicity and versatility cannot fail to bribe the potential owner.  So the LG Nexus phone continues the tradition of its flagship product line. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  It is expected that Google will support its new smartphone for a couple of years.  That is, all this time updates and firmware will be released.  But even after this period, the Google Nexus phone will remain relevant and will be able to work with the new software.  The hardware platform of the model is based on the experience of the entire line and includes the features of LG G2. </p>

    <p>  But in terms of autonomy, the device has all the typical costs of its analogues.  Charging will have to be saved, especially when using applications and games.  With a large processor overload, the case starts to overheat, which, however, does not affect the smoothness of the screen and image quality.  But you still have to take the charger with you, just in case. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The sound quality on the call dynamics is of a satisfactory average level, but the manufacturer has already promised that an update will soon be released to improve this parameter.  With headphones, things are better, although, of course, the headset factor is added here.  If it is good, then there should be no problems. </p><h2>  Video and display </h2><p>  The LG Nexus 5 phone received support for large files (i.e. more than 4 gigabytes).  This means that moviegoers can breathe a sigh of relief and boldly go to the store for a novelty.  High quality films are now not only available for viewing, but are also played without any braking or ‚Äúcrashes‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  Unlike previous models, the next Nexus boasts less color distortion, increased brightness, and improved anti-glare characteristics.  The image is accurately transmitted even in bright sunshine.  The Nexus mobile phone received many of these advantages due to the fact that there is no more free space left between the sensor and the matrix - a small layer of air inherent in the previous smartphones of this line as well as in general.  True, the black color fades noticeably at an angle, but this is an inevitable drawback characteristic of many analogues. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Regular customers of previous versions of Nexus constantly complained about the camera in the device.  It‚Äôs not that she was a hack, but the developers never paid attention to her and added as a mandatory additive that was not of technical interest.  So it turned out that the image quality did not reach the level of analogues from other manufacturers. </p>

    <p>  But now the situation has changed 180 degrees.  The camera received its 8 megapixels, and now this is another advantage that the Nexus phone has.  The purchase price fully justifies all the technical tricks, including those that are stored somewhere under the lens. </p><p>  Photos get good quality.  This is especially noticeable in terms of night shooting or when capturing small details in the shade.  The camera has become noticeably more sensitive.  When shooting video, all these advantages are striking even more. </p>
