It is not by chance that he enjoys crazy popularity with tourists.  Its snow-white beaches, a huge number of historical attractions and a long swimming season are only a small part of what travelers expect here. </p><p>  Turkey has long been a popular tourist destination for residents of many countries, and Russia is no exception in this regard.  In this regard, the resort areas of the country are well prepared - the tourism infrastructure is well developed, the cost of the tour is often quite affordable, and the swimming season is quite long (from July to September, the weather in Kusadasi is perfect for the beach). </p><p>  The Kusadasi area is also popular because it houses the most famous fashionable hotels.  One of them is My Aegean Star Hotel 4 *. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  My Aegean Star Hotel is an all-inclusive 4-star hotel.  It was built recently, in 2012, and that is why it can safely boast of new plumbing and other engineering networks (tourists will not encounter spoiled wiring and rusty taps). </p>

At the top of the hill there is an observation deck, from where an amazing view of the surroundings opens. </li><li>  Kaleici Mosque (7 km).
