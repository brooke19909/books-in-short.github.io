In fact, various dragons and dinosaurs occupy a separate role in the modern world: they are not only frequent guests of various horror films, but also the beloved heroes of the younger generation of boys and girls.  Of course, what could be better than an unknown flying creature who is definitely not afraid of any obstacles? </p><h2>  Exhaling flame </h2>

    <p>  Little fans of big dragons undoubtedly dream of a home version that could be put on a shelf and even shown to friends.  Then we will tell you how to mold a dragon with your own hands without spending much effort.  What needs to be said before the creative process is irreversible: there are several materials that can be used.  Firstly, this is plasticine - raw materials that are used even in kindergarten, focusing only on its inedibility. </p><p>  It's very easy to create with him.  And if we talk about the process itself, then this is one sheer pleasure, especially when it comes to children and their motor skills.  Plasticine lacks the temperature of the hands that he receives during work, and it is very simple to create different small figures with it.  But a plasticine dragon will not serve you for long.  Indeed, a slight increase in temperature affects its resistance and strength. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Polymer clay molding for beginners </h2>

    <p>  If we are already talking about polymer clay, then it will have to tinker a bit.  The fact is that this material is more capricious and demanding in the process of molding and after it.  But with confidence we can say that a clay dragon will definitely serve you for a long time if it is processed correctly.  This material is usually divided into two categories: self-freezing, which you just need to leave for a whole day in the fresh air, and baked in the oven. </p><p>  Usually the last process takes no more than half an hour and is much faster than the first option, but requires preliminary preparation.  In addition, when it comes to brightness and color palette, polymer clay is in no way inferior to plasticine: modern product markets present a huge number of color and white options that can be further painted and varnished. </p><h2>  Tools at hand </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="polymer clay modeling for beginners" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2002300.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  In order for the modeling of the dragon to bring only positive impressions and emotions, it is necessary to prepare all the materials in advance.  In our case, this process will not do without additional purchases, but the main part can still be found in every home: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Stacks.  These small sticks are indispensable when working with plasticine, as they provide thorough elaboration of the product.  You can buy them in a store where their choice is huge, but you can find them at home without spending a single extra ruble.  For example, an ordinary ballpoint pen, which has served on the written front, copes with eye holes and small dents perfectly.  To create a texture you can use an old toothbrush or an iron sponge.  Fine lines are perfectly created with a toothpick or a sharp pencil. </li><li>  Plasticine or polymer clay.  The choice of these materials is truly huge and does not end long on sets with dull colors of the color of sadness and longing.  Real sellers provide a huge selection of products for buyers of different skill levels and wallet thicknesses.  So the question of how to blind a dragon, or rather, from which, the answer you can find only yourself. </li><li>  The final coverage.  In order for the image of our hero to look bright and juicy, you will need to use a coating that gives expressiveness to the toy.  The regular base nail polish without sparkles and nacre perfectly copes with this role.  He will make the colors brighter and give durability to your product.  But it is important to clarify that the plasticine dragon does not need such an addition. </li></ul><h2>  Preparation for the sculpting process </h2>

    <p>  Little is known how to mold a dragon from one or another material.  In order to start making this creature, you need to perform some actions in advance, which will now be carefully considered: </p><ol><li>  We clean the work surface from foreign objects that may interfere with further work. </li><li>  We put all the necessary stacks, sticks and scissors on the table, pre-treating them with cleaning products. </li><li>  For beginners, sculpting from polymer clay is a puzzling process.  Therefore, beginners should stock up on a pair of medical gloves.  This step will protect your product from greasy stains and unnecessary fingerprints. </li></ol><h2>  Modeling </h2><p>  It's time to start the process of creating a dragon from clay.  There will be one description for different materials, but during the whole time additional comments will be added related to this or that product.  For convenience, all actions will be described step by step: </p><ol><li>  To begin with, we should create a body for our dragon.  It is identical to a trapezoid with rounded edges.  Next, we insert a toothpick into the finished part, tightly fixing it.  In the future, this will help us attach subsequent parts without damaging them. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="clay dragon" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2002303.jpg" width="500"></div></li><li>  We make the legs and arms of our character, carefully marking them with nails and bends.  These parts resemble droplets in shape and are easily attached to the body without much effort.  In addition, to add detail, we make nails from white plasticine or clay and fix them in the previously designated cavities. </li><li>  It's time to mold the creature‚Äôs head: for this, we form a ball that has a certain resemblance to a rugby ball.  With the help of home-made or purchased stacks, we make eye sockets, pressing well in the right places.  Yellow color is perfect for the eyes, making them significantly more expressive, and black serves as a pupil.  We place our eyes in the intended cavities and fix them there with a light pressure.  We make nostril cuts.  As a complement, you can add various spines and spikes.  We place the head on the body, carefully putting it on a toothpick. </li><li>  We create wings and tail, giving them the desired shape, and then fix it on the body. </li><li>  At this stage, the plasticine figurine can be considered finished, and <span>clay modeling</span> for beginners is still ongoing: bake the dragon in the oven at a certain temperature or leave it to freeze on its own. </li><li>  After complete solidification, we cover the muzzle with a final layer of nail polish. </li></ol><h2>  At least on the shelf </h2><p>  Now we know how to blind a dragon and spend time with pleasure.  And the result of all the work is a craft that can be a wonderful toy, figurine or just a gift for loved ones. </p>
