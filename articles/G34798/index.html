In general, the choice of any <span>gadget for a child</span> is not an easy task.  And if the topic is about school and learning, many parents just get stuck.  Especially when it comes to the phone or tablet.  At an older age, a child is easier to choose a gadget.  Often a teenager himself will say what he needs.  But it‚Äôs very difficult for young children to find the best tablet (for a schoolchild, elementary grades).  Now we will find out what to look for when choosing a particular model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet for student" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/967231.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Character Features </h2><p>  The first thing to consider is the nature of your baby.  Without them, choosing a tablet for a student is very difficult.  Especially when you expect that this device will be not only educational, but also a game, and a developing tool.  In this case, it is quite difficult to find a middle ground. </p><p>  Depending on the temperament of the young schoolchild and his penchant for addictions, one will have to give preference to one or another model.  For example, you should not take a ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù gadget with a bunch of opportunities and games if there is a chance that the child will abandon his studies and bury himself in toys.  It only hurts academic performance.  Tablets for students are not just games.  On the contrary, this technique should be used precisely for educational purposes.  If the child can calmly limit himself to entertainment on his own or by observation, you can buy a more expensive and modern model.  The line here is very thin, and only parents can catch it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Price </h2><p>  Tablets for students, like any other gadgets, have different prices.  Choosing a particular model usually comes from the family budget.  Only here often parents want to buy a child both the best and the cheapest.  This is hard to do. </p><p>  In general, the price of a tablet for a <span>primary school</span> student should not exceed approximately 7,000 rubles.  This is based on the fact that after 3-4 years you will buy a new gadget.  Newer and more powerful.  If you buy equipment "for centuries", it is worth a little money.  After all, a good powerful tablet costs about 10-15 thousand rubles. </p><p>  No need to overpay for a brand or advertisement.  Try to pay attention to cheaper options, and then study the reviews about these or those models.  Maybe the price will not be an indicator of quality.  This often happens.  So, you should not expect that the most expensive thing for your child will also be the best and highest quality. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  An important characteristic is the dimensions of the device.  Tablets for schoolchildren and adults, in principle, do not differ in this parameter.  Only here, children, as practice has shown, it is more convenient to handle small models. </p>

    <p>  But the needs of kids often require a large screen.  Sometimes you can make such sacrifices.  Especially if the child is initially very careful with gadgets.  In this case, the probability that he will break an expensive device is small.  The ideal tablet for the student is 8 inches across the screen.  But in the case of the game option, you will have to find a diagonal of 10.1 inches.  And it‚Äôs good if a special stand is attached to such a device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Among other things, it is important to pay attention to the weight of the gadget.  A tablet for a student of 10 years and older usually weighs from 620 grams.  But for a younger school, models weighing from 500 to 600 grams are suitable.  It is not necessary to take heavier ones - it will be difficult to work with such a device.  Sometimes even an adult will refuse such an option. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Of course, in any modern gadget there should be a camera.  Without it, a tablet or phone loses its relevance.  So this point will still have to be given due attention.  It‚Äôs not so easy to choose a tablet for a student.  With the expectation of several years - and even more so. </p>

    <p>  The camera on the children's tablet should be at least 5 megapixels.  If the child does not have a good smartphone, you can stop on models with 10-12 megapixels.  With all this, it is desirable that the device has a front camera.  What kind of quality it will be - not so fundamentally. </p><p>  A tablet for a high <span>school</span> student (and junior ones too) can sometimes help you write down your homework.  Simply use a good camera - and you can not record anything in a notebook.  All data will always be at hand.  So, the better the quality of the camera, the greater the likelihood that the child will begin to fully use it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  This indicator is extremely important.  Launched applications and games depend on it.  So, the operating system plays an important role in shaping the functionality of gadgets.  Tablets for students of all ages should be "fast." </p><p>  It is best to choose models based on Android.  This is the so-called golden mean, which helps parents give their child multifunctional, useful and entertaining equipment at the same time.  The OS version is not so critical - usually it is updated using a special interface.  "Android" allows you to run all the latest news applications and games.  Just what children and adults need. </p>

    <p>  Windows is less popular.  In truth, tablets of this type for schoolchildren and adults are not very often chosen by customers.  After all, it is much more logical sometimes (especially by comparing prices) to buy a full-fledged laptop or netbook than a tablet.  But as an option to consider this system is worth it.  In general, it is up to you to choose the final operating system.  Nevertheless, in practice, as already mentioned, it is better to give preference to the familiar Android and to everyone. </p><h2>  Space </h2><p>  A tablet for a student (and the child as a whole) is not only a learning tool.  Often, this gadget more plays the role of an expensive modern toy.  And space is very important for her.  The more it is, the better.  Only there must be a limit. </p><p>  It is better to choose a tablet with 16 or 32 GB of free space.  Of course, the gadget should be able to connect a special memory card.  The maximum allowable volume is on average 64 GB.  Enough to download many modern games and programs.  But basically they will all be entertaining than educational in nature. </p><p>  If you suspect that the child will become addicted to a tablet, you will have to pay attention to models with 8 GB of free space.  Sometimes even without the ability to connect a memory card.  This solution will not allow you to overload the device with games that so interfere with the learning of kids! </p>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  It is also important to pay attention to the processor of the device.  Often, it is its power that affects the cost.  And sometimes it‚Äôs more logical to buy a more expensive and powerful model for your child than the first tablet that came to hand.  But there is a limit to everything.  And some processors are even called gaming.  It is better not to give such models to a child who does not yet know the measure.  Harm his academic performance, make the kid lose all interest in learning. </p><p>  The thing is that, in principle, a tablet for a student is also suitable for a dual-core processor with a clock frequency of 1.5-1.9 GHz.  But often 4-core models with the same capacity are chosen.  This is normal.  If your child asks for a tablet for 4 or 8 cores with a frequency of 2-2.1 GHz, then most likely he is already thinking over what games he will launch on it.  After all, you will be dealing with a real gaming tablet.  It is not very suitable for training. </p><h2>  RAM </h2><p>  The next thing to consider is the amount of RAM.  On a <span>gaming tablet,</span> it averages 3-4 GB.  Quite normal performance.  Sometimes even computers do not have such power.  But here the tablet for the student, and even the elementary grades, should be less powerful.  Indeed, in this case, you do not have to constantly monitor the flow of downloaded games and applications. </p><p>  In general, 1 GB of memory will be sufficient.  If you buy a gadget with the prospect in mind, you can pay attention to the model with 2 gigabytes of RAM.  But no more.  Indeed, in this case, the child will begin to understand that he has in his hands a tool not just for learning, but also for entertainment.  And, of course, the student will mostly have fun with this device.  In this case, it is extremely difficult, sometimes impossible, to tear off children from technology. </p>

    <h2>  Parental control </h2><p>  The last important and very useful point is the presence of the so-called <span>parental control.</span>  It is preferable to choose the model of tablets (and even phones) in which this function is present.  It will once again protect the child from inappropriate content.  And games including. </p><p>  In principle, if you trust your young student, then you can do without this option.  But reinsurance once again does not hurt.  With parental controls, you can easily introduce restrictions on some virtual resources.  And they will no longer harm learning.  What specific tablet model to choose?  In truth, there is no definitive answer.  It all depends on your personal decision.  Ask for advice in the store - you will definitely be shown all the tablets that are suitable for your requirements.  And among them it is already worth determining. </p>
