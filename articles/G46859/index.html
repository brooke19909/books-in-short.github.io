Having visited one of them, you will get a lot of pleasure. </p><h2>  Grand Hotel Oka (Nizhny Novgorod): reviews </h2><p>  To have a complete picture of the Oka Hotel, let's turn to the reviews of people who managed to visit this place.  I would like to note that almost all the guests are satisfied with the rest in the complex, with the exception of minor comments. </p><p>  For those who plan to visit the Oka, we want to remind you that it has two buildings of different categories, so this point should be considered when considering different hotels in Novgorod.  You can have an inexpensive rest in the Oka Business 3 * building.  According to some visitors, not all rooms in this part of the complex have air conditioning, which is inconvenient in the summer. </p><p>  On weekends, during events held on site, music is very audible until late at night. </p><p>  The apartments are equipped with modern furniture, there are detergents, a minibar and dishes, but there is no kettle.  The situation is saved by a water cooler in the halls on each floor.  The cleaning is good, the staff is friendly.  The food in the Oka restaurant is tasty and good, but perhaps not entirely cheap.  A nice bonus for guests is the opportunity to visit the fitness club for free.  He is worth a visit.  Yes, and the spa is recommended to visit those who have already managed to use its services. </p><p>  The guests of the city have no complaints about the Oka Premium building.  Very nice place to stay.  The rooms are clean and new, it is clear that the cleaning is done at the proper level.  The hotel‚Äôs bonus program allows guests of the building to visit the spa and fitness center for free.  Taking advantage of such a pleasant offer, all guests are very pleased with the services, noting the massages of specialists from Bali and the pool, bowling. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ok business" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1371938.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for food, as a rule, guests speak warmly about the Royal restaurant with a beautiful view of Novgorod.  The Oka Hotel is especially noted as a business center for business events.  Indeed, everything here is well thought out and equipped.  As they say, you can work, and relax, and eat.  There is no need to go anywhere else.  Everything is in one place.  By the way, conducting business events here has already become very commonplace.  The staff is well prepared to organize such services. </p><p>  The hotel has a very convenient location.  Nearby is a park, and a traffic intersection will allow you to get to any part of the city on business.  If you came just to relax, then in general there is no better place.  After day trips around the city, you can relax in the hammam, enjoy the treatments in the spa, swim in the pool, and then visit one of the restaurants and the entertainment center.  All the most interesting and useful is inside the hotel.  So, there is no need to leave its territory in search of entertainment.  Moreover, the bonus visit to all places in the hotel initially makes it possible to evaluate the level of service, prompting guests to go to the spa center or fitness club more than once. </p>
