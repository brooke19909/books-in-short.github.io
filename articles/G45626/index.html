    <p>  And of course, a SLR camera - thanks to which we can adjust the <span>depth of field,</span> have fast focus and shoot with pleasure in dimly lit places.

It is not as difficult as it may seem.  Having studied all the principles below, you can learn how to photograph with a reflex camera or any other type of lens. </p><h2>  Technique: Professional Tips </h2><p>  The color scheme is what you need to pay attention to right away.  If you want to take a photo of the whole family, then it‚Äôs good if the colors of their clothes will be combined (as in the photo below).

Appearance is also of great importance: if you <span>do not pay attention</span> to a careless haircut, then the camera will do it for you.  In those cases when photographing women, pay attention to whether <span>makeup is</span> applied in the <span>right</span> way. </p>

    <p>  If there is someone wearing glasses in the picture, then you can ask him to turn his head so that there are no glare on the glasses.

    <p>  In addition, the background is important.  If the subject is on the background of poles or wires, then a good frame will not work.  The background must be chosen so that all attention is focused on the subject.  This means that the person being photographed must be in contrast with the background.  In a closed room, you can try to photograph a person against the background of indoor plants or busy with some usual thing.  The light surface of the walls is also suitable.  If there is no suitable background, then you can practice in <span>portrait shooting,</span> as in this case it will turn out to make the background blurry.  You can also use the special focus mode, if available in the camera. </p><h2>  How to learn to photograph professionally?  Pose selection </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to learn to take pictures professionally for free" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23824/513045.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><p>  In the event that a person has very rounded facial features, you can choose such an angle so that the lighting falls on only half the face.  The part with less light should be rotated towards the camera lens.  In addition, very often novice amateur enthusiasts make one mistake related to the incorrect setting of hands.  If the hands are placed along the body, then this does not look very nice.  It is better to keep the hands in the usual position for a person. </p><h2>  How to take pictures with a SLR camera? </h2><p>  Today, the question of how to learn how to professionally take pictures with a reflex camera is very relevant.  If you carefully read the material above, and try to put it into practice, then using a SLR camera to photograph you will be much easier.  Good luck! </p>
