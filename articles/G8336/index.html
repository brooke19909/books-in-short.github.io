Nevertheless, to diversify their leisure, tourists will have to pay.  Prices for excursions are quite high, which is clearly a big drawback of the camp site.  So, the minimum cost starts at 3,000 rubles, and ends with a mark of 30,000 (usually the cost is shared between members of the group). </li><li>  Inconvenient catering.  A small cafe located in the base offers a meager selection of food.  The dishes prepared here are really tasty, but you will have to pay for them. </li><li>  Bad connection.  In order to reach the ‚Äúoutside‚Äù world, you will have to use a specially designated place.  Mobile communications do not catch throughout the camp site. </li></ul><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The cost of living in the camp ‚ÄúStone Mushrooms‚Äù in Altai depends on the type of accommodation you choose.  One of the most economical options is to stay in a summer house, overnight in which does not exceed the amount of 300 rubles per night.
