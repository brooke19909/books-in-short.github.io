Among them, a special place is occupied by the Bead Temple located in Bakhchisarai.  It is known for unusual decoration and decorations that were made by monks and parishioners of beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="of-crimea.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bead Temple in Bakhchisarai" class="if uuid-3064213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3064213.jpg"></div><h2>  History of the cloister </h2><p>  Unfortunately, history has not kept the exact date of the appearance of the monastery on this earth.  There is a version that in the VI-XVIII centuries, monks settled here who fled from Constantinople due to church persecution.  They managed to build a rock monastery here, which was later destroyed during an earthquake. </p><p>  In 1778, most Christians from Crimea were resettled, and the monastery remained abandoned for many years.  Saint Innocent, who was a real ascetic, in the 19th century made a great contribution to the revival of Orthodox monasteries on the peninsula.  He was sure that Crimea is very reminiscent of another Christian shrine - Athos.  It was thanks to his efforts that the monastery was restored, the territory was landscaped.  The church of St.  Anastasia and paved road. </p><p>  In 1932 the monastery was closed, like most religious buildings in our country.  He was revived in 2005.  An important role in this was played by the monk Dorofei and his associates.  A new temple of the Anastasia the Solvers was founded in an abandoned cave, which soon became known as Biserny. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Saint Anastasia </h2><p>  Anastasia the Decourer, whose name was consecrated the Bead Temple, was born in Rome.  Her father was a pagan, and her mother secretly professed Christianity.  Anastasia adopted the religion of her mother and devoted her life to serving God.  This girl was very beautiful, but refused to all her grooms, taking a vow of virginity.  When it became known about her religion, the pagans presented her with an ultimatum: she had to renounce religion or die.  To the surprise of her tormentors, the girl preferred the latter. </p><p>  She was tortured for a long time, and then burned at the stake.  Anastasia the Patternmaker during her life tried to help those who ended up in prison for their faith.  For all, the girl had words of comfort.  In front of her icon, prisoners who have not committed mortal sin pray for speedy release.  People who want to strengthen their faith or get rid of diseases turn to her for help.  Patronizes the saint and the pregnant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.playcast.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Saint Anastasia" class="if uuid-3064292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3064292.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is the Bead Temple in Bakhchisarai? </h2><p>  The monastery of St. Anastasia is located next to another famous attraction - the cave city of Kachi Kalon.  The cloister is located at an altitude of about 150 meters on Mount Fitzky.  To ease the path along a rather steep climb, the monks laid almost 600 old car tires on the trail, and then cemented them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the ascent, you can see the small church of St. Sophia, as well as the outbuildings of this monastery.  The enormous work that the novices and monks did is amazing.  On a bare rock, they grew numerous flower beds, a real garden, planted a garden. </p><p>  The bead temple in Bakhchisarai, a photo of which can be seen in this article, is located above, in a cave carved in limestone.  Therefore, an original method was found for the interior decoration - the monks began to use beadware for this purpose.  The walls are covered with bead panels, and the arch is decorated with a Byzantine cross made using this technique. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iriska10.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Unique icons" class="if uuid-3064225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3064225.jpg"></div><h2>  Temple visit </h2><p>  Several monks now live on the territory of the monastery, who are helped by parishioners in everyday life.  Moreover, many come here on purpose, in order to help the monastery with their own efforts in economic work.  Here vegetables and fruits are grown, cows and goats are bred, cheese and cottage cheese are made.  The monastery also has its own bakery, where monks bake fragrant bread, prosphora for worship, rolls.  The monastery garden is rather unusual - the plants in it grow in iron barrels. </p><h2>  Temple decoration </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, the Bead Temple in Bakhchisarai on the first visit gives the impression of a Buddhist temple: the walls and the ceiling are lined with beads and beads, hundreds of icon lamps from beads hang from the low ceiling.  On the ceiling is the Star of Bethlehem and the Byzantine cross, which are laid out from beads and beads by the hands of monks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.kryminfo.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ceiling decoration" class="if uuid-3064230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3064230.jpg"></div><p>  A few tens of meters in depth goes adit.  It also hosts services.  The interior of the Bead Temple in Bakhchisarai began with icon lamps with pendants similar to those on the holy Mount Athos.  They were taken as a basis, and later added their own elements to them.  All lamps are unique, there are no two identical.  They are made with love from materials brought by pilgrims and believers.  This applies to all products that can not only be seen in the cloister, but also taken with you as souvenirs. </p><p>  The decoration of the temple was continued in the same style.  Beaded panels are located on the walls and arch of the cave.  They are fixed on a waterproof basis.  There are no windows in the Bead Temple in Bakhchisarai, so the ceiling and walls reflect the dim light of church lamps and candles.  The temple turns into a fabulous and shimmering structure.  I don’t want to leave here during the service - glare from the beads, the smell of candles and incense, the prayers of the monks distract from everyday problems and make us think about God and the soul. </p><p>  There are several high chairs with reclining seats, which are also made with inlaid beads, are against the wall of the temple - these are stasidia.  The Ten Commandments are lined with beads on their backs.  During night prayers and many hours of service, the monks lean on their armrests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Ten Commandments" class="if uuid-3064242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3064242.jpg"></div><p>  People who once visited this holy place, on their next visit to the Bead Temple in Bakhchisarai bring gifts: beads, sea stones, old jewelry, unusual buttons that are used by monks and pilgrims. </p><h2>  What else to see in the monastery? </h2><p>  Climbing to the temple, tourists and pilgrims approach the holy spring.  Water from it is considered healing.  Nearby you can read the text of the prayer, which must be read before drinking water. </p><p>  In a small church shop, tourists can buy unique handicrafts - icons from beads, crosses and paintings, plates with saints, herbal preparations, soap, aromatic oils.  All this is created with prayer and every thing preserves the spirit of the monastery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="po-krymu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church shop" class="if uuid-3064237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3064237.jpg"></div><p>  A small hotel has recently been opened on the territory of the monastery for pilgrims.  It stops those who want to help in the arrangement of the territory. </p><h2>  Fire </h2><p>  At the end of January 2018, a fire broke out in the territory, which destroyed many outbuildings.  EMERCOM employees helped to cope with the fire and save people.  As a result of the fire, warehouses and a kitchen with a refectory, monastic cells were damaged.  A few days later, parishioners and monks were able to cope with stress and begin to analyze the rubble.  Help was provided by people from all over our country.  Restoration work was carried out in a short time.  Very quickly new wooden buildings were erected and their arrangement began.  The most difficult work was undertaken by monks and parishioners, and the pilgrims entrusted the easier work. </p><p>  Fortunately, the Bead Temple in Bakhchisarai was not affected by the fire.  Moreover, next to him began the construction of a new church in the name of the Three-Handed icon.  It is built in the Byzantine style: spacious, with domes and bells, bright, unlike the cave.  However, its interior decoration will also be beaded. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alushta-tour.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interior decoration" class="if uuid-3064221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3064221.jpg"></div><h2>  Bead Temple in Bakhchisarai: how to get there? </h2><p>  The unique monastery complex can be reached by car and public transport.
