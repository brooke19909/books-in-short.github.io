The Kodori Gorge is replete with mysterious dolmens and inaccessible fortresses in times past.  Tourists have the opportunity to go down to the bottom of deep canyons, enter the gorges of rocks.  But especially tourists like to admire the grazing herds in the meadows and sparkling rivers full of golden trout.  The routes are for the most part uncomplicated, so fatigue will not distract you from enjoying the views of the surroundings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Although there are destinations intended for experienced tourists and even for lovers of extreme sports.

    <h2>  The journey begins </h2><p>  Let's explore together the <span>sights of Abkhazia.</span>  The Kodori Gorge reveals its secrets to those who are willing to walk many kilometers, so wear comfortable shoes.  The first to meet you is the village of Markhaul with a mineral spring, in which the water is considered healing.  As they move forward, tourists will fall into the picturesque Tsebeldinsky valley, which is famous for the fact that our ancestors lived here in large numbers from the beginning of time.  This is evidenced by finds: primitive tools, medieval fortresses and much more.  Here you can visit the house-museum of scientists, this is not an entertaining, but cognitive element of the tour. </p><p>  Mysterious dolmens are located a little further down the valley.  These are small buildings made of stone, the purpose of which scientists are still thinking about.  According to the most common version, these are places of the secondary burial of the dead, where what is left after the decomposition of the body is placed. </p><p>  A hike along the Kodori Gorge (Abkhazia) has just begun.  This is not a gloomy grotto between two sheer cliffs, as it might seem at first glance.  Such places are also here, but over a greater length of the gorge you will find a surprisingly green and attractive valley with picturesque landscapes.  Usually tourists visit Lake Amtkel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Abkhazia Kodori Gorge" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1423982.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Waterfalls </h2><p>  The lake is very large, but warms up to +20 in the summer, so many tourists willingly bathe here.  Staying overnight on its hospitable shores, you will spend amazing minutes breathing in the aromas of herbs and bonfire.  The next day, an even more amazing sight awaits you.  A little further flaunts a waterfall, from where the Machara River originates. </p><p>  He is not the only one here, therefore, having admired the unusual sight, you can go further.  In the gorge there is a very interesting <span>Shakuran waterfall.</span>  Here, water flows from a height of 30 meters onto a cone-shaped stone.  However, the latter, despite everything, is only growing year by year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trekking through the Kodori Gorge Abkhazia" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1423983.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Creation of nature </h2><p>  Surely you have never seen anything like it in your life.  Kodori Gorge is a river valley of Abkhazia.  The path of tourists lies along the bottom of a very narrow canyon.  Gradually, the walls converge, and you approach the Wolf's Gate.  Behind them is the stunning Kada Valley, green and picturesque.  Here tourists will find a real adventure.  Drop your backpacks and get ready for a journey into the unknown.  It will be much easier for you to inspect the local cave, where, in addition to stalactites from stalagmites, you will find an amazing sight - huge flocks of bats under the ceiling that spend daylight hours here. </p><h2>  On the way to </h2><p>  You won‚Äôt go hungry on the way, so many fruit trees grow throughout the entire route that you can constantly enjoy fruit.  But the landscapes impress with their expressiveness.  Wolf Gate is not a place for the weak.  Here you have to wade along narrow paths, clay and slippery, on the other side of which there is a cliff.  Of course, the surrounding beauty compensates for the difficulties that the Kodori Gorge (Abkhazia) offers you to endure.  Excursions to ice caves will be another test.  The path goes in the middle of a cold lake, a little to the right or left - and you get into it with your foot. </p><h2>  Tour end </h2><p>  Having reached the confluence of the Kodor and Dzhampal rivers, you can stop at a halt.  You deserve rest in order to regain strength.  There is a picnic with barbecue, vegetables and homemade cheese, bread and wine, as well as many toasts.  Everyone who went this route, say that I want to repeat it many more times in a row, despite the fact that sometimes it is very difficult.  There are several options.  If you are planning a day trip, get ready to be back late at night, stock up on changeable clothes and shoes.  The option of spending the night is discussed separately with the tour operator, equipment (tents and sleeping bags) is necessary for every tourist. </p>
