    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the evenings, activists organize entertainment shows and live music evenings.  The hotel has incredibly fun entertainment for all ages - a water slide.  Riding them with the children, you will get a lot of pleasure.  For a beach hotel, this is the best entertainment. </p><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  Since the Sealight Resort Hotel (Kusadasi) positions itself as a hotel for families, there is a playground with swings for children, and the restaurant has a children's menu.  If necessary, you can use the paid service and order a babysitter for the baby. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The beach at Sealight Resort Hotel has a gentle slope and beautiful sand cover.  The hotel is on the first line, so the distance from the building to the coast does not exceed 50 meters.  The beach is equipped with umbrellas and sun loungers. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, Sealight Resort Hotel (Kusadasi) is located in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKusadasi resort, which is interesting for all categories of tourists.  Here you can go scuba diving and shopping, have fun in Turkey's largest water park.  There are many discos and night clubs in the city.  But the resort has become popular, of course, thanks to its stunning beaches. </p><p>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Old Town, the beach strip stretched parallel to the promenade.  Here you can see the marina for yachts, as well as numerous cruise ships.  Of course, there is an incredibly beautiful view, but far from clear water due to the accumulation of ships.  But south is the very crowded and popular Ladies Beach, which is famous for its finest sand.  It can be reached from the center on dolmash No. 5. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sealight resort hotel food" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1989513.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another amazingly beautiful place is the beach in the village of Davutalar, located 6 kilometers from Kusadasi.  There is a very gentle sunset, the cleanest sea and nice restaurants and cafes along the coast.  There are many marine activities on the beach.  You can get here at Dolmushi No. 6. </p><p>  The city of Kusadasi will appeal to shopping lovers, because here you can buy almost any product.  There are a lot of shopping centers with good quality products made of fur and leather.  In addition to clothes, shoes and accessories in Kusadasi, you can buy oriental sweets, home textiles, natural cosmetics in olive oil, ceramics and spices. </p><p>  Experienced travelers recommend visiting the village of Soke, where outlets are concentrated.  Here you can buy things from famous brands at fairly large discounts.  And, of course, do not forget about the huge market in Kusadasi, which is incredibly colorful, like any oriental bazaar.  It takes far from one quarter, and the range of goods on it is simply amazing.  As for the quality of things, you need to carefully inspect the goods, you may come across both good and not very high-quality products. </p><h2>  Sealight Resort Hotel: reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I would like to refer to the reviews of its guests.  Kusadasi is an amazing resort that you always want to return to.  Its main advantage is its amazing climate.  Even during a siesta, you should not leave the beach, since there is absolutely no grueling heat.  Around a lot of coniferous and deciduous greens.  The sea on the coast is a little cooler than in Antalya, but it is refreshing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sealight resort hotel beach" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1989512.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Sealight Resort Hotel 5 * (Turkey) is built on a mountain, but at the same time its territory is very reasonably planned.  A large number of terraces with beautiful views, lawns, green spaces are pleasing to the eye and create an amazing mood.  There are a lot of wonderful places on the territory where you can relax and enjoy the scenery, capturing them in the photo. </p><p>  As for the apartments in the Sealight Resort Hotel (the description of the rooms is given by us earlier in the article), they are quite acceptable.  Of course, traces of scuffs are noticeable, and the plumbing is far from ideal, but you can live.  However, according to tourists, the rooms do not significantly reach five stars.  The quality of cleaning is acceptable, but I would like better.  The staff, apparently, is not enough, and this is the fault of the institution's management.  As a rule, maids regularly only replenish water in the minibar and take out the trash.  But detergents are often forgotten to report, I have to remind.  Beds are also made every other time.  Well, we don‚Äôt talk about swans from towels, even tips will not help here. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  As for food, in this matter all tourists unanimously say that it is very diverse and of high quality.  Of course, the local cook does not know how to cook porridge, but the rest of the dishes are just wonderful.  The main restaurant is incredibly spacious, but it is also equipped with two outdoor terraces.  Enough space for everyone.  But the overall great impression of the establishment spoils the service.  The waiters are clearly not enough for the number of tourists who relax at the hotel.  And from here and the tables covered with dirty dishes and dirt on the floor.  To get the staff to order a drink is simply unrealistic, you have to wait.  During the meal no one removes the dirty dishes from the table, it turns out that all the plates that will accompany you until the end of the dinner accumulate in front of you.  It can be seen that the waiters are tired and gloomy.  Savings on staff are not the best way affects the quality of service.  Such a service does not pull five stars on the institution‚Äôs plate.  If a larger number of waiters worked in the restaurant, then they would do very well - bring drinks and remove them from the table. </p><p>  There are no complaints about nutrition itself.  The restaurant has a children's table and a light menu.  On the tables there is always fish, cheeses, a large selection of fruits and salads.  But they don‚Äôt offer any frills in the form of squid and mussels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sealight resort hotel service" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1989510.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tourists recommend visiting the Italian restaurant a la carte and fish.  But you should not go to Chinese.  Sushi in it is not very tasty.  Ice cream and Italian waffles are available at the hotel on the second floor.  In restaurants and bars, the proposed alcohol of good quality can always be seen from which bottles you are poured into a glass.  Local bartenders have one feature.  They pour drinks into paper cups if you do not drink them at the bar, i.e. takeaway.  And for those who plan to sit at the counter, the cocktail will certainly be in the glass.  Therefore, bartenders just need to be warned in advance.  This is due to the fact that the administration is trying to deal with broken dishes.  And it is right.  So, for example, if there is a suspicion of the presence of glass fragments in the playground, I simply close it to check and remove it.  After all, no one wants to cut himself, and even more so that the child is injured. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  One of the benefits of Sealight Resort Hotel is entertainment.  During the day, various sports programs are held at different venues of the hotel.  The hotel has a beautiful new gym, it is worth a look.  The pool area offers yoga and water aerobics classes.  There is also a children's animation.  In the evenings, guests are entertained by playing the piano, live music and show programs.  Every day, clowns, acrobats and artists perform in the amphitheater, and the level of programs is very good.  And after 23.00 a night club begins to work.  The hotel‚Äôs adult animation is commendable. </p><p>  The hotel has three water slides.  On which not only children can ride, but also adults.  You can also play billiards in the evening or relax in the sauna.  In general, the hotel has enough entertainment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sealight resort hotel room description" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1989507.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In general, the complex makes a very good impression, if not for a very weak level of service. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel has a beautiful sandy beach and a gentle entry into the sea.  Every day, cars run every five minutes on the coast.  Kusadasi is famous for its beautiful beaches with golden sand, and this is true.  Resting on the coast, you will appreciate the beauty of these places.  Hotel staff clean the entire beach daily.  On the shore there are not only umbrellas and deck chairs, but also water coolers, changing cabins, a toilet and fresh water showers.  There is also a bar with a good selection of drinks and cocktails. </p><p>  On the territory of the hotel there is a large multilevel pool, next to it sun loungers need to be taken early.  Although it is worth spending time staying near it when such a beautiful sea is nearby. </p><h2>  Tours and attractions </h2><p>  Resting in the Kusadasi area, you should see all the most interesting places in the resort.  The water amusement park Adaland is very popular.  They say that he is among the top ten in the whole world.  It has a kamikaze hill, a safari park, and a river for rafting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sealight resort hotel 5 turkey" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1989508.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The best place for a family vacation is simply not to be found, because there is entertainment for visitors of all ages.  Near the park is a dolphinarium.  Here tourists can watch shows with dolphins and fur seals.  Not so long ago, a marine park was opened in the city.  Upon entering it, guests are given out suits and masks for snorkeling.  Tourists have the opportunity to swim in the lagoon, admiring the tropical fish and coral reefs, you can play with dolphins.  In general, there is plenty of entertainment at the resort to have fun with the whole family. </p>
