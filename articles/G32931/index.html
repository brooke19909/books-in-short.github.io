This is one of the most picturesque and popular resorts of the Black Sea coast.  This fabulous land is called Apsny, which in translation from the Abkhaz language means "country of the soul." </p><p>  The <span>nature of Abkhazia is</span> unique and inimitable <span>.</span>  There is a clean and warm sea, majestic mountains and dense forests, mountain rivers and lakes, which are known throughout the world. </p><p>  Every year the number of people who want to relax in these parts is increasing.  But most tourists come here in the summer months, although locals say that Abkhazia is no less beautiful in September-October than in summer.  In this article we will tell you how attractive this sunny country is in the fall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia in October" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/988784.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is the weather like in Abkhazia in October? </h2><p>  As on the entire <span>Black Sea coast, the</span> climate here is quite mild.  The average annual air temperature is +15 degrees, in summer it warms up to +27 on average, and in winter it does not cool below +7 <sup>o</sup> C. </p><p>  The coastal part of Abkhazia has a humid <span>subtropical climate.</span>  The hottest month is August.  1300-1500 mm falls annually.  Humidity - not less than 70%.  In the warm season, heavy rains take place, after which hot and sunny weather is always established.  Sometimes it can change several times a day.  Snow on the coast does not happen every year, winter begins in January (sometimes at the end of December), and in February mimosa and cherry plum bloom. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Weather in Abkhazia in October varies during the month.  In the first half it is still quite warm, some tourists even swim in the sea.  In the autumn it is warmer than in May, because in the summer it manages to warm up well.  The water temperature in Abkhazia in October is about +21 ° C, but swimming can interrupt the storm and strong wind.  By the middle, and especially towards the end of the month, autumn is finally taking effect.  The air temperature in October is set at +17 ° C in the afternoon, and drops to +11 ° C at night.  Now you know what the weather is in Abkhazia in October.  Experienced travelers recommend taking warm clothes with them on a trip. </p><h2>  Holidays in October </h2><p>  The second autumn month is characterized by mild but prolonged rains.  Therefore, the weather in Abkhazia in October has a sightseeing holiday, especially since there is something to see in this country.  And fresh air, the lack of heat and a large number of vacationers have such walks. </p><p>  There is another argument in favor of a trip to Abkhazia in October - a huge selection of fruits and vegetables.  At the beginning of the month, persimmon appears in local markets, followed by oranges, kiwi, tangerines and feijoa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in abkhazia in october" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/990507.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to tourists, excursions in this amazing country give no less pleasure than a beach holiday - fresh sea air, comfortable temperature, luxurious nature will be remembered for a long time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where to relax in Abkhazia in October? </h2><p>  Most tourists who decide to explore the sights on their own first go to New Athos, at the foot of the mountain of the same name.  Here, against the backdrop of the majestic slopes covered with greenery, the domes of the active male New Athos Monastery burn in the sun in the sun.  It is located in the Gudauta district of Abkhazia, and is the largest spiritual center in the Caucasus. </p><p>  The land on which the monastery is located and the money for its construction almost a century and a half ago were granted to the monks by the tsarist government.  At this very place in the 1st century AD  e.  Simon Kananit died - an apostle who preached Christianity among the Caucasian peoples.  The Roman legionnaires were responsible for his death. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="abkhazia october reviews" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/988783.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The construction of the monastery was actively supported by the Russian emperor Alexander III, but the war (Russian-Turkish) tragically intervened.  During the hostilities, Turkish forces ravaged and sacked the unfinished temple. </p><p>  The construction of the monastery complex was fully completed only in 1999.  It consists of six temples, the main of which is the Panteleimon Cathedral.  The monastery was destined for the fate of thousands of churches of the Soviet Union - in 1934 it was closed.  The measured and calm church life returned to these walls in 1994.  Now this is a place of pilgrimage, attracting the attention of many tourists. </p><h2>  New Athos Cave </h2><p>  Abkhazia in October, when the beach season is completed, has to explore another attraction - New Athos cave.  A huge dungeon with a history of several million years was discovered and investigated relatively recently - in 1961. </p><p>  The pioneer was the artist G. Sh. Smyr, who decided to go down 135 meters underground.  Exploration of the caves lasted 14 years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the weather in Abkhazia in October" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/988778.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Since 1975, everyone can visit the site.  <span>Stalagmites and stalactites,</span> underground galleries and frozen waterfalls, many underground halls and <span>emerald lakes</span> make a huge impression and amaze with their beauty. </p><p>  The New Athos cave, which is located in the bowels of the <span>Iverskaya Mountain,</span> stretches for almost two kilometers.  Underground tours are conducted by experienced specialists on an electric train.  True, only half of the eleven underground halls are open to tourists, but this is quite enough to get a lot of impressions. </p><h2>  Ritsa Lake </h2><p>  Abkhazia is famous for its many unique natural monuments.  In October, we recommend that you admire the alpine lake, which has such clean water that it allows you to see what is happening in the underwater world at a depth of up to ten meters. </p><p>  Ritsa Lake is located in the north-west of the country, in the national reserve in the Gudauta district.  Calm and majestic, it appeared only two hundred and fifty years ago, after the collapse of Mount Pshegishkhva.  Part of it blocked the Lachips River in the mountains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia in September and October" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/988782.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main feature of the lake is the ability of its waters to change color depending on the time of year.  The range of shades varies from greenish in summer to sky blue in autumn and winter.  This is due to the activity of small algae at the bottom of a unique reservoir. </p><h2>  Blue Lake </h2><p>  Locals love one legend and often tell guests that in ancient times there was a cave in the place where the lake is today.  There lived a kind and affable sage.  His blue eyes sparkled like a very young man.  They were bewildering and did not allow to determine his true age.  People from all over the world came for advice and help to an old man.  They brought animal skins as a gift.  Once the ill-wishers decided to rob and kill the sage, but suddenly the foaming water killed the insidious killers.  After that, a lake of unearthly beauty appeared on the site of the cave, which incorporated the blue eyes of the ruined old man. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water temperature in Abkhazia in October" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/988780.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The water surface does not change its color even in gloomy weather.  The lake is so deep that the sun's rays cannot penetrate through the layer of water, so it seems a little unclear. </p><h2>  Sukhumi Botanical Garden </h2><p>  In October, Abkhazia impresses tourists with its bright colors.  This is especially evident in the oldest botanical garden in the Caucasus, which in 1838 was founded by an enthusiastic botanist and talented doctor Bagrinovsky.  He planted rare tropical plants near his house, which gave rise to a modern park.  Many copies from around the world were brought to Abkhazian land over the long history of this facility. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to relax in Abkhazia in October" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/988779.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Today you can admire thousands of outlandish flowers and trees that delight and amaze tourists.  Even before the creation of the complex, linden grew on this place, which today is an old-timer of the park.  Specialists claim that she is already two hundred and fifty years old.  She could die twice - the first time at the end of the 19th century, when the Turks tried to cut it down, and the second time - after a hundred and ten years.  In 1987, a tree hurricane demolished the crown of a tree.  But the tree survived, and today it continues to delight visitors with the aroma of its flowers. </p><h2>  Apery </h2><p>  Speaking about where to visit and what to see in Abkhazia, one cannot help but recall the Sukhumi monkey nursery.  It will be especially interesting to families who go on vacation with children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in abkhazia in october" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/990452.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Once upon a time, at the place where this amazing institution is located, there was a summer house of Ostroumov, a famous Russian scientist.  In 1927, on the green slopes of Mount Trapezia, a research institute began to work, which is now known throughout the world.  Scientists here began to conduct unique experiments.  They made many important discoveries, thanks to which dangerous ailments were defeated.  You can find out about this if you visit the Primate Museum. </p><p>  Here is the world's only monument to the monkey, which was erected in 1977.  More than three hundred species of primates live in the nursery, which invariably delight tourists, especially small ones.  Here it is allowed to feed cute animals, which is very pleasing to the kids. </p><h2>  Traveler Reviews </h2><p>  As you can see, this is a magnificent resort - Abkhazia.  In October (reviews of tourists confirm this), the grueling heat is no longer tormenting, so there is an opportunity to get to know the sights of the country without fuss.  Many travelers say that there are no problems with accommodation (even if you leave on your own).  In Abkhazia there are a lot of hotels, pensions, guest houses, which in October work as usual, and the cost of living is slightly reduced. </p>
