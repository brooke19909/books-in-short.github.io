If with the second option everything is quite simple, then a lot of debate and controversy erupts over which city's beach is better.  One of the places where you can relax is a town called Oludeniz, which is several tens of kilometers from Fethiye.  As in any resort town, there is a large number of hotels.  Among them can be distinguished hotel Garcia Resort Spa, which has five stars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="garcia resort spa" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579560.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Garcia Resort Spa Oludeniz 5 * is located in a small Turkish town called Oludeniz.  This town is not isolated, but is under the jurisdiction of a larger resort town - Fethiye.  Of course, the location of this hotel cannot but please visitors.  At the request of people who have stopped at this hotel, you can go to the stunning white sand beach, which is one of the best in the world.  Also nearby is the Oludeniz National Park.  Elements of untouched nature have been preserved in this place, which allows the average person to feel all the splendor of our planet in just a few tens of minutes.  If your plans include the purchase of any fish products, then a couple of blocks from the Gracia Resort Spa is the city‚Äôs fish market, where you can buy all kinds of fish at a good price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="garcia resort spa oludeniz 5" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579561.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the hotel </h2><p>  This hotel is located in Turkey, which means that the most important stage of the trip is arrival in the country.  You can do this by flying from your city to the capital of <span>Turkey, the city of</span> Istanbul.  Neither Oludeniz nor Fethiye has its own airport, and the nearest one is located in neighboring Dalaman.  The cost of a ticket to this city is about 100 US dollars in both directions per person.  From Dalaman, there are two ways to get to the coveted Fethiye Garcia Resort Spa.  The first is the most expensive and easiest - to take a taxi and go straight to Oludeniz.  At the same time, you will spend no more than one and a half hours on a trip.  The second way is cheaper and more complicated.  From Dalaman you can take buses to Fethiye, and already from this resort city - to Oludeniz and Gracia Resort Spa, in particular, local taxis and minibuses leave several times per hour.  The road may seem long and tiring, but if you want to get real pleasure from the rest, then it is worth doing. </p><h2>  The facade of the building and the view from the windows of the rooms </h2><p>  The hotel was built relatively recently, and the reason for this was a noticeable increase in the flow of tourists to Oludeniz.  The building itself is made in bright and warm colors.  Its facade is completely white, and the roofs are covered with brown tiles.  Each hotel room faces the south side of the hotel, allowing you to see the stunning nature and Oludeniz Bay.  If you look at the Gracia Resort Spa from afar, it may seem like it is not a hotel building, but a ship filled with a large number of passengers interested. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fethiye garcia resort spa" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579562.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Like any other place in Turkey, you can hear a lot of positive and negative reviews from visitors to the five-star Garcia Resort Spa.  Among the positive aspects, the work of the personnel stands out, who works at a very high level, trying as soon as possible to check in the visitor in accordance with all his requirements and preferences.  Food and drinks are also highlighted as a positive feature.  Visitors acknowledge that the minibar was not always full on time, but the quality of the food never caused any complaints.  The main disadvantage noted by tourists is the remoteness of the beach from the hotel.  According to them, it is not at a distance of 3 kilometers, but a little more.  But the solution can be a car rental. </p><p>  In general, every reader can draw their conclusions about the hotel Garcia Resort <span>Spa 5 *</span> (Turkey).  Guest reviews about the hotel are subjective and can hardly be considered undeniably true.  Therefore, decide for yourself whether to go to this hotel or not. </p>
