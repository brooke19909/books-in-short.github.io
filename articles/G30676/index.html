    <h2>  General information about the city </h2><p>  First you need to provide basic information about this village.  So, the city of Anadyr is located in a remote part of the country, on the <span>Chukchi Peninsula.</span>  It is also the center of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of the same name.  The city lies almost in the border zone, which also adds to it some specific features.  It was founded in 1899, but for a long time it bore a different name - Novomariinsk.  The status of the city this settlement received a little later - in 1965. </p><p>  It is worth talking about the size of Anadyr.  It occupies a very small territory, compared with other cities of our country.  The area of ​​the settlement is about 20 square meters.  kilometers.

    <h2>  Local weather and climate </h2><p>  So, we examined the general information about the city.  Now it’s worth talking about the climatic conditions in which this settlement lies.  The weather in Anadyr is usually cold, it can be hard for people who are not used to such natural conditions.  The climate of these places is subarctic as well as marine.  It is characterized by a long cold period and a very short warm period.  In January, the average air temperature is -22˚.  As for July, the average temperature varies greatly from year to year, on average it is at + 11˚. </p><p>  However, the weather in Anadyr is much less severe than in the continental regions of Chukotka, since the influence of the <span>marine climate</span> is present here <span>.</span>  Due to this factor, winter in these places is less cold, and summer is much cooler.  In the warmer months, fogs often form.  Water here never heats up very much, its temperature in summer is about + 10˚. </p><p>  Thus, we got acquainted with the climate and weather of this wonderful city, and now it’s worth moving on to consider other details about it. </p>

    <h2>  Anadyr time: what is the time zone here? </h2><p>  As you know, our country is really vast, therefore, different settlements are in different time zones.  It is interesting to know in what time zone is the city of Anadyr.  If we compare its location with Moscow, then it is located far from it in the east.  In this regard, the time difference between these cities is very significant.  The difference with Moscow is as much as 9 hours.  When it’s 12:00 in the capital of our country, it’s already 21:00 in Anadyr.  By international standards, this time zone is designated UTC + 12. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thus, the time in Anadyr is very different from Moscow.  It is worth noting that the time zone in which this city lies is called Kamchatka time.  It acts on several regions - the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug and the Kamchatka Territory. </p>

    <h2>  Local nature </h2><p>  Of course, we need to talk about the nature of the <span>Chukotka Autonomous Okrug</span> and, accordingly, Anadyr itself.  Permafrost reigns everywhere here.  This means that for a very long time the temperature of the earth's surface does not rise above 0 C. The entire territory of the peninsula is located in a natural zone called the tundra.  Forests are completely absent.  Of the plants, you can often find Arctic willow, blueberries, cranberries and others, their height does not exceed 20 centimeters.  Sometimes plants such as lean birch and bearberry Alpine grow here.  Various shrubs are also found, they can often be seen in river valleys.  Among them there are some species of willows, birches and other trees.  The most common representatives of the local flora are mosses and lichens, here you can find truly unique species that only the Chukotka Autonomous Region can boast.  Anadyr is really a very unusual city.  Therefore, it will be interesting to visit not only the village itself, but also get acquainted with the local nature. </p>

    <h2>  City population </h2><p>  So, we examined the climate and nature of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug.  Now it’s worth talking about the population of these places.  The city of Anadyr, as is already known, is quite small.  No more than 15 thousand people live here.  If we talk about more accurate figures, then in 2015 the population of the city amounted to 14,329 people.  Interestingly, the number of inhabitants is only increasing.  This process began in 2006 and continues to the present.  For example, in 2014, the population indicator was 14029 people, in 2013 - 13747 people. </p><p>  Of course, by the standards of a country where truly large-scale megacities are present, Anadyr is not a leader.  In the list it is on the 809th place out of 1114 cities of Russia. </p><p>  In 2009-2011, some trends were observed here that strongly influenced the demographic situation.  At this time, a significant outflow of the population occurred as a result of migration.  However, at the same time, a good trend was noted for the city - the birth rate exceeded mortality. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Thus, we got acquainted with the data on the demographic situation in this area.  Now it’s worth talking about transport in Anadyr and the region as a whole.  Of course, this is an important component of any locality.  The transport structure here is represented by several components.  Among them there is a seaport, aviation, roads and public transport. </p><p>  For starters, of course, you need to talk about the port of Anadyr.  This is an object that has truly important transport significance.  Ships depart from here to Vladivostok, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Magadan and other ports.  However, the navigation period does not last long, it is 4 months.  Thus, transportation is carried out from July 1 to November 1. </p><p>  As for roads, in the city they are mostly concrete.  There is a federal highway A384.  She goes from Anadyr to the airport.  The length of the road is about 23 kilometers.  The city has several bus routes that connect the main important places. </p><p>  As it became clear, the airport operates here.  Anadyr sends and receives planes from various cities.  It is worth talking about this in more detail. </p><h2>  Air traffic with other cities </h2><p>  So, we examined the transport in Anadyr, and now we need to discuss the airport in more detail.  Anadyr has a large federal air port.  It is located near the city, in a village called Coal Mines.  However, it can be difficult to get there, helicopter transportation is organized all year round, in winter you can also use the ice crossing, and in the summer you can take a boat.  Regular flights depart from the airport to Moscow and Khabarovsk.  Also, air communication is carried out with almost all the settlements of Chukotka. </p>

    <p>  We should also talk about the flight Moscow – Anadyr.  It will take about 8 hours.  Flights depart daily from Vnukovo Airport.  Ticket prices are quite high, on average, they range from 28 thousand rubles to 35 thousand rubles.  The distance of the Moscow – Anadyr route is also great - about 6187 kilometers.  Thus, we got acquainted with Anadyr airport and air transportation from it to other cities. </p><h2>  City Economy </h2><p>  Of course, you need to talk a little about what enterprises exist in this locality.  On the territory of Anadyr, a large fish production plant operates.  In addition, near the city, gold and coal deposits are being developed.  There is also a CHP. </p>

    <p>  However, this is far from all that Anadyr can boast of.  Russia has several <span>wind farms,</span> but the largest of them is the Anadyr Wind Farm.  It provides electricity to several nearby villages, as well as the airport. </p>
