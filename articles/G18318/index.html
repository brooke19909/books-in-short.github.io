Who is its manufacturer, why is it needed, how much does it cost, and is it taken?  In fact, this is a device for the deaf, characterized primarily by a bell resembling the sound of a real jackhammer.  It is worth noting that the Bluetooth in it passed the test "excellent".  Nevertheless, it is unlikely that an ordinary person will be interested in such a device, and its cost is very high.  If we talk about standard models, the highest volume among Chinese manufacturers, while they have low sound quality, which also does not enthuse. </p>

    <h2>  How to choose the loudest phone? </h2><p>  The loudest of branded manufacturers can be called Nokia.  She was recognized several times as the leader in this parameter thanks to the Nokia X2, Nokia N95, Nokia 5800, Nokia 6233 and <span>Nokia 3250</span> models <span>,</span> which, unfortunately, have already gone out of production.  Therefore, we look for the loudest phone among modern devices. </p><h2>  But what about Apple? </h2><p>  Other manufacturers are pulling up in volume, for example, the well-known Apple.  ‚ÄúYablokofila‚Äù are in love with their devices, which means that when asked what the loudest phone is, they will answer: ‚ÄúiPhone!‚Äù  Indeed, the iPhone is becoming louder with each new generation.  So, the fifth generation differs from the fourth by 2.5 dB.  The manufacturer achieved this by increasing the number of magnetic transducers in the dynamics.  Previously, there were three, now five, while the size of the <span>speaker system</span> remained the same.  Why iPhone is needed - it‚Äôs unknown, probably the key here is simply the desire to prove that the company is still capable of much.  One way or another, there are a lot of fans of the gadget, which means that the innovations were made not in vain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Specialized Models </h2><p>  Naturally, manufacturing companies are interested in every consumer evaluating their products.  That is why Geemarc has released a mobile phone for people with hearing loss.  The model name is Clearsound CL8200.  The device is interesting not only with a loud sound, but also with an impressive monochrome display, large characters and keys.  Now, no elderly person will experience inconvenience when using the phone.  It is also interesting that the menu in it is very simple.  It turns out that Western old people all the time complain about super-fashionable smartphones, and you need to call older people, even relatives, from time to time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the loudest phone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/412330.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  As we already mentioned, the loudest mobile phone has a unique speaker.  It is located on the back of the device.  In the event that you still decide to buy this unit for personal use, you will never miss an SMS or a call.  In standard mobile phones, the maximum volume is 10 decibels, but here it is 2.5 times higher.  That is why the device is recognized as the loudest on our planet!  Its cost is about $ 130. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, one of the most high-profile phones is the <span>Nokia 808</span> PureView.  These are far from all the advantages of the model: there is a camera capable of taking photos of 7152x5368 pixels, and a 4-inch display with 640x360 pixels.  Almost a computer phone!  This alone makes it possible to recommend the device, but do not forget that for sure something else will appear soon.  So, the title ‚Äúloudest phone‚Äù will move to another model.  But while Nokia does not cease to amaze and delight its customers with new interesting solutions, well, it‚Äôs not worth talking about the quality of the device - it‚Äôs checked. </p><h2>  The loudest phone in 2014 </h2><p>  In 2014, the winner of the nomination is the HTC One smartphone.  One of its main advantages is an audio system featuring BoomSound technology, as well as Beats Audio (sound enhancement algorithm).  In view of this, HTC One is a good competitor to external audio systems.  Once, the experts conducted the following experiment: examined 4 devices at a volume level.  The results were as follows: </p><ul><li>  fifth Apple iPhone (70 Decibels); </li><li>  <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S III (70 dB); </li><li>  Nexus 4 (65dB); </li><li>  HTC One (75 dB). </li></ul>

    <p>  Among other things, HTC One has become a leader in sound purity.  Let us introduce some characteristics of this model: the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600, which has a clock frequency of 1.7 Gigahertz;  Android operating system version 4.3;  2 gigabytes of RAM;  Adreno 320 processor  32 gigabytes of internal memory;  the main camera with a resolution of 4 MP;  screen with the latest Super LCD technology, as well as a diagonal of 4.7 inches. </p><p>  Thus, the smartphone at HTC again turned out great.  Its distinctive features: good looks and high build quality (which manufacturers Samsung, LG and others cannot yet catch up with).  If we talk about the emotions that arise when you hold One (M8) in your hands, then they are only positive.  Using the device is very nice (functionality is at its best), watching and showing to others is also a pleasure.  However, if you look at the gadget from the average buyer, you can find models with about the same technical specifications for less money.  At the same time, there are better cameras, and the operating system is kept at the same level, and the autonomy is almost the same ... So why overpay?  So our citizens prefer other, frankly, no less good models.  One way or another, HTC has enough fans, which means they will appreciate One (M8). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the loudest mobile phone" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11844/411826.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So, now you know what is hidden under the concept of ‚Äúthe loudest phone in the world‚Äù, why it is needed and what characteristics it has.  Of course, not everyone will like the device, but, of course, there will be those people for whom such a <span>sound volume</span> will be a real salvation. </p>
