This became known at the United Nations.  The year was noteworthy for many African states, because independence was achieved by the largest British colony - the Belgian Congo, the state of Somalia, which was also under the protectorate of the united kingdom.  In total, 17 countries on this continent received independent status during this time.  A similar trend continued in the future: in the 61st, Tanganyika and Sierra Leone became independent, in the 62nd - Uganda, in the 63rd - Zanzibar and Kenya, in the 64th - Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, and in 65- m - The Gambia. </p><h2>  Restless continent </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="African independence" class="if uuid-2532110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2532110.jpg"></div><p>  After 1960, Africa remained the most troubled continent on Earth.  The role was played by the fact that Britain by all means sought to maintain its influence in the former colonies.  For this, thorough diplomatic work was carried out.  As a result, most of the territories entered the Commonwealth, and then they also recognized Elizabeth II as their head of state. </p><p>  But even after that, tension persisted in many countries.  It was the man with the gun who often made the key decision on many vital issues.  After the decades that followed 1960, the year of Africa, more than 120 coups took place in these countries, as well as almost two dozen civil wars that claimed the lives of millions of people.  And now, of the 25 poorest countries in the world, 20 are in Africa. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The vast majority of the population remains illiterate, many suffer from AIDS and epilepsy.  After 1982, tens of millions of people died from HIV.  But all the same, 1960 entered the <span>history of Africa</span> as the year when the countries of the continent began to gain independence.  At the headquarters of the United Nations, more and more new flags of independent territories appeared.  The events on the Black Continent attracted the attention of the whole world. </p><h2>  The role of the Soviet Union </h2><p>  Many historians still remember that the year of Africa is 1960.  The formation of independent African states would not have been possible without the participation of the Soviet Union.  The then head of the country Nikita Khrushchev played a big role in this.  It was the Secretary General who insisted that the <span>UN General Assembly</span> adopt a declaration on the granting of independence to colonial peoples and countries. </p><p>  This interest of the Soviet Union in the African region was explained by the desire to feel like a superpower that is able to influence world politics.  For the first time, the Soviet authorities became interested in the Black Continent in 1957, when the sixth World Festival of Youth and Students took place in the USSR.  At that time, for the first time, a large delegation from various African countries visited our country. </p><p>  At that time, representatives of African states were enthusiastic.  They believed that as soon as the colonial regime fell, they would begin a new and undoubtedly happy life.  Great hopes were pinned on the African edition, which at about the same time began working on Moscow Radio.  Since the late 1950s, broadcasts in French and English began.  Since 1961, Moscow Radio began broadcasting programs and programs in Swahili, Amharic and Hausa.  Soon after, eight more local languages ‚Äã‚Äãwere added to listeners of the Black Continent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The course of the national liberation movement </h2><div class="photo" data-original="englishresourcefiles.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="African states" class="if uuid-2532113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2532113.jpg"></div><p>  From this article, you will now understand why 1960 was dedicated to Africa around the world.  It should be noted that almost immediately after independence, national liberation movements began in most states. </p><p>  According to the most common version, the anti-colonial movement arose spontaneously.  However, now historians are inclined to believe that this version does not withstand any criticism.  It is now obvious that many field commanders were simply puppets in the hands of large European companies. </p><h2>  Rebel Armament </h2><p>  This fact is also suggested by the fact that the rebels armed themselves very quickly, although the last demonstration organized by the indigenous population against the colonialists dates back to 1872. </p><p>  It was a period of the Boer War.  Then the English corps, commanded by Cecil Rhodes, defeated the army of the high leader of the Zulu Ketchvayo to finally establish the colonial administration in the Orange Republic and the Republic of Transvaal.  Of particular interest to the British were diamond deposits located in the Kimberley region. </p><h2>  Who supported the rebels? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="historum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decolonization of Africa" class="if uuid-2532116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2532116.jpg"></div><p>  It is not known for certain why the national liberation movement began to develop so actively in Africa in 1960.  The rebels were actively supported by the United States and the USSR.  These superpowers showed increased interest in the consumer markets of the Black Continent and minerals.  Some of the rebels in the European colonies had other sponsors.  They were financed by Belgian, French and English concerns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Moreover, the colonial administrations gave formal consent to this.  As a result, this led to the fact that the colonialists fought among themselves, using the local population for this.  It only at first glance looks absurd.  Colonial governance in the country in the middle of the 20th century was no longer profitable to either empires or large European companies. </p><p>  The colonial authorities have long dreamed of getting rid of unnecessary expenses for the social protection of the local population, which grew every year, and corporations hoped to establish puppet governments in these territories that could be used for their own purposes.  Then it was proposed that they reform the investment and tax laws in their favor.  As we now know, these calculations are fully justified. </p><h2>  Continent history </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blart507.rssing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the African continent" class="if uuid-2532114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2532114.jpg"></div><p>  To understand all the problems that were relevant on the Black Continent at that time, it is necessary to delve into its history.  According to one version, it is Africa that is the birthplace of man.  It is believed that he settled there about 100 thousand years ago.  The findings of archaeologists, which date back to the prehistoric period, indicate that in those places they were already engaged in agriculture at that time and processed grain. </p><p>  Europeans appeared in Africa at the beginning of the 15th century.  Perhaps the greatest contribution to the development of the continent was made by the Portuguese and Spaniards when the Reconquista ended.  The Portuguese began to control the west coast, starting a massive slave trade.  Then other nations came to the Black Continent.  In North Africa, control was established by the Ottoman Empire. </p><h2>  Mass colonization </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1960 in the history of Africa" class="if uuid-2532112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2532112.jpg"></div><p>  Colonization began directly in the second half of the 19th century.  Especially after the so-called race for Africa, which unfolded in 1885.  By the beginning of the 20th century, virtually the entire continent, with the exception of Liberia and Ethiopia, was divided between several European countries. </p><p>  It is rightly believed that economic reasons have become the main incentives to start the fight for Africa.  Europeans exploited local natural resources.  So, in the south of the continent they discovered the world's largest diamond deposit, which immediately began to give super-profits.  To obtain these incomes, it was necessary to make large investments in order to explore natural resources, establish communications, and suppress the protests that constantly arose among local residents. </p><p>  In addition, many ideologists were convinced that the opening of new colonies would lead to the creation of a large number of jobs, completely eliminating unemployment.  These plans, if implemented, are much slower than originally anticipated.  Also, the plan with the relocation of the excess population of Europe to Africa failed.  The inhabitants of Old Europe, if they moved, only to the very south of the continent, where there was a relatively sparing climate.  Countries located in the Gulf of Guinea were even called the "grave of a white man", so few could seduce anyone. </p><h2>  Decolonization </h2><div class="photo" data-original="minalhajratwala.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="List of Independent African States" class="if uuid-2532111" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2532111.jpg"></div><p>  1960, the year of Africa, entered literature as the year of mass decolonization.  In fact, this process began sluggishly after the end of World War II, reaching its highest point by the middle of the century.  Now it becomes clear why 1960 is called the year of Africa. </p><p>  A large number of colonies that received liberation were French.  These include Togo, Cameroon, Dahomey, Ivory Coast, Central African Republic, Chad, Malagasy Republic. </p><p>  After this, the situation on the continent changed in a most fundamental way. It became clear why 1960 entered history as the year of Africa.  By 1990, Mauritius, Swaziland, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Northern Rhodesia, Malawi, Lesotho, Seychelles, the Republic of Namibia also gained independence. </p><p>  In 1960, the list of African countries to which independence was extended looked impressive. </p><h2>  Wars and partisan uprisings </h2><p>  Now that it‚Äôs clear why 1960 was called the Year of Africa, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that not everywhere decolonization and declaration of independence took place without bloodshed.  So, before gaining freedom in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Namibia, real civil wars broke out, an active guerrilla war was waged between the opposing clans. </p><p>  But still in most countries managed to do without bloodshed.  Independence was achieved through strikes, mass demonstrations, and the negotiation process.  For some territories, relevant decisions have been taken by the United Nations.  It was she who at one time explained why 1960 is called the year of Africa. </p><h2>  Unreadiness for democracy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Independence of the Black Continent" class="if uuid-2532115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2532115.jpg"></div><p>  One of the consequences of decolonization was that many borders of African states were drawn very roughly.  This happened during the so-called race for Africa, when they were carried out as arbitrarily as possible, not considering how the tribes and peoples were settled.  That is why African society has been completely unprepared for democratic change.  In many countries, civil wars began immediately after independence. </p><p>  In addition, real dictators often came to power, who ruled the country, neglecting to respect human rights, and built a totalitarian society based on bureaucracy.  All this led to an intense increase in poverty and an economic crisis. </p><h2>  Current situation </h2><p>  In our time, only certain territories have remained under the protectorate of certain European countries.  So, there are enclaves of Spain in Morocco and the Canary Islands.  These are the areas of Melilla and Ceuta. </p><p>  Great Britain retained a certain influence only on St. Helena, Ascension Island, on the Chagos archipelago and on the Tristan da Cunha archipelago.  Portugal owns Madeira, while France owns the islands of Mayotte and Eparce and Reunion. </p><h2>  Continent of freedom </h2><p>  Africa began to be of real interest to European entrepreneurs after the completion of the decolonization process.  She was even called the "continent of freedom."  They began to invest in African countries, sending there unprecedented investments.  As a result, their final amount reached the size of 40 billion dollars, which were sent to the continent annually.  Up to 10 billion dollars a year were exported back to Europe. </p><p>  But, to the surprise of many economists, such significant financial influences did not create any industrial and industrial boom in Africa.  Money was mainly invested in operations on which everyone sought to earn quickly and as much as possible.  But nobody wanted to finance long-term projects with a long payback period. </p><h2>  Rising oil prices </h2><p>  A certain role in the fate of Africa after decolonization was played by the increase in oil prices, which was carried out by OPEC.  Soon after, a relatively small Belgian company leased a plot of land from the Republican government in Ghana to build an aluminum smelter. </p><p>  The dictator Mboya, who was in charge of the country at that time, gave these lands practically for nothing, guaranteeing special and exceptional tax preferences after it is put into operation.  But Belgian capital did not reach Ghana.  This is one example of how an attempt to invest in the African continent has failed. </p><p>  Initially, negotiations between the government and investors dragged on for four whole years.  By that time, the Belgians realized that this project would not bring them immediate profit and abandoned it, having bought an oil field in Eastern Sahara.  This attitude towards investment led to the fact that African countries could not intensively develop, despite gaining independence. </p>
