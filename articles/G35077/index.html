    <h2>  Zoo </h2><p>  Safari Park (Lipetsk region) began with this object.  Today, a wide variety of animals and birds live here on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwo square kilometers in the pen.  Some of them are completely tame - they calmly approach the fence, where children and adults communicate with them with pleasure.  The only request of the zoo employees to visitors is not to feed the animals.  Unfortunately, not everyone follows this rule.  The territory of the zoo can be reached by horse carriage.  However, for this you need to take a turn.  But since there are two such carts, she is moving fast.  On the way, the coachman tells children interesting stories from the life of animals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  We study the territory </h2><p>  If you go to the left along the fence along the fence, you will come to the picturesque river Kamenka.  The water in it is clean and clear.  On very hot days, you can see animals fleeing from the heat.  Crossing the bridge and climbing the steps to the hill, you can see another original bridge over the Kamenka, but not just a wooden one like the previous one, but a stone one with towers, similar to the main entrance to the medieval fortress.  This is really an entrance bridge through which you can get to the park and to <span>the Don River.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Safari park Lipetsk region how to get" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/459739.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Surely, approaching the complex, you will pay attention to the mound.  According to the creators of the Safari Park, it has archaeological value.  According to some researchers, there are ancient burials.  While this is not known for certain, however, it is necessary to visit the mound, if only because from its top a completely stunning view of the Don River and the entire complex opens.  From this point you can see the holy spring with ice water, equipped with a font.  It is made of wood and stone, well decorated - you can immediately see that an experienced designer has worked on it.  If you want, you can plunge into it. </p><h2>  Sergey Uvarkin </h2><p>  This unique Safari Park (Lipetsk region) belongs to the largest agricultural enterprise in the region, AOP ‚ÄúAurora‚Äù.  Sergey Nikolaevich Uvarkin was the general director and main owner of this enterprise, was the founder of this unique complex.  It was an amazing person.  He was known not only in his small homeland, they knew about him throughout Russia.  In addition to creating a Safari Park, he restored several temples at his own expense.  At its enterprises the best agricultural machinery is working.  Colleagues and subordinates spoke of him as a talented leader and businessman.  In the Safari Park Book of Reviews, the kindest and warmest words are addressed to this person.  Thinking over this project, Sergey Nikolaevich dreamed of a free resting place for people.  He wanted to see smiles on children's faces.  Today we can say with confidence - he managed to do it by 200%. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="safari park lipetsk region photo" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/459740.jpg" width="600"></div>
