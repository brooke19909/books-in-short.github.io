Technical characteristics and the principle of the "Autodoria"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Ensuring traffic safety on roads is one of the priority tasks that are being solved in our country at present.  Poor quality of road surface requires strict observance of traffic rules from drivers - the slightest mistake or neglect of the established traffic regulations can lead to serious accidents with serious consequences. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="autodoria what is it" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1795625.jpg" width="441"></div>  Already become "traditional" electromagnetic radars that record the speed of movement, as well as road surveillance cameras installed on some routes, can not cope with their duties.  Specially for speed control, the Avtodoria complex was developed.  What is it and what is its principle of work, we will try to figure it out.

    <h2>  Intelligent control system </h2><p>  "Avtodoriya" is a hardware and software system designed to register the speed of vehicles, compare it with the permissible speed mode and fix violators of traffic rules.  But unlike the radars common at the given moment of time, the system works on a completely different principle. </p><p>  At the heart of modern electromagnetic radars is the Doppler effect: the device emits a signal, and then catches its reflection from the car.  If the vehicle was moving, the frequencies of the emitted and reflected signals do not match.  This difference between the signals is strictly fixed and determined for each vehicle speed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The principle of operation of "Avtodoriya" is completely different.  The complex does not measure the frequency of the propagated signal, but directly the speed of the car.  By <span>measuring the distance</span> and time during which the vehicle has traveled this interval, and substituting the data in the simplest formula V = S / t, the speed is calculated. </p><h2>  The composition of the complex </h2><p>  Unlike the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù systems of monitoring and control over the high-speed regime, which cover a section of the track of small length, the Avtodoriya complex is able to record the speed of vehicles in sections from 500 meters to 10 km in length, leaving no chance for offenders. </p><p>  To answer the question: ‚ÄúWhat is‚Äú Avtodoriya ‚Äù?‚Äù, You need to deal with the set of devices that make up the complex.  One of the key elements is a motion recorder.  It performs the function of fixing the fact of the movement of the car on a certain section of the road.  It has an integrated GLONASS system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how autodoria works" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1795624.jpg" width="600"></div>  The second key element is the Unified Computing Center - special software that perceives the entire <span>data stream</span> transmitted by the registrars and processes it using parallel computing methods.  EVC is also connected to the GLONASS system.

As noted earlier, the complex fixes the speed limit in sections from 500 to 10,000 meters long. </p><p>  During this period of the road, registrars are installed at a certain distance from each other.  A pair of adjacent such devices form a control zone.  Both devices register the car's license plate, determine its location and time.  After that, the data is ‚Äúmarked‚Äù with an electronic digital signature and transmitted to the EVC. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="autodoria working principle" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1795627.jpg" width="600"></div>  The Avtodoriya Unified Computing Center (which we have already found out), having received data from a pair of registrars, compares the license plate number, determines the location of the car at the beginning of the control zone and at the end, as well as the time for which the car traveled this period of the road.  Using the simplest computational operations, the center calculates the average speed and, in case of exceeding the speed limit, automatically draws up a penalty receipt.

    <p>  The administrative case resolution contains photographs of the offender at both points of the control zone, the time and place of fixation.  The act is signed by digital signature, which gives it legal force. </p><h2>  The advantages of the complex </h2><p>  The characteristics of Avtodoriya allow it to record offenders in three-lane sections up to 10 km long - this is one of the main advantages of the hardware and software complex.  The second advantage of the system is that motion control is carried out without the use of radar, laser or electromagnetic rays.  This leads to high accuracy of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="race track characteristics" class="if" height="222" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1795630.jpg" width="600"></div>  The third and one of the controversial advantages is autonomy.  The complex is able to carry out all operations, up to sending penal receipts to the offender, without human intervention.  On the other hand, a fully autonomous system can be hacked, which puts thousands of drivers at risk of being fined.

    <p>  As the last feature we can name the compatibility of the device with other devices.  The technical characteristics of Avtodoriya allow it to be used to register other violations, for example, dipped beam headlights, not fastened seat belts, and others. </p><h2>  Roads features </h2><p>  In addition to control over the speed limit, the Avtodoriya complex is used for search activities.  With its help, employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the future will more efficiently and quickly find vehicles in theft, as well as block the movement of criminals. </p><p>  Another additional function of the system is monitoring the road section.  The complex determines the average flow rate of the vehicle, their number and, based on this, provides data on traffic congestion.  In the future, this may be used to prevent traffic jams. </p><h2>  What does the complex look like? </h2><p>  Avtodoria radars are mounted on ordinary lampposts located along the highway.  They are massive rectangular instruments with sloping front and rear walls.  You can find out what Autodoria looks like by looking at the photo below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="race track looks like" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1795626.jpg" width="450"></div>  It is not difficult to recognize the device, but you can only do this at a distance of 50-100 meters, and the fixing of offenses occurs at a distance of 500 meters.  Car registration takes place in both directions, as video devices are located on both sides.

    <h2>  Is it possible to trick the system? </h2><p>  Craftsmen have not yet come up with effective ways to deceive the Avtodoria complex.  Therefore, you should not be interested in various offers on the Internet - all these are tricks thanks to which scammers earn a living. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="autodoria technical specifications" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1795628.jpg" width="486"></div>  But there is still a way to ‚Äúnot be fined‚Äù.  To do this, you just need to follow the rules of the road, at least in those areas where the radars of the complex are installed.  Thanks to GPS technology, car enthusiasts have long drawn up a map of the location of Avtodoriya systems.  Entering it in the GPS navigator, you will not get caught at speeding.
