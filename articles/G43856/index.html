  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to create an Apple ID: step-by-step instructions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are two giants of mobile operating systems in the world.  This is Apple‚Äôs iOS and Google‚Äôs Android.  If in the first case, IOS can only be installed in phones from the company that produces them.  That things with the "android" are different.  For a fee, they can use all the companies that produce smartphones.  Everyone who has switched from one Android mobile platform to an iPhone is probably interested in the question of how <span>to create an Apple ID?</span> </p><h2>  Benefits provided to the user when registering for Apple Idi </h2><p>  You become a full user of your iPhone.  You can download games, as well as some applications.  Of course, as in the case of the "Play Market" on the "Android".  The Apple Store will have to pay for using some applications.  But there are seasonal discounts and you can grab a game you like almost for nothing.  Sometimes application developers make them temporarily free.  And then everyone can get the cherished thing forever and without payment.  Therefore, creating <span>an Apple</span> Id <span>account</span> is so important.  It also allows you to use other services from the company "apple" company. </p><h2>  Five advantages of using Apple ID </h2><p>  The full list of features that registration on the iphone provides is as follows: </p><ol><li>  The ability to install applications on the App Store for free. </li><li>  Listening to licensed music through the iTunes Store. </li><li>  Using provided messengers, such as iMessage, FaceTime or any other. </li><li>  If the device was lost, there is the possibility of its preventive blocking and search through a special service from the "apple" company. </li><li>  Work with iCloud cloud storage from Apple. </li></ol><p>  Now we know about the various bonuses provided when registering an account, and it's time to learn how to create an Apple ID on an iPhone.  For convenience, all actions are divided into several stages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First stage.  Register at the store </h2><p>  You need to go to the App Store, for this you need to find the corresponding application icon on the phone‚Äôs home screen.  Once you‚Äôve entered the Apple Store, you‚Äôll need to find the ‚ÄúFree Applications‚Äù tab.  In the list of games provided to you, choose what you like best and download.  It is possible to download an application that costs money.  In this case, you will need to enter a card or mobile phone number.  Once you have selected the desired application, click on the ‚ÄúFree‚Äù button.  We almost learned how to create an Apple ID on an iPhone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Login on the site" class="if uuid-2354997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2354997.jpg"></div><h2>  Stage Two.  Create New Account </h2><p>  The button, which was called ‚ÄúFree,‚Äù will now look like ‚ÄúInstall.‚Äù  Click on it again, and a new window will appear in front of you, where you need to select the download method.  Either from the existing Apple Idy or create another. </p><p>  Now we will learn how to create a new Apple ID on an iPhone.  To do this, click on the "Create New" item and in the window that opens, select the country in which you are currently located or live. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gurugadgets.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to create apple id" class="if uuid-2355000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2355000.jpg"></div><h2>  The third stage.  Agreement with all terms </h2><p>  As usual, you will be presented with a license agreement between you and the company.  In an open window, you must agree that you have read the information and carefully read it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Then you will be asked to indicate your email account.  This is in order to create an Apple ID account.  There are no preferences for mail, you can specify both your Gmail and the address from Mail or Yandex. </p><p>  In case you forget your Apple ID password, you can recover it through your email.  A notification will be sent to you with a link to restore the forgotten password. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kto-chto-gde.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone Iphone" class="if uuid-2355004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2355004.jpg"></div><h2>  Security measures </h2><p>  The most important step of all is to create your unique password.  You need to create a password, which will consist of various combinations of numbers and letters.  Be extremely careful and do not use your personal data in the password (such as the year of birth or your first name with last name). </p><p>  It is also not recommended to use passwords consisting only of numbers or letters.  Or primitive ones that are easy to pick up.  Carefully and carefully approach this action.  It is best to have a password consisting of the following sequence: digit-letter and so on.  And in order not to forget it, write it down on some paper. </p><p>  The importance of the stage is due to the fact that your password can be compromised in various ways.  And then you risk losing not only your personal data, but also your phone forever. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kto-chto-gde.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Account creation" class="if uuid-2355001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2355001.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional protective measures </h2><p>  Large services always use secret questions.  After all, you can forget the password and even lose the sheet where it is written.  A letter to the mail does not always save. </p><p>  Often people do not use the same email.  And they are created only for registration on certain services, and then safely forgotten.  For example, they learned how to create an Apple Id, registered a box and with a calm soul ejected all the information from memory. </p><p>  In a new window, you will have the opportunity to create a secret question that will help you recover data from Apple Idi in the future.  Here, as with the password case, you need to be extremely careful and not ask questions like ‚ÄúWhat is my name?‚Äù  or "What is the name of my first dog?"  It must be something extremely personal for you that will never fly out of your head.  Knowing how to create a new Apple ID on an iPhone makes you a more technically advanced person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="picshype.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple Idy" class="if uuid-2354993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2354993.jpg"></div><h2>  Profile Filling </h2><p>  Once all past actions have been completed, you will need to fill out personal data.  Namely, the date of your birth.  After you have indicated everything, a new window opens before you, where you are offered to choose the method by which payment will be made in the service.  It contains all the available international settlement systems. </p><p>  After that, you are prompted to enter your first and last name.  And also fill out a line about your place of residence, it is important to indicate exactly the country in which you are currently located or will be living for the next few years.  Then you indicate the world index of your state and your address.  We almost learned how to create an Apple ID. </p><div class="photo" data-original="appsgames.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Password reset" class="if uuid-2354994" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2354994.jpg"></div><h2>  Mail letter </h2><p>  This is the practical completion of all actions.  A letter is sent to the mailbox you have indicated about the end of registration in the service.  It indicates the password and username from your Apple Idy account. </p><p>  If you can‚Äôt remember your login details, copy them to a separate document.  And so it‚Äôs even better, because there will always be an opportunity to return to them.  Then go to your mobile device and select the App Store application, find the profile and fill in the "login and password" fields.  Now you know how to create an Apple ID, and you can freely download applications from the store. </p><h2>  The second method of registration in the service </h2><p>  If the first is well suited for those who use mobile devices, the second is suitable for users of Apple MacBook or computers.  To implement it you need to download iTunes.  Below is a list of actions to create an Apple ID: </p><ol><li>  Install and run the program in the iTunes Store.  Next, click on any available application and click on Free or "Free." </li><li>  In the new window, select "Create Apple ID" and click "Continue." </li><li>  You agree to the license agreement by clicking on "I agree." </li><li>  Provide personal information, come up with a password and ask three security questions and so on. </li><li>  You are asked for your billing information.  If you do not reside in the USA, then scroll to the top of the page and click on the inscription click here.  Now, instead of states, you can specify your country. </li><li>  After the fifth step, a new page will open before you, enter your address and confirm the action by clicking on the "Create Apple Id" button. </li><li>  You will receive an email.  There is a link in it that you need to click to confirm the registration of the account. </li></ol><p>  Now you know how to create an Apple Id in two ways.  And which one to choose is up to you. </p>
