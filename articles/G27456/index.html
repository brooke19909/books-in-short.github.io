It is the most environmentally friendly product, as it is of plant origin.  In appearance, microcrystalline cellulose is a water-insoluble snow-white, loose, loose, fine-grained powder, devoid of taste and smell. </p><p>  This substance has very wide application in various fields of modern industry.  This is a very valuable and very common <span>food supplement,</span> which is part of confectionery and bakery products, ice cream, sauces, low-calorie dairy products, and also used as a filter material.  It is approved for use, and in the composition printed on the packaging of food products, it can be designated as E-460, powder cellulose, cellulose, MCC, cellulose (I), Microcrystalline cellulose, (II), Powdered Cellulose. </p><p>  In medicine, microcrystalline cellulose is the main filler of drugs, is part of cosmetic creams, emulsions, dyes.  Adhesive dental materials and sanitary napkins are made from it.  Tablets containing MCC as a filler are characterized by good ability to release medicinal substances and a fast decay rate.  This substance does not react with natural extracts, enzymes and vitamins, which are somehow contained in tablet forms of drugs, and therefore cannot change their properties.  In the chemical industry, microcrystalline cellulose is considered an excellent thickener and sorbent.  It is used as raw material for the production of porous materials, ceramics, rubber and polyurethanes, heat-resistant bitumen coatings, and as a welding electrode. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, microcrystalline cellulose has another purpose and is used as a rather effective <span>means for losing weight.</span>  Food MCC is able to perfectly cleanse the <span>small intestine.</span>  Creating the illusion of satiety, it helps to dull the hunger and reduce the amount of food consumed by a person.  In pharmacies, this drug is sold under the names "Microcel", "Ankir", "MKC-229" in the form of powder or tablets.  It has no contraindications or side effects. </p><p>  <span>Microcrystalline cellulose, the instruction of</span> which recommends using it in courses of 3-4 weeks, is taken no more than 25 grams per day to achieve the effect of losing weight.  You should start with small doses - 10 pieces of tablets per day, then gradually increasing the dose to 15 pieces.  There are two ways to use microcrystalline cellulose in order to reduce excess weight: take tablets before or instead of the main meal or add powder to the prepared dishes - in meat or fish mince, in dough, porridge or egg white.  You can replace MCC tablets with afternoon tea or dinner.  It should be noted that it is absolutely tasteless and does not lose its beneficial properties even during heat treatment. </p><p>  Microcrystalline cellulose, reviews on the use of which are very diverse in the network, will be effective only in combination with low-calorie diets and moderate physical activity.  Independent reception of it or short-term use will not give the desired result.  In this case, you must constantly monitor the amount of fluid you drink, at least one and a half liters daily, otherwise there is a high risk of constipation and problems with the intestines.  To maintain the normal functioning of the digestive tract, it is advisable to combine microcrystalline cellulose with products that have a mild laxative effect, such as prunes, rhubarb and beetroot.  In most cases, the effect of the use of MCC becomes noticeable already on the 10th day. </p>
