The city is big enough, there is entertainment for everyone to taste, quiet family and noisy, youth hotels.  Of the attractions here I want to highlight the unique landscape natural complexes.  These are mountains and valleys, waterfalls and rivers, geysers and architectural monuments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The ideal time of year for sightseeing is spring and autumn.  However, before going on a trip, you need to choose a hotel for yourself, because in the season it is very crowded.  We invite you to learn more about what Alushta is.
