The architect‚Äôs favorite project is a loft on Filippovsky Lane, which was completed a long time ago and turned out to be cozy, bright and very comfortable.  This project was carried out practically in one breath, inexpensively and very quickly.  The result was a very spectacular object.

    <p>  Cozy was a restaurant located in the bank building.  The interior is created with classic elements, namely: </p><ul><li>  chandeliers; </li><li>  ivory piano; </li><li>  mirrors in frames. </li></ul><p>  The loft in Zhukovka turned out to be rather unusual.  There is a kind of transparency in this interior, since all the doors are almost absent, and the general space is free from all sorts of styles.  This interior perfectly combines glass, simple shapes, and there is not a single extra detail. </p><p>  Almost all of the projects are executed in a recognizable style, in which the creative approach of the master to the arrangement of the interior is immediately read. </p><h2>  Architect's look at work </h2><p>  The architect Boris Uborevich-Borovsky believes that you need to create the interior in such a way that it is most comfortable for human life.  In his works, he tries to look at the arrangement of living space as a designer, to work with the plane and volume. </p>

He is convinced that the living space should be only a background and emphasize the person who lives in it.  However, despite the fact that the arrangement of the living space is only a background, it should be as functional, decent and convenient as possible.  The main task of the architect is that he must understand the customer and imbue his interests.

    <p>  The designer pays a lot of attention to space and its formation.  In this case, it is necessary to create a single space of the entire apartment.  He tries to remove all the doors and dull walls to make the interior easier and more spacious. </p><h2>  Master about his work </h2><p>  The basic principle of the work of the architect Uborevich-Borovsky is very simple, but at the same time quite convincing.  The team of craftsmen works in the principle of minimalism, trying to strictly follow the basic architectural rules. </p><p>  Corporate identity is always guessed almost unmistakably, as it is characterized by: </p><ul><li>  concise design; </li><li>  graphics; </li><li>  neutral palette; </li><li>  straightforwardness. </li></ul><p>  However, at the same time, the master claims that he never thinks about how to make a building or interior more conceptual.  The most important thing for him is to create an interesting project.  Regardless of whether the interior is a penthouse or a residential complex, the workshop always tries to work in a modern style.  However, despite the desire to introduce the most fashionable trends in the interior, they are quite realistic and designed for people. </p>
