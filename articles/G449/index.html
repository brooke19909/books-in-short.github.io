They claim that Aya is a cape formerly called Kriumetopon.  It was on him that the navigators of antiquity were oriented when they sailed to Tauris.  In any case, this is a great place, the beauty of which can be judged even by looking at the photo.  Cape Ayia has a long and rich history, there are gorgeous fauna and flora, which may be interested in even the most avid lover of botany or zoology.

    <h2>  What's interesting here </h2><p>  There is a conservation area, which includes Ayia itself - a cape of striking beauty, as well as some other territories, in total 1340 hectares. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you climb to the top of the cape, you can see a large funnel, in which there are boulders of different colors and tones.  You can find blue, beautiful green, even red or with speckled or striped patterns. </p><p>  Going down to the foot, you can see numerous grottoes in which there is beautiful azure water.  Previously, this territory was used by sailors who served in the fleet of the Russian emperor.  Here guns used on ships were shot.  Traces from the cores are still visible.  There are very few monuments of man-made origin.  They are usually interested in archaeologists and historians.  Although tourists also find it interesting to look at the ruins of the places of residence of ancient people who are in Ayazma, a beautiful tract. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting places </h2><p>  There is a parking lot of primitive people, preserved since the Neolithic era.  It is located on the territory of Laspi Bay, which is deservedly called the most beautiful bay in the whole Crimea.  Local landscapes deserve the most enthusiastic attention.  Cape Ayia gives great <span>aesthetic pleasure</span> .  Rest here leaves an amazing impression. </p><p>  It is definitely worth a visit to Figs.  Why is the area called that way?  Because of the rock, which is extremely similar to this fruit.  The local beaches and nature deserve all praise, but besides them, the place has another interesting point - a mountain called Ilyas Kala.  There are the ruins of a monastery of the same name. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This territory has become a conservation area not so long ago, namely since 1982, however, creative people who love <span>beautiful landscapes have</span> come here for a very long time.  It is hard to recall a personality more popular than Aivazovsky, he created the work ‚ÄúThe Storm at Cape Ayia‚Äù here, in 1875. </p>

Fortunately, there is a settlement "Speleologist", where you can spend the night. </p><p>  You can get into it by going to the very shore, rising to a height of 75 meters above sea level.  Each tent can accommodate three people.  It features mattresses, soft pillows and warm blankets. </p><p>  You can eat in the <span>field kitchen,</span> sit on a bench at the table, hiding from the sun and weather under an awning.

Of course, it is not very convenient due to the fact that the stones are large, but if you spread a towel, this does not hurt to enjoy a wonderful pastime. </p>
