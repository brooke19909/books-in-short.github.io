    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, this is the best hotel in the whole city.  It combines style and a surprisingly warm homely atmosphere, and the friendly staff will be able to make your stay especially enjoyable, fulfilling any of your wishes.  However, not only ordinary tourists leave their reviews about this hotel.  Recently visited and "Revizorro" in Nizhny Novgorod.  The Volna Hotel first of all interested them, and Anna Flying decided to check how this hotel corresponds to its high status.  Despite a rather strict exam, to which she subjected not only the apartments themselves, but also the professionalism of the staff, as well as the restaurant menu, all the marks turned out to be the highest.  Of course, this hotel deserves the title of the best.  Evaluation of five points out of five possible is the best compliment that such a strict judge could make.  Summing up, I would like to note that in the Volna hotel very often solemn weddings take place, and usually a few days of stay in stunning wedding rooms become a gift from the hotel.  This is a great end to a bright holiday. </p>
