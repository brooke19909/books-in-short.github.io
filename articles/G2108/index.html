And what panoramas open to those who climb the upper plateau: forests and valleys covered with lavender, the sea and the immense expanse of the sky, where it seems that you can reach the birds by hand! </p><p>  Mountains and caves are especially popular with tourists.  Chatyr-dag is a mountain range in the south of the peninsula.  The name translates as "Tabernacle Mountain."  The more ancient Greek name ‚ÄúTrapezunt‚Äù, or <span>‚ÄúTable Mountain‚Äù,</span> is also known <span>.</span>  They are located on a wavy plateau (yayla), which is located at an altitude of about one and a half km above sea level in a protected forest.  As you climb, unforgettable views of the mountain peaks will open.  Next comes the descent into their depths - caves.  Chatyr-dag formed them from clay-like rocks that do not dissolve in water;  hard rocks mixed with quartz and sandstones.  Marble, oddly enough, is not in them.  Several million years were not enough for it to form.  Mysterious and impressive caves.  Chatyr-dag and without marble is incredibly beautiful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chatyr Dag caves" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1388361.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lower Plateau Chatyr-Dag </h2><p>  In the fifth century BC, hunters and herders settled in the grottoes.  Now it is a popular tourist attraction.  In particular, such caves as Marble, which was included in the 5 most beautiful caves of the Earth, Emine-Bair-Khosar (Mammoth, or a funnel at the hill of Emine), Emine-Bair-Koba (red-brown funnel of Emine), Thousand-headed.  Two first caves are fully adapted to the needs of tourists.  Chatyr-dag with magnificent stone icicles flowing down from the ceiling, and growing cones and pillars from the bottom will delight even a sophisticated tourist. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Magic caves </h2><p>  A complex system of halls and galleries was discovered by cavers in 1987.  A year later, a tourist center was created, which is still active today - Onyx Tour.  This center is made available for visiting Chatyr-Dag.  The marble cave is equipped with paths with handrails, lighting, musical accompaniment.  Experienced and beginner guides work in it.  In the Marble Cave there are several halls that are cool, so the tourist needs to stock up on warm clothes and shoes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chatyr Dag marble cave" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1388362.jpg" width="600"></div>  The route "Chatyr-Dag Caves" is very interesting.  The tour is thought out so that it is suitable for any age.  Chatyr-dag will now begin to tell its tales, having led tourists along a 10-meter passage.  The mystery begins from the entrance: silence, cold and dusk reign here.

    <h2>  First hall </h2><p>  Meeting: in front of the tourists the owner of the Marble Cave.  Huge head, crocheted nose, overhanging eyebrows, toothless mouth.  Can a photograph convey all the charm of Chatyr-Dag cave? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea caves Chatyr Dag" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1388363.jpg" width="600"></div>  They need to be placed not one, but a dozen.  Stone formations took the most unexpected forms, which a rich imagination did not even expect.

All the tourists went down to the magical realm: the Tales Gallery opens a journey into the unknown.  Stalagmites growing from the floor, and stalactites hanging from the ceiling, as well as the nods on the walls that surround the path, resemble bizarre fantasy heroes.  Here is Shrek, and next to the Princess is a frog with a crown on his head.  Look carefully, do not miss Santa Claus with the Snow Maiden. </p><p>  Not far from the fairy world are Pearl Lakes.  Here you can wander around them a little, if you do not want to lag behind the tour. </p><h2>  Cave beast </h2><p>  The walk continues with a passage to the side of the Tiger Run.  Here, at the bottom of the lake, the skeleton of a predator was found and suggested that it belongs to the saber-toothed tiger.  After a careful study of the remains, it was found out that it was a <span>cave lion,</span> and then decided that it was possibly a bear.  But the name of the hall has already been fixed.  The view, worthy of the artist‚Äôs brush, opens up on sagging columns and curtains, water baths and ‚Äústone flowers‚Äù. </p><h2>  Landslide hall </h2><p>  Otherwise, it is called the Perestroika Hall.  Its size is grandiose.  Imagine a stadium with a hundred-meter track.  And its height will quietly accommodate a building of nine floors.  The walls and floor are decorated with intricate <span>stalactites and stalagmites,</span> which at times merge into a single whole - stalagnates.  Their shape is so whimsical that they can be examined for hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chatyr Dag caves excursion" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1388364.jpg" width="600"></div>  From here, you can see the next Palace Hall, where the ‚ÄúKing‚Äù and ‚ÄúQueen‚Äù are located.  They are accompanied by a retinue of stalagmites.

    <h2>  Road to the lower world </h2><p>  From the landslide hall, a descent begins between the stone blocks and along the passages through the narrow slots into the Pink Hall.  Everything is present in this grotto: natyki on the walls, flowers on the ceiling, skeletons of unknown animals under the stones.  Below there are five more arranged for viewing caves. </p><h2>  Crimea, Chatyr-Dag caves </h2><p>  Not only the Marble Cave is famous for the <span>mountains of Chatyr-Dag.</span>  Emine-Bair-Khosar Cave has retained in many ways its natural appearance.  It is divided into three floors.  Tourists can visit only the first, but this is enough.  It contains the skeletons of prehistoric animals that fell into it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chatyr Dag caves photo" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1388365.jpg" width="600"></div>  The photo shows the skeleton of a mammoth, which is located in a cave from the Ice Age.  Inside there is a lake filled with pure water, as well as the Hall of Idols.  These are stalagmites incredibly grown in height (10 m).  One of the stalactites looks like a Monomakh hat.  There is also a hall of the Dead Sea - a lake with waves without water.

    <p>  The thousand-headed, or Binbash-Koba cave, thanks to the barbarians, is not very well preserved.  The entrance to the cave is narrow and cramped.  Then it turns into a small hall, bypassing which you can get big. </p><p>  A sad local legend is associated with it.  According to legend, when the enemies came, all the inhabitants here hid.  Girls went out later for water.  She spilled, and beautiful flowers grew along the path.  Enemies came for civilians and destroyed them all.  More true is another story.  For centuries, ritual burials have been held here.  Hence, many skeletons and skulls.  They cannot be found now.  As far back as the century before last, their sale for souvenirs began. </p><p>  ‚ÄúAmateurs‚Äù with axes came here and cut down exotic stalagmites, and that they could not carry away, they tumbled down.  But the removal of stalagmites did not bring them any benefit.  They are stored only at a certain humidity and temperature, and under normal conditions, quickly destroyed. </p><p>  It is forbidden to make bonfires in all Crimean caves and leave trash and inscriptions behind.  Do not be like vandals.  It is impossible to revive natural monuments. </p>
