If you choose the best mobile browser, it will be able to speed up even slow and unresponsive pages, upload images, save your passwords and add third-party plugins.  It‚Äôs hard to find a browser that meets all your requirements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.computerworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best mobile browser" class="if uuid-3104689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3104689.jpg"></div><p>  Fortunately for us, progress does not stand still; today it is possible to install intuitive and reliable services available on the Web without any problems.  Ultimately, this is a matter of taste: you should find a browser that matches your needs.  Below is a list of the best mobile internet browsers.  Study their description and make your choice. </p><h2>  "Google Chrome" </h2><p>  Google Chrome has many features, including the ability to search from the address bar, browse private web pages incognito, and automatically fill out web forms with your information.  The default Chrome homepage is also surprisingly useful.  She offers to read news articles that you like, and also provides links to your favorite resources.  You can also save any web page for offline viewing - this is useful if you want to watch something later.  Safe Browsing by Google, in addition, warns you of potentially dangerous links, and the added translator ensures that no page can deter you from reading continuously. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.itpro.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best mobile browser" class="if uuid-3104692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3104692.jpg"></div><p>  Not surprisingly, Chrome could become the best mobile browser for Android if you have a Google account.  After logging into your account, it synchronizes your tabs, bookmarks and history on different devices, saves your usernames and passwords, and automatically completes your Internet search. </p><p>  However, you don‚Äôt need a Google account to take advantage of the tabbed browser, which allows you to switch between web pages with a few taps.  The same goes for the Data Saver service, which compresses fonts, images, and other web objects to speed up browsing and reduce the use of your data by 60 percent, according to Google statistics. </p><h2>  "Opera" </h2><p>  Opera Mobile from the Opera team for Windows and MacOS is regularly updated with new features with free updates.  Users rightly believe that this is the best browser for a mobile phone.  Here are some of its latest options: </p><ul><li>  built-in ad blocker that removes ads from web pages; </li><li>  Updated search bar that can scan QR codes </li><li>  smart news feed on your homepage recommending reading news. </li></ul><p>  There is a very useful incognito mode if you need to visit sites anonymously, and a built-in data warehouse is available that allows you to save the information you like.  The browser supports tabbed browsing, has a password management system and can automatically fill out forms if you select this function.  Like Chrome, if you log in with an Opera account, it will begin to sync your sessions with other devices that are currently logged in. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="connectnigeria.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best mobile internet browser" class="if uuid-3104694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3104694.jpg"></div><h2>  Firefox </h2><p>  Firefox from the non-profit developer Mozilla Foundation is interesting in that it supports add-ons - third-party tools that expand the capabilities of your browser in various ways.  For this opportunity, some experts call it the best mobile Internet browser. </p><p>  So, AdBlock Plus plugins, Speechify text-to-speech mechanism and LastPass password manager are available in it - and these are only the main options.  Add-ons also include themes that you can use to change the look of your browser so that you can truly personalize your browsing. </p><p>  But add-ons aren't Firefox's only contribution to mobile browsers.  Its best features are some additional features.  It has a night view mode that changes the colors of the web page to minimize eye fatigue from blue light.  It also has a robust set of privacy controls that block ad networks from tracking your browsing habits.  In addition, Firefox has bookmarks, password saving and tab synchronization features that are unmatched. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best mobile browser for android" class="if uuid-3104691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3104691.jpg"></div><h2>  Firefox focus </h2><p>  What is the best mobile browser for safe surfing?  The Mozilla Firefox browser is good for general-purpose web pages, but if you're looking for something more secure, you should choose Firefox Focus. </p><p>  The application has an optimized stripped-down interface that hides ads and displays how many tracking algorithms are actively blocked on any page, and periodically reminds you to erase the browsing history.  Firefox Focus enables users to glide over the Internet like a ghost, being sure that you can easily avoid tracking ads and other such troubles.  We can say that it is perfect for phones with limited memory, since the download takes only 4 MB. </p><h2>  Dolphin </h2><p>  This browser was released a little over four years ago, but it has managed to stay relevant with features like Dolphin Sonar, which allows you to search for information by voice, as well as share content for social networks.  Of course, you can do many of these things with artificial intelligence assistants, but it's nice to integrate them into your browser anyway. </p><div class="photo" data-original="static1.squarespace.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best mobile phone browser" class="if uuid-3104696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3104696.jpg"></div><p>  Gesture browsing allows you to create bookmarks for web pages using finger gestures, and the Webzine option (Dolphin's answer to Flipboard) combines about 300 internet sources on various topics in a stand-alone magazine-style digest. </p><p>  Dolphin is competitive in other respects, and some consider it to be its best mobile browser.  Like Puffin or Firefox, it supports add-ons, tabbed browsing, anonymous browsing, and password synchronization.  In addition, it syncs through Dolphin Connect.  To do this, log into your Facebook or Google account and download the appropriate Firefox or Chrome extension to your computer, and your history, tabs and bookmarks from your mobile phone will be displayed in the background.  In addition, Dolphin is considered one of the best mobile browsers for the iPhone. </p><h2>  Samsung Internet Browser Beta </h2><p>  Samsung‚Äôs Internet browser with the appropriate name is full of useful options.  It supports ad blockers such as Disconnect and AdBlock, as well as a high-contrast viewing mode designed for users with low vision.  There is a built-in download manager.  In addition, you can use the browser to synchronize saved pages, bookmarks and tabs with third-party devices through the Chrome extension. </p><p>  This is the best mobile browser to use with a Gear VR or Dex Station headset that will automatically work with both of these accessories.  It is available for all Android devices with version 5.0 of Lollipop or later. </p><h2>  Ecosia </h2><p>  Many will speak out for nature conservation.  Ecosia is a browser with a search option that encourages users to improve the environmental situation in the world.  As much as 80 percent of the profit from using the browser is spent on planting new trees.  Developers hope to plant a billion seedlings by 2020. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.popsci.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the best mobile browser" class="if uuid-3104697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3104697.jpg"></div><p>  This is a very good environmental argument and a good reason to download this browser.  It is based on Chromium, so if you used Chrome, you won‚Äôt notice too much change compared to what you‚Äôre used to.  Ecosia publishes all receipts for the purchase of trees on its website, as well as reports on financial spending - so you can be sure that the money you spend will not be wasted. </p><h2>  Microsoft edge </h2><p>  Many undeservedly skip this service only because they see Microsoft in the name.  Despite the fact that this company does not have a very good reputation in mobile phones, do not let this distract you from the real applications of Microsoft Edge. </p><p>  First of all, because if you use this browser on any other device, you can continue to view the page from where you left off on your phone.  Here you will find all your passwords, favorite sites and reading list.  The Hub View option makes it easy to find your favorite and new content, and the text reading mode makes it easier to browse.  The app even has a QR code reader and voice search.  Of course, he lacks the frills of some other browsers, but if you use Edge on another device, it is useful to install it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.microsoft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile internet browsers list of the best" class="if uuid-3104699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3104699.jpg"></div><h2>  DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser </h2><p>  The DuckDuckGo search engine was initially convenient for those who did not like tracking Google searches, and a browser with that name now means that users who prefer privacy can easily browse web pages from their phone without worrying about Big Brother style issues. ". </p><p>  The DuckDuckGo browser forces web sites to use encryption, blocks the display of ad trackers, and never starts tracking your searches.  It also evaluates individual sites for confidentiality using a rating range from ‚ÄúA‚Äù to ‚ÄúF‚Äù.  When you finish surfing and want to erase the history, the Fire button erases all data and open tabs with one click. </p><h2>  Phoenix browser </h2><p>  Compared to other browsers, Phoenix Browser offers super-customizable browsing.  It's smooth and fast, as you would expect from any browser these days, but what makes it stand out is the breadth of options available. </p><p>  There are several functions aimed at reducing the use of mobile data, including the ability to download entire web pages for delayed viewing, as well as the "no pictures" mode, which removes images with a large amount of data for those who have accounting traffic.  Phoenix Browser can also download videos from streaming websites. </p><h2>  Final word </h2><p>  After reviewing the above brief reviews, you can decide which mobile browser is best for you.  As you can see, a single recommendation does not exist.  It all depends on what criteria play the most important role for you.  From the list of browsers presented above, you can choose a variety of options.  Some of the above examples offer enhanced functionality and speed, while others focus more on privacy and security. </p>
