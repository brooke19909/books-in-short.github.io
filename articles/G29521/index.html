Interesting facts about carnivorous mammals, insectivores</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mammals are amazing animals that have filled our planet from the hottest countries of Africa to cold Antarctica.  They can be found almost everywhere, these unique inhabitants of our globe are very similar in behavior to humans: they also care for their cubs, feed them milk and take care of them.  An interesting fact about mammals: previously, an animal such as a beaver was considered a fish, so the Catholic Church used its meat on fasting days, Orthodox believers generally refused to eat such a product, because they were sure that it was a saint. </p><h2>  Experimental rats </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting fact about mammals" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39187/990499.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Now in many countries some mammals have been tamed and made pets, for example, a cow, a goat, an ox.  An interesting fact about mammals: mice are by far the most common experimental subjects, which by their example show the side effects of a drug invented.  It has also been proven that mice can completely repair damaged tissue of the heart muscles, which shocked all the laboratories in the world.  Previously, mammals did not have such an opportunity, since they stand higher in the evolutionary ladder. </p><h2>  Scary beasts </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting facts about predatory mammals" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39187/990501.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Mammals also include tigers, jaguars, cougars, which are <span>predatory animals of</span> our planet.  Despite their awesome appearance, many scientists are still studying their behavior and habitat.  Interesting facts about predatory mammals on the example of a tiger: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  one animal has in its skin more than 100 stripes of color, while tigers with the same color cannot be found; </li><li>  a small tiger can eat 30 kilograms of meat in one meal; </li><li>  if you shave the animal, the stripes will remain on the body; </li><li>  it is estimated that around 6,000 of these mammals are left in the world; </li><li>  tigers mark territory with urine and scratches on the doors; </li><li>  animals have strong and persistent tendons on their paws, so there were cases when this species of mammals remained standing after killing. </li></ul><p>  Interesting facts about mammals can be found almost everywhere, often on some channels show programs about animals, where they talk about their most incredible behavior and appearance. </p><h2>  Huge and not scary </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Interesting facts about mammals" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39187/990502.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  This characteristic includes an elephant, which represents a family of mammals and has large, directly huge sizes, striking, but not at all frightening.  In thousands of zoos you can meet these amazing animals, they amaze with their size, way of eating food, and also the amount of liquid that is removed from the body.  Interesting facts about mammals (elephants): </p><ul><li>  animals communicate with each other on high-frequency sounds that a person does not recognize; </li><li>  the average life time of elephants, like many people, is 70 years, but long-livers are also found; </li><li>  the heart of a mammal produces 30 beats per minute due to the large weight reaching 25 kilograms; </li><li>  the emotionality of animals is amazing: they know how to rejoice, cry after the loss of relatives, they also tend to take care of dying and sick members of the herd. </li></ul><p>  An interesting fact about mammals: in the 20th century, 2 public killings were committed.  For the first time, the elephant Topsy died from an electric discharge for trampling 3 people.  13 years later, another female was sentenced to death by hanging. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Unique and fluffy </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting facts about mammals" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39187/990503.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Another representative of mammals are proteins, which surprise with their originality and the ability to jump over a wide variety of distances.  It is these animals that know how to swim beautifully, lifting their tail up; if she gets it wet, she will have to go down.  An interesting fact about mammals on the example of proteins: </p><ul><li>  forgetfulness: sometimes they do not remember exactly where they piled up their supplies for the winter, and therefore they occasionally have to spend a hungry winter; </li><li>  according to rumors, the squirrel eats exclusively cones, but this is not so, she does not mind eating eggs from nests, attacking young chicks or even hares; </li><li>  on the example of these animals it is impossible to find out the time of their breeding, since it is not typical for them to breed in captivity; </li><li>  women from Croatia were strictly forbidden to eat protein meat, as it was believed that the child was born black. </li></ul><p>  No matter how absurd the interesting facts about mammals may seem, they are, indeed, such, and people sincerely believe in everything that is prescribed by their social concepts, race or faith.  It‚Äôs very scary when the inhabitants of the planet for whatever reason kill innocent animals, try to harm or even exterminate contrary to the law. </p><h2>  Growling animals </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting facts about carnivorous mammals" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39187/990504.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Mammals also include bears, which are considered <span>predatory animals.</span>  Despite their awesome and huge appearance, some of them eat insects: ants and bugs.  Interesting facts about carnivorous mammalian bears: </p><ul><li>  in psychology, it is these animals that are close to humans; </li><li>  some bears eat sweets, and therefore their teeth tend to deteriorate, fall out and even hurt; </li><li>  in recent years, seven people have been killed by polar animals in Canada; </li><li>  when an antiseptic gets on a white bear, its fur becomes purple; </li><li>  eating bear‚Äôs liver is forbidden because you can oversaturated the body with vitamin A; </li><li>  according to statistics, only pregnant females fall into hibernation. </li></ul><h2>  Murder or pardon </h2><p>  According to statistics, on our planet every year from killing and bullying suffer numerous animals that are not listed in the Red Book, but, unfortunately, are on the verge of extermination.  Many people do not even think about the fact that animals are the same full-fledged inhabitants of the planet.  Despite countless animal welfare associations, they continue to be killed.  The only thing that is not clear is whether people really care about the world around us or whether these associations work in such a way that all the money received is not actually spent in the direction. </p><p>  If you start to respect wildlife and all its inhabitants with respect, then numerous contributions to protect them will not be required, you just need to start looking at yourself.  To protect all mammals is the duty of everyone, the duty of the higher <span>human race.</span> </p>
