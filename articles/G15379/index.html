The fighting was not easy, many innocent children, fathers, mothers, young girls with children died.  They died for the future of their heirs and the country.  Even if they vomited from the inside, and the question “for what?” Always tormented, but still some kind of force forced to rise and move on. </p><p>  The open zone of defeat was inconspicuous small cities, which opened up a large training ground for military operations.  The battle at an unnamed height was an indicator that the Soviet army did not give up under any circumstances, a good result and victory was the main guideline.  Unfortunately, not so much is said about this event, as, for example, about Stalingrad, and this is completely wrong.  This fight is worthy of being studied in the school curriculum, as it is one of the most revealing demonstrating <span>what patriotism is.</span> </p><h2>  Boiling point </h2><p>  September 1943  The Oryol-Kulikovo battle was coming to an end, and Soviet troops actively launched an offensive along the entire Western Front.  The Germans were indignant and actively resisted.  In parallel with the occupation of these lands, information reached them that there was a secret “flight territory” - anonymous height. </p>

About 17 kilometers from Roslavl of the Smolensk region, a distinctly fortified zone was discovered.  She occupied a very important strategic position and was considered a secret object. </p><p>  For two days, the <span>Soviet army</span> recaptured him from the Germans.  Of the 18 guys who went into battle, only two survived. </p><p>  The Germans were initially confused, rushed through the trenches and dug trenches, but in the end they stubbornly began to take anonymous height.  After that, our soldiers nevertheless had the opportunity to distract the enemy - the incident helped them manage to remove the invader from their territory. </p><h2>  To stay alive </h2><p>  One of the survivors was simply dug out of the ground.  The brothers found him on the protruding shoes, felt the pulse and immediately began to pull out.  The Soviet hero was Eugene Lapin. </p><p>  After a long period of treatment and rehabilitation, he returned to his <span>military unit.</span>  In a short time he managed to get a few more military injuries, to learn and get to Berlin.  After the war, he returned to the city of Donetsk, but was soon evacuated with his family. </p><p>  A completely different story happened with the second surviving hero - Vlasov Konstantin Nikolaevich.  He was already listed as dead, and his family even received a funeral notice. </p><p>  In fact, the Germans captured him, then a prison and a concentration camp in Germany.  But he managed to escape with his compatriots.  In 1944, was seriously wounded, but survived. </p>

    <h2>  Excursion into the past </h2><p>  The monument “Nameless Height” was erected in October 1966 by the Soviet architect Leonid Kopylovsky.  The memorial was part of the Green Belt of Glory - <span>a complex of</span> structures on the borders of the battles for Leningrad at the beginning of the war period. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Fresh air, a pacified spirit and this nameless height ... The <span>Kaluga region</span> has preserved in its memory that which is never forgotten.  The barbaric methods of attacking and conquering territories from German enemies opened a window to the Soviet citizen into the world of fear and indignation - no one knew what would happen next. </p><p>  The exploits of Konstantin Vlasov and Evgeny Lapin awakened the <span>duty of Russian</span> citizens to honor the memory of the heroes.  In honor of this, the whole memorial complex "Nameless Height" was opened. </p><h2>  Exhibition of Times </h2><p>  In honor of the heroic feat of eighteen soldiers, in addition to the monument, they also created a museum.  He tells the story of liberation from the fascist invaders of the Kaluga region.  The exposition of the museum is very diverse: from the ammunition found during the excavation of military equipment, to sheet music on which V. E. Basner’s song “At an unnamed height” is written. </p>

    <p>  Some go further and carry out larger-scale programs after the trip: round tables, press conferences, present their own videos and photo reports. </p><p>  This project has become significant for residents of the city, in particular, for the systematic patriotic education of urban youth. </p><p>  Over the five years of the existence of such organized events, 110 people visited the memorial complex.  They certainly discovered something new.  After all, every patch of land is saturated with its unique history. </p><h2>  No one is forgotten </h2><p>  As previously mentioned, every year the “Nameless Heights” meets the military and the guys who come to honor the memory of the deceased heroes.  Significant events are not necessarily dedicated to Victory Day, many of them take place in the middle of the year. </p>

The memory of the heroes must live in human hearts forever.
