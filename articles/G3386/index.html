  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reinforced thread: description, specifications, application, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The modern textile industry pleases with newer and newer inventions.  Thanks to them, sewing becomes easier, and most importantly faster.  Among the most accustomed to her achievements is a reinforced thread.  Let's find out about its properties, varieties, and determine the purpose of the application. </p><h2>  What is reinforcement? </h2><p>  To better understand the features of the type of thread under consideration, it is worthwhile to find out what kind of process is called reinforcement.  This is the name of various ways of reinforcing one material by combining it with a more durable other.  It is the properties of the latter that are partially transferred to the former, improving its own characteristics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kanapipeline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reinforcing threads reviews" class="if uuid-2842151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2842151.jpg"></div><p>  Reinforcement is widely used in completely different industries.  In the textile industry, cosmetology, in the construction of roads, in the manufacture of reinforced concrete and stone structures, glass products, films, ceramics, gypsum, etc.  By the way, the notion ‚Äúreinforcement‚Äù, which is known to all of us, is more than closely related to this process.  These metal rods just serve to strengthen reinforced concrete structures. </p><h2>  Reinforced thread for sewing </h2><p>  Quite often after hearing such a name, some relate the studied type of thread to those that contain lurex.  However, this is a mistake.  Both species are completely different.  The fact is that Lurex (although it can be metallized or coated with foil), but is not very durable.  The purpose of these additives is to decorate products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="diy-enthusiasts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reinforced thread 10" class="if uuid-2842154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2842154.jpg"></div><p>  At the same time, from the name ‚Äúreinforced thread‚Äù itself, one can guess that its fibers are more durable compared to other varieties.  But unlike Lurex, no metal elements or their derivatives are used here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gronitex.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reinforced thread" class="if uuid-2842176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2842176.jpg"></div><p>  This <span>type of thread is</span> also called "frame".  They are distinguished by twisted weaving.  Moreover, the core is made from one type of fiber, and its braid from another.  Due to this, incredible strength and durability are achieved, with which the reinforced thread is famous </p><h2>  Distinctive properties </h2><p>  Features of this type are determined by their components and production methods. </p><p>  The core of polyester fibers gives particular strength to the reinforced yarn.  <span>Natural</span> or mixed <span>fibers</span> are used as windings.  This is done in order to protect the melting of the synthetic core when ironing, washing or other exposure to high temperatures.  Also, the braid extends the life of the thread-conducting parts of the sewing equipment by reducing the friction coefficient to 15% (compared to fully synthetic threads).  For this reason, the reinforced look is often used for overlocks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Such threads provide a high bond strength of sewing parts, as well as minimal shrinkage during wet-heat treatment.  Due to their own versatility, they are equally effective in the sewing, knitting, shoe, leather goods industries. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  There are three types of threads of this kind.  They are distinguished by the type of fiber used to braid the polyester complex core.  To understand which one is in front of you - it is worth paying attention to the two letters indicated on the coil.  The first one is always "L".  It is one for all and means the core of the thread - complex low-shrink polyester fibers.  The second is the name of the braid. </p><ul><li>  Marking "LL" means that the outer part of the thread is a polyester staple fiber, it is also a lavsan.  This variety is considered universal.  It provides high bond strength for sewing parts.  As well as good appearance and elasticity of the seam.  Most often used for overcasting sections, less often for finishing stitches. <div class="photo" data-original="dianarambles.com" data-author=": Diana Rambles, "><img itemprop="image" alt="reinforced thread 10" class="if uuid-2842181" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2842181.jpg"></div></li><li>  In LS, the second component is the siblon. </li><li>  The marking ‚ÄúLH‚Äù means that thin-fiber cotton threads act as a winding.  Although they are less durable and wear-resistant than LL, they are able to withstand temperatures up to 200 degrees. </li></ul><p>  In addition to composition, the species under study differs in footage.  For household needs, bobbins of 100-200 m are more often sold. A similar amount is quite enough for those who are engaged in sewing rarely or in small volumes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For professionals working almost every day, a reinforced thread of 1000 m, 2500 m, 3000 m is produced. </p><p>  There is an opinion that the number in front of the marking is the footage of the bobbin.  It's a delusion.  In fact, these numbers indicate the approximate nominal linear density of the threads and are measured in texes.  The most common reinforced thread 45 is LL.  This means that its linear nominal density is approximately equal to 45 tex.  More precisely 43.5 tex. </p><p>  The most common sizes are 35, 36, 44, 45, 65, 70 and 80. </p><p>  It is worth remembering that such marking is characteristic of bobbins produced only at the Spinning and Threading Plant named after  CM.  Kirov.  At the same time, it is absent in most foreign manufacturers.  Therefore, before buying it is worth consulting the seller. </p><h2>  Scope of application </h2><p>  Threads of this type are ideally suited for fastening or closing seams on products made of material of any thickness.  Their high tensile strength and wear resistance allows you to get smooth seams. </p><p>  They are also used in the production of high-strength fabrics.  As a rule, they are intended for tailoring industrial protective suits, as well as clothes for military and emergency workers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lahtipro.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reinforced thread 10" class="if uuid-2842196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2842196.jpg"></div><p>  There are far more than one type of fabric with reinforced thread.  They differ not only in its variety, but also in the way of spinning. </p><p>  The best quality materials are those in which both the weft and the warp are located yarn.  They play the role of a mesh base, between the fibers of which cotton components are more densely spun.  This design allows the material not to interfere with the thermoregulation of the body, but at the same time be more wear-resistant and tear resistant. </p><h2>  Thread lifting </h2><p>  It is possible to reinforce not only reinforced concrete structures, fabrics and fibers, but also the face.  This procedure is gaining popularity in cosmetology today.  Its essence is that special hypoallergenic threads compatible with the human body are introduced under the skin.  Their distribution in a certain order helps the person to remain in good shape. </p><p>  Reinforcement, or thread lifting also helps to smooth wrinkles and improve the general condition of the epidermis.  It also helps fight double chin and some other age-related changes.  The procedure is most often shown to patients after 50 years, but not older than 60. </p><h2>  What threads are used? </h2><p>  For lifting, specialized reinforcing threads are used.  Not reinforced!  The difference is that in the first case they serve as a reinforcing element.  In the second, they themselves underwent a hardening procedure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newbeauty.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reinforcing threads reviews" class="if uuid-2842173" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2842173.jpg"></div><p>  There are several varieties of them, differing in composition. </p><ul><li>  The so-called "golden" threads.  Steel was used to reinforce the face among the first.  In their composition there is indeed a noble aurum.  However, most of it is caprolactam and polylactic acid. </li><li>  Polypropylene or caprolactam.  Thanks to microscopic notches, they keep their shape better.  It is believed that their service life is 3-6 years. </li><li>  Threads based on non-absorbable polypropylene composition.  Serve up to 7 years. </li><li>  3D mesothreads coated with lactic acid. </li><li>  Silicone </li></ul><h2>  Reinforced film </h2><p>  Threads are used to strengthen not only tissues and facial skin, but also ordinary plastic film for greenhouses.  Thanks to the use of a mesh base from them, the material retains the advantages of a conventional film.  In addition, it acquires increased resistance to mechanical stress, more reliably protecting it from wind, hail, snowfalls and temperature extremes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.americover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reinforced film thread" class="if uuid-2842186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2842186.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, the so-called "reinforced" film consists of two ordinary canvases deposited on a mesh frame.  Its threads can be made of different materials: </p><ul><li>  lavsan; </li><li>  fiberglass; </li><li>  polypropylene; </li><li>  high pressure polyethylene. </li></ul><p>  The sizes of the mesh cells, as well as its color, may also vary. </p><p>  The use of films with reinforcing threads in greenhouses and hotbeds, according to reviews, can increase its service life by an average of up to 5 years. </p>
