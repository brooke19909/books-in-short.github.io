    <p>  New compulsory medical insurance policies have a single model for everyone.  Naturally, they have certain advantages: </p><p>  - payment for medical services is made by an insurance company, so in case of emergency you do not have to worry about the availability of funds in your pocket; </p><p>  - the possibility of undergoing examination and receiving treatment from various specialists: ENT, gastroenterologist, neurologist, surgeon and others; </p><p>  - children and adults, as well as those people who are not citizens of our country, can receive a document; </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - The policy is valid regardless of your place of registration and actual location, that is, services can be obtained throughout the state. </p><h2></h2><h2>  How and where can I get (replace) the submitted document? </h2><p>  Obtaining and replacing an MHI policy is not a very difficult procedure.  You just need to decide on the insurance company that will represent your interests.  However, it should be said that those people who do not have citizenship or do not want to draw up a document of a new form may not be in a hurry, since the old card will be suitable until you have the opportunity to do so.  The only thing to consider: you need to be in time before 2015. </p>

    <p>  Obtaining and replacing old CHI policies must be done by the employer, regardless of where you live.  If you don‚Äôt like the IC with which your boss has a contract, then you can choose another.  It should be noted that such insurance can be issued not only by force, but also voluntarily. </p><p>  If you do not work, then you can get a policy at a medical organization that provides services for your area of ‚Äã‚Äãresidence.  You can submit a written application yourself or via the Internet.  However, keep in mind that you will also have to send certified copies of some personal documents over the network.  Naturally, you can use the mail service. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After submitting such an application, you should receive a notice stating whether the policy is ready and where you can pick it up.  Often this happens within 3 days.  In order to take out insurance, a specific package of <span>personal documents</span> should be submitted to the issuing authority <span>.</span>  What you need to collect, you will learn in the next section of the article. </p><h2></h2><h2>  In which cases is a replacement policy mandatory? </h2>

In principle, if you decide to find another job, you can leave the old insurance card if the organization is serviced by the insurance company with which you have an agreement.  A feature of the presented document is that it should be issued free of charge.  In addition, compulsory replacement of compulsory medical insurance policies is carried out gradually.  Old insurance cards will be valid until the entry into force of the new single standard. </p><p>  To apply for a single sample policy, you should contact a <span>medical insurance organization</span> and submit the relevant documents.  Next, you must be issued a temporary certificate, thanks to which you can get free medical help. </p><h2></h2><h2>  What documents are needed to replace the policy? </h2>

It is used in the same way as the old insurance card.  You can safely present the policy in those medical institutions that work with your insurance company.  In this case, you do not incur any additional financial costs (unless, of course, you need procedures or medicines that are not included in the list approved in the policy). </p><p>  As for the time frame for the examination and possible hospitalization, this time can vary between 1-4 weeks.  For emergency hospitalization, this document has very mixed advantages.  You just need to remember to take it with you. </p>
