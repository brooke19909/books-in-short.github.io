A famous writer compared them to the Round Tower of Copenhagen. </p><h2>  Rundetaarn - a symbol of the city </h2><p>  The ancient building, which is the hallmark of Denmark, appeared in 1642.  The round tower of Copenhagen, located in the historic city center, near the university, was erected during the reign of King Christian IV.  At that time, astronomical fever swept Europe, and the ruler, longing for new discoveries, dreamed of a building in which they would take place.  He orders the construction of a building for scientific purposes.  In the structure, which has a cylindrical shape, there was an astronomical observatory at the city university. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.copenhagen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Local attraction" class="if uuid-2676998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2676998.jpg"></div><h2>  Unusual architecture </h2><p>  The unique monument, which became a symbol of enlightenment, surprised contemporaries with an unusual architectural solution: there were no corners in the structure, and instead of a spiral staircase that led upstairs, a spiral, covered with paving stones was used.  There is a legend about a snail corridor 209 meters long among the people, according to which in 1716 Peter I, who visited Denmark, went up to the observatory on a horse, and later the empress rode up in the carriage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On a wide ramp during the Middle Ages horse- <span>drawn</span> carts climbed with heavy special equipment that made it possible to observe night luminaries.  A talented astronomer Ole Roemer worked here, observing the moons of Jupiter and giving an estimate of the speed of light. </p><div class="photo" data-original="copenhagencard.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Business card copenhagen" class="if uuid-2677042" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2677042.jpg"></div><p>  The facade of the building is covered with red and yellow bricks, the alternation of which creates an original drawing, and its upper part is decorated with four consonants.  According to the researchers, they encrypted the king‚Äôs message to himself.  Inside the tower is the oldest sewer system in the world, which is still working. </p><h2>  Panoramic area </h2><p>  And at the very top of the famous tower of Copenhagen is an observation deck, which offers stunning views of the surroundings.  It was fenced with a cast-iron grate cast in the middle of the 15th century.  The fencing pattern contains the royal monogram and the first letters of the words of the motto of the family of rulers: "The power is strong with piety."  The unique architectural masterpiece is part of an ensemble called Trinitatis, which includes a tiny student church and university library. </p><p>  Later, the site, which was notorious among suicides, was surrounded by a high steel fence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Amazing medieval monument </h2><p>  Now the Round Tower in Copenhagen is a beautiful panoramic platform, as well as a historical museum.  His most valuable exhibits are starry sky maps compiled in the Middle Ages, and an old engraving depicting the entrance of Peter the Great to the top of the structure. </p><p>  Visitors to local attractions must go up to admire the amazing beauty of the Danish capital.  There are telescopes aimed at all directions of the world.  There is also a souvenir shop where you can purchase various items with the image of a tower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Round tower of copenhagen" class="if uuid-2677059" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2677059.jpg"></div><p>  While tourists climb the spiral corridor up, they look at curious exhibits related to the history of the miracle of architectural thought and astronomical discoveries that were made at the observatory. </p><p>  And just below the observation deck is the former library, which burned down in a fire in 1728.  The restored hall today hosts various exhibitions, cultural events and concerts. </p><h2>  Attraction mode </h2><p>  The cost of admission to the museum is 25 crowns (a little over 3 euros / 220 rubles) for adults and 5 crowns (14 rubles) for children.  These funds are used to maintain the Round Tower of Copenhagen in good condition. </p><p>  In the summer period (from May to September), the attraction is open from 10.00 to 20.00, and in winter it works until 17.00. </p><h2>  Round Tower: reviews </h2><p>  The facility, conveniently located in the very center of the city, is a favorite tourist attraction.  They admire the unusual beauty of Copenhagen's business card.  Climbing up a wide staircase, the floor of which is tiled with stone, and the walls are whitewashed, is very convenient, but for a long time you will have to go through a continuous corridor of more than 200 meters.  Climbing it is very unusual, and it is recommended to move on the outside.  Many even forget that in the courtyard of the XXI century, immersed in the atmosphere of antiquity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stromma.dk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spiral corridor" class="if uuid-2677045" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2677045.jpg"></div><p>  The most amazing thing is the fabulously beautiful view that opens from the height of the observation deck: the charming city is spread out in front of the eyes of admiring guests who have climbed to the very top of the local attraction. </p><p>  The round tower of Copenhagen, the photo of which is forced to take off his hat to the skill of builders, is a real urban legend.  And everyone who visits Copenhagen should definitely get to know her.  Climbing up does not take much time, but it will bring a lot of pleasure. </p>
