    <h2>  Card description </h2><p>  Since the map appeared recently, it raises a large number of questions among users on the network.  A multicard is a ‚Äúplatinum‚Äù banking product from VTB Bank, combining most of the positive qualities of several cards at once. </p><p>  A significant difference between multicards and other similar offers is that it suits the needs of almost every client.  It can satisfy the aspirations of customers who want to receive cashback, maintain their savings or use it for purchases via the Internet.  This is feasible thanks to plug-in options.  Thus, it turns out to customize the card to the individual needs of each individual client.  Reviews of VTB 24 debit card with cashback confirm this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It can be both credit and debit.  If you use it to transfer salaries or pensions, that is, as a debit card, it will be allocated to a separate multicard category. </p><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  Basically, everyone is interested in whether the multicard is really different from other offers of the bank, and if there are any moments in it that are disadvantageous for the client. </p><p>  The receipt and maintenance of the card is subject to the package of options for a multicard.  Thus, when registering not only a credit, but also a debit multicard, a certain service package is automatically connected.  Cards on their own, up to five, are provided free of charge, however, you will have to pay for connected services.  However, if the minimum requirements are met, the service charge is canceled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wtb 24 cashback debit card reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2226227.jpg"></div>

    <p>  1. The cash balance of the client on all accounts in the bank must be more than 15 thousand rubles.  This takes into account current and savings accounts, deposits, as well as master accounts opened in addition to debit cards. </p><p>  2. Purchases with bank cards, regardless of whether they are debit or credit, must be made at least 15 thousand rubles a month. </p><p>  3. A debit card must be credited with at least 15 thousand rubles per month.  Charges should be made by individual entrepreneurs or a legal entity.  Thus, <span>VTB 24 salary debit cards</span> with cashback also fall into this category.  Tariff reviews are mostly positive. </p><p>  If one of the above conditions is not met, 249 rubles will be debited from the card account every month. </p><h2>  Release and Maintenance </h2><p>  The package provided for multicards includes a free issue of up to 5 debit and 5 credit cards, included in the platinum category.  Card data service will be free.  The concepts of package maintenance and card maintenance should not be confused. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you draw up an VTB multicard online, you can choose the payment system that is needed.  Three options are provided: <span>MasterCard, Visa and</span> MIR.  When issuing cards directly at a bank branch, the option of choosing a payment system is usually not provided.  Most often these are the systems that are in the priority position of a particular bank. </p><p>  According to the reviews of the owners, the VTB 24 debit card with a cashback also provides the opportunity to open a savings account free of charge.  On it you can store your own funds with the accrual of a certain percentage.  This becomes a kind of contribution, which can be replenished or performed expenditure operations at any time without losing the interest received.  The rates on this account vary depending on the period that the funds are on it.  That is, the longer the money is not withdrawn from the account, the higher the interest on the deposit becomes.  Interest is accrued every month. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="VTB 24 card with cashback debit reviews rates" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2226230.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cashback and bonus programs </h2><p>  The most basic and profitable way to purchase multicards is various bonus programs and cashback.  The terms of these programs apply to both credit and debit cards.  Moreover, all conditions and nuances are the same for both types of cards. </p><p>  Having issued a debit or credit multicard, customers can connect an option that allows you to receive increased cashback for certain categories of purchases. </p><p>  There are several options to choose from.  However, it should be borne in mind that if you spend less than 5 thousand rubles on the card, cashback will not be credited.  The largest cashback, as was said, is accrued when making purchases of more than 75 thousand rubles a month. </p><h2>  Options </h2><p>  A multicard offers the following options: </p><p>  1. <em>"Auto".</em>  It makes it possible to return money to the card when refueling a car and paying for parking lots.  The maximum cashback for this option is 10 percent. </p><p>  2. <em>"Restaurants".</em>  Cashback is charged when paying with a card of restaurants and cafes.  If spending is 75 percent per month, then the return will be 10 percent of this amount. </p><p>  <em>3. "Cashback for everything."</em>  Returns occur for all purchases, including online stores.  However, the maximum percentage for it is 2%. </p><p>  <em>4. "Travel".</em>  It gives you the opportunity to receive bonus miles for every 100 rubles in the check.  In the future, points can be used to pay for flights, <span>hotels, hotels</span> , etc. </p><p>  <em>5. ‚ÄúCollection‚Äù.</em>  This is a bonus program, which involves receiving up to 4 bonuses for every 30 rubles.  Further, the accumulated bonuses can be spent on goods from a special catalog. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="VTB 24 card with cashback debit bank reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2226233.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  First, consider the reviews on the VTB 24 debit card with cashback. </p><p>  Everyone must decide whether to draw up a multicard from VTB Bank.  The card receives mostly good reviews.  However, many note that the bank somewhat confused the conditions for cashback and some options, which makes the multicard understandable to not everyone.  Sometimes you need to carefully read all the nuances in order to understand all the conditions and evaluate the benefits of product design in a particular case. </p><p>  What other reviews on the VTB 24 cashback debit card are there? </p><p>  Some note that the card is aimed at those people who plan to actively use it.  Otherwise, its design does not make much sense and is simply inappropriate.  One of the drawbacks of the card is considered to be a very high amount that must be spent to get the maximum number of privileges.  Opening this card is only worthwhile if a person is willing to spend at least 15 thousand rubles on it monthly.  Smaller amounts require charging a card service fee of 249 rubles, which, of course, is disadvantageous for a debit card. </p><p>  Reviews about the bank are generally positive.  He is considered a reliable credit institution, cooperation with which is beneficial to everyone. </p><p>  We reviewed customer reviews of a VTB 24 cashback debit card. </p>
