The best hotels of Rimini</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For more than two thousand years, the city of Rimini has stood on the shores of the <span>Adriatic Sea</span> .  Once the Etruscans, Greeks, Romans lived here, and now the ancient city is greeted by thousands of tourists from all over the world who come to enjoy the gentle sea, the sun and a real European vacation that hospitable Italy can offer.  <span>Rimini hotels</span> are designed for guests with various needs and requirements, today about 450 hotels of different classes have been built for them. </p><h2>  Adriatic Riviera </h2><p>  Rimini has a long tradition in the spa industry - since 1843 this area has become one of the most famous holiday destinations in Europe.  Over 170 years, dozens of restaurants, parks, shops and health centers have appeared on the Adriatic <span>coast (Italy).</span>  Rimini hotels are located in the center of developed leisure infrastructure.  But the fact is that this resort is located at the intersection of popular tourist routes. </p><p>  Comfortable conditions are created for all guests coming to the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãEmilia-Romagna (Italy).  Rimini hotels provide language support for tourists from different countries, including Russia.  The staff of many hotels speaks good Russian. </p><h2>  Interesting places, shopping and entertainment </h2><p>  Arriving on the Adriatic, tourists can visit the historical sights, architectural monuments, parks and museums that Italy is famous for. </p><p>  Rimini hotels are located near picturesque temples, arches and amphitheaters, monuments of the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages.  From the resort area you can get to the historical part of Rimini in a quarter of an hour by taxi (14-15 euros). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tourists can take part in the fun holidays that Italians love so much.  Rimini hotels (4 stars) often conclude agreements with entertainment centers and nightclubs, which offer discounts during mass holidays and festivals. </p><p>  Shopping in Rimini is part of the holiday.  Around there are many shops and warehouses of clothes of famous brands, etc. Hotels of Rimini (3 stars) help their guests organize excursions to such warehouses. </p><p>  And, of course, you should visit the famous Flea Market, which works right on the central square of the city, where you can buy (or just see) real antiques. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  About 230 beautiful beaches are equipped on the 15 km of the sea coast, all of them belong to the city and are rented out, although there are free beach areas.  A permanent bus runs along the coast. </p>

    <p>  A well-developed infrastructure, proximity to popular tourist routes in other <span>cities of Italy</span> and extensive experience in organizing holidays form the basis of the excellent reputation of the Adriatic Riviera. </p><p>  The best Rimini hotels are located near the sea or historical sites.

What to do when traveling to Rimini? </p><ul><li>  Take along a dictionary or phrasebook (you can download it to your phone) - not only English, but also Italian, as ordinary people on the streets speak their native language. </li><li>  Take a laptop to keep in touch with friends and relatives, as well as several flash drives with movies, games and books, because not all hotels have free Internet access to the rooms. </li><li>  It must be remembered that most of the beaches are paid, that is, for a sunbed and an umbrella you will have to pay 10-15 euros per day.  All hotels have an agreement with a specific beach (discounts).  You can ride on a free beach - the sea is the same, just the level of comfort is slightly lower. </li><li>  There is a single ticket for all types of transport, it‚Äôs cheaper to buy in a newspaper or tobacco shop (you will have to buy such a ticket at a double price from the bus driver). </li><li>  It‚Äôs cheaper to travel around the neighborhood on your own - right at the station you can buy a guide with a map (in Russian).  Such travels will cost much cheaper tours from agencies. </li><li>  Use your stay in Rimini to see Italy.  Trains and buses to neighboring cities run several times a day.  You can leave in the morning and return to your hotel in the evening. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Room reservation </h2><p>  Rimini is a very famous resort, and you can book hotel rooms on many sites.  This allows you to save time, money and nerves when you can book a stay at the selected hotel at any time (reservation of rooms occurs automatically, and the Internet works around the clock). </p><p>  Reserving a room, you must clearly determine your requirements for the level of comfort and services, as well as collect more information about a particular hotel so that your vacation is successful. </p><p>  For example, when planning to book an apartment at the Grand Hotel, you need to make sure that the room is in the main building, because there is also an additional block (it is called the Residenza Grand Hotel or Residenza Parco Fellini). </p><h2>  How to get to Rimini </h2><p>  You can buy tickets for a direct flight to Rimini (12,000-15,000 rubles "round trip").  The cheaper route is via Bologna by train. </p><p>  Also by train you can get to Rimini from <span>Rome (3-4</span> hours), Venice, Florence and other cities. </p><p>  Given that Rimini is an old and very popular tourist destination, one should mentally prepare for long lines and crowds (200-300 people each) in front of the passport control desk, customs and baggage claim. </p><h2>  Queues at the airport </h2><p>  In order to avoid queues, in Rimini you can pre-order Arrival Meet &amp; Greet Services (130 euros) - this is a personal meeting at the gangway, delivery by car to the terminal, a special person will go through passport control, receive luggage (at this time you can safely sit in cafe) and takes the tourist to the parking lot of a bus or taxi. </p><p>  Departing back, you can purchase the Red Carpet VIP Lounge Accesses Standard service (40 euros) - check-in for a flight in a separate zone, prior arrangement of seats in the airliner, quick passage through the security control zone.  In addition, an agency employee will stand in line for a tax-free (returning the amount of tax on items purchased in Italy) instead of a tourist. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Accommodation in Rimini hotels is economical and diverse, as hotels of all directions work for tourists. </p><p>  Three-star European hotels are much more comfortable than in Asia or Africa.  Cleanliness, grooming, beautiful linens, excellent breakfast, satellite TV, shower (however, gels and shampoos are not given in the rooms - only soap). </p><p>  The undoubted advantage is the babysitting service for children and free bicycles, which you can ask at many three-star hotels. </p><p>  Four-star hotels have their own beaches, pools and spa centers, and an increased level of comfort is provided. </p><p>  Rimini hotels are a great option for active tourists who seek not only to sunbathe, but also to travel to the picturesque cities of Italy. </p>
