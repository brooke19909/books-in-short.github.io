Everything is provided and equipped here for a quality stay.  In these places - pure nature and pleasant warm waters. </p><h2>  Where is </h2><p>  This small but beautiful pearl is located in the Nizhny Novgorod region in the Volodarsky district.  Nizhny Novgorod and this body of water are 60 kilometers apart.  Since the lake is located in the village of Zolino, it is called Zolinskoe.  The lake is the pride of the locals. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  This small pond is in the shape of a droplet.  Its length is 0.5 km, and the width of the reservoir is about 300 meters.  Since the lake is not too deep, only five meters, in the summer the water in it warms up enough.  It also boasts extraordinary purity and transparency.  The coastal zone is mostly sandy, so in the summer all the villagers come to Zolinskoye.  The lake only in some places has thickets of sedge and reeds.  Near such vegetation, the coast is bushy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zolinsky lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1091754.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The surrounding nature also has a good rest.  The area is located in a strip of mixed forests, in which gentle birch, slender pine, alder and larch prevail.  In some places you can see small oak groves.  In these forests there are many bushes of honeysuckle, buckthorn, hazel, viburnum. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since these are real Russian forests, they are rich in berries.  Also, many guests, having bathed in the lake, want to go for mushrooms.  The surroundings of the lake are filled with the voices of many different birds, which makes the vacation even more enjoyable.  Walking through the woods, you can meet badgers, hedgehogs and hares. </p><h2>  Rest on the lake </h2><p>  Given this environment, many families from the Nizhny Novgorod region come to rest on Zolinskoye.  The lake has located on its shore a recreation center with small houses for guests.  But some vacationers are not averse to staying with local residents.  On the territory of the base there is an equipped beach with barbecue areas, tables and barbecue, gazebos and playgrounds.  As with all modern bases, there are sports activities here.  Traditionally, there is a Russian bath with a steam room. </p><p>  Near the beach there is a rental point for water transport - boats and catamarans.  There are also horses nearby where you can ride. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zolinsky Lake Nizhny Novgorod Region" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1091753.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For relaxation, any side on the lake is suitable.  There are several sandy beaches and <span>summer cafes.</span>  If you come in your own car, <span>recreation centers</span> offer parking.  You can come to these charming places not only in the summer, but also at any other time of the year. </p><p>  If you arrived just for a day, you can order a gazebo for relaxation.  There is also a campsite on the lake. </p><h2>  Fishing on the lake </h2><p>  Another nice feature of the rest can be fishing.  Fishermen from different parts of the region come to Zolinskoye.  The lake contains roach, perch and crucian carp in its waters.  This is the fish that comes in large numbers.  But also as a trophy sometimes pike, bream, gudgeon or rudd fall out. </p><h2>  Zolinskoe Lake: reviews of vacationers </h2>

As you can see, the surroundings, nature and the lake itself are delightful.  But some guests from other cities were disappointed with the service of their chosen recreation center.  Many did not like the service and attitude of the staff.  So, for example, a sauna was ordered, which they did not have time to prepare for the appointed time, or the promised barbecue facilities near the arbors had to be dug independently.

    <p>  Some rooms may have weak electricity, which also makes you uncomfortable in the evening.  Therefore, guests who have already visited modern bases on the lake, recommend that you carefully pay attention to the choice of the company, which will be rented a house for the rest. </p>
