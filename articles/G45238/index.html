    <p>  Trastevere (Rome) is a rather modest <span>Roman region,</span> which up to now managed to maintain its identity and the spirit of the real Middle Ages.  There are still narrow cobblestone streets, which are his hallmark.  The quarter is the best place for walking tourists and couples.  Currently, Trastevere is filled with souvenir shops, shops, restaurants, cafes and pizzerias. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is difficult for contemporaries to imagine that at the beginning of their history (in the 1st century BC) the district was completely abandoned and of no interest to anyone.  Exiled Etruscans lived on its territory.  And after some time, visiting Jews and Syrians began to settle here.  With its rich history and the presence of unique objects, the Trastevere district in Rome owes to the multinational composition of its inhabitants, belonging to different faiths. </p><p>  The quarter could become part of the city only during the reign of Aurelian (this happened at the beginning of the 1st century A.D.), which enclosed the city with a wall.  But Trastevere (Rome) reached its heyday during the reign of Caesar.  During this period, the area became popular among the rich.  On his lands were built villas of noble nobles and even the mansion of the emperor himself. </p><p>  In the Middle Ages, the area became an ordinary working quarter.  Its inhabitants differed from other Romans in traditions and a special dialect.  It was in Trastevere (Rome) that the very first street fairs and stunning <span>poetry evenings</span> began to be held <span>.</span>  Moreover, local residents even began to spend their own holidays.  The most important of them is Noantry, which means “we are different” in translation. </p><p>  In the 70-80 years of the last century, the Trastevere district in Rome became popular among immigrants and the middle class.  After that, numerous tourists came here.  The area has become more lively, it began to build new shops, cafes, attracting visitors and visitors to the city. </p><h2>  The modern look of the area </h2><p>  Currently, Trastevere (Rome), the photo of which is given in the article, is a picturesque corner of the capital.

One of them says that even in ancient times, on the birthday of Christ, in an inconspicuous place, Trastevere unexpectedly began to beat a spring with clear water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Trastevere Rome what to see" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1735093.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Jewish community interpreted this as a special sign, so much later a temple was erected in this place.  The appearance of the building that we see now was created in the middle of the twelfth century by decree of Innocent II.  According to experts, the earlier building was completely destroyed by the personal order of the pope due to the fact that his political opponent was secretly buried in this place. </p><h2>  Santa Cecilia in Trastevere (Rome) </h2><p>  What to see in Trastevere?  Of course, Santa Cecilia deserves attention.  In the fifth century AD, a basilica was built here, which was dedicated to Roman Cecilia.  Believers tell the legend that the temple was erected on the spot where the house of Cecilia once stood.  The martyr, sainted, is the patroness of music.  The old Romanesque building was significantly changed in the ninth century, and after another seven hundred years, Santa Cecilia was completely rebuilt. </p><p>  Inside the temple, the <span>wall painting of</span> Pietro Cavallini (13th century), marble columns, and statuettes of angels have been preserved to our time.
