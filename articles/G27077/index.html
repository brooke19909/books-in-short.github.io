His name is associated with several high-profile political affairs.  Ryumin was a typical representative of the totalitarian system.  After Khrushchev came to power, he was shot for past crimes. </p><h2>  early years </h2><p>  The future functionary of the MGB Ryumin Mikhail Dmitrievich was born on September 1, 1913 in the village of Kabanie, <span>Perm province,</span> on the territory of modern Kurgan region.  His father was a middle-class peasant.  The boy graduated from the eight-year school.  In 1929, he began working as an accountant in the nearest agricultural cartel.  Then he managed to transfer to the regional communications department, where he became an accountant. </p><p>  In 1931, Ryumin Mikhail Dmitrievich moved to Sverdlovsk, where he received a similar position.  Along with his work, he devoted much time to participating in the Komsomol movement.  In 1935, a young man was drafted into the army.  Ryumin came to the headquarters of the Ural military district, where he served as an ordinary.  After demobilization, the accountant returned to his usual job at the Sverdlovsk Regional Communications Administration. </p>

    <h2>  Moving to Moscow </h2><p>  In 1937, Ryumin Mikhail Dmitrievich faced mortal danger.  The accountants were accused of misappropriating money and using the excessive protection of their boss.  This man was arrested the day before and declared an enemy of the people.  In these extraordinary circumstances, Mikhail Dmitrievich Ryumin made the only decision that could save him from imprisonment in the Gulag.  The accountant hastily moved to Moscow, where after a month of ordeals he found work in the People‚Äôs Commissariat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the promotion and until the outbreak of the war, Ryumin held the post of head of the financial department in the management of the channel between Moscow and the Volga.  In these circumstances, in 1939 he managed to obtain the status of a candidate for party membership. </p>

    <h2>  Abakumov's protege </h2><p>  When the war began, Mikhail Dmitrievich Ryumin did not go to the front, but to the Higher School of the NKVD.  By September, he had already completed the forced course, after which he became an investigator in the NKVD of the Arkhangelsk Military District.  At the same time, Ryumin was not just in the organs, but in the Special Department of the department.  In the conditions of war and constant staff turnover, he managed to make a relatively quick career.  In 1941, Ryumin was a junior lieutenant of state security, and in 1944 he was already a major. </p><p>  It was during the war that the former accountant finally joined the party.  However, a decisive turn in his fate was another circumstance.  The functionary was noticed by counterintelligence officer Viktor Abakumov.  Since then, Ryumin Mikhail Dmitrievich became his protege.  Abakumov made him a senior investigator in SMERSH.  This couple made synchronous jerks when climbing the career ladder.  When Abakumov received the post of Minister of State Security of the USSR in 1946, Ryumin followed him and ended up in the chair of the deputy in one of the branches of the 3rd Main Directorate of the Ministry of State Security. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Critical Investigator </h2><p>  Since Mikhail Dmitrievich Ryumin enjoyed the special confidence of Abakumov, the minister trusted him with the most delicate matters.  In 1948, Stalin instructed the MGB to begin an investigation in the case, which later became known as Marshal.  Within its framework, the documents necessary for the arrest of Georgy Zhukov were prepared.  Ryumin directly led the case of the arrested Hero of the Soviet Union Peter Braiko.  Thanks to the beatings, he managed to obtain the necessary evidence from the defendant. </p><p>  Subsequently, Mikhail Dmitrievich Ryumin (1913‚Äì1954) took part in interrogations in the <span>Leningrad case.</span>  Then he personally beat the former chairman of the city executive committee, Solovyov.  This episode fell into the case, which was later instituted on Ryumin himself.  In 1954, fearing execution, the functionary accused Stalin of his crimes, explaining that it was he who gave instructions to beat Solovyov. </p>

    <h2>  Denunciation on Abakumov </h2><p>  In May 1951, the MGB Human Resources Directorate drew attention to the incorrect information about relatives that Ryumin had given before entering the organs.  In the Soviet system of that time, such attention meant mortal danger.  In addition, one day the investigator, through stupidity, forgot a folder with an important case in public transport.  He became increasingly reprimanded. </p><p>  Against this hopeless background, Ryumin went on the offensive.  He wrote a statement to the Central Committee of the party, which in fact was a denunciation of his own boss - Minister Viktor Abakumov.  The paper was at the top exactly at the moment when Stalin decided to conduct the next personnel cleaning in the law enforcement agencies.  As a result, Abakumov was repressed.  Ryumin's maneuver was his temporary success.  He became a colonel, and in October 1951 he was appointed deputy minister of state security of the USSR. </p>

    <h2>  Arrest and execution </h2><p>  In 1951‚Äì1953, Ryumin Mikhail Dmitrievich, whose biography is an example of a typical nomenclature, was one of Stalin's main favorites.  This could not be forgiven by other participants in the hardware struggle.  Among the enemies of Ryumin was Lavrenty Beria.  <span>On March 5, 1953</span> , Stalin died, and the entire previous system collapsed.  Now, yesterday's favorite could be under attack from his opponents.  Many of the leader‚Äôs nominees have developed a further biography.  Mikhail Ryumin among them was one of the first victims of the reaction. </p><p>  Beria set the course against the deputy minister of the MGB.  Ryumin was charged with sabotage against the Soviet state.  The investigation recognized him as a "hidden enemy of the USSR."  <span>Treason</span> and espionage could lead only to one outcome.  However, the court slowed down somewhat due to the fact that its main initiator, Beria, was himself arrested and later shot.  Confusion reigned within the Soviet elite.  Changes for a short period hid Ryumin in the shade.  Nevertheless, after some time, the investigation returned to his case.  The new group of nomenklaturtschik, who came to power, did not intend to leave alive some executioners of the Stalin era, on which, moreover, many mistakes and sins could be blamed.  July 22, 1954, Mikhail Ryumin was shot.  Unlike the victims of <span>Stalinist repressions,</span> he was never rehabilitated. </p>
