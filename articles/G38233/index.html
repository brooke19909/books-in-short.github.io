However, many fashionistas do not want to wear what is available to others and prefer to independently make various wardrobe items.  Especially for lovers of needlework, we offer step-by-step instructions that will help to make knitting a sweater for women with knitting needles. </p><h2>  Where to begin </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen say that it is quite simple to fulfill the desired.  But for knitting to really bring pleasure, you need to carefully prepare.  Better to start with model selection.  Traditionally, women's sweaters are distinguished by a rounded collar, but sometimes they are supplemented with a stand-up collar.  The design of the bottom edge also varies.  In most cases, the line is flat, decorated with an elastic band, or immediately begins with the main pattern.  But no less popular are models in which the back is slightly longer than the front.  Therefore, the first thing you should choose the style of a sweater for a woman.  You can start knitting with the chosen model when you can pick up a pattern, yarn and knitting needles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.coes.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a jumper" class="if uuid-2981323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2981323.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  You can tie up a conceived product with absolutely any pattern.  However, experienced needlewomen believe that large braids and harnesses are more suitable for sweaters than thinner and more delicate jumpers.  The latter is best decorated with various lace, sheets with embossed patterns, hosiery or garter stitch.  It is also worth noting that knitting a sweater with knitting needles for women allows you to create an effective model, you need to choose the right yarn and knitting needles.  When choosing a material, you can rely on your taste.  But professionals are convinced that a sweater connected by a monophonic yarn looks more interesting.  A tool is wiser to choose one that is made of metal.  Before buying it is recommended to carefully examine it.  There are no defects on good knitting needles.  You also need to check the tips, they should not be too sharp. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.postila.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit sweater" class="if uuid-2981320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2981320.jpg"></div><h2>  Measurement Technology </h2><p>  Many beginners, studying the features of knitting <span>jumpers for women with knitting needles,</span> find a kind of magic wand - standard parameters for men, women and children.  However, often working with them does not bring good results.  And all because each person is individual.  This applies not only to the inner world, but also to the structure of the body.  For this reason, experienced needlewomen advise self-measurements from the model.  To cope with the task is simple.  It is only necessary to prepare the necessary tools: a centimeter tape, a piece of paper and a pencil.  After preparing, get to work.  We need to find out the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  product length - from the seventh vertebra to the alleged lower edge; </li><li>  girth of the neck (at the base); </li><li>  hip circumference; </li><li>  the beginning point of the armhole is the distance from the lower edge to the armpit; </li><li>  sleeve length - from shoulder to cuff. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting jumper description" class="if uuid-2981334" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2981334.jpg"></div><h2>  Convert centimeters to loops and rows </h2><p>  Some beginners, due to lack of experience, are greatly tormented by trying to knit a fashionable sweater for a woman.  The reason lies in the fact that they knit, checking work with a centimeter tape or a full-sized pattern prepared according to previously taken parameters.  Such work is extremely inconvenient.  Especially at the initial stage, when you need to dial the calculated number of loops.  In this case, experienced needlewomen advises to do otherwise - translate the measurements taken into the required units of measurement.  To do this, prepare a square sample of the pattern with a side of ten centimeters.  Then carefully count the number of loops and rows.  Divide both values ‚Äã‚Äãby 10, finding out how many important parameters are contained in a square centimeter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After that, we return to our standards and multiply all horizontal ones by loops calculated according to the model, and vertical ones by rows.  We round the final numbers, check with the rapport, add two additional ones to the loops - edge ones.  After carrying out simple manipulations, we begin to study the description of knitting a sweater for a woman with knitting needles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.roxy-ireland.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="we knit a jumper" class="if uuid-2981325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2981325.jpg"></div><h2>  Implementation of a Conceived Product </h2><p>  To knit a really fashionable, beautiful and neat thing, you need to prepare ring knitting needles.  Then dial the number of loops equal to the circumference of the hips.  Close the row in a ring and knit, moving in a circle.  At the same time, do not add or reduce loops.  As a result of work, we get a wide "pipe", which reaches the point of the beginning of the armhole. </p><p>  Having completed the task, we divide the "pipe" into the back and front.  The number of loops in both parts is the same.  We tie each detail separately.  Do not make out the gate and armhole.  Having connected the main part of the desired length, we complete the work.  The loops are closed, and the product is turned out and sewn along the shoulder seams.  Then, again turning on the front side, along the line of the armhole with the help of the hook add loops.  We distribute to the hosiery knitting needles and knit the sleeve of the desired length, moving in a circle.  By analogy, we perform the second. </p><p>  As you can see, even beginners can make knitting with fashionable sweater models for women.  The main thing is to take advantage of the tips provided. </p>
