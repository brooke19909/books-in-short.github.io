Get to know them better. </p><h2>  Dominican Republic </h2><p>  Dominican Republic is one of the most popular tropical states in the Caribbean.  In search of the sun and entertainment, so many tourists flock here during the year that they can populate all European cities, from small to large.  The clear sea, many kilometers of white sand beaches, comfortable hotels and delicious food - this is what this wonderful tourist destination is associated with. </p><p>  The Dominican Republic has not only magnificent nature, but also a rich history.  The island was discovered in the fifteenth century by Christopher Columbus.  At different periods of its existence, it was controlled by the Spaniards, the French, the British and the Americans.  The country has long been economically dependent on foreign countries, especially the United States.  The Dominican Republic survived many uprisings and wars, but by the middle of the twentieth century, through the holding of popular elections, it turned into a republic and to this day has good diplomatic relations with many civilized countries of the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.libertytravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic" class="if uuid-3219836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3219836.jpg"></div><h2>  Waterfall path </h2><p>  27 waterfalls in the Dominican Republic are located in the Puerto Plata area, near the city of Imbert.  To the sights, several excursions of various types are organized daily: VIP, individual and small groups.  It is not recommended to take young children with them, for whom this walk in the heat will turn into a real torture.  If you are tormented by the question of how to get to 27 waterfalls in the Dominican Republic quickly and without much loss of energy in the heat, there is only one answer: a taxi.  The cost of a one-way road will be approximately thirty dollars, but the car will take you to your place in just twenty to thirty minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="19.7807686" data-lng="-70.68710909999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/5/1/1/17511.png"></div><p>  After arriving at the main location, tourists are greeted by local residents and offer a light breakfast, since they will have to leave home or from the hotel early in the morning.  After this, preparation for the excursion will begin, which includes mandatory instruction, as well as a life jacket and hard hat.  The ticket price also includes the services of an experienced guide. </p><div class="photo" data-original="walkingontravels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="road to waterfalls" class="if uuid-3219849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3219849.jpg"></div><h2>  List and cost </h2><p>  An excursion to 27 waterfalls in the Dominican Republic is considered quite difficult and is considered an extreme vacation.  To spend the whole day among the rocks and water, at least minimal physical preparation is necessary, since during the tour you will have to climb steep paths, rope ladders, crawl and then jump into the water.  If you have a poor idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe route and are not completely confident in your abilities, before buying an excursion, carefully read the photo of 27 waterfalls in the Dominican Republic, reviews of tourists and decide whether you can afford such an adventure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you are going to buy a tour, as they say, without leaving your home, or rather from the hotel, then be prepared for an overpayment.  The cost of excursions at the hotel starts at $ 90. </p><p>  The ticket price on the spot depends on the route you have chosen, which are divided into three types according to the number of waterfalls.  There are three of them: 7, 12 and 27 waterfalls.  The first route will cost you $ 7.5.  It is better to choose it if you are not confident in your abilities and endurance of your companions.  This is especially true for minor children, to whom this relatively simple route may seem overly complex. </p><p>  Route number 2 includes 12 waterfalls and will cost tourists $ 9 per person.  The third path, the most difficult, consists of 27 waterfalls.  The cost of such a "race" is $ 13, it will take three hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="small waterfall" class="if uuid-3219856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3219856.jpg"></div><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  Before buying a tour and visiting a famous attraction, you should get acquainted with the opinions of people who have already been there and give some practical advice.  27 waterfalls in the Dominican Republic - a place as interesting as it is dangerous.  Firstly, you need to take care of comfortable shoes that will not make your legs heavier and will allow you to move confidently on inclines.  Favorite sneakers or sneakers are great.  The main thing is that the foot does not slip on the sole and be sufficiently strengthened, since, having wet your feet, you can easily slip and get a dislocation.  Comfortable shoes can be rented on site for just a few dollars.  But it‚Äôs better to take care of this in a city where for the same price you can buy a pair of shoes, ideally choosing the size and style. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You should not take things with you on a tour of the 27 waterfalls of the Dominican Republic that can easily deteriorate from the water.  All important items are best left at the hotel.  Remember to take cash.  They come in handy to buy something tasty in the cafe or tip the guide.  For a few dollars, guides will keep an eye on your belongings and can also take great photos while you are walking the route.  If you ask, of course. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sea-horse-ranch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bay in the reserve" class="if uuid-3219848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3219848.jpg"></div><h2>  Precautionary measures </h2><p>  As one good Russian proverb says, safety precautions are written in blood.  Of course, we are exaggerating, but in the rainforests, where 27 waterfalls are located in the Dominican Republic, precautionary measures will never be superfluous. </p><p>  Before leaving your home, check to see if you have any basic documents with you.  Leaving them at the hotel is, of course, scary, but no one knows what might happen along the way.  Take medical insurance with you and your family members.  Wrap the documents in a waterproof bag so that they are not inadvertently wet. </p><p>  Be sure to bring drinking water and hats with you.  In the heat, these are the first means of necessity.  Leave your bank cards in the room and use only cash, exchange them in advance at the bank or at the hotel staff. </p><p>  If you suffer from any phobias or know what may happen, for example, a panic attack with you or someone from your loved ones, be sure to warn the guide.  Experienced experts will tell you the best option for entertainment and will be ready when an emergency occurs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.colonialtours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jumping from a waterfall" class="if uuid-3219853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3219853.jpg"></div><h2>  Self visit </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the reviews about 27 Dominican waterfalls, and in principle about all resorts of the republic as a whole, are quite positive, it‚Äôs worth considering one point.  If you like the reviews of tourists who love to travel, as they say, savages, and you want to plunge into the world of wild foreign nature with your head, do not rush.  You can always do this, however, if you are planning to go to the Dominican Republic for the first time, it is better to use the services of travel agencies, to learn everything and put your experience into practice the next time. </p><p>  Moreover, it is forbidden to visit the main and, as usual, the most beautiful sights of the country on your own.  This is especially true for Dominican waterfalls.  Without a guide, you can‚Äôt even get closer, not to mention walking along the waterfalls, since after an accident in 2004, independent visits to 27 waterfalls in the Dominican Republic are strictly forbidden.  It is better to unite in small groups of three to four people and calmly, without fuss and crush, take a walk through the wonderful surroundings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iexplore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wooden staircase to the waterfalls" class="if uuid-3219862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3219862.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The Dominican Republic is one of the best tourist destinations in the world, which annually collects tens of thousands of excellent reviews about the country as a whole, about delicious cuisine based on fresh seafood and vegetables, about "golden" beaches and the clear sea.  Among the variety of entertainments, there are special reviews about the excursion to 27 Dominican waterfalls.  Those who have already been there are forever impressed by the lush vegetation and magnificent views of the stone boulders from which water flows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="27 waterfalls dominican republic tips" class="if uuid-3219859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3219859.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  However, everything does not happen so smoothly, and there are reviews of people who were dissatisfied with the trip to the unique 27 waterfalls in the Dominican Republic.  This is mainly due to the service staff not only in the hotel, but throughout the excursions.  Tourists were dissatisfied with the dishes that they were offered in distant locations, the high cost of related services and hotel rooms.  But all this is easily solved. </p>
