    <h2>  General concepts </h2><p>  By law, every owner of a car must have insurance.  Without a policy it is impossible to register a vehicle (vehicle) in the traffic police and use it.  The absence of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance entails penalties and even a ban on the operation of cars.  With the policy, the owner receives the right to compensation for material damage to other participants in the accident.  The number of insured events is not limited. </p><p>  DPS officers today have the opportunity to verify the validity of the policy through the IMTS of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation or through the database of Russian car insurers.  And since the data on the insured is entered almost simultaneously with payment, then patrol traffic police are not allowed to prosecute the driver, according to part 2 of art.  12.3 Administrative Code. </p><p>  Electronic insurance policy at Alfa Insurance (EOSAGO), <strong> </strong>  as in any other company, it is calculated by multiplying the base rate by various individual coefficients.  These may include the region of registration, engine power, the period of use of the vehicle, the age and length of service of the driver, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What is CTP for? </h2><p>  Firstly, it is saving your own money in the event of an accident.  For the policy enables the insurance holder to compensate without loss the damage caused to the driver, property or vehicle injured in the accident. </p><p>  Secondly, the OSAGO system is a civilized way of calculating between the parties to a road conflict. </p><p>  If there is no policy, you will have to cover all expenses associated with an accident from your wallet (and the amounts are usually rather large). </p><p>  There are three scenarios in the event of an accident. </p><ol><li>  If, due to the fault of the insured in Alfa Insurance, harm is caused to the health and / or car of another driver, then the company pays the amount indicated by the experts after evaluating the expert commission.  The culprit repairs the personal vehicle at its own expense. </li><li>  If a car and / or a company‚Äôs client suffered from someone else‚Äôs fault, then it receives material damage. </li><li>  If both drivers are to blame, then each court determines the measure of each, and AlfaStrakhovanie calculates the ratio of the damage suffered in monetary terms and makes payments. </li></ol>

    <p>  Next, the cost of OSAGO is calculated.  After payment, the document data is stored in the PCA database (it takes no more than two minutes to reconcile it), and the policy itself appears in your personal account and comes to your email inbox.  It remains only to print (or save to a smartphone).  But this is only if the information entered is correct.  If the system finds errors, then in order to make changes to the electronic insurance policy of OSAGO from Alfa Insurance, the applicant will have to upload scans of documents requiring correction.  A company specialist will already work with them.  After making changes, you can proceed to payment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The insurance acquired in this way is equivalent to its paper version. </p><h2>  Payment </h2><p>  If the amount issued by the calculator suits the buyer, click "Pay."  Three ways: </p><ol><li>  Alfa-click Internet banking. </li><li>  By credit card with any payment system (with support for payments on the Internet). </li><li>  Through an electronic wallet. </li></ol><h2>  Renewal </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of the electronic insurance policy of OSAGO from Alfa Insurance, <strong> </strong>  This procedure is incredibly simple (it can be performed any of 60 days before the deadline).  We go to your personal account on the official website and log in.  To do this, in the opened form, enter: </p><ul><li>  Valid insurance number. </li><li>  Surname, full name. </li><li>  Date of birth. </li></ul><p>  Thus, the new electronic policy from Alfa Insurance OJSC is already considered partially filled.  Next, proceed according to the prompts of the system.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  Open the "Policies" tab and find the current one.  If the time allows, then next to it there will be a button "Buy YOSAGO". </li><li>  We are waiting for the verification of data with the PCA database. </li><li>  Upon its completion, an electronic mail comes with consent to sell the policy and an application form. </li><li>  In your account, click the "Pay" button and select the convenient option for transferring money. </li><li>  After payment is confirmed, the finished policy arrives by email. </li></ul><p>  For a timely renewal, the company's specialists remind about the expiration of the insurance by e-mail or SMS. </p>

    <h2>  Tariffs </h2><p>  Sets the tariff grid of the Central Bank of Russia.  For the first time, the purchased policy will be calculated from the base rate and individually selected coefficients.  To streamline insurance transactions, the Central Bank issued an instruction on determining the tariff corridor, which sets the maximum and minimum value of the base rate. </p><h2>  We calculate the cost of an electronic policy in Alfa Insurance </h2><p>  The following data must be entered in the corresponding tab: </p><ul><li>  Brand of vehicle. </li><li>  His model. </li><li>  Year of issue. </li><li>  Date of beginning and end of insurance. </li><li>  Technical indicators (engine power - KM, vehicle age - KS, etc.). </li><li>  Accident rate - KBM (bonus-malus is provided for accurate driving. It makes it possible to buy a policy 5% cheaper each year for the absence of insurance events). </li><li>  The region where the vehicle is registered is CT (large and federal cities have a rather high coefficient. For example, in Moscow it is 2.0). </li><li>  Information about the drivers and the owner allowed to drive the car, including age and length of service - FAC, KO. </li></ul><p>  Now you need to confirm your consent to the processing of personal data and click on the button ‚ÄúCalculate E-CTP‚Äù. </p><p>  The final cost is affected by the desire of the applicant to include additional risks.

Most often, the following are found in reviews: </p><ul><li>  The acquisition takes place without a visit to the representative office and queues. </li><li>  After payment, the data is instantly displayed in the PCA database. </li><li>  Additional services are not imposed on the policy and you do not have to pay for filling out the forms. </li><li>  When calculating the insurance amount, a personal MSC, loaded from the PCA database, is taken into account. </li><li>  Registration and renewal is possible around the clock and at the right date. </li><li>  Payment of the policy passes through secure channels. </li><li>  In case of loss, the document can be printed again from your personal account. </li></ul>
