    <h2>  Admiral Nakhimov: biography </h2><p>  A native of <span>Smolensk province,</span> Nakhimov was born on July 5, 1802 in a poor large family with noble roots.  Having entered the Naval Cadet Corps of the city of St. Petersburg in 1815, whose director later became one of his brothers, Pavel brilliantly proved himself to be the best of the midshipmen of the educational institution.  For excellent study at the age of 15, he received the rank of midshipman and distribution to the Phoenix brig, where in 1817 he sailed to the shores of Denmark and Sweden.  This was followed by a difficult service in the Baltic Fleet. </p><p>  It was the sea, military affairs and service to the Motherland, the love of which was laid down during the years of study, that were the meaning of Nakhimov‚Äôs life.  In no other industry did Pavel Stepanovich see himself anymore, refusing to recognize even the possibility of existence without sea open spaces. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Admiral Nakhimov biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/612823.jpg" width="335"></div>  In love with the sea, he married military service and was always faithful to his homeland, thus finding his place in life.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The first years of military service </h2><p>  At the end of the Naval Cadet Corps P.S.  Nakhimov was assigned to serve in the port of St. Petersburg, and subsequently transferred to the Baltic Fleet. </p><p>  At the invitation of MP Lazarev - his mentor, admiral, Russian naval commander and navigator, from 1822 to 1825 he went to serve on the frigate "Cruiser", on which he traveled around the world.  It lasted 1084 days and served as an invaluable navigation experience on the expanses of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, on the shores of Alaska and Latin America.  Upon his return, already at that time already in the rank of lieutenant, he was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir of the 4th degree.  After a three-year voyage on the frigate, Nakhimov, all under the same command of his beloved mentor Lazarev, switched to the Azov ship, on which in 1826 he accepted his first battle against the Turkish fleet.  It was Azov that mercilessly smashed the Turks, the first among the others as close as possible to the enemy.  In this battle, where there were many deaths on both sides, Nakhimov was seriously wounded. </p><p>  In 1827, Pavel Stepanovich was awarded the Order of St. George of the 4th degree and promoted to the rank of captain-lieutenant.  In 1828 he became commander of a reconquered Turkish ship, renamed Navarin.  He was directly involved in the cordoning off of the <span>Dardanelles by the</span> Russian fleet in the years 1828-1829 in the Russian-Turkish war. </p><h2>  The courage of a leader is an example for a team </h2><p>  The promising sailor met 29 years of age already with the rank of commander of the new frigate Pallas, a few years later became the commander of Silistra and was promoted to captain of the 1st rank.  Flying the vast expanses of the Black Sea, Silistria was a showcase vessel and, over 9 years of sailing, led by Nakhimov, completed a number of complex heroic tasks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is famous for Pavel Stepanovich Nakhimov" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/613692.jpg" width="424"></div>  History has preserved such a case.  During the exercises, the ship of the Black Sea squadron Adrianopol came close to Silistra, making an unsuccessful maneuver, which led to the inevitable collision of ships.  Nakhimov was left in utah alone, sending the sailors to a safe place.  By happy coincidence, such a dangerous moment occurred without disastrous consequences, only the captain was showered with fragments.  P.S.  Nakhimov substantiated by the fact that such cases are rarely provided by fate and provide an opportunity to show the presence of spirit in the boss, demonstrating it to the team.  This illustrative example of courage can be of great benefit in the future, in the event of a possible battle.

This time the collection of well-deserved awards was replenished with the Order of St. Anna of the 1st degree - for successes in the naval and military fields. </p><h2>  Nakhimov: the image of an ideal leader </h2><p>  The moral impact on the entire Black Sea Fleet was so enormous that it was equated with the influence of Admiral Lazarev himself. <br><br>  Pavel Stepanovich, giving the service days and nights, never regretted himself and demanded the same of the sailors.  Having no other passion in life than military service, Nakhimov believed that naval officers could not be interested in other life values. <br><br>  Everyone should be busy on the ship, a person cannot sit without work, with folded arms: labor and only labor.  Not a single comrade reproached him for wanting to curry favor; everyone believed in his calling and commitment to military service. </p>

You must always strive forward, work on yourself, improve, so as not to be broken in the future.  He was revered and respected as a father, and absolutely everyone was afraid of reprimands and remarks.  Money for Nakhimov did not have the value that society was used to.  Generosity along with understanding the difficulties of ordinary people is what Pavel Stepanovich Nakhimov is famous for.  Leaving himself the necessary part to pay for the apartment and modest food, he gave everything else to the sailors and their families.  Very often he was met by crowds of people.  They were carefully listened to by Nakhimov.  The admiral tried to fulfill everyone‚Äôs request.  If there was no opportunity to help in connection with empty pockets, Pavel Stepanovich borrowed money from other officers for future salaries and then distributed them to those in need.

    <h2>  Sailor - the main force of the navy </h2><p>  He always considered sailors to be the leading force of the navy and treated everyone with due respect.  It is these guys who determine the outcome of the battles that need to be taught, exalted, aroused in them courage, a desire to work and perform feats for the sake of the motherland. <br><br>  The ordinary sailor is the main engine on the ship, the command staff is just the springs acting on it.  Therefore, you should not consider these hard workers controlling sails, pointing weapons at the enemy, rushing aboard, serfs.  Humanity and justice are the main principles of communication with subordinates, and not the use of their officers as a means of their own exaltation.  Like his mentor - Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev - Nakhimov demanded moral discipline from the command staff.  Corporal punishment was prohibited on his ship, and instead of honoring command officers, love for the Motherland was fostered.  It was Admiral Nakhimov, whose biography serves as the clearest example of fostering <span>fortitude,</span> respect for one's neighbor and complete dedication in serving the interests of the motherland, was the ideal image of a warship commander. </p><h2>  The role of the admiral in the defense of Sevastopol </h2><p>  In the difficult years for Sevastopol (1854-1855) during the <span>Crimean War,</span> Nakhimov was appointed military governor of the city and port commander, and in March of that year he was promoted to admiral. <br><br>  Under his competent leadership, the city for 9 months selflessly repelled the attacks of the allies.  It was Nakhimov ‚Äî the admiral from God ‚Äî who with his energy contributed to the activation of defense. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="n s nakhimov" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/612950.jpg" width="600"></div>  He coordinated the sorties, waged a mine and contraband war, built new fortifications, organized the local population to defend the city, personally circling the front lines and raising the morale of the troops.

    <p>  It was here that Nakhimov was mortally wounded.  The admiral received an enemy bullet in the temple and died July 12, 1855 without regaining consciousness.  Day and night, sailors were on duty at the tomb of the beloved commander, kissing his hands and returning immediately, as it was possible to change at the bastion.  During the funeral, a large fleet of enemies, before which shook the earth with countless shots, was silent;  in honor of the great admiral, the enemy ships lowered their flags. </p><h2>  The cruiser Admiral Nakhimov as a symbol of the power and strength of the Russian fleet </h2><p>  As a symbol of courage and strength, in honor of the great man, <span>the largest warship in the world</span> was created <span>,</span> which in NATO is called the ‚Äúkiller of aircraft carriers‚Äù.  It is designed to defeat large surface targets.  This is the heavy nuclear-powered cruiser Admiral Nakhimov, equipped with constructive protection against the use of missile weapons. </p><p>  The warship has the following specifications: </p><p>  Displacement - 26,190 tons. </p><p>  Length - 252 meters. </p><p>  Width - 28.5 meters. </p><p>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äã- 32 knots (or 59 km / h). </p><p>  Crew - 727 people (including 98 officers). </p><p>  Since 1999, the ship has been idle pending modernization;  a powerful buildup of the missile complex ‚Äî the Caliber and Onyx ‚Äî is planned. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="heavy nuclear cruiser admiral nakhimov" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/612961.jpg" width="530"></div><br>  The modernization plan provides for the return of the cruiser to the military fleet in 2018.
