Is it possible to throw an almost new thing?  Well of course not!  There are two ways to save the situation: take it to the bag repair studio or sew a new lock.  If you choose the second option, then this article is for you!  Let's find out how to sew a zipper in a bag. </p><h2>  Procedure for replacing an old lock with a new one </h2><p>  Firstly, open the dead fastener, having previously noted the location.  Buy a new one that is suitable in size and shade.  If your bag is made of very dense material (leather or a very thick fabric), do not forget to buy needles adapted for such sewing.  Choose strong threads matching the color of the bag. </p><p>  So, everything is prepared, now let's proceed directly to the replacement.  How to sew a zipper in a bag? </p><div class="photo" data-original="emmalinebags.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing straps and processing zippers" class="if uuid-2646003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2646003.jpg"></div><p>  First, sew large stitches with a thread of contrasting color on the new lock in place of the old one.  It should be installed exactly in place of the previous one.  Open and close the ‚Äúdog‚Äù several times to make sure that the bag material does not get anywhere between the zipper teeth.  If everything suits you, you can sew on completely. </p><p>  Replace the needle in the machine with a special one, thread the thread and gently evenly sew one side of the lock to the bag, keeping the distance between the stitch and the teeth 2 mm.  Cut the thread at the end and tie a knot from the wrong side.  Sew the second part in the same way.  Remove the draft thread. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the bag is sewn from light material, then the work will be much less - you do not need to replace the needle, and it is easier to sew. </p><h2>  How to sew a zipper in a lined bag </h2><p>  Some bags are lined.  If you need to sew a zipper, decide on the size and color.  The length will be equal to the width of the bag + 4 cm. Proceed?  Connect it to the lining as shown in the photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="zipper to the lined bag" class="if uuid-2645741" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2645741.jpg"></div><p>  We fix with pins or hand stitching with a thread of a different color.  Sew, bend the matter, iron the seam.  Sew outside the edge. </p><p>  We put this bag in the bag, choose the direction of the lock individually. </p><p>  We unfasten the lock, with a needle with a strong thread we carefully sew a lining with a zipper, making stitches over the machine stitch and without going to the front side. </p><p>  That's all - the lightning is sewn! </p><h2>  Clasp for a knitted bag </h2><p>  And sometimes the needlewomen have a question how to sew a zipper into a knitted bag.  It was created with a hook and the view without a lock is unfinished. </p><div class="photo" data-original="skeinandhook.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stitching the lock in a knitted bag" class="if uuid-2646008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2646008.jpg"></div><p>  Take the hook and the yarn left from knitting the bag itself, tie 2 strips-strips, the length of which is equal to the width of the bag, and focus on the zipper in width.  Sew them to the lock on both sides with neat, invisible stitches (manually).  Then sew a lining bag to the straps and collectively fasten knitting thread to your bag with a darn needle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Zipper to the bar </h2><p>  We found out how to sew a zipper into a bag in simple ways.  You can try a more complicated method - to master the fixation of the lock in the bar. </p><p>  We cut 4 stripes from the material for grinding: 2 on the front side and 2 on the inside, wrong side.  The size of the strips depends on the size of the strips, which is desirable to get at the end of the work. </p><p>  The width of the pattern is calculated as follows: the final width of the stitch / 2 + 1.5 cm per bend + 2 cm allowance for the seam.  Let's say the size of the finished plank is 5 cm. Then the pattern has a width = 5/2 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 cm. Make it a little wider, it‚Äôs easier to cut the excess 1 time than to redraw it several times! </p><p>  The length of our strap will be equal to the length of the zipper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="zipper sewn into the bar" class="if uuid-2646014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2646014.jpg"></div><p>  For more convenient work, get adhesive non-woven stripes for the belt.  By gluing them to the material and cutting off the excess, not forgetting the allowances for the seams, you can not count anything and do not draw patterns. </p><p>  We apply the trim stripes on both sides with the front sides to the fastener, we will combine the edges and sew together, retreating 4 mm from the teeth of the zipper.  Bend the strips of fabric and iron them.  Lay another line next to the fold.  This is the underside, "looking" into the bag. </p><p>  Now we will process the top: we apply the prepared strips close to the cloves of the lock, but so that when closing the fabric does not interfere, we fix it with pins.  On a typewriter we attach a foot for sewing lightnings, scribbling near the edge.  All fixing elements are removed and carefully ironed. </p><h2>  Work with knitwear </h2><p>  Knitted fabric is very moody, and the question of how to sew a zipper into a knitted bag often remains open.  Since the knitwear is very stretched, waves and creases can form when zipper is sewn.  In order to avoid this, glue the back of the bag in places where the zipper is sewn with non-woven or doleic.  A lobster is a fabric strip or <span>non-woven material</span> that fixes the problem area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork to avoid stretching, shedding threads, etc. In this role, use doubler strips, thermal fabric.  If all this is not and there is nowhere to buy, then take a regular <span>masking tape.</span>  The strips must be glued or swept onto the seam allowances in the places where the zipper will be sewn. </p><h2>  Zipper for inside pocket </h2><p>  Almost all women love not only interesting and original, but also practical bags.  So they must have hidden pockets or even a few!  But if there is not a single one in the new bag?  Build them yourself, with your own hands, always with a zipper, so that all useful small things are not lost.  And now we‚Äôll figure out how to sew a zipper into the pocket of a bag. </p><p>  To begin with, to simplify your work, glue the fabric with doubler or non-woven - the lining fabric is usually very thin and soft.  On the seamy side, in places with sealed adhesive, draw a frame whose width is equal to the width of the ‚Äúdog‚Äù and the length to the zipper itself.  Mark the corners for cutting.  Cut out a piece (pocket) from the lining fabric that you sew to this frame.  Walk the entire perimeter of the drawn frame, cut the corners of the material very close to the line, twist the pocket.  Smooth everything very well with an iron, sew a zipper into this slot, at the closest distance to the edges of the fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sewsweetness.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="way to fix the zipper" class="if uuid-2646010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2646010.jpg"></div><p>  Many of you are ready to sew wonderful bags or to crochet them on knitting needles, some have a few little things that are not used due to a broken lock.  Now you have learned how to sew a zipper into a bag - this is <span>not</span> at <span>all difficult.</span>  Having tried once, you will definitely return to this lesson, you will be very pleased with yourself and the result of your work! </p>
