This special mode cannot be used in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  The staff exceeds one hundred people. </li><li>  Cumulative income from operations on an accrual basis for the reporting period exceeded the established limit (in the previous and current year, the limit is one hundred and fifty million rubles). </li><li>  Business owners did not notify the inspection of the <span>transition to the simplified tax system.</span> </li><li>  The activity is applied by the unified agricultural tax. </li><li>  A <span>type of IP activity</span> is being conducted <span>,</span> which is not foreseen under the simplified <span>taxation system</span> . </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="chyngle.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://chyngle.com/business/benefits-of-business-setup-in-uae.htm"><img itemprop="image" alt="Conditions for work on the simplified tax system" class="if uuid-2269852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2269852.jpg"></div><p>  If the conditions are not met, business owners should abandon the special tax regime.  They must do this starting from the reporting period when the conditions of the STS were not met.  The entrepreneur must inform about the transition to the general system no later than fifteen days from the date of termination of the application of the special regime. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.regberry.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Application form for the transition to the simplified tax system" class="if uuid-2269827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2269827.jpg"></div><p>  Reasons for canceling the use of the simplified tax system: </p><ul><li>  the number of employees exceeded one hundred people; </li><li>  Exceeded revenue </li><li>  new types of activities have been opened (for example, the practice of private notaries, lawyers). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.vectorfree.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.vectorfree.com/modern-businessman-vectors"><img itemprop="image" alt="Staff" class="if uuid-2269847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2269847.jpg"></div><p>  Business owners who have just started their entrepreneurial activities are entitled to apply a special taxation regime by filling out an application for a simplified IP taxation system and having previously notified the tax inspectorate thereof.  The deadline for providing information on the choice of the tax regime from the moment of registration with the inspection is thirty calendar days. </p><h2>  Reporting Types </h2><p>  The special regime for entrepreneurs involves the submission of only a tax return. </p><p>  Entrepreneurs should print out and keep in paper form a book of accounting for income and expenses.  If during the year the book was kept in electronic form, then it is necessary to prepare, print, flash and number it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Object of taxation </h2><p>  The declaration is submitted by the entrepreneur, regardless of which object of taxation is selected. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.entrepreneur.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.entrepreneur.com/listen"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pros and Cons of USN" class="if uuid-2269857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2269857.jpg"></div><p>  An individual entrepreneur independently determines the object of taxation: 6% of income or from 5% to 15% of the difference "income - expenses".  The tax paid by the taxpayer to the budget depends on the choice made.  The object of taxation can be changed an unlimited number of times in the process of entrepreneurial activity. </p><h2>  Procedure for submitting a tax return </h2><p>  Reporting to the IFTS can be provided: </p><ul><li>  sending by mail; </li><li>  transferring to the tax inspector; </li><li>  sending via the Internet, if the company is conducting electronic document management with inspection. </li></ul><h2>  Reporting Form </h2><p>  Entrepreneurs, using a simplified taxation system for entrepreneurs, report their earned income and expenses to the inspectorate using a tax return.  The form adopted in the spring of 2016 is also used in 2018.  Using an obsolete form declaration form, the business owner violates the law and his actions are equated with failure to submit reports. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.regberry.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.regberry.ru/nalogooblozhenie/novaya-forma-nalogovoy-deklaracii-po-usn"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cover sheet example" class="if uuid-2271969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2271969.jpg"></div><h2>  The procedure for filling out the form </h2><p>  The basic rules for entering data into the declaration form for the simplified IP taxation system: </p><ul><li>  the information is entered in block letters in the form (Courier New size of 16-18 points is used on the computer);

In 2017, the last business day fell on a weekend, Sunday, so the deadline for transferring tax was moved to the first day of the next year, January 9, 2018. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ip-vopros.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://ip-vopros.ru/otkrytie-ip/zayavlenie-na-usn"><img itemprop="image" alt="Working conditions on the simplified tax system for entrepreneurs" class="if uuid-2269866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2269866.jpg"></div><p>  If the entrepreneur at the STS does not have workers, then they must pay fixed contributions only for themselves.  These payments are calculated on the basis of the minimum wage.  If the businessman‚Äôs income for the year exceeds three hundred thousand rubles, then, in addition to the indicated amounts, he will have to pay another percent of the excess amount to the Pension Fund of Russia. </p><p>  If an individual entrepreneur uses a simplified taxation system and has chosen the object of taxation as income reduced by expenses, then the legislation provides for contributions that reduce the tax base: </p><ul><li>  Mandatory insurance contributions paid to extrabudgetary funds for employees, as well as for the entrepreneur himself; </li><li>  payment of sick leave benefits to employees from the first to the third day of illness (the exception is payments for accidents that occurred during working hours and occupational diseases); </li><li>  amounts paid under voluntary insurance contracts in favor of employees in case of their sick leave. </li></ul><p>  When determining income as an object of taxation, an entrepreneur may reduce the calculated advance payments and the tax itself by the amount of contributions paid for itself and for employees.  In this case, tax payment can be reduced by only fifty percent.  If the entrepreneur does not have workers, then the tax can be reduced completely. </p><h2>  Responsibility of IP </h2><p>  Violations in filling out declarations, failure to meet the deadlines for reporting, punishes business owners. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">  Type of error </td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">  Punishment </td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">  Lack of reporting, including a ‚Äúzero‚Äù report at the Federal Tax Service Inspectorate </td><td rowspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">  A fine of 5 to 30% of the unpaid amount of tax payment for each calendar month of violation, but not less than 1,000 rubles </td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">  Reporting deadlines </td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">  Long-term violation of the deadlines for submitting a declaration (more than ten days) </td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">  IP bank account lock </td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">  Submission of a declaration on an irrelevant form </td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">  Fine or blocking of the settlement account of IP </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Entrepreneurs try to avoid punishment in the form of fines and blocking accounts and provide reports in a timely manner. </p>
