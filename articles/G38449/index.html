There are no special problems with visas, tickets can be bought cheaply and at great discounts, so traveling to Helsinki, especially in summer, is not a big deal.  You can get from St. Petersburg to the capital of Finland by plane, train and even bus, because the distance between the cities is not very large, and the roads in this country are excellent.  But the most interesting is the <span>ferry service,</span> which operates in the summer months.  But housing in Helsinki is expensive.  Even a room in a modest three-ruble note will cost from 5000 r.  per day.  And even then it is not always available.  The best budget accommodation option in Helsinki is a hostel.  But such alternative hotels need to be booked in advance, long before the intended trip.  Otherwise, you will lose all opportunity to save on housing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Helsinki Hostel" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2130116.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hostels in the center of Helsinki </h2><p>  If you are lucky enough to find a budget hotel, try to choose something near the heart of the Finnish capital.  So you save on transport, which is also not very cheap here.  And the prices here are approximately the same for hotels in the center and outside the city.  Good reputation at "Erottayanpusto", "Sweetdrim", "Forenommesenaatti."  But in the summer months, tourists prefer the Domus Akademika hostel (Helsinki), which we present to you.  It has the most convenient location, good value for money and can accommodate quite a lot of people.  Tourists who like to save money left very good reviews about him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Helsinki hostel cheap" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2130117.jpg"></div>

Tourists believe that its location is more than convenient.  Hietaniemi Beach is just steps away, so when you arrive in Helsinki during the warmer months, you can also relax at sea.  Moreover, this hotel is open seasonally - from June 1 to September 1.  On foot you can easily reach the train station and metro station.  And the tram and bus stops are right next to the hostel.  There are a lot of shops in the vicinity, including grocery, cafes and restaurants.  There are McDonald's and three supermarkets, one of which is open around the clock.  A ten minute walk - a church in the rock.  The hostel is very careful about its reputation in the field of ecology: its guests must sort the garbage, only clean products grown without chemical fertilizers are used for breakfast, and customers are encouraged to get to know Helsinki on foot, by bicycle or by public transport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel in the center of Helsinki" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2130118.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where do tourists live? </h2><p>  The Domus Akademika hotel, as this hostel in Helsinki is often called, is very large for such establishments.  It has 326 rooms, which are located in three different buildings with one courtyard.  The fact is that it is a student dormitory.  When students move out for the summer, the hotel opens.  As in most hostels, it offers double rooms, as well as dormitories for several people.  You can get hooked on to some people if you travel alone, and then overnight will cost you very cheaply.  The rooms have good soundproofing, there is everything you need.  Some have a private bathroom, while others have shared bathrooms.  There are rooms for guests like mini-apartments, with a refrigerator and stove.  But the dishes still have to be taken in the shared kitchen, which is used by residents of all rooms.  Linen and a towel are provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Academic Helsinki Hostel" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2130120.jpg"></div>

Helsinki is quite suitable for traveling around the city on four wheels, but first you need to make a request for a reception if there is still space left on the parking lot.  After all, there are not very many of them.  The receptionist has a lot of safes where you can leave things for storage, especially if you spend the night with strangers.  The cost of this service is 200 p.  in a day.  Here you can also wash clothes in the car.  The Helsinki Card is also sold in the lobby, which gives the right to ride all types of public transport for free, including speedboats to Suomenlinna Island, as well as go to museums.  The cardholder is entitled to various discounts at many restaurants in the Finnish capital.  The hostel staff is very helpful and welcoming.  Wi-Fi catches in all buildings and rooms, but its quality depends on the proximity of the location to the routers. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  On the ground floor of Domus Akademika (hostel, Helsinki) there is a Metropol restaurant.  Hotel guests usually have breakfast there.  A morning meal is not included in the price of the stay, you need to pay an additional 650 p.  Breakfast is served from 7 to 10 in the morning, and on weekends from eight to half past ten.  The menu includes meat and cheese slices, bread, butter, eggs, juices, yogurts, granola, cereals, coffee, tea and fruits.  Guests have lunch and dinner either in neighboring cafes and restaurants, or buy their own products in a supermarket and use the shared kitchen.  There you can take not only dishes, but also sugar, salt and flour.  Many travelers leave behind products that they did not have time to use.  They lie on a special shelf, and they can be taken for free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel Domus Academic Helsinki" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2130122.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews and prices </h2><p>  Tourists praised the accommodation and services of this hostel in Helsinki.  Inexpensive accommodation, excellent location, good breakfasts, clean, comfortable.  The price of rooms is the lowest in Helsinki.  Double - 4000 rubles, the price for a bed in a room for three people is 2300 rubles.  Paid services are also not too expensive.  Parking costs 1400 rubles per day, washing clothes - 350 p.  for one use of the machine.  Despite the fact that the hostel is located next to the bus and train stations, the place is very quiet.  And most importantly, there is an excellent equipped beach with very good cafes nearby.  Guests are also enthusiastic about the hostel's lobby.  The fact is that the famous storyteller Touve Jansson worked in this building, and now everyone can buy a Moomin figure at the reception in order to forever retain the memory of Helsinki and the hospitality of this city. </p>
