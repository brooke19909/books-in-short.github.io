    <p>  The shady square looked elegant and picturesque, despite its artificial landscape.  Until the end of the 20th century, the park’s atmosphere remained untouched until the modern rhythm of life introduced its own corrections. </p><p>  The Tauride Garden, whose opening hours can be found on its official website, is very easy to find in the city.  First you need to get to the <span>Chernyshevskaya metro station,</span> get out and turn right.  So you find yourself on Furshtatskaya street, walk along it to the intersection with Potemkinskaya.  And across the road you will see one of the entrances to the park. </p><p>  <strong>Tauride Gardens.</strong>  <strong>History</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tauride Garden Greenhouse" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5067/222293.jpg" width="600"></div>  Grigory Potemkin received the princely title and land as a gift from Catherine the Great for services to the Fatherland.  A Tauride castle was built on the spot, and behind it it was decided to set up a garden.  The project was developed and arranged in 1783 by the architect Ivan Starov and garden master William Gould.  Ponds and canals were dug in the garden, and bridges and artificial hills were built.  Unusual trees and shrubs were specially brought from England.  According to the creators, the Tauride Garden, created in a romantic style, was to imitate the beauty of natural nature.  So the Tauride Garden greenhouse appeared.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1866, it became a place of walks and games.  The park hosted concerts and exhibitions.  And in winter, the famous <span>Tauride skating</span> took place here <span>.</span>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the garden began to be considered a Park of Culture and Rest, and a little later there was a <span>sports ground</span> and attractions for children.  In 1920, it was decided to reconstruct the garden.  The redevelopment was entrusted to the architect Fomin. </p><p>  During World War II, the territory of the Tauride Garden turned into a garden where vegetables were grown for the starving citizens.  It was here that workshops were located for the repair of machines transporting products along the Road of Life.  The garden was badly damaged by a fallen German plane, but in 1962 it was completely restored and a monument was erected in memory of those who held the defense of Leningrad.  And on the birthday of St. Petersburg in 2003, the Parliamentary Alley was opened.  At the end of the 20th century, two new pedestals appeared for Yesenin and Tchaikovsky. </p><p>  <strong>Modern Tauride Garden</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tauride Garden Opening Hours" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5067/222292.jpg" width="600"></div>  Today, the appearance of the Tauride Garden has changed for the better.  It became more pleasant to walk along the alleys when dog walking was banned here.  It is a pity that not all pet owners comply with this rule.

    <p>  There are always a lot of athletes in the park: some just run along the paths, others are engaged in the playgrounds.  It's nice to see how women aged selflessly do exercises.  For children, in addition to playgrounds and sports grounds, there is a special studio called IgrAteka.  There are groups of people singing psalms and handing out brochures of religious content. </p><p>  Not far from the garden, right at the intersection of Potemkinskaya and Shpalernaya streets, there is an old greenhouse where it is pleasant to wander among greenery and flowers.  At the same time, look into the store to buy your favorite plant, or a gypsum figurine.  You can also sit in the cafe on the top floor. </p>
