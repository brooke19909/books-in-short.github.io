    <p>  Having played Prince Bolkonsky, the scout Isaev and other goodies, Vyacheslav Tikhonov was very cautious about the remaining roles.  He compared all subsequent characters with the prince, Stirlitz and the teacher from "We'll Live Until Monday", so he could not afford to play negative characters.  This expressed his holistic nature, first of all, he thought about the viewer and could not let him down. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Anechka‚Äôs childhood was cloudless and joyful, and could not be otherwise, because loving parents, especially his father, were always nearby.  Vyacheslav Vasilievich was forty-one years old when Anna Tikhonova was born.  He took this very responsibly and instructed his wife to also be responsible for the life and well-being of his daughter. </p><p>  Dad adored his daughter, he washed his diapers, hung them up, not at all thinking about whether it was men's work or not.  According to the daughter‚Äôs recollections, if the father was at home, he always put her to sleep.  Vyacheslav Vasilievich was a reliable, homely man, he knew how to cook, and when he went on business trips, he always wrote letters with funny pictures, called and brought gifts.  Anna Tikhonova recalled: having learned in advance that dad was going home, everyone was preparing for a meeting: they laid the table, did the cleaning, and so on.  Everyone adored him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Parents </h2><p>  Parents met at Mosfilm: Tamara by this time graduated from the philological department of Moscow State University, worked as a teacher of French at a school on Arbat and still worked as a translator.  In "Mosfilm" she was invited to help translate some scenes from the movie "Man and Woman."  The male role was voiced by Tikhonov.  By this time he was already forty years old, he had an unsuccessful marriage with Nonna Mordyukova, and Tamara was only 24 years old, but she managed to divorce her first husband and was about to marry the Frenchman again. </p><p>  When Vyacheslav found out that she had a groom, he was upset, but did not give up.  After some time, they were together, got married, and Tikhonova Anna Vyacheslavovna was soon born.  Their marriage was happy, Tikhonov did not like noisy companies, parties, Tamara did not like them either.  They understood each other at first sight.  In the summer, they always went to the country, in general, in recent years they have lived in the country on <span>Nikolina Gora.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tikhonova Anna Vyacheslavovna" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45418/1528854.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Vyacheslav Vasilievich did not like the city with its bustle, and having built a summer house with his own hands, he was very proud of it.  Unfortunately, a lot of unpleasant rumors around his family appeared after the departure of the great artist.  Whatever vices were attributed to his wife Tamara for not appearing in public during the funeral service.  But she had a broken hip joint, which was difficult to treat, and it was difficult for her to leave the house. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Anna Tikhonova: personal life </h2><p>  At fifteen, Anna fell in love with the star of the Italian pop, composer and singer Toto Cutugno.  Dad was ready for her to get the moon from the sky, and so he found tickets for the Cutugno concert, bought flowers and in the break held his daughter backstage to the singer.  From happiness and horror, Anna could not utter a word, but the translator came running and introduced the famous singer to an equally famous artist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anna Tikhonova personal life" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45418/1528895.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Anna Tikhonova early on felt like an artist: she spent all her childhood dancing, playing school, but her father did not want her to become an actress, he considered this profession too difficult and dependent.  But she nevertheless tried to enter both the <span>Shchukin School</span> and the Moscow Art Theater School, but eventually entered the VGIK, and there she found her love. </p><p>  Nikolai Vorontsov studied in a parallel flow, and Anya drew attention to him.  He was handsome, tall, slender with long hair.  They <span>fell in love with each other,</span> and when Anna fell ill, he came to her house to visit, and then his parents first saw him.  Anna recalled that Nikolai had taken off his shoes in the hallway, and when Vyacheslav Vasilyevich saw his shoes of enormous size, she began to call the future son-in-law a "bigfoot." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anna Tikhonova photo" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45418/1528872.jpg" width="251"></div>

    <p>  But then something didn‚Äôt work out for them, and Kolya went abroad.  And only a few years later he returned and called her.  She seemed to be waiting for a call and was not at all surprised.  Then Anna realized that she had loved Nikolai all her life.  In February 2002, they got married, and already in 2005 they had twins: Slava and George.  They named the children in honor of their fathers. </p><h2>  Movie roles </h2><p>  Anna starred in many films: </p><ul><li>  "European history." </li><li>  "White crows." </li><li>  "Sochi has dark nights." </li><li>  "Committee of Arkady Fomich." </li><li>  "Mannequin in love." </li><li>  "Strong man." </li><li>  "Adventure". </li><li>  "Dear friend of long forgotten years." </li></ul><p>  In the last two films, she acted as a producer: </p><ul><li>  "Seventeen Moments of Glory." </li><li>  Through the eyes of a wolf. </li></ul><p>  Anna Tikhonova, whose photo with her father is placed in this article, is a talented, interesting woman who has proved that nature does not rest on the children of geniuses. </p>
