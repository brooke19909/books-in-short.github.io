Every year, hundreds of thousands of tourists from all over the world come to the homeland of the goddess Aphrodite to plunge into the atmosphere of antiquity and enjoy a vacation on the magnificent beaches of the island. </p><p>  Cyprus is especially popular with tourists from Russia.  Perhaps this is facilitated by the relatively close location of the island, or perhaps the possibility of free, visa-free entry of citizens of the Russian Federation into the territory of this country. </p>

    <p>  From Moscow to Larnaca or Paphos can be reached in just three and a half hours.  It is in these two cities that there are international airports that accept flights from around the world, including from Moscow.  By the way, in season charter flights from many large cities of Russia fly to Cyprus.  Both Paphos and Larnaca are excellent tourist centers, but there are many other resorts on the island (Ayia Napa, Polis, Limassol, Protaras, etc.), where you can go by bus or taxi upon arrival. </p><p>  By the way, the best option is pre-booking a car.  With wheels under it, it will be possible to travel the entire island far and wide and explore each of its corners.  In this article we will introduce you to the resort town of Protaras, and also talk about the Tsokkos Gardens Hotel 4 * - a wonderful four-star hotel with excellent service and quite reasonable prices, where you can have a wonderful vacation and get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtrue Greek hospitality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Protaras </h2><p>  This resort is one of the youngest in Cyprus.  It is located in the southeast of the island.  There are not many attractions here, but there are wonderful golden beaches, sea landscapes, bizarre cliffs and blue lagoons, and most importantly - peace and quiet. </p>

    <p>  Protaras (see photo in the article) primarily attracts fans of a secluded and lazy beach holiday.  Not so long ago, on the site of luxury fashionable hotels, there were bushes and <span>fig trees.</span>  When it became necessary to build a new resort, the choice fell on this particular section of the beach.  It is located in a bay and is protected by cliffs from the winds.  Due to this, the weather conditions in Protaras are very comfortable for a beach holiday: there are practically no big waves, the air temperature even in the winter months does not drop below + 17 degrees, but in summer it is not hot at all, the air warms up to a maximum of 27-28 degrees.  All this attracts thousands of tourists who long for comfort and peace. </p><h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  Since the resort of Protaras is one of the youngest on the island, almost all the hotels here are new and built using modern technology.  The most common type of hotels are apartment hotels, for example, Tsokkos Gardens Hotel Apts.  Cyprus is generally considered an expensive resort, but the prices are relatively low, which does not affect the level of service.  Here you will find a great value for money. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Rooms are cleaned daily and linen is changed every 3 days.  By the way, non-smoking hotel has private rooms. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  As already noted, the Tsokkos Gardens Hotel (Cyprus / Protaras) consists of several buildings, which include both rooms and public areas: <span>lobbies, bars,</span> restaurants, a gym, etc. The buildings have an elevator.  In front of the central building is a beautiful, and most importantly, always clean outdoor pool of an original form, next to it is a small and shallow children's pool.  There is also a bar. </p><p>  Indoor facilities also include a heated indoor pool.

However, there are also reviews in which tourists talk about a wonderful organized and rich entertainment program, especially for children.

But showers and changing rooms are free.  On the beach you can find many water activities: catamarans, scooters, parachutes, bananas, water skiing, etc. Diving instructors will help you make an underwater trip to the coral reefs. </p>

In a word, lovers of antiquity and excursions here will not have to be bored either. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews Tsokkos Gardens Hotel </h2><p>  The biggest advantages of this hotel, according to vacationers, are the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff.  Guests also appreciate the efforts of professional chefs.  Among the shortcomings are poor Internet connection, as well as a small range of entertainment services. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Based on the foregoing, it must be assumed that this hotel can be an ideal vacation spot for middle-aged people, as well as senior citizens and families with children.  But youth is better to choose a hotel for relaxation, in which there are a lot of noisy nightly entertainment. </p>
