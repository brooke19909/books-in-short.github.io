  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Resorts of Finland: we are going to visit Santa Claus!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For some, Finland is a country in which a relative of Santa Claus's beloved Santa Claus lives.  Someone, imagining this country, thinks about the calm and leisurelyness of local residents.  And for some, Finland is the world of skiing, traveling across the country of crystal rivers and pristine lakes, snow-white slopes and unusual ice houses. </p><p>  How to relax? </p><p>  Finnish resorts are unique and original - you can spend your vacation on the <span>ski slopes</span> or snowboarding tracks, excursions on <span>cable cars</span> and lifts, great fishing and dog and <span>reindeer sledding,</span> as well as acquaintance with the Finnish culture and the folk epic Kalevala, and even the most a real visit to Santa Claus.  This amazing country at any time of the year makes an indelible impression on guests from different countries.  There are very few historical monuments - the main advantage of the country is its natural beauty and pristine natural charm.  Finnish resorts offer tourists ample opportunities for walks through the picturesque forests and lakeshore, annually covered with real carpets, "woven" by nature itself from lingonberries, strawberries and blueberries. </p><p>  Positive reviews about the resorts of Finland and the most vivid emotions from visiting them can appear only after tasting the uniquely delicious dishes of local cuisine.  Of course, the not too generous nature of this country does not allow you to greatly diversify the diet, but from the few products that Finland is rich in, you get wonderful dishes that are popular all over the world.  First of all, these are dishes from wide fish wealth that inhabit coastal waters and the depths of inland lakes.  Variety of these dishes can be meat of birds and wild animals.  Finns make ‚ÄúViliya‚Äù from milk, a delicious sweet and sour product that is added to some dairy dishes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Finnish ski holidays </p><p>  You can relax and gain strength at one of the 120 most popular resorts in this snowy country.  You can have a wonderful vacation in the towns of Saariselk√§ and Yll√§s, Olos and Vuokatti, Pyh√§ and Levi, where the tourist infrastructure is excellently developed.  Here, <span>skiing</span> has long been considered not entertainment, but a true lifestyle.  Finland's ski resorts will help everyone to experience the incredible feeling of flight, boundless and magical, free and seemingly endless.  Who will refuse to repeat these feelings? </p><p>  Both professional athletes and beginners who have just recently started skiing - for a skier of any level, this country will offer something especially and interesting that can surprise you.  The resorts of Finland have gained popularity largely due to the variety of slopes and tracks: long and gentle slopes for those who are just developing skills and learning to cope with the load, sharp turns and bends - for speed lovers and true professionals.  There are special tracks for fans of snowboarding and cross-country skiing tracks, as well as unusually picturesque and convenient places for sports holidays for the whole family. </p><p>  In general, Finland is the best fit for a friendly vacation for parents and children.  There are many children's ski schools and specialized tracks, and for the smallest there are gentle toboggan runs.  If parents want to devote a little time to themselves - and in this case there is a way out: kindergartens, in which experienced nannies and instructors will deal with restless tourists. </p><p>  In the evening, resorts in Finland offer their guests a chic entertainment program.  Have you thought about clubs and restaurants?  Yes, such types of entertainment are present here, but nevertheless, they can become the most exciting Finnish event, but the real Finnish sauna.  Such feelings can not be experienced by any person in the world if he has not spent at least a couple of days in this magical snowy country. </p>
