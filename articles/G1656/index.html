This area at all times was a deep province.  Throughout its history, until the locality became part of Russia, it belonged to Georgia and Armenia.  And sometimes even the Turks. </p><p>  What is the city of Georgia Bolnisi today?  Sights and other information about it are presented in this article. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="41.3879166" data-lng="44.51195510000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/2/5/3/18253.png"></div><h2>  General information about the town </h2><p>  The city is the capital of the Bolnisi municipality.  This calm and quiet town, hidden among the greenery of coniferous vegetation, extends along the highway for several kilometers.  The infrastructure of the city is several shops and cafes, where visitors are offered excellent barbecue and traditional Georgian khachapuri.  There are no modern hotels or hotels for tourists in Bolnisi yet. </p><p>  There is a railway station in the city of Bolnisi of the Georgian railway (Marneuli-Kazreti line).  It should also be noted that in the nearby village of Rachisubani there is a source of mineral water that is not inferior in taste to the famous Borjomi water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sv.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern Bolnisi" class="if uuid-3253348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3253348.jpg"></div><h2>  Briefly from the story </h2><p>  Bolnisi (Georgia) has a long and rather interesting history.  At the time of its foundation, the settlement was called Choruk Kemerli, and for the first time it was renamed Katerinfeld in 1818 in honor of Ekaterina Pavlovna, sister of Tsar Alexander I. At that time, German families from Swabia settled here (95 in total).  After the military operations of 1918, the Bolsheviks seized the region, and in 1921 the village was renamed and became known as Luxembourg.  The name was given in honor of the famous German Communist R. Luxembourg. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In connection with the mass repressions at the beginning of World War II, the German population moved to Siberia and Kazakhstan.  Moreover, only those Germans who were already married to the Georgians were left in the settlement. </p><p>  The next change in the name of the settlement occurred in 1944.  Since then it has become known as Bolnisi.  In Georgia, the ancient village located the same south-west of it has the same name.  After such serious transformations, the settlement remained multinational, but so far the majority of the population are not Georgians.  The largest community is represented by representatives of the Azerbaijani nation.  Since December 1967, Bolnisi has the status of a city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Cozy streets" class="if uuid-3253368" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3253368.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The city, which has a rather long history, can be called young, since it began to develop and build actively only in the 20th century.

There is the Kolagiri fortress located in the village of Tsurtavi, as well as the Tsugrugasheni monastery church in the area.  In the rural settlements of Kveshi and Paladauri there are also ancient medieval fortresses, perfectly preserved, despite their considerable age.  There are two churches in the village of Tanzia, and a magnificent panorama opens next to the surrounding hill. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="beejey.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fortress Kolagiri" class="if uuid-3253361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3253361.jpg"></div><p>  Not far from Bolnisi is the modern village of Kazreti.
