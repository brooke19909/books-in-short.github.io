    <h2>  Alexander Fleming </h2><p>  The future inventor of penicillin was born in August 1881 in the small Scottish town of Lochfield.  After secondary education, he went to London and became a student at the Royal Polytechnic Institute.  On the advice of a professional physicist and his brother Tom, Alexander decided to do science, in 1903 he joined the hospital of St. Mary and began surgical practice.  After the war, where he saw many deaths, Fleming decided to find a cure that would cope with infections.  Famous English scientists have already worked on the issue, but no one has been able to achieve significant results.  The only thing that was invented is an antiseptic that only reduces the protective functions of the body.  Fleming proved that this treatment is not suitable for the treatment of deep wounds.  By 1928, he began to study bacteria from the staphylococcal family.  Once, returning from vacation, Fleming found on the table fungal colonies that had infected harmful microorganisms.  The scientist decided to grow mold in its pure form and isolated penicillin from it.  Until the forties, he improved his form and soon his production became large-scale and was accepted in hospitals.  In 1944, together with his colleague, Flory received a knighthood.  The names of famous scientists reached the Nobel Committee, and already in 1945 they received an award in the field of medicine.  The Royal College of Physicians has made Fleming an honorary member.  Not all famous English scientists can boast of such achievements.  Fleming is an outstanding talent and a person worthy of mention in any list of the best doctors in the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Names of famous scientists" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/753413.jpg" width="332"></div>

For example, Gregor Mendel was born in July 1882 in a family of simple peasants and studied at a theological institute.  He acquired all his deep knowledge of biology on his own.  Soon he began to teach, and then went to a university in Vienna, where he began to study hybrid plants.  With the help of many experiments on peas, he derived a theory of the laws of inheritance.  The names of famous scientists were often given to their inventions, and Mendel was no exception.  Gregor's works did not interest his contemporaries, he quit his job in the laboratory and became abbot in the monastery.  The revolutionary nature of his discoveries and their deep meaning became apparent to biologists only at the beginning of the twentieth century, after the death of Gregor Mendel.  Famous scientists of Russia and the world use his theories now.  Mendel‚Äôs principles are taught at a basic level in schools. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Famous scientists of Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/753751.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Leonardo da Vinci </h2><p>  Few famous scientists are as popular as Leonardo.  He was not only an outstanding physicist, but also a creator, his paintings and sculptures delight people around the world, and his life itself serves as a source of inspiration for his works: he is a truly interesting and mysterious person.  The greatest Renaissance figure was born in April 1452.  Since childhood, Leonardo was fond of painting, architecture, sculpture.  He was distinguished by impressive knowledge in the fields of natural sciences, physics and mathematics.  Many of his works were evaluated only after centuries, and contemporaries often did not pay attention to them.  Leonardo was fond of the idea of <span>aircraft,</span> but he failed to implement a working project.  In addition, he studied the many laws of fluid and hydraulics.  Well-known scientists are rarely famous as artists.  Leonardo is a great artist, author of the famous "Mona Lisa" and the painting "The Last Supper."  Numerous manuscripts remained after him.  Many foreign and well-known Russian scientists still use Da Vinci‚Äôs achievements, created by him until 1519, when he died while in France. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Blaise Pascal </h2><p>  This French scientist was born in June 1623 in Clermont-Ferrand, in the family of a judge.  Pascal's father was known for his love of science.  In 1631 the family moved to Paris, where Blaise wrote his first work on the sound of vibrating bodies - this happened when the boy was only 11 years old.  Few famous scientists from Russia and the world can boast such an early success!  Blaise surprised people with his mathematical abilities, he was able to prove that the sum of the angles of a triangle equals two straight lines.  At 16, he wrote a treatise on a hexagon inscribed in a circle.  Based on it, the well-known Pascal theorem will be developed later.  In 1642, Blaise developed a mechanical calculating machine that could carry out addition and subtraction.  However, like many other famous scientists and their discoveries, Blaise with his "Pascalina" did not become too famous among his contemporaries.  Today, its variations on the theme of calculating machines are stored in the best museums in Europe.  In addition, the contribution of Pascal to science is invaluable - modern scientists also use it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Famous scientists and their discoveries" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/753418.jpg" width="341"></div>

    <h2>  Alexander Popov </h2><p>  Many well-known Russian scientists have made inventions that are now used by the whole world.  These include <span>Alexander Popov, the</span> creator of the radio, born in a Ural village in the family of a priest.  The first education he received at the theological school, after which he entered the seminary.  Going to the University of St. Petersburg, Popov ran into financial difficulties, so he had to work in parallel with his studies.  Alexander became interested in physics and began to teach it in Kronstadt.  Since 1901, he served as a professor at the Institute of Electrical Engineering in St. Petersburg, and then became its rector.  The main interest of his life remained inventions and experiments.  He studied electromagnetic vibrations.  In 1895 he presented the public with a radio.  From 1897 he worked on his improvement.  Popov‚Äôs assistants Rybkin and Troitsky confirmed the possibility of using it to receive hearing signals.  Popov made final modifications and thereby created a device that is now in almost every home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Nikola Tesla </h2><p>  This scientist was born in Austria-Hungary.  Like Popov, Tesla was the son of a priest.  In 1870 he graduated from high school and enrolled in college, where he became interested in electrical engineering.  For several years he worked as a teacher in a gymnasium, after which he went to the University of Prague.  In parallel, Nicola worked in a telegraph company, and then - with Edison.  All the years of training he tried to invent an electric motor operating on alternating current.  He moved to the United States, where he did successful work to improve the machine created by Edison.  However, Tesla did not receive money from that, after which he quit and established his own laboratory in New York.  By the beginning of the twentieth century, Nicola already had several patents - he invented a frequency meter and an electricity meter.  In 1915 he was nominated for a Nobel Prize.  He never stopped working and made a significant contribution to science, died in 1943 after an accident - Tesla fell under a car, and broken ribs led to too complicated pneumonia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Famous English scientists" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/753420.jpg" width="374"></div>

    <h2>  Friedrich Schiller </h2><p>  As everyone knows, well-known scientists can be not only in the field of <span>exact sciences.</span>  An excellent example for this is <span>Friedrich Schiller</span> , a historian and philosopher who has done a lot for his fields of knowledge and has made an invaluable contribution to the literary heritage.  He was born in 1759 in the Holy Roman Empire, but already in 1763 he moved with his family to Germany.  In 1766 he ended up in Ludwigsburg, where he graduated from the medical faculty.  Schiller began to create in the process of training, and in 1781 his first drama saw the light of day and received such recognition that it was staged in the theater the next year.  This play is still considered one of the first and most successful melodramas in Europe.  All his life, Schiller created, translated plays from other languages, and also taught history and philosophy at universities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="World famous scientists" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/753422.jpg" width="264"></div>

    <h2>  Abraham Maslow </h2><p>  Abraham Maslow is a confirmation that famous scientists can be not only mathematicians and physicists.  His theory of self-realization is known to absolutely everyone.  Maslow was born in 1908 in New York.  His parents mistreated him and humiliated him in every possible way, and his Jewish origin caused anti-Semitic antics from his peers.  This developed an inferiority complex in little Abraham, which is why he hid in the library and spent days reading books.  Later, he gradually began to establish himself in life - first in High School, participating in various clubs, and then at the Department of Psychology, where he received a master's degree in 1931.  In 1937, Maslow became a member of the faculty of the Brooklyn College, where he worked for most of his life.  When the war broke out, Maslow was already unsuitable for service, but at the same time he learned a lot from this bloody event - it influenced his research in the field of humanitarian psychology.  In 1943, Maslow developed his famous Theory of Personality Motivation, in which he stated that each person has a pyramid of needs that need to be satisfied in order to fulfill themselves.  In 1954, he published the book Motivation and Personality, where he explained his theory in the most detail and developed it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Most famous scientist" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/753423.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Albert Einstein </h2><p>  Any discussion on the topic "Famous scientists and their discoveries" will not do without mentioning Albert Einstein, a brilliant physicist who is at the forefront of the modern understanding of this science.  Einstein was born in Germany in 1879, he was always a modest and quiet boy, he did not stand out from the rest of the children.  And only when he became interested in Kant, did Einstein discover a talent for exact sciences.  This helped him to successfully complete the gymnasium, and then the Zurich Polytechnic in Switzerland, where he moved.  Even in college, he began to write various articles and other works, to conduct research.  Naturally, in the end, this led to a number of discoveries that are known to the whole world - the theory of relativity, the photoelectric effect, <span>Brownian motion,</span> and so on.  After some time, Einstein moved to the United States, got a job there at Princeton and set himself the goal of working on the theory of a single <span>gravitational electromagnetic field.</span> </p><h2>  Andre-Marie Ampere </h2><p>  Well-known scientists of the world who worked in the field of physics are not limited to Einstein.  For example, Andre-Marie Amp√®re was born in 1775 in France.  His father did not want his son to study centrally, so he taught him himself, and books helped him in this.  Amp√®re was literally brought up on the works of Rousseau, which affected his further work.  After the Revolution and the death of his father, Amp√®re marries and returns to normal.  He continues to teach, and in 1802 becomes a teacher of mathematics and chemistry in one of the schools.  However, at the same time, he was conducting research on his well-known probability theory, because of which he ended up at the Paris Academy and wrote one of his most recognized works, The Mathematical Game Theory.  In 1809, Amper received the title of professor, and in 1814 he became a member of the Academy of Sciences.  After that, he proceeds to research in the field of electrodynamics, and in 1826 he created his most famous work, "A Scientific Essay on the Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena." </p>
