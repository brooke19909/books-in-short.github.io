  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best places to stay in Crimea: Hotel-Park Rhodes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The wonderful rule ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt seek good from good‚Äù is quite applicable to rest on the <span>southern coast of Crimea.</span>  Why do we need a ‚ÄúTurkish coast‚Äù if the unique climate zone is located very close, combining the healing mountain air, telassotherapeutic properties of the sea and the unique flora of the Crimean coast. </p><p>  Not so long ago, hotels located in a park area, or located on a well-maintained forest plot, with walkways and exquisite architectural design, have become very popular for recreation.  Such a charming shelter for tourists has received the name hotel - park. </p><p>  Park hotels of Crimea are located in the resort area, on the coast.  Descent to the sea, as a rule, does not take much time and is a fascinating journey through the park area, among palm trees and exotic southern shrubs. </p><p>  One of the most famous on the <span>Black Sea coast of</span> Crimea is the Rhodes Park Hotel, located in Miskhor - a unique southern town that is characterized by all the features of the resort villages of Crimea. </p><p>  Miskhor is located only 12 km from Yalta, and has the title of one of the warmest on the coast.  The hotel-park is a unique cottage complex, spread out near a juniper grove, filling the fragrance with the evenings of vacationers.  The Rhodes complex (Miskhor) consists of six highly comfortable cottages, as well as an administrative and household complex. </p><p>  On the territory of the Rhodes Hotel there are parking, restaurants and bars, a massage room.  There is also the opportunity to use the pool, which is managed by the Ai-Petri sanatorium, the beach and the lovely children's playground.  These services are included in the price at the Rhodes Park Hotel and give vacationers the opportunity to diversify their leisure time and spend their <span>holidays in Crimea</span> even more interestingly <span>.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Miskhor hotel-park is located near the world-famous pearl of history and architecture - the <span>Vorontsov Palace,</span> and not far from the sanatorium-medical complexes "Dyulber" and "Ai-Petri". </p><p>  Hotel-Park Rhodes is adjacent to the famous <span>Miskhoro Park, whose</span> charming shady paths even in the most intense heat give guests a saving shadow, and the landscape design of which is elegant and simple at the same time.  Brooks and small fountains of the park evoke peace and coolness, sculptural compositions allow you to think about art, and small architectural forms successfully complement the design of the park and make it truly unique. </p><p>  Not far from Rhodes is the <span>cable car</span> to Ai-Petri, where any self-respecting tourist should definitely make an excursion.  Indeed, from the tops of the mountain, a stunning panoramic view of the coast opens, the sea appears in all its immensity and its turquoise is amazing.  Another memorable trip from the Rhodes Park Hotel may be a visit to <span>the Massandra tasting room,</span> where you will certainly be allowed to taste the best wines of Crimea and tell the amazing story of Massandra's wine cellars.  In this tour, your main task will be to get the maximum information on the history of winemaking, but to stop in time during the tasting of unique Crimean wines. </p><p>  The hotel-park on the basis of the neighboring Ay-Petri sanatorium can offer vacationers a course of treatment in one of four profiles: the cardiovascular and nervous systems, as well as the upper respiratory tract and musculoskeletal system.  The excellent medical and preventive base of the sanatorium provides those wishing to strengthen their health with accurate diagnostics, treatment rooms with modern equipment, a gymnastics room, exercise machines, and an inhalation.  For those wishing to turn to non-traditional methods of treatment - the services of a homeopath, acupuncturist and chiropractor. </p>
