Reasons and methods for eliminating wheezing in speakers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nothing obscures the car enthusiast on the road or the music lover while listening to your favorite tracks, like the sudden appearance of wheezing in the audio system.  It is often quite difficult to determine the reason why the speakers wheeze in a completely new acoustics. </p><h2>  Causes </h2><p>  Wheezing in the columns can appear at virtually any intermediate stage of signal processing.  The main task in this case is to identify the source of malfunctions in the speaker system, finding the problem place, due to which the speakers wheeze.  What to do when a failed node is successfully identified will depend on the cause of the failure and the nature of the damage. </p><p>  In most cases, the speakers begin to wheeze due to the amplifier.  The wheezing then is just audible non-linear distortion.  These distortions occur due to insufficient bias of the amplifier element when it is introduced into the linear mode in which the amplifier microcircuit operates. </p><p>  Without special knowledge in electronic circuits and skills to work with a soldering iron, it is problematic to fix the problem on your own in this situation, and therefore, a wheezing column should be taken to a service center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gulfcoastmuseum.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car audio" class="if uuid-2742320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/2742320.jpg"></div><h2>  Wheezing and hissing of speakers </h2><p>  Often with a situation when the speaker wheezes or the entire speaker system immediately, motorists are faced.  Most complaints come immediately after installing new speakers or radio in the car.  Sometimes a problem is solved in the simplest way. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The fact is that some perceive the hissing of the speakers of the audio system as wheezing.  They observe, turning the radio knob in the car, that when the volume is increased, the speakers wheeze, although in reality they emit a strong hiss.  If you can hear it from all connected speakers, then the reason is most likely in poorly compatible speakers and radio tape recorder.  Usually this happens when the power of the amplifier is too high relative to the speaker system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.autance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Speakers from acoustics" class="if uuid-2742323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/2742323.jpg"></div><h2>  Correspondence of power of acoustics and amplifier </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the average car radio produces 45-55 watts of power.  Car speakers have a power of about 20-40 watts or more.  As a rule, manufacturers on boxes and shops in product cards prefer to indicate peak acoustics or RMS watts.  To get the real value, the declared one needs to be divided by about 10. That is, typical 300-watt speakers produce in reality about 30 watts of nominal volume.  All this applies to household computer speakers. </p><h2>  Diagnosis of wheezing columns </h2><p>  You should first analyze the situations in which you can hear <span>extraneous noise,</span> sounds and wheezing.  Only then can we understand why the speakers or individual speakers wheeze.  First, you need to answer two basic questions for the localization of the malfunction: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  One speaker wheezes or all at once? </li><li>  At maximum or minimum volume, wheezing is best heard? </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.yelp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The master repairs the speaker" class="if uuid-2742324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/2742324.jpg"></div><h2>  Wheezing in one speaker or all columns </h2><p>  The simultaneous wheezing of all the speakers is either due to improper selection of the amplifier (described above), or the problem lies in poor contact, poor-quality wires or a worn connector on the radio.  The latter is possible when all speakers are connected through one input.  Also, simultaneous failure of all columns is not excluded, however this is unlikely. </p><p>  If only one speaker wheezes, then it is worth checking the contacts for corrosion and the connector on the radio.  Similarly, the wire and the quality of contact with the connector are tested.  A quick way to check the speaker is to connect a known-good connection instead.  If wheezing is lost, the old speaker will have to be replaced or repaired. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.halfords.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Checking the radio in a car" class="if uuid-2742315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/2742315.jpg"></div><h2>  Wheezing at minimum or maximum volume </h2><p>  The reason why the speaker wheezes at minimum volume is almost always hidden in the speaker itself.  Often the wires from the terminal to the coil are broken off or frayed during use.  Due to poor contact, wheezing occurs, which can be eliminated only by soldering new wires.  It is important to consider that they must be exactly the same in cross section. </p><p>  At maximum volume, most problems arise at the output of a sound amplifier.  Distortion in the form of wheezing appears at heavy load.  The amplifier can not cope with it because of a punctured capacitor, which must be replaced with a new one.  Another reason may be moisture entering the speaker suspension.  Replacing a suspension spreaded by moisture is also acceptable.  The third cause of wheezing at high volume levels is considered to be dirt in the dynamics.  For repair, it is necessary to remove the suspension and diffuser, and then carefully blow the speaker through the compressor. </p><p>  These are just the most basic reasons why columns wheeze.  If these manipulations do not lead to a positive effect, then the speakers can not do without a professional examination in a service center. </p>
