    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  La Grace Resort is located in a very convenient place for tourists.  Firstly, next to the airport - to go to it for a maximum of half an hour, or even 20 minutes.  Nevertheless, the distance is more than 20 kilometers, so that planes flying by regularly will not annoy travelers with their noise. </p><p>  What about the sea?  It is also nearby.  Just over 500 meters you need to walk to get to Benaulima beach.  Many do not like that this is not the first coastline, but the second.  But what to do, anyway, 500-600 meters - this is not two or three thousand kilometers, so this nuance can be endured.  In addition, this is still considered a plus (at least among the locals).  It is pleasant to live in a place located on the 2nd coastline, since you do not have to constantly encounter a crowd of other tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are also local attractions nearby.  One of the most important is the Old Church, it is 25 km from the hotel.  By the way, the railway station is also located nearby - only three kilometers you need to drive to it. </p>

    <h2>  Best booking option </h2><p>  La Grace Resort has several room categories and, accordingly, more than one accommodation option.  But the best is considered to be the booking of spacious two-bedroom apartments.  This is an awesome room!  People staying at La Grace Resort are exceptionally positive.  Everyone says that for such a price the conditions are simply gorgeous.  And the cost is really as low as possible - 75 thousand rubles for four for 14 days (!) With breakfast.  It turns out about 1300 p.  from each per day.  And this is really very small.  True, we must make a reservation that sometimes the price may be higher than the declared one.  It all depends on the moment at which the person is booking.  From the season or from whether the hotel has established any discounts and super offers.  But if you get to just such a good time (and the hotel arranges discounts regularly), then you can save a large amount. </p><h2>  Accommodations </h2><p>  And now it‚Äôs worthwhile to tell in more detail about the conditions that are offered to the guests in the 2-bedroom apartments of La Grace Resort.  It‚Äôs worth starting from the square.  It is as much as 107 square meters!  On this huge square there are two bedrooms, a private kitchen with a dining room (although it‚Äôs more correct to call it a dining area) and, of course, a bathroom with a toilet.  High-grade apartment - you can say with confidence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Each room has a huge king-size bed (although in the conditions it is declared as a normal 2-bedroom) and furniture - bedside tables, a wardrobe and other ‚Äútrifle‚Äù.  Also includes a flat-screen TV with satellite channels, air conditioning, a work desk, a comfortable sofa and even a personal seating area.  And of course, people staying in this room are offered the ‚ÄúWake-up call‚Äù service and towels are provided. </p>

    <h2>  Deluxe Apartment </h2><p>  Another option that is often booked in the hotel complex La Grace Resort 3 *.  If you manage to get on a special offer (promotional or discount), you can book this room for 30 thousand rubles for two (the price is indicated for 7 days) with breakfast.  The deluxe apartment can accommodate two guests. </p><p>  How can conditions please?  The area here, of course, is small - 19 square meters.  But there is everything you need for comfort and coziness.  In the sleeping area there is a large comfortable bed.  There is also good air conditioning and a private minibar.  The bathroom, in which both the bathtub itself and the shower (and, of course, the toilet) are installed, is spacious and clean.  By the way, each guest is provided with towels, which are regularly changed during the rest.  A work desk, a separate seating area, a plasma TV with satellite TV - all this is in the apartment.  So it is not surprising that this category of rooms in La Grace Resort 3 * is in demand. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Many people, going on vacation to this or that hotel, learn in advance about how the issue of nutrition is organized there.  Well, in the case of La Grace Resort (Goa), you can be absolutely calm about this topic.  On the territory of the complex there are two pleasant establishments where you can eat deliciously.  The first is a restaurant called Imperial Venus.  It serves fresh and original dishes related to international cuisine.  The restaurant room is designed for 56 guests.  The institution opens at 12:30 for two hours (that is, until half past two) and then at 19:30, after which it works until 11 pm. </p><p>  And the second institution is a cafe called Sun Dial.  It can fit 48 people.  It works from seven to half past ten (as you might guess, breakfast is served there).  Then the cafe is open from 12:30 to 14:30 and in the evening according to the same schedule as the restaurant of La Grace Resort. </p><p>  The reviews of tourists who visited these establishments are inspiring.  People claim that they do not spare portions in the restaurant and cafe, and the food is varied, original and tasty every day.  And if you couldn‚Äôt eat, then not far from the complex there are various cafes and grocery stores.  There you can also find a lot of interesting things. </p>

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  And finally, a few more important nuances that you should know when setting out to relax at the La Grace Resort 4 * hotel (south of Goa).  Firstly, the hotel can still offer a transfer from the airport, which is a very useful condition for a non-native person.  True, it may be paid. </p><p>  If guests come to the hotel with a small child who is two years old or less, then you do not need to pay for it.  An extra bed can be provided if agreed in advance.  And with existing beds, accommodation is absolutely free.  Also, only pre-registered guests can be accommodated in the rooms, so that  when booking, you must specify in full - each tourist. </p><p>  And reviews are advised to reserve apartments long before the start of the vacation.  Since the hotel is quite famous and the available rooms can be simply sold out, if you catch your mind a week before the trip. </p>
