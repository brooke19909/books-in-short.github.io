    <h2>  Some interesting facts </h2><p>  A curious story is the origin of the idea of <span>"Stalin's skyscrapers" in Moscow.</span>  It appeared after the return of one of the delegations from New York.  They admired this overseas city, its skyscrapers.  And then it was decided to build <span>high-rise buildings</span> in Moscow, so to speak, so as not to be left behind. </p><p>  A team of specialists was created under the direction of Arkady Mordvinov, head of the Academy of Architecture of the Soviet Union.  Outstanding and talented Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky became one of the leading designers.  He carefully studied the technology of erecting multi-story buildings, as he was involved in the development and took part in the construction of buildings for temporary residence.  The hotel building project in Dorogomilovo (as it was originally planned to call the future hotel) became one of the most interesting things for him. </p><p>  In 1953, began to develop a project and construction, which involved more than two thousand workers.  And on May 25, 1957, a beautiful hotel opened its doors to its first visitors. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel "Ukraine" - a masterpiece of architectural creativity of the mid XX century </h2><p>  Hotel "Ukraine" (Moscow) impresses with its size.  It is the largest in height (206 meters with a 73-meter spire, on which a hammer and sickle is hoisted) not only in the capital of Russia, but also in Europe.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe premises is about 89 thousand m <sup>2</sup> .  And despite this, the openwork and airiness of the building, which has 34 floors, fascinates. </p><p>  The building consists of three parts.  The main tower on both sides was surrounded by nine-story buildings with an impressive view.  They were originally intended for permanent housing. </p><p>  <span>The chic interior</span> with its typeset parquet, bronze chandeliers, massive natural wood furniture, many paintings by famous artists and the facade with elegant decorative decoration always amazed guests with its luxury. </p><p>  The materials used in the construction and decoration are environmentally friendly and not cheap. </p><p>  Since 1987, it is considered a state-protected monument of history and architecture. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Radisson</span> Royal <span>Hotel</span> Moscow </h2><p>  The Radisson Royal Hotel (Moscow) is the name of the Ukraine Hotel today.  The address in Moscow remained the same, but a private owner appeared.  By decision of the capital‚Äôs government, in 2005 the hotel complex was sold.  But the main condition of the auction was a complete restoration of the building while maintaining the former appearance of both the facade and the interior. </p><p>  In the same year, restoration work was carried out on the outside, and at the beginning of 2007 the hotel closed for a full-scale restoration of the interior.  Improvements were made to technical systems and the arrangement of the area around the hotel. </p><p>  In 2009, the hotel complex was transferred to The Rezidor Hotel Group, one of the leading hotel business in the world, which still manages it. </p><p>  As a result of restoration <span>work</span> , the atmosphere of ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù was preserved <span>in the hotel</span> , but a modern technical structure was created, a high degree of security and excellent comfort were provided. </p>
