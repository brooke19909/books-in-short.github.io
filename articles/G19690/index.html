Read more about how this process goes and how the inventory of emission sources inventory is completed, read on. </p><h2>  Terminology </h2><p>  A stationary source of emissions is any source of pollutant emissions located on the territory of the audited enterprise.  They are conditionally divided into two types: </p><ul><li>  organized (release through gas ducts and pipes); </li><li>  unorganized (emissions enter the atmosphere as a result of a malfunction of the equipment). </li></ul>

    <h2>  The timing </h2><p>  The organization conducting the audit must comply with applicable standards.  If the work is carried out by the forces of its own unit, then it is not necessary to issue a license for their implementation.  An inventory of sources of atmospheric emissions from new, modernized sources should be carried out once every two years from the date the documentation for the equipment was released.  According to current emission sources, 1 time in: </p><ul><li>  4 years - for objects assigned to the 1st category; </li><li>  5 years - for objects assigned to the 2nd and 3rd categories; </li><li>  6 years - for objects of the 4th category; </li><li>  10 years - for objects of the 5th category. </li></ul><p>  Mobile sources of emissions of pollutants, as well as facilities equipped with an automated control system that are being mothballed, are not subject to verification. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Stages </h2><p>  The verification is carried out in the following sequence: </p><ul><li>  training; </li><li>  examination; </li><li>  receipt and presentation of results. </li></ul><p>  Consider each of the steps in more detail. </p><h2>  Documentation </h2><p>  Before an inventory of pollutant emission sources is carried out, the organization must: </p><ul><li>  adjust the ventilation system and issue a passport for it; </li><li>  to equip selection sites according to the requirements of regulatory enactments; </li><li>  prepare a certificate on the methods of controlling technological equipment; </li><li>  prepare statistics on annual production, the amount of all types of consumed raw materials and excipients. </li></ul><p>  For reference are attached: </p><ul><li>  chemical reaction data; </li><li>  process diagrams; </li><li>  order of launch and withdrawal of equipment; </li><li>  other documentation necessary to understand all aspects of the work. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Training </h2><p>  At this stage, it is necessary to carry out a number of activities: </p><p>  - Develop a work program.  This task lies with the head of the environmental service and representatives of organizations involved in the process. </p><p>  - Issue <span>an order to conduct an inventory, a</span> sample of which will be presented later.  It indicates the persons responsible for conducting the audit as a whole throughout the organization and in a particular unit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  - Examine the design documentation for raw materials used in production.  Specialists should identify pollutants released in the process.  To do this, they get acquainted with the results of previous surveys of raw materials and equipment.  All documentary materials are provided to the head of the service in agreement with the engineer. </p><p>  - Visually check the gas control units (GOU), determine the location, size, location, direction of emissions.  Based on the results of the inspection, the scope of work, the period of their implementation, the necessary support in the form of sampling points and measuring instruments are determined. </p><p>  - Assess the condition of ventilation systems, GOU. </p><p>  Based on the results of the check, an inventory act is drawn up, a form of which can be obtained from representatives of the environmental service.  It concludes that the equipment is operational.  The document is signed by members of the commission.  If any deviations are detected, employees of the organization, under the guidance of a mechanic (power engineer) and the control of an environmental officer, perform work to eliminate them.  Then repeated inspection is carried out.  If the work cannot be completed by the deadline, then they are included in the inventory of emission sources.  The document indicates the deadlines, fixes the need for re-inspection and current measurements. </p><h2>  Inventory Order: Sample </h2><p>  LLC "AVS" </p><p>  Moscow 12/21/2016 </p><p>  Order </p><p>  about inventory </p><p>  To carry out the audit _________________________ a commission is appointed consisting of: </p><p>  Chairman: Name  Employee Signature </p><p>  Members of the Commission:  Signature staff </p><p>  Verification is subject to ___________________________. </p><p>  To begin the inventory on December 20, 2016 and finish on December 25, 2016. </p><p>  Hand over inventory materials to Rosprirodnazor before 12/28/2016. </p><p>  Head Ivanov I.I. </p>

For this purpose, carry out a minimum of six control samples during the process.

The amount of emissions is determined based on information on fuel consumption and the operating time of pollutant sources for the previous year. </p><p>  Inventory of sources of emissions of pollutants provides an assessment of the category of impact of facilities on air.  This process can be carried out according to the results of the last check: </p><ul><li>  for objects assigned to groups 4 and 5 with a hazard indicator value of less than 0.1, refined pollutant calculations are carried out, their quantitative and qualitative composition is established; </li><li>  For facilities assigned to groups 1-3 with a hazard indicator value of more than 0.1, balance diagrams of energy flows are drawn up for the previous year, indicating the amount of raw materials used, electricity, fuel, and the number of manufactured products. </li></ul>
