  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Domestic history and its place in modern education</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The study of history has long been given quite a large amount of time both in schools and in universities.  This science does not study any one side of the life of society, but all of it in the aggregate at a certain moment.  At present, Russian history is studied in almost all educational institutions, independently not only of the level of education received, but also of the future specialty.  The only difference between <span>training programs</span> is depth.  It is reasonable that liberal arts students will know more in this field than those who prefer natural sciences. </p><p>  Domestic history is divided into several periods, which, in turn, are studied by schoolchildren and students of universities.  Despite the fact that different scientists, as well as ordinary people, look at the same event differently, the purpose of this science is not so much to evaluate the facts as to acquaint them with them, to reveal not laws, but randomness.  Students in the classroom learn to reason, analyze, generalize. </p><p>  Of course, depending on the future specialty, it is necessary to know the development of a certain science.  So, philologists will be interested in the history of Russian literature, which, in turn, was greatly influenced by the development of society as a whole.  Mastering this discipline helps to better understand the process of becoming science as a whole. </p><p>  Domestic history is part of the general and studies the formation and formation of the Russian state.  One of the main tasks of her teaching in educational institutions is the education of citizenship and patriotism.  In addition, students should know the content and the main stages of the history of Russia, from ancient times to modern times.  This will allow students to better understand the characteristics of their native state.  Also, this subject stimulates the development of <span>analytical thinking, the</span> desire to expand their own erudition, the ability to conduct dialogue. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The course of domestic history has a huge educational impact.  It can show the role of an individual in the development of a whole society, the development of moral and <span>moral values ‚Äã‚Äãof a</span> person.  As you know, you cannot consider yourself a patriot if you do not know the history of your homeland. </p><p>  There is currently no single officially approved program by which this discipline can be studied either in schools or in institutions providing vocational education.  Therefore, each teacher chooses the authors closest to his point of view.  Students are most often recommended a reading list on various topics.  Usually this is the work of A. Sakharov, <span>V. Klyuchevsky</span> and other famous scientists who carefully studied Russian history. </p><p>  The result of studying the course at the school should be the free operation by students of the dates and names of figures who influenced the formation and development of the state.  It may seem that in other educational institutions (universities, vocational schools, etc.) this discipline is not needed, because the basics of it are already given.  However, according to federal state standards, this course is also taken when obtaining higher or professional education.  The purpose of this introduction is simple.  Students should not only consolidate the knowledge gained at school, but deepen and systematize it. </p><p>  Such training is aimed at helping students to master the skill of historical analysis, which should help him in his future profession.  In addition, young people must learn to penetrate the essence of phenomena and events.  This skill will come to the rescue even when a narrow branch of science is being studied, for example, the history of Russian journalism by future specialists in this field.  This contributes to the systematization of the material. </p>
