    <p>  Not so long ago, Rayong was an ordinary fishing village.  Tourism infrastructure here began to develop in the late 80s of the last century.  Cozy bungalows, trendy hotels, colorful restaurants and supermarkets grew like mushrooms. </p><p>  However, despite the developed tourism business, Rayong retained some pristine charm.  You will find here no less entertainment than in the noisy, sparkling neighbor Pattaya, but the aura of the resort town is completely different.  That is why it is chosen by those who long for a quiet rest, silence and peace.  Rayong is also suitable for traveling with children.  Noisy nightlife here is minimized, so chords of music from the nearest bars will not interfere with your sleep. </p><h2>  Motivation for relaxation: why go to Thailand? </h2><p>  You still doubt: is it worth going to Rayong (Thailand)?
