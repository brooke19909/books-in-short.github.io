Gradually, the area around it began to fill with settlements, in which Russian soldiers settled, who completed the service. </p><p>  In 1749, Empress Elizaveta Petrovna ordered the construction of customs at the mouth of the Temernik River.  At the same time, the construction of a trading port was started.  Customs became the base for the fortress, named after the decree of Empress Catherine II of Rostov in honor of Dmitry Rostovsky.  It is interesting that one of the first commandants of this fortress was the great commander A.V. Suvorov. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Rostov fortress and the new port very soon attracted attention and aroused great interest of foreign merchants.
