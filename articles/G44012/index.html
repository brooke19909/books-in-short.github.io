    <p>  Reviews of our compatriots about this hotel, I must say, for the most part are positive, even enthusiastic.  So, tourists were very pleased with the hotel and advise everyone to come here without hesitation.  However, we learn about everything in detail. </p><h2>  The hotel itself and its territory </h2><p>  Most of the tourists were satisfied with the rooms provided at the hotel.  So, according to them, the apartments here are quite spacious, if all that is needed for living.  In the bathrooms, recently made repairs and new plumbing are noticeable.  The furniture in the rooms is in good condition.  All equipment is working properly.  Cleaning is done every day.  Towels are changed every three days.  You can rent a safe.  But this option is paid and will cost two dollars per day.  A small minus was some tourists considered the Internet.  So, despite the fact that it is paid (ten dollars for one device for the entire period of residence), the quality of communication leaves much to be desired.  However, it catches Wi-Fi everywhere - in the room, in the restaurant, and on the beach. </p><p>  The hotel area is green, well-groomed.  There are a lot of nice places where you can take beautiful photos.  The hotel has three swimming pools.  On the terraces for sunbathing, there are plenty of sunbeds for everyone, even in the midst of the season.  There is also a bar where you can cool off with a drink or a snack during the day. </p><p>  Many praise the location of the hotel.  So, in the vicinity there are lots of shops, a market, a shopping center, a spa, clubs, bars and restaurants. </p><h2>  Food at the hotel </h2><p>  As for nutrition, this issue always causes a lot of controversy among the guests.  And this applies not only to Club Hotel Caretta Beach (Turkey, Alanya), but also for other hotels in various countries.  As for the hotel we are considering, then most of the guests were satisfied with the kitchen.  So, according to them, it is simply impossible to stay hungry here.  Those who want to eat can do this at almost any time of the day.  Indeed, in addition to the main restaurant, where a buffet is served three times a day, there are also snack bars by the pool and on the beach, where you can eat a burger, pizza, delicious flat cakes, french fries and other similar dishes.  Many did not even return for lunch from the beach, but ate there. </p>

    <p>  As for the main restaurant, there were always a choice of various dishes from meat, vegetables, soups.  In the morning, cereals, scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, fresh fruits and, of course, sweets for dessert are offered.  Most guests also had no complaints about the quality of the drinks available in the bars. </p><h2>  Personnel Opinion </h2><p>  About the staff of the Club Hotel Caretta Beach hotel reviews, our compatriots left mostly positive.  So, according to tourists, the staff is well aware of their work and copes with their duties.  In addition, employees are always friendly and helpful.  The hotel reception is open 24 hours a day.  Therefore, if something unexpected happens or some question arises, then you can always contact the duty administrator who will quickly solve the problem.

Many guests also note the efficient waiters in the restaurant.  The guests were also satisfied with the work of the maids, who cleaned the rooms perfectly, regardless of whether they were left with a tip.  A big plus is the fact that almost all the staff speak Russian or at least understand the language.  Therefore, you can explain here without any problems. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  Since the vast majority of tourists come to Turkey mainly to sunbathe and enjoy plenty of fun in the warm sea, the comments of people who have already visited this or that place regarding this issue play a very important role in choosing a hotel to stay.  As for Club Hotel Caretta Beach 4 * (Alanya), then most of the guests were satisfied with the beach belonging to the hotel.  So, according to them, it is quite spacious, with a large number of sunbeds.  At any time of the day you can find free sun loungers here.  Of course, those sunbeds that are located closer to the water, are most popular.  And if you want to occupy them, it makes sense to come to the beach early in the morning.  If this is not critical for you, then you can easily find free sunbeds a little further from the sea at any time.  There is a bar on the beach.  Here you can also have a snack during the day.  Experienced travelers note that the Club Hotel Caretta Beach 4 * hotel (Turkey, Alanya) does not provide guests with beach towels.  Therefore, it makes sense to bring them with you from home or buy directly on the spot. </p><p>  As for entering the water, there is small pebbles.  However, there is no need for special shoes, because in just a few steps you find yourself in the depths.  So long walk on the pebbles is not necessary.  The water here is very clean and warm. </p><h2>  Comments on hotel activities </h2><p>  A lot of our compatriots warmly remember the animators of Club Hotel Caretta Beach 4 *.  So, tourists note their professionalism and tirelessness.  The hotel's entertainment program begins immediately after breakfast.

After that you can visit a disco or karaoke.  Also in the evening there is a disco on the beach.  In a word, according to our compatriots, you will not be bored here.  Have a nice rest! </p>
