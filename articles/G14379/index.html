Step-by-step description, requirements and feedback</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If a person ceases to use the services of a bank, this does not mean at all that he does not owe anything to this financial structure.  The organization can send messages, use personal data or make calls until the person completes the relationship with him according to the rules.  The algorithm of actions is presented below.  So, we will get acquainted with a phased strategy that describes how to close a bank account. </p><h2>  Requirements and walkthrough </h2><p>  Customers need a bank account in order to be able to store and transfer funds.  But often there is a need to close such an instrument.  What should be done for this?  First of all, you need to make sure that the person owes nothing to the bank, and that, accordingly, - to his client.  After this, it is required to notify the institution of the desire to terminate the contract for the provision of services with it and to receive written written confirmation.  You will also need to make sure that the institution destroys all personal data. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fixingfinances.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to close a bank account" class="if uuid-3082274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3082274.jpg"></div><p>  How to close a bank account is interesting to many. </p><h2>  Step One: Bank Visit </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to take into account the fact that closing an account requires the personal presence of a citizen in a bank.  Remotely implement this will be almost impossible.  And just one visit, most likely, does not get off.  Therefore, you need to choose a convenient time and office, take a passport along with plastic cards associated with the account, and go to the institution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If possible, contact the branch in which the account was opened.  The period of the smallest queues can be found directly in the department, or in the call center.  A possible catch in this situation, as a rule, is the following: most institutions allow you to close accounts in any department, but in order not to waste time, it is better to call support and clarify this point. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bbva.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to close a bank account un" class="if uuid-3082289" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3082289.jpg"></div><p>  How to close a bank account, it is important to find out in advance. </p><h2>  Zero balance </h2><p>  In the event that a person has funds left on his account, they can be transferred to some other in the Internet bank or withdraw money from an ATM.  In any situation, the client will be sent directly to the cashier for the remainder in the bank.  But if you prepare properly, you can save a lot of time. </p><p>  How to close a bank account, you can check with the employee. </p><h2>  Step Three: Writing a Statement </h2><p>  At the bank, the client will be required to write an application to close the account.  This procedure, as a rule, does not occur instantly.  In the event that a card was attached to it, the period can reach up to 60 days.  Not very likely, but still possible pitfall is the following: in the event that an operation occurs on the account during this time, a person will have to repeat steps one through three. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.gobankingrates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to quickly close a bank account" class="if uuid-3082279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3082279.jpg"></div><h2>  The fourth step and receiving confirmation </h2><p>  Do not be lazy to go for official evidence that the bank closes settlement accounts, and the financial structure has no complaints.  Some employees may raise their eyebrows in surprise, but still write the paper.  She will certainly protect the client in case of possible disputes in the future.  Do not be lazy or hesitate to ask the bank for any written confirmation, even if the employee claims that the citizen is the first to need it. </p><h2>  Step Five and Caring for the Destruction of Personal Information </h2><p>  Most likely, the client, as part of the conclusion of the contract, gave the bank the right to systematize, and in addition, to use and transfer personal data.  In the event that you do not submit an application for the withdrawal of this permission, even after the payment instrument is closed according to all the rules (steps one through four), the structure can inform the client about new products via SMS and calls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gobankingrates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to close a bank account" class="if uuid-3082284" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3082284.jpg"></div><p>  From now on, a citizen will have to ban the bank from using personal data.  A sample application for recalling personal information can be easily found on the Web.  You will need to print three copies: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  The first of them must be sent to the legal address of the bank, a copy of the passport and (if any) agreement with the financial institution must be attached. </li><li>  The second is given to the department in which the agreement was concluded. </li><li>  And the third remains with all the seals and signatures of the client. </li></ol><p>  In the event that a person owes nothing to the bank, the organization should no longer call him and write messages.  At this step, the citizen completely completes the relationship with the organization on a specific account. </p><h2>  How to close an account at Tinkoff Bank? </h2><p>  For this, first of all, it is necessary to pay all debts.  You can clarify the information on the debt with the operator or the Internet bank is also suitable (you should also focus on the latest discharge from the institution).  When a person goes to zero, this does not mean that he paid in full, since the organization can charge extra interest for using the service (for example, it may turn out to be a fee for SMS informing in the current period). </p><p>  A month before the proposed closure, it is required to notify the financial institution of its intention to do this (that is, terminate the agreement).  This can be done by writing to the bank (the application form should be clarified on the official website on the Internet), but it is better to do this by calling the 24-hour line.  So it will be much easier and also much faster.  In the event that a person changes his mind, within thirty days he has time to withdraw his oral or written statement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="66.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="open a closed bank account" class="if uuid-3082292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3082292.jpg"></div><p>  The third step is optional.  The client returns the card to the bank tied to the account, but usually this is not required, since after closing it automatically becomes useless plastic.  Nevertheless, after a person closes an account, for several months you should not throw it out or break it, let it lie on some distant shelf.  And in the event that at the end of this period there will be no surprises from the banking organization, it is worth cutting the card into several parts.  Among other things, in the end you need to make sure that the account has been closed.  This can be done by phone or online. </p><p>  Not everyone knows how to close an account with an IP bank. </p><h2>  IP account closure </h2><p>  In the event that the contract is terminated at the request of the client, it is necessary to inform the bank manager, who will provide a standard form for closing.  When the account is closed at the initiative of the bank, a notice regarding this will be sent to the entrepreneur in advance.  Officially, no other documents will be required, it will only be necessary to hand over the checkbook if one was issued, and in addition, the roots for it. </p><p>  On termination of the agreement, the bank shall make an entry in the book of registration of accounts.  From that moment on, expenditure and receipt operations cease, and the balance of funds is issued to the client within one week.  In the event that within sixty days the owner is not to receive money, and the organization has no instructions on transferring finance to any other details, they are sent to a special account of the Central Bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smartasset.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="banks close current accounts" class="if uuid-3082280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3082280.jpg"></div><p>  Starting from 2014, the legislation does not oblige customers to notify tax and funds about the procedure for closing a current account, since a message about this is sent by the bank itself.  But if anyone needs to be notified on their own, these are business partners so that they do not pay unknowingly for an inactive account. </p><h2>  How to open a closed bank account? </h2><p>  To do this, you need to come to any department with documents.  As a rule, a passport is required, and in addition, a TIN, if any.  You must write a statement and conclude a new contract with the financial structure. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  According to customer stories, as part of the closure of the bank account, it is necessary to make sure, first of all, that the person owes nothing to the bank.  After that, it is necessary to notify the financial institution of the desire to terminate the agreement on the provision of services with it and receive written confirmation.  Reportedly, such a procedure usually proceeds rather quickly. </p><p>  In particular, people in the comments advise making sure that the bank destroys all personal data, otherwise annoying messages will continue to arrive in an endless stream to the former client. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aol.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to close an account in tinkoff bank" class="if uuid-3082286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3082286.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, in order to obtain a closed bank account as a result, you must submit an application regarding the termination of the relevant contract.  Within one week after receiving this document, the financial institution gives the client the cash balance in cash (or can transfer it through a payment order). </p><p>  There are situations in which the bank terminates the account agreement on its own initiative.  For example, if within two years there is no money on the client‚Äôs payment instrument and he does not carry out any operations.  In such a situation, the institution has the right to refuse to fulfill the contract.  In such cases, the person from the bank receives a notification and two months after the warning, the agreement is considered terminated (provided that no funds were received to the account during this period). </p><p>  We examined how to quickly close a bank account.  We hope the information provided will be helpful. </p>
