    <h2>  Zeus Turunc Hotel 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  I must say that most Russians liked this hotel.  In their reviews, they note its good location: around the mountain, clean air and many trees.  In addition, the proximity of the beach for many tourists also became an advantage when choosing a hotel.  Turunch is a great place where you can relax calmly and measuredly.  In search of thrills and vibrant nightlife, tourists should go to Marmaris. </p><p>  As for nutrition, most Russians liked it.  There is a lot of food, buffet trays are constantly replenished, so even the most recent customers will get everything that was on them at the time of opening.  The dishes are varied and delicious.  Tourists especially liked the desserts and fish, which the chef incredibly skillfully prepared. </p><p>  The number of rooms also did not cause any particular complaints.  There were, however, those who were unlucky, and they had problems with plumbing.  However, the staff very quickly eliminated all the problems. </p><p>  Some tourists were unhappy that the hotel had a small area, as well as the fact that the workers did not understand Russian. </p><p>  Nevertheless, most Russians were satisfied with the hotel and, if possible, would come here again. </p>
