More precisely, the hotel does not have its own beach, but there is a public beach nearby.  You can always go for it, but at the same time you need to be prepared for a large crowd of people, including locals.  There are no umbrellas and sunbeds on the beach.  But this problem can be solved, since there are beaches of other hotels nearby on the coast.  Among them there are paid and free, in principle, you can choose an acceptable option. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  They say a lot about holidays in Lavender Hotel Sharjah 4 * reviews of tourists.  It always starts from the sea, which causes a lot of positive emotions.  It is always very warm, some even emphasize that it is too warm.  This is not surprising.  In the hot season, under the scorching rays of the sun, it simply can not be otherwise.  Therefore, in the Emirates it is good to relax with young children, for whom the water temperature is the most important indicator.  And not all adults love swimming in cool water.  So, everyone who loves the warm sea and the beach should definitely visit the UAE. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lavender hotel sharjah 4 pics" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1418629.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has a very good principle of daily replacement of beach towels.  In many complexes, problems arise with this.  Lavender Hotel Sharijah 4 * (Sharjah) takes care of its guests and offers them daily clean white towels, which is very important, because during the day they get dirty on the beach. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Hotel Lavender Hotel Sharjah 4 * has its own tour desk on its territory.  This is very convenient, since vacationers can book trips without leaving the complex.  UAE is a very interesting country.  It has something to see.  Tourists really like the following tours: safari, Abu Dhabi, modern Dubai.  And this is not the whole list of those trips that are offered to vacationers.  There are also sea night and day excursions, but their reviews are a bit conflicting.  Not everyone likes them. </p><p>  In addition to travel, vacationers can use the services of the fitness center, visit the sauna or enjoy a massage.  Darts and table tennis are available on site. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lavender hotel sharjah 4 reviews" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1418643.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel is in a good location, it is very easy to get to the center from it, which allows tourists to see Dubai on their own, you can walk on it endlessly.  The only thing that can interfere is the intense heat.  Sometimes vacationers move in small dashes between different malls, since it is much easier to bear the heat of the day (air conditioners work).  The White Mosque in Abu Dhabi deserves special attention, it is worth a visit.  The nearest attractions can be seen independently, reaching them by public transport. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  The hotel has a service such as delivery twice a day to one of the malls.  If you want to go to another place, then you can use the buses, metro.  Taxi is also a good option if you are planning on shopping in the mall.  For a group of four to five people, the car will cost less than public transport.  The metro in the UAE is something special for us.  It is worth using its services to see what it is. </p><p>  As for shopping, tourists are not advised to rely on the acquisition of cheap goods.  As a rule, prices in malls are higher than Moscow.  Of more interest is the infrastructure of entertainment centers.  But be prepared to pay for everything. </p><p>  The indigenous people look quite belligerent, but in fact, they are very educated and courteous people.  Many know English.  Walking around the city, you can not meet locals so often.  Most of those around are those who come to the Emirates to work: Thais, Pakistanis, Indians. </p><h2>  Lavender Hotel Sharjah 4 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  If this is your first time planning a vacation in the UAE, then first of all, pay attention to what time your vacation falls on.  Do not forget that it is very hot in the Emirates.  But this has its advantages.  Where else can you find such a warm sea?  If this does not scare you, then feel free to choose a place to live.  Lavender <span>Hotel Sharjah 4 * (Sharjah)</span> can be included in the list of hotels you are considering. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel lavender hotel sharjah 4" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1418644.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The complex boldly justifies the price-quality ratio.  For a reasonable price you can relax at sea with the whole family and get a lot of pleasure.  It is unlikely that you will be able to find a more budget option with the existing characteristics of the complex. </p><p>  Lavender Hotel Sharjah 4 * (ex. Lords Hotel) has a good location, being in the famous resort area.  From it it is absolutely easy to get to Dubai, it is convenient if you want to see the metropolis and its attractions.  According to tourists, the hotel bus does not always take guests to the city.  Therefore, sometimes you have to rely on your strength. </p><p>  Sharjah is a small town where you can walk on foot without using transport.  You can stroll along the promenade, admire palm trees, bougainvilleas and flowering acacias, wander around shopping centers and look into the oceanarium. </p><p>  The hotel is on the first line, however, to get to the beach, you must cross the road.  A serious drawback of the hotel is the lack of its own place on the coast.  The free public beach site is too overloaded with people, and entry to the territory of other complexes has to be paid.  On the shore there are a lot of hermit crabs and crabs.  The sea is very pleasing to all vacationers, it is clean and incredibly warm.  Sometimes you don‚Äôt even feel that you are entering the water. </p><p>  According to tourists, the food in the hotel is very good, varied.  All dishes are delicious, food is enough even if you order a buffet.  If during the day you plan a trip on an excursion, then you will always be offered a replacement lunch.  Near the complex there is a grocery supermarket, but, in principle, it is not really needed.  Unless you can buy shrimp there and cook them on the grill in the evening.  Keep in mind that the hotel does not have alcohol at all, if you want a drink, then look for yourself where to get it, as a rule, this can be done in duty free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="UAE lavender hotel sharjah 4" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1418646.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tourists note that the hotel is quite new and clean.  Daily cleaning is of high quality, frequent replacement of towels is pleasing, which you will not find in other hotels.  The windows in some rooms are somehow high and have no view.  Unfortunately, the apartments have no balconies.  This is a significant drawback, things after the beach there is simply nowhere to dry.  The hotel area itself is small and not fenced.  Nearby is the wasteland of a neighboring complex. </p><h2>  Hotel transfer </h2><p>  In the evenings in Sharjah (after dinner) there is absolutely no entertainment.  At this time, everything seems to freeze.  Therefore, it is better to pre-record the hotel bus schedule and go <span>sightseeing in Dubai,</span> otherwise you will have to watch TV (only one Russian channel works).  Mini-buses leave the complex at 16:00 and return to 22:00.  There are still flights to the central part of Sharjah (10:00, 13:00, 20:00).  In the first half of the day, leaving is not a problem, but in the afternoon there are already many who want to.  The driver takes passengers by the number of seats and nothing more.  Therefore, you can simply not get on the bus. </p><h2>  Interesting veils and tourist tips </h2><p>  In the UAE, there are a lot of bans that are incomprehensible to us.  For example, you can‚Äôt walk in T-shirts, swim in swimsuits, and much more ... But at the same time, the police do not react to such violations.  Crowds of tourists do not adhere to these standards.  In Sharjah, it still makes sense not to expose too much; local women are too squinting at the bare shoulders of tourists.  And in Dubai, everything is much simpler.  Nobody pays any attention to anyone. </p><p>  It is better to buy goods in large shopping centers or in shops with fixed prices, since in small shops you strive to deceive you.  A product can have a price tag with one value, and at the checkout you can voice twice as much.  Traders go to a variety of tricks and tricks to earn money on vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lavender hotel sharjah 4 sharjah" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1418648.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In general, you should not rely on cheap shopping, there are simply no low prices.  There are separate shopping centers where goods are cheaper.  You should definitely visit the Dubai Mall, where you can see the singing fountain. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Lavender Hotel Sharjah 4 * - a great place for those who want to spend a vacation on the sea.  The sun, sand, wonderful clear water on the coast will not leave anyone indifferent.  And the price of the tour will certainly surprise you.  The complex is really good in terms of price-quality ratio.  AOE is a country worth looking at. </p>
