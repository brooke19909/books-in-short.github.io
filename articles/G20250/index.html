So it is called by locals and those who had to see this pond with their own eyes.  It attracts with its bewitching nature and blue waters.  But the lake is not only suitable for being admired.  People come here who want to relax and bathe in the summer heat, as well as many fishermen. </p><h2>  Description of the lake </h2><p>  Beauty Lake really lives up to its name.  The pleasant greenish <span>color of the water is in</span> harmony with the golden gently sloping beaches, which continue through the sunlit meadows.  These shores gradually go into the distance and grow into picturesque steep slopes that hold majestic pine trunks at their very edges.  But gradually these fragrant trees are diluted with delicate birch trees and fluffy fir trees.  A dense forest line stretches to Zelenogorsk highway, and on the east side the road runs very close to the coast. </p>

    <p>  Beauty Lake is 2.5 km long and has a width of slightly more than 1 km.  The lake is considered deep-sea, in the deepest place reaches 19 meters.  With such characteristics, this place is suitable for relaxation and recreation. </p><h2>  Rest on the lake </h2><p>  Beauty Lake <span>(Leningrad Region)</span> in the summer months hurries to receive as many people as possible.  Equipped beaches are not here, but the sandy beaches have a good rest.  There are many <span>flat beaches</span> 3-4 meters wide, so they can comfortably accommodate a large company.  Also, the entrance to the water is quite convenient.  In summer, the upper layers warm up to 23 degrees, but cold currents are felt a little deeper, since there are underwater springs in the lake.  But some swimmers even like this contrast.  Also, the transparency of water is 1-3 meters.  There is no garbage on the water surface, so I want to come back here from year to year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  But still, some vacationers do not want to clean up after themselves the ashes and garbage.  Therefore, if you are going on vacation, try not to forget to leave the place clean, because there are no workers who monitor the state of the beach and nature. </p><p>  The next attraction is a walk through the woods.  Here you can not only admire, breathe the air, but also search for mushrooms.  Returning home after rest, everyone feels a surge of energy and strength received by him from the local nature. </p><p>  You can stay overnight in the neighboring village of Ilyichev.  There are good shops there.  In addition, along the coast there are newly built summer cottages that can be rented for several days. </p><h2>  Pond fishing </h2><p>  If you prefer to relax with a fishing rod in your hands, try to go for this to Lake Beauty.  Fishing in this pond is often successful.  Roach, bream, pike, perch live in the waters of the lake, and some manage to catch zander.  A good bite begins at the end of spring, as life under water becomes active.  A good catch is obtained from the boat, but on the shore, many are satisfied with their prey.  Also come here for fishing in the winter.  Although during this period, the fish is less active. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Some fishermen are lucky, and they return home with large predators.  But it is worth noting that such a catch here is very rare.  But the average fish is going well. </p><h2>  Lake name </h2><p>  Hearing that there is such a charming place, many decide to go on vacation or fishing on Lake Beauty.  The map of the Leningrad Region does not actually contain such a name, so some are lost, not knowing where to look for a reservoir.  But the secret lies in the fact that the lake is so named only among the people, and in the documentation it is recorded under the name <span>Big Simaginskoe Lake.</span>  But this pond received this name only after the Great Patriotic War, since it is believed that Sergeant N. Simagin died near the village </p><h2>  The disadvantages of the lake </h2><p>  Despite its attractiveness, Lake Beauty has recently changed a bit due to the huge and uncontrolled influx of tourists.  Many leave garbage, do not clean the place from the fire.  All this spoils some impression. </p><p>  Another disadvantage that spoils the whole landscape is the cottages.  Private construction unfolded along the coast, so the primeval northern nature is gradually turning into a territory equipped with people. </p>

    <p>  Also, part of the beach was fenced off from the village of Ilyichev.  In this place the base is made.  If you want to relax on the beach, you need to rent a room or order lunch in a restaurant in the base.  People who used to come to these places for unity with nature, see how quickly Lake Beauty turned into a resort area. </p><h2>  Possible danger </h2><p>  Local residents say that the lake is insidious, and it is dangerous to swim far from the coast.  The fact is that the bottom is covered with pits and underwater cliffs.  And cold streams can play a cruel joke, therefore, before sailing a little further from the shore, it is important to think carefully, because there is a risk of drowning. </p>
