    <p>  Society and its structure are one of the central problems in sociology.  Some textbooks even define it as a subject of science.  Any society is not a monolith, not something homogeneous.  It consists of the most diverse layers and groups (national, social, and so on) that are closely connected with economic, political, social and spiritual relations.  And they can manifest themselves only within the framework of these interactions.  This determines the functioning of society as a single organism, its integrity.  The essence of this issue is disclosed in the works of G. Spencer, M. Weber, K. Marx and other famous sociologists. </p><p>  Thus, the <span>concept of society</span> and its structure includes a complex of relations and relations existing between communities and social groups of people.  And they interact constantly about their living conditions (economic, spiritual, political and social). </p><p>  Society and its structure are developing on the basis of the division of labor and the division of ownership of the products of production and its means. </p><p>  So, the appearance of professional groups, classes, groups consisting of rural and urban residents, people of physical labor and mental work is due to its division. </p><p>  The existing fragmentation within society is further strengthened by the division of ownership into means and products of production.  Both factors represent objective economic and social prerequisites for the development of the <span>structure of society.</span>  At one time, E. Durkheim, P. Sorokin and other scientists pointed to their role. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Society and its structure consists of several elements.  The main ones include the following: </p><p>  1) Classes.  In the system of division of labor, division of means and products of production, they occupy different positions. </p><p>  2) Village and city dwellers. </p><p>  3) People engaged in physical and <span>intellectual labor.</span> </p><p>  4) <span>Demographic groups</span> (old people and youth, women and men). </p><p>  5) Estates. </p><p>  6) Groups united by nation, ethnicity, nationality. </p><p>  Almost all of the indicated elements are heterogeneous in composition and are still divided into groups and layers, characterized only by their inherent interests, the implementation of which takes place in relations with other entities. </p><p>  Society and its structure seem so complex that it attracts the attention of not only sociologists, but also government officials and politicians.  The fact is that without knowledge of the clear structure of <span>society, social</span> groups, its components, their interests and possible areas of their activity, it is impossible to lead either the society as a whole or any of its areas (spiritual, economic, social or political). </p><p>  The problem of social structure is directly related to <span>civil society</span> and its structure.  It is an interaction between objectively emerging social groups and those groups and organizations that are artificially created by people for the best realization of spiritual, political, economic and social interests.  The task of the state is to contribute to the development and improvement of civil society on the economic basis that all formations have. </p><p>  Each person in him should be able to creatively, freely express himself, bring benefits to people, and satisfy his needs.  Laws and <span>law enforcement agencies</span> should comprehensively protect a citizen in the exercise of his rights.  But each person also should not forget to fulfill his duties both to close people and to society as a whole.  Only in this case two problems can be solved at once: creation, as well as significant optimization of the functioning of the rule of law and the improvement of civil society. </p>
