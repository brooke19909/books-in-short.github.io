After all, it was to him that the children with such enthusiasm write letters asking them to fulfill their most cherished dreams and present such coveted toys.  And of course, such a long-awaited and welcome guest must have an appropriate outfit.  So, in this article we will talk about how to make one of the most important accessories for this character, namely the real staff of Santa Claus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="staff of santa claus" class="if" height="494" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/582520.jpg" width="547"></div>

    <h2>  Image in detail </h2><p>  Well, what else makes this magical <span>New Year's hero,</span> fulfilling all his wishes, so fabulous and unbelievably bewitching?  Probably, everyone will agree that Santa Claus is a character with a thick white beard, in a chic velvet coat with white fur inserts and, of course, with this mysterious staff, which, as you know, can freeze anyone. </p><h2>  How to make a staff of Santa Claus? </h2><p>  This accessory can be created with your own hands, and for this you do not need any expensive materials.

You will also need decorative elements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself santa claus staff" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/582519.jpg" width="600"></div>

Such an accessory is good in that it is very light, which is quite important, because you will not only have to carry it with you, but also dance with it, and even raise it above your head during competitions. </p><p>  So, based on the age of the actor, who will have to play such an important role, they glue a certain number of bottles, after cutting the neck off each of them.  About 15-18 pieces will be needed, and you also need a large skein of wide adhesive tape.  The result should be a long plastic stick that will need to be decorated. </p><h2>  Shovel handle as a base for a staff </h2><p>  How to make a Santa Claus staff from a handle from an old shovel or a mop handle?  To slightly increase the product in diameter, its base can be wrapped with synthetic winterizer or pasted with foam rubber.  After all the manipulations, it will be possible to proceed to the decorative design. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a staff of santa claus" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/582518.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <h2>  How to make a staff? </h2><p>  Even the child knows about what color the staff of Santa Claus should be (with his own hands it will be made or not).  Naturally silver!  And to give it such a specific icy look, the frame can be wrapped with ordinary foil for baking or covered with paint from a spray can. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The staff of Santa Claus (whose photo can be seen in this article) will be fake if it is not covered with snow.  For this purpose, small foam balls or beads are ideal, which should be glued using a hot glue gun.  Snowy powderiness can be done like this: in several places, smear the staff with PVA glue and cover it with polystyrene foam.  Using this method, it is very important to withstand the product for some time to allow the composition to dry well. </p><h2>  Plastic bottle ice caps </h2><p>  The original tip for the staff can be made from a regular plastic bottle.  For this purpose, a slightly bluish plastic is just perfect.  In order to create an ice composition, a figure in the form of a snowflake with a long leg is cut out of one bottle, and the other is cut so that a whole neck remains, from which several stripes of plastic hang down at the edges.  Both blanks are joined with glue.  Next, you will have to work a little with fire and melt the edges of the entire structure.  The edges of the parts must be melted so that they do not change color, but are somewhat cringed from exposure to heat.  Such a composition will initially look at the top of the staff, creating the illusion of icing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="staff of santa claus photo" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/582525.jpg" width="517"></div>

Yes, very easy!  It is worth noting that for this purpose it is better to pick up rain with a wire base, so that it can be easily fixed not on the staff frame.  Tinsel is fixed at the very bottom, tied in a loop, and the staff is wrapped in a spiral to the very top.  Moreover, the rain for such decoration can be taken in absolutely any color, but, of course, you need to take into account the color of Santa Claus's fur coat. </p><h2>  How to make a tip for a staff? </h2><p>  In order for the staff to come out complete, a tip must be attached to its top.  It can be a huge sparkling snowflake, icicle or a huge shiny star.  This element is not difficult to make on your own, but you can just pick up a suitable Christmas toy and attach it to the top of the staff.  But you can make a little effort and build an original tip with backlight. </p><h2>  How to make a highlight? </h2><p>  The glowing staff is a very original idea that will give the image a special magic.  Such a detail will definitely not be left without attention.  So, to make the backlight, you need to pick the right tip for the staff.  Very unusual at the end of the staff will be the so-called snow globe, in which bulbs are already built-in, operating from the simplest batteries and turning on with a light touch of a button located somewhere on the side of the base. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Santa Claus staff with light" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/582529.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  Another option is a large transparent Christmas ball, into which it is easy to place LED bulbs from an ordinary children's toy.  In the place of attachment of such a tip, it is quite easy to hide a box with batteries and contacts in tinsel, but it is advisable to lower the switch to hand level so that Santa Claus can turn the backlight on and off for children.  Using this idea, the program can be supplemented with magical contests from the main character at the matinee.  The kids will definitely like this part of the program, as well as the well-known chant ‚ÄúOne, two, three, Christmas tree - burn!‚Äù </p><h2>  Fantasy is a great generator of ideas </h2><p>  It just so happened that the staff must be twisted in a spiral.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what - with a ribbon, rain or small white snowflakes glued to each other.  But it is precisely this pattern that is associated not only with this bewitching wand, but also with garlands hung on a Christmas tree.  How to make an original staff?  Just in its decoration should use unusual elements.  Children will love the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa luminous or ringing staff.  Bells tied to the edges of the tapes and attached to the base at the point of attachment of the tip is simply a great option.  And how to make a staff of Santa Claus with light, has already been described above. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="collar of Santa Claus" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/582522.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What about a folding staff? </h2><p>  Quite often, actors earn extra money by visiting children at home, and running around the city with a long stick in hand is not very convenient, especially if you have to travel by taxi.  This problem can be solved, because you can make a staff of Santa Claus collapsible design.  This accessory is easy to store directly with a fur coat, hat and bag, because, unlike a solid stick, this option will not take up much space.  How to make the staff of Santa Claus collapsible? </p><p>  To create such an accessory, you will need to connect all your imagination.  To make the frame, you will need plastic pipes, threaded <span>couplings</span> and, of course, a soldering iron to assemble all the parts together.  This is the easiest way you can think of.  A staff can be divided into three or four parts, depending on how tall it is.  So, the pipe is cut or trimmed to the required size and soldered to them elements that allow you to twist one into the other.  This is done with all the elements of the staff, which will need to be interconnected. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a staff" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/582524.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to decorate a folding staff? </h2><p>  When decorating such a staff, it is better not to use a spiral pattern, because if a strip of ribbon or tinsel of contrasting color that wraps around it does not coincide with the junction, it will not look completely harmonious.  An excellent decoration for such a staff is snowflakes glued to the base in a chaotic manner, but the top can be decorated as you like.  The details of such a staff can be wrapped with synthetic winterizer or foam rubber, or you can leave everything as is, just painting the frame with spray paint.  The joints of all elements can be masked with Christmas tinsel. </p>
