Now there is no need to waste time deciding which service to call.  It is enough to know how to make an emergency call.  112 can be dialed absolutely from any phone and talk about the reason for the appeal.  The operator will determine exactly which rescue unit should come to you. </p><h2>  Union </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe need to introduce a single number for all rescue services in Russia appeared in 2010.  In December, the president signed a decree according to which one contact telephone number should be recognized, which can be used in case of any emergency.  It was assumed that the transition to the new number will be gradual, for several years all the usual contacts of the ambulance, police, fire and other services will function along with a single number.  Such joint work is planned until 2017, after which only emergency call 112 will function. </p>

At this time, Putin signed a decree according to which the creation of one call system for any emergency service was to begin.  The number by which only emergency calls will be received was determined in March 2013.

But this number became publicly available from August 12, 2013.  Prior to this date, the indicated number worked in pilot mode in certain subjects of the Federation.  It was available in the Astrakhan and Kursk regions, in Tatarstan and other regions. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the emergency call until 2017 is also available at the usual numbers: 01 for the fire department, 02 for the police, 03 for the ambulance arrival, 04 for calling the gas workers.  True, in this format, these numbers will be valid, most likely, only until the end of 2014.  At present, it‚Äôs better to get used to the new format of their input: first you need to put the number 1. Those are, in order to call an ambulance from your phone, it‚Äôs better to dial 103. </p><h2>  Job prospects </h2>

    <h2>  Service fee </h2><p>  Any calls to the emergency number are free of charge.  You can dial 112 both from a regular <span>landline phone</span> and from a mobile.  It does not matter where you are located - in the center of a metropolis or in a distant village.  You can call the specified number from anywhere.  Separately, it is worth noting that an emergency call is made absolutely free.  You can dial <span>112 from your</span> mobile, even if you do not have money in your account.  Also, calls will be available if your mobile device does not have a SIM card or if it is blocked for some reason.  The only obstacle to a call from a mobile phone will be the complete discharge of the battery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Separately, it is worth noting that it does not matter what kind of carrier you use.  Of course, each of them provides its own numbers for calling emergency services, but sometimes not everyone can remember them.  It is much easier to learn one emergency number, which can be used in any emergency. </p><h2>  <span>Information Processing</span> and Response Speed </h2>

Considering that considerable funds were spent on introducing a single number, it was important to understand how well this system works, whether it has advantages over standard, familiar to all numbers.

    <p>  As practice has shown, the response time when using the number 112 was reduced by almost 20%.  That is, each specific person receives help faster.  And if we are talking about emergency situations, when a person cannot decide where to call first, then the efficiency increases even more.  For example, after witnessing a crime in which the victim was seriously injured, the person must decide what is more important - an emergency call of the police or ambulance?  On the one hand, the victim needs to provide medical care as soon as possible, but on the other, during this time the offender will have time to escape.  It is much easier to dial one number - 112. </p><h2>  Benefits for citizens </h2>

First of all, it is worth noting that in a critical situation, many could confuse the numbers of the police, ambulance or fire, it is much easier to remember a single number, by which an emergency call is made in any critical situation.  The phone is one for the whole country - 112.

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The advantages of introducing one number also include fixing all calls in one system, so no call will be left unattended.  Experts who can provide psychological support or tell how to behave in the situation that has arisen can also be connected to the conversation. </p><h2>  State benefit </h2><p>  By creating a single number by which an emergency call can be made at any time, the state, of course, cares about its citizens.  But do not forget that the country itself receives certain benefits from this.  A person does not call several numbers, thereby increasing the load on specialized dispatch networks, he contacts all emergency services with one number.  In addition, the introduction of number 112 made it possible to automate a number of processes.  For example, when receiving a call, the operator automatically fills in a card that immediately displays the phone number (and information about its owner).  This significantly reduces the time of making a call, which means it speeds up the response. </p>

The actions that were carried out should be recorded in it.  This helps to control the entire process of helping those in need.

    <p>  Also, an analysis of all calls received to a single number allows you to assess the security situation and the level of health of the population in the region.  The use of a single dispatching base also favors the normal interaction of all related emergency services. </p><p>  Do not forget that in order to create the number it was required to develop a new technical base, make non-standard decisions to maximize the process of its implementation.  And this, in turn, affects the innovative development of the state. </p><h2>  Western counterparts </h2><p>  It is worth noting that Russia did not become an innovator by introducing a single number by which emergency calls are made.  Such a system is practiced in many countries.  For the first time, one emergency number was introduced in the UK back in 1937.  From that moment, it was possible to get through to the police, fire service or doctors by dialing 999. </p>

At first, the service worked only in large cities, but in the 80s it already covered the entire territory of the country.  In New Zealand, a single contact telephone number was introduced back in 1958.  The government decided that it would be most convenient to dial 111 in an emergency.

It is worth noting that they began to use this number throughout the country only by the end of the 80s. </p>
