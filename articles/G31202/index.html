We are talking about DVRs that allow real-time recording of everything that happens on video and subsequently using these recordings as evidence.  The higher the quality of such a video, the more likely it is to discern small details that may seem key.  This article is dedicated to the registrar under the name "3600 FHD G Video Witness", reviews of which will serve as the basis for concluding its quality.  It was thanks to the high-quality picture that he became the hero of today's review, despite the fact that he is a rather old model.  But first things first. </p><h2>  Why registrars are often ignored </h2><p>  As one proverb says, many simply do not take any safety measures until they get into an unpleasant situation.  In this case, it is often too late to change something. </p><p>  Registrars are simple devices that are rarely advertised, and are produced by not-so-well-known companies.  However, this does not make the benefit of their use less.  It is worth considering the fact that every day on the roads there are not only inept drivers provoking traffic accidents, but also various people who are trying to ‚Äúknock out‚Äù a certain amount of money out of you with fraudulent actions.  It is in such cases that the registrar is indispensable, since it allows you to prove innocence, despite the numerous "witness" testimonies, adjusted in advance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Video Witness DVR can be especially useful in resolving disputes related to getting one of the officials or police officers into the accident of your car and the car.  One way or another, the videos will help to clearly show who was wrong, even if it comes to trial.  That is why the installation of such a device should be considered now if you are the owner or driver of a car. </p>

    <h2>  How to make the right choice </h2><p>  Not so much is required from such a simple device.  Its main task is to fix everything that happens on the road.  The higher the video quality, the better for the driver.  It is worth checking right away how the DVR behaves at night, whether the numbers of passing cars are visible, or whether it is possible to make out even if they belong to a particular make and model. </p><p>  The additional data transmitted by the GPS module can also help resolve contentious issues.  So, thanks to this sensor, your current speed can be displayed on the video.  This will help to prove that you clearly followed the rules of the road at the time of the emergency.  A GPS recorder also records your route completely, which can be useful for your own purposes, for example, to track the movements of a company car. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An interesting fact is the feature of this kind of gadgets.  If any other technical innovations almost always should attract attention with their appearance and be evident at first glance, then the registrar in this matter is the exact opposite.  Why?  The whole secret is that it should perform its function without undue interference from the user.  This means that the recording itself starts at the beginning of the movement, and the driver is not distracted by its start or stop.  A good car DVR is one that was set up once during installation, and then just performs its function, and you do not need to monitor it. </p><p>  Another feature that echoes the previous one is compactness and invisibility.  The smaller the device will take up space on the windshield, the better the view for the driver will be, and he will not have to constantly look for a comfortable position to watch the road, bypassing the weighty mount. </p><p>  All these features are inherent in the model under consideration.  Let's take a closer look at its technical specifications, as well as pay attention to the factory equipment and operating recommendations.  A review on the 3600 FHD G Video Witness will help you decide whether to buy such an ‚Äúassistant‚Äù in your car. </p>

    <h2>  Factory equipment </h2><p>  Perhaps it is always nice to receive gifts.  In the case of this DVR, the manufacturer made sure that the most complete set served as a pretty pleasant surprise.  So, inside the box after purchase you can find: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  the <em>DVR</em> itself; </li><li>  <em>a power adapter of the</em> required power plugged into the <em>cigarette lighter socket</em> ; </li><li>  <em>USB</em> <em>cable</em> , which can be used to transfer data without removing the memory card, as well as updating the firmware of the device; </li><li>  <em>a power adapter</em> that can be connected to a regular <em>220V</em> home outlet; </li><li>  <em>AV cable</em> (the so-called "tulips" for connecting to a TV using analog image transmission); </li><li>  <em>mini-HDMI-HDMI cable</em> (for connecting to modern monitors equipped with a digital input); </li><li>  <em>mount with suction cup</em> , designed for fixing on the windshield; </li><li>  <em>warranty card</em> </li><li>  <em>instruction manual</em> . </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the manufacturer tried to make sure that the user does not have the need to buy any components or accessories.  The only thing that will be needed for full-fledged work is a memory card of the size you need.  It is not supplied and is purchased separately by the user, as each has its own requirements regarding its characteristics. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance and usability </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the DVR received a rather compact body, which allows it, together with the mount, to occupy a minimum of space and not block the driver‚Äôs vision while driving.  On the front of it there is a small camera lens, on four sides of which there was a place for IR LEDs, which make it possible to improve the quality of videos shot at night. </p><p>  At the top, the manufacturer decided to place all the connectors, as well as the keys, which need quick access.  They included a power button and a quick snapshot button.  Of the connectors at the top are also the most used ones - this is a USB port that is used for charging while driving, as well as an analog video output through which you can display the image on the radio‚Äôs built-in display, if it supports this function.  This arrangement facilitates the first connection, and the 3600 FHD G Video Witness can be mounted independently without much difficulty. </p><p>  The side parts are also not without additional elements.  On the one hand, there is a mini-HDMI output for connecting a cord that transmits video in digital format, and on the other, there is a slot for a microSD memory card. </p><p>  The back is thought out for the most comfortable use and initial setup.  It has a display with a resolution of 320x240 pixels, which is enough to display the main menu of the device, as well as select the shooting area.  4 keys are used for setting.  There will be no problems with it, because for the DVR 3600 FHD G registrar, the instructions are drawn up as competently and fully as possible.  Under them, the developer decided to place a hole for the microphone that records all the conversations.  This can be useful if there is a conflict, for example, with a traffic police officer. </p><p>  The bottom end is also not without a pair of elements.  There is an emergency reset button in it, designed in case the ‚ÄúVideo Witness 3600 FHD G‚Äù suddenly hangs.  The manufacturer did not forget about the small dynamics, which will allow you to view the footage with sound in order to provide evidence of your innocence on the spot if necessary. </p>

    <h2>  Video Features </h2><p>  Shooting can be done in several modes, depending on which parameter you choose when setting up the 3600 FHD G Video Witness device.  The characteristics indicate that the option with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels has the best quality, however, it should be borne in mind that the memory card will fill up very quickly, which means that with active movement during the day, the video can be rewritten several times, and by the evening you will not find a fragment taken in the morning.  There are two more shooting modes in high quality, with a resolution of 1440 by 1080 and 1280 by 720 pixels.  In these modes, the frequency is 30 frames per second. </p><p>  If a higher speed is required, then you can sacrifice the quality of the picture itself.  By choosing the latter option with a resolution of 848 by 480 pixels, you will increase the frequency to 60 frames per second.  This can be useful if you want to be able to consider some details in the future, flipping through the video in slow motion. </p><h2>  Sensors and Modules </h2><p>  However, this device is more than just a video camera that captures everything in its path.  Additional features are provided with two built-in modules that facilitate operation and guarantee the smooth operation of the device. </p><p>  The first of these is the G-sensor, or accelerometer.  It is designed so that the gadget can independently determine the moments of the start of movement, shocks, hits, flips or turns.  If you specify a specific parameter in the menu, the video fragments captured at the time of events that are abnormal from the point of view of the device will be marked protected and will not be deleted during subsequent dubbing.  Thus, in the event of an emergency, you can be sure that the evidence will not be accidentally overwritten. </p><p>  The second module is a GPS receiver.  It provides several advantages at once.  One of them is recording current coordinates.  Therefore, even if an unpleasant situation occurred at night, and it is difficult to identify the surrounding area by video, geotags that have been carefully saved by a DVR with a GPS module can come to the rescue. </p><p>  In addition, based on the data received from the satellites, the vehicle‚Äôs speed is determined quite qualitatively, which is also displayed in the video itself.  This can subsequently help prove that you were moving without violating traffic rules. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The developers did not forget about allowing users to use the recorder as a regular camera separately from the car.  To do this, a removable battery of 500 mAh comes with it, which is enough for about an hour of continuous operation.  Given that it has a camera with a resolution of 5 megapixels, which can take pretty good photos and shoot high-quality video, the device could well replace the digital ‚Äúsoap box‚Äù during short walks. </p><p>  The battery is also used to work after the engine is turned off and the car is parked.  Nevertheless, it is recommended to leave the Video Witness DVR permanently connected to the power network so that it can capture, for example, the face of someone who might be trying to break into your machine, or do some damage to it.  This is especially true in the light of the fact that recently news feeds have been full of messages about drivers who escaped from an accident after a collision with a car parked on the road or parked. </p><h2>  Data storage </h2><p>  The device does not have internal memory, so you will immediately have to purchase a separate memory card.  It is recommended to immediately take a card with the maximum possible capacity, which is 32 GB.  This should be done because the video in the highest quality takes up a lot of space, and after nine hours, even with such a volume, you will begin to dub old fragments.  And if the card is only 4 GB, for example, then only a little more than an hour of material will be placed on it. </p><p>  When choosing a memory card, pay attention not only to the volume, but also to its speed class.  So you can avoid delays and jerks that occur at that moment, if the recording speed is not enough to save everything in real time.  That is why try to buy a card of class 10 or higher for your gadget "Video witness 3600 FHD G".  The description of this characteristic is often shown in large print on the package itself. </p>

    <h2>  Positive user reviews about the device </h2><p>  It's time to evaluate the quality of the device based on user reviews.  After all, it is precisely those people who have been using the device for some time under real operating conditions that can provide the most detailed and truthful information about its capabilities. </p><p>  The Video Recorder 3600 FHD G Video Recorder received both positive and negative.  Let's start with pleasant moments, among which the main ones are the following: </p><ul><li><p>  <em>Nice appearance and compact body</em> .  Many drivers note that this is precisely the approach of the developer to the creation of design that prompted the choice of this model.  The device does not interfere with the windshield and allows you to comfortably drive. </p></li><li><p>  <em>Acceptable video quality</em> .  With maximum parameters, the picture is quite clear, you can easily make out the numbers of vehicles moving along the way.  There are no problems with the oncoming in good lighting. </p></li><li><p>  <em>Simple and intuitive menu</em> .  Some users admit that they did not even look at the instructions, as this was not necessary.  All functions are named in plain language, and there are no problems with setting up the 3600 FHD G Video Witness interface. </p></li><li><p>  <em>Confident satellite signal reception by the GPS module</em> .  As some drivers note, quite often there were cases when the DVR established a reliable connection with the satellites before the navigator had time to do this. </p></li><li><p>  <em>Responsible technical support</em> .  Like any other device, the registrar may be defective or fail some time after the start of operation.  In most cases, as noted by users, the problem was quickly resolved under warranty in authorized service centers by replacing the gadget unit or even the entire device. </p></li><li><p>  <em>Possibility of use as a camera</em> .  This kind of versatility allows drivers not to acquire additional gadgets and can help out if there is no smartphone at hand, and you need to urgently take a high-quality photo. </p></li><li><p>  <em>The presence of IR illumination</em> .  Such a simple moment, as the installation of four LEDs by the manufacturer, significantly improved the quality of night shooting. </p></li></ul><p>  As you can see, the model has a rather impressive list of positive aspects.  However, she also has significant disadvantages, which are also worth paying attention to. </p>

    <h2>  Negative aspects of the model based on user reviews </h2><p>  The registrar received a number of significant shortcomings that cannot be ignored.  Before buying, think about whether you‚Äôre ready to put up with them, and only then make the final decision to purchase the 3600 FHD G Video Witness gadget.  Reviews say that the indignation of users is often caused by the following points: </p><ul><li><p>  <em>Fragile mount</em> .  As some drivers say, the suction cup could fall apart just three months after the start of operation.  This led to the need to invent new methods for fixing the gadget on the windshield. </p></li><li><p>  <em>The lack of a swivel mechanism</em> .  There is no ball joint on the mount, so you cannot turn the device and point it at the side window, for example, to record a conversation with a police officer without removing it from the mount.  This is not always convenient. </p></li><li><p>  <em>Incorrect firmware posted on the manufacturer‚Äôs website</em> .  The ‚ÄúVideo Witness 3600 FHD G‚Äù, whose users tried, in accordance with the instructions, to update the software, sometimes encountered the problem of getting a ‚Äúbrick‚Äù as a result, which, however, was subsequently restored without problems to the service center.  As it turned out, there are several revisions of the device with incompatible firmware for each other. </p></li><li><p>  <em>Sometimes it freezes</em> .  This often happens if the car is too hot or, conversely, too cold.      Reset         .     ,          . </p></li><li><p> <em>     ,       2-3    </em> . ,        ,        . ¬´ 3600 FHD G¬ª  ,   ,  ,    ,   ¬´¬ª ,   . </p></li></ul><p> Otherwise, given the relatively low price for the ‚ÄúVideo Witness 3600 FHD G‚Äù, which is about 5,000 Russian rubles, this model is one of the most optimal with similar functionality.  Of course, it will not do without some problems, but in order to avoid them, you will have to pay a lot more. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This unit is suitable for those who are not too picky about the reliability of technology.  The case is executed with high quality, the design is attractive, the work is almost stable, and if you are not lucky and get caught, then exchanging it through an official representative for a fully functional device will not be so difficult. </p>
