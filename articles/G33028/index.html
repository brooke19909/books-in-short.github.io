  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Several ways to set ringtone on iPhone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After the first joy of finding the coveted news subsides, the owners of the iPhone begin to notice some seemingly insoluble problems.  Most people do not even suspect what difficulties they will face in the process of setting up the device.  The commonplace actions that apply to regular phones are often not enough for a multifunctional iPhone.  In particular, people usually do not know how to install a ringtone on iPhone 4. After all, this model initially does not support the use of its own tunes. </p><p>  Moreover, even if you have some kind of song loaded, it is hardly possible to use it as a signal.  Firstly, a special <span>AAS format is</span> required <span>.</span>  In addition, there is a strict time limit: no more than 39 seconds for ringtones per call.  This means that you can only put the basic tunes installed on the phone by developers.  But sooner or later, even the most unpretentious user will have a moment when they are all deadly bored.  If this happens, then it's time to look for a loophole that allows you to circumvent this ban. </p><p>  <strong>So how to set ringtone on iPhone?</strong> </p><p>  There are several ways to solve this problem.  All of them are of varying degrees of difficulty, paid and free, but, one way or another, help to overcome the ban of developers.  Of course, you can use the services of the commercial App Store program.  It has the opportunity to get the right melody for a fee and quickly convert it to the desired format.  But there are other ways to <span>set the</span> ringtone on iPhone.  This should include the use of programs such as iTunes or, for example, Ringtonium Lite.  Let's consider a little more detailed work with each of them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Quick Start Guide for iTunes</strong> </p><p>  This method is one of the simplest and is available to almost any owner of an iPhone.  To get started, you need a computer and the iTunes application installed on it.  First, run it and drag the desired audio file into the working window of the program.  Alternatively, you can do the same through the ‚Äúfile‚Äù section and the ‚Äúadd to library‚Äù function. </p><p>  How to crop a file: </p><p>  Now you need to choose a melody or song with which we will work.  The procedure is as follows: first you need to trim the file to the required size, and then change its extension.  In the first case, you need to click on the audio file with the right mouse button, calling the context menu.  There is an item "Information".  Open it and look at the top section of the parameters.  When you click on it, a new window will open in which you need to set a time limit.  In our case, it is about 30 seconds. </p><p>  Remember that here it is not necessary to choose exclusively the beginning of the musical composition.  After all, we only have half a minute, and in some songs the introduction takes so much time.  What if a call requires, for example, only a refrain or the most emotional part of a melody?  For this case, next to the ‚Äústart‚Äù and ‚Äústop‚Äù buttons there are sections where you should manually set the time interval.  We select the interval and save the settings. </p><p>  Conversion: </p><p>  Next, you need to convert the resulting short melody.  It is quite simple to accomplish this, since all the necessary codecs are already in the program.  You only need to call the <span>context menu</span> again and select the "Convert to AAC format" section.  Upon completion of the process, you need to open the file (again, right-clicking on it) in Finder, selecting the appropriate menu bar. </p><p>  In the window that opens, manually change the extension to m4r.  That's it, our ringtone is almost ready.  It remains to connect the iPhone to the computer and synchronize the created melody with the device.  This is done in the ‚Äúringtones‚Äù tab (for some - ‚Äúsounds‚Äù).  Now you can easily set this musical composition on a call. </p><p>  <strong>How to set ringtone on iPhone using Ringtonium Lite</strong> </p><p>  The interface of this program is easy to master, since there are only a few basic functions.  The principle of operation is very similar to the steps in the first description.  In the same way, you need to drag your favorite music to the working window and specify the interval.  As you remember, it is desirable that it lasts no more than 30 seconds. </p><p>  But to make a mistake in this program is quite difficult, since the maximum duration of any melody created in it is limited to 33 seconds.  Adding a ringtone will become available after synchronization with the computer.  For a more detailed familiarization with some functions, an instruction is built into the program. </p>
