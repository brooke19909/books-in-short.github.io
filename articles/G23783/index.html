The cheapest MTS tariff without a monthly fee</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most of the mobile communication plans that we have to deal with require a monthly fee.  This means that the user must regularly pay bills that the operator sets in order to be able to make calls, send SMS messages, and use Internet traffic.  Of course, not everyone likes this state of affairs. </p><p>  There are people who would like to have a number connected to one or another mobile operator purely for receiving calls or, say, for a one-time access to the Internet.  Paying constantly and regularly for being able to do this is quite disadvantageous.  That is why subscribers often look for a <span>tariff plan without a monthly fee.</span> </p><p>  MTS, as the leader of the Russian telecom segment, is ready to provide such tariffs.  About them and will be discussed in today's article. </p>

    <h2>  Why are tariffs good without a monthly fee? </h2><p>  Let's start by describing why plans are so good without having to regularly pay a fee for their use.  In principle, this is obvious - the subscriber is not forced to replenish the account every month, say, by 300 rubles.  He pays only for those services that he consumes, for example, for a call every 2 days, SMS or for the day of using the Internet (or even for the amount of traffic that was consumed once). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, a similar approach allows saving in certain situations.  After all, choosing a tariff plan without a monthly fee (MTS), you do not pay for additional services that you do not actually use.  So, in the end, pay less. </p><p>  The second point is the psychological attitude of people towards the monthly fee.  So our nature is arranged.  If the operator introduces an obligation to replenish the account by a certain amount, this can be somewhat depressing to a person.  Well, some do not want to feel <span>this feeling,</span> when you have to pay a certain amount once a month.  The logic of such subscribers is simple: ‚ÄúI used the services - I paid.  But I will not make contributions in advance. ‚Äù </p><p>  This is less serious, but also an explanation of why MTS tariffs without a monthly fee are more successful than plans with a monthly fee. </p>

    <h2>  Disadvantages of tariffs without a monthly fee </h2><p>  Although, if we look at this situation from an economic point of view in order to establish real benefits for the subscriber, we will understand the opposite.  In fact, tariffs with a monthly fee are more profitable.  And the reason for this is quite simple - the operator company knows how much money you will definitely spend on communication services next month.  Consequently, she can, in a sense, count on your contribution.  In addition, when making subscription payments, you buy services in bulk;  whereas in a situation without a regular fee, you actually consume them at retail.  This, obviously, already affects the final cost of consumed Internet traffic, minutes for calls and SMS provided by the operator. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Therefore, if you need MTS tariffs without a monthly fee, think about whether they really will be so beneficial specifically for you.  The answer to this question will be positive only if you really need a number to perform one-time tasks. </p>

    <h2>  MTS tariffs </h2><p>  If you look at the tariff schedule of this operator, we note the following: all plans are divided into two groups, the first of which includes tariffs with regular payments, and the second without them.  Obviously, plans with a monthly fee are more profitable.  Even with a quick inspection, this can be seen.  The user, being on such a plan, gets in the end much more. </p><p>  On the other hand, there are also ‚Äúfree‚Äù plans without mandatory payments, which we will be talking about.  Yes, if you compare the package of services provided under the plans of the first and second groups, then more, of course, get users with tariffs, including a monthly fee.  But the topic of our article is plans for which you do not need to pay regularly, and so now we will briefly review each of those that we managed to find.  All these tariffs will be supported by MTS for a year without a monthly fee and even more (if there is any activity on the number). </p>

    <h2>  "Your country" </h2><p>  This tariff is aimed at users who often communicate with subscribers from other countries due to the fact that the cost of calls here from 1 to 5 minutes (to CIS numbers, as well as Vietnam, Korea and the USA) is charged at a price of 4.5 rubles;  from 6 to 10 minutes - 1.5 rubles.  If we talk about calls to Azerbaijan and Belarus, their cost will be at the level of 9.5 rubles per minute.  Calling to Europe is much more expensive, such calls will cost the subscriber 49 rubles per minute. </p><p>  To communicate with subscribers from Moscow, you will have to pay 2.5 rubles per minute for the first 5 minutes.  conversation and 1.5 rubles - for each subsequent.  Calls to Russian numbers will cost 3 rubles for each of the first 5 minutes and 1.5 rubles each.  - for the subsequent ones. </p><p>  SMS and the Internet in this regard are quite expensive - 9.9 rubles per megabyte of traffic and from 2 to 6.5 rubles - for each message. </p><p>  Thus, this typical tariff plan without a monthly fee, MTS positions it as for calls abroad.  It is possible to use it within the country, but it is less profitable.  By the way, the transition to the plan is also paid, it will cost 150 rubles.  ‚ÄúYour country‚Äù is valid only for residents of Moscow and the region (MTS subscribers).  For a year without a monthly fee, such a tariff will be active only if calls are made from it. </p>

    <h2>  ‚ÄúSuper MTS.  Region" </h2><p>  This tariff can also be connected only to subscribers from the capital and Moscow region.  He suggests an interesting offer - 20 minutes of free calls within the region.  True, the remaining services within this plan are quite expensive.  This is clearly not <span>the cheapest MTS tariff</span> without a monthly fee. </p><p>  Calls after the 21st minute of a call to local numbers will cost the user 1.5 rubles;  to call other numbers (not MTS) within the region, you need to pay 2.5 rubles per minute, and to talk to subscribers from other regions - 5 rubles (MTS).  A call to another operator‚Äôs number from another region will be charged at 14 rubles per minute.  The Internet, as in the previous tariff, will cost 9.9 rubles per megabyte.  Switching to such a MTS tariff without a monthly fee will also cost the subscriber 150 rubles. </p><h2>  Super MTS </h2><p>  This plan is an analogue of what is described above, only with this difference: it can be connected not only to residents of Moscow and the Moscow region.  It is obviously available throughout Russia, and the cost of calls is calculated using the same formula. <br>  If we talk briefly about both Super MTS tariffs, then only 2 advantages will be obvious - the absence of a mandatory fee and 20 minutes of free calls in the subscriber's region.  The rest of the services are obviously provided at too high prices, due to which the operator, obviously, compensates for the lack of a regular fee. </p><h2>  Red energy </h2>

    <p>  At the cost of additional services, the Red Energy tariff is similar to Super.  True, it does not imply the availability of free 20 minutes to local MTS numbers.  But, according to this plan, a subscriber can call at a low price - only 1.6 rubles per minute to all numbers from his region.  This also applies to numbers of other operators. </p><p>  The alternative is obvious: either the user is given free calls to his network numbers (Super MTS), or cheaper calls with all numbers from his region (this tariff plan) without a <span>monthly fee.</span>  MTS, allowing making such a choice, creates additional comfort for the user.  Let's put it this way: depending on who you often communicate with over the phone, these two plans can be very beneficial for you. </p><h2>  Per second </h2>

    <p>  The third package, which we will consider along with the two mentioned, is called "Secondary".  He is also part of the group that MTS has - tariffs without a monthly fee.  True, this plan differs in the tariffing of conversations - it happens per second. </p><p>  This means that for every second of conversation with any number from your region, you must pay 5 cents.  Thus, by simple calculations, it can be established that a minute of conversation will cost 3 rubles. </p><p>  MTS has connected such a tariff plan without a monthly fee for users who need a few seconds of conversation to say something most important and immediately hang up.  At the same time, the cost of additional services (calls to other numbers, the Internet and SMS) here are the same as on ‚ÄúSuper MTS‚Äù and on Red Energy. </p><h2>  How to choose? </h2><p>  These are all the tariffs that are available for the MTS mobile operator.  There is Internet without a monthly fee at all, but its cost is extremely high.  It is much more profitable to connect a tariff with regular payments.  SMS is the same.  And in general, packages are beneficial only to those who speak little or do not speak on the phone at all.  And so it will be until new MTS tariffs appear without a monthly fee. </p><h2>  Or is it a monthly fee? </h2><p>  You saw how much the service costs on tariffs without a mandatory fee.  As you can see, the cost of services is quite high.  For comparison: the Smart mini tariff allows you to make an unlimited number of calls to MTS in your region for just 200 rubles, talk for 1000 minutes for free with MTS numbers in Russia, send 50 free SMS and spend 500 megabytes of mobile Internet.  A call to the numbers of other operators will cost 10 rubles. </p><p>  So a monthly fee or "free recharge"?  You decide.  For calls to numbers of your network, Super MTS is suitable, while for communication with subscribers of other networks in your region it is better to take Red Energy.  The second will seem interesting to those who say very little. </p>
