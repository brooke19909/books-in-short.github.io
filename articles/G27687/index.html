  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Balance Fishing: Features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An artificial bait that resembles a small fish and has a multi-colored color is called a balancer.  The hooks at this bait are conditionally located in the tail and head parts, and on the top and bottom there are two loops, one for securing the fishing line, and the other, respectively, for the location of the second tee. </p><p>  The obligatory part of the balancer is the stabilizer located in the part of the tail, due to which its various play is provided.  The size of the bait ranges from two to nine centimeters. </p><p>  Few fishermen know that balancing fishing came to Russia from the <span>Scandinavian countries.</span>  Today, it has gained great popularity among mediums and those who are fond of winter fishing for predatory fish. </p><p>  The principle by which the fishing is carried out on the balancer can be conveyed in just a few words: approximately in the center of gravity of this bait is the fishing line mount.  When lifting the rod up due to its original design, the bait begins to go right and left.  This is precisely what determines its name and ideality when fishing for a predator. </p><p>  Catching on the balancer is not always a panacea for nibble, however, with the "sluggish" fish, the advantages over catching the spinner are obvious.  And the fish is caught larger. </p><p>  With intensive biting, such a fishing as balancing fishing has its drawbacks - it is a slower pace for fishing, which is caused by some inconvenience when removing caught prey from the tee, so usually fishermen replace this bait with a spinner so as not to waste precious time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In this article, you can find the answer to the question of how to catch on the balancer. </p><p>  This kind of fishing is somewhat different from fishing with baubles.  The fishing rod must be waved more gently, while maintaining some tension in the fishing line, the amplitude should be no more than twenty centimeters.  During the pause, you can barely noticeably pull the end of the rod, as if stimulating the grip of a predatory fish. </p><p>  The balancer sinks to the bottom, and then gently rises a couple of centimeters.  Then smoothly return the rod back to the bottom.  In this case, the balancer begins to sail from side to side, describing after the second wave of the figure eight.  After playing ten times at the bottom, you can then shorten the fishing line by half a meter, then a little more, catching gradually closer to the surface. </p><p>  Then gradually you need to lengthen the fishing line, returning the balancer back to the bottom.  It goes without saying that after biting you need to continue fishing at the same depth, continuing to use the "game" to raise the fish higher and higher. </p><p>  The balancer can be used in any water layers and at any, of course, real depth.  However, it should be noted that at a clean bottom made of stones and sand and a shallow depth, repeated repetition of the diving strikes of predatory prey can lead to bending or breaking the hook. </p><p>  Fishing in the winter on the balancer involves a fishing rod with a reel.  The fishing line should be up to 0.27 millimeters in diameter, and its length should be up to 25 meters - a thin fishing line does not scare away the fish when playing. </p><p>  The benefits of fishing on the balance are as follows: </p><ol><li>  if the fish is determined to dine, then a few strokes are enough and excellent fishing will begin; </li><li>  if the nibble is very sluggish, then the game will tease the fish, reviving the swallowing of the bait; </li><li>  easy slipping to the desired depth; </li><li>  large balancer - large bait. </li></ol><p>  There are many types of balancers, differing from each other in color, size, shape and material from which they are prepared. </p><p>  There is an opinion among fishers that any predatory fish found in fresh water can be caught on the balancer, but nevertheless the main objects for fishing are zander and perch.  Moreover, the fact that the largest <span>specimen of these</span> fish is caught on the balancer is interesting. </p><p>  In conclusion, I want to say that if the fisherman‚Äôs tackle is prepared carefully, then he will never be left without a catch. </p>
