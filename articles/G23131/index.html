Satisfied tourists often return to the incredibly beautiful and cozy town located between Tarragona and Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãnot only to soak up on the clean beaches, but also once again to admire the historical heritage of a paradise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1423860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1423860.jpg?1539074686"></div><h2>  Calafell - a family-friendly resort </h2><p>  Designed for families, Calafell (Spain) will delight in a very good location of the resort.  And the pacifying natural beauty will appeal to those who are tired of noisy and gassed megacities.  Guests are pleased to note that this is one of the sunniest cities in the world.  Here, in the high tourist season, the water temperature holds above 25 degrees. </p><h2>  History tour </h2><p>  The territory of the Spanish pearl, which received a certificate of the best resort in the country, was settled by Iberians in the 90s of our era.  And the emergence of a city on the coast, historians attribute to the Middle Ages.  Residents of a small town erected defenses, repelling the attacks of the enemy.  In the XVII century, the city fell under the onslaught of the Spanish king.  And traces of the Middle Ages remained on the ancient fortress and carved in the rocks of the church of Santa Cruz. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Iberian Citadel </h2><p>  A fascinating excursion to the Iberian citadel, which made Calafell famous throughout the world, which Spain can be proud of, allows you to make a real trip in time.  Built before BC, Ciutadella ib√®rica de Calafell was discovered as a result of archaeological excavations.  The fortress destroyed by Roman soldiers, which became a museum, was restored to the smallest detail for about 20 years.  And now the eyes of the astonished guests of the city appear powerful stone walls and ancient buildings, decorated with found objects. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1424010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1424010.jpg?1539074686"></div><h2>  The main castle of the city </h2><p>  Tourists with pleasure come to the city of Calafell.  Spain beckons them with its sights.  Guests of the country want to get acquainted with a unique monument towering above the city.  Castell de la Santa Creu de Calafell appeared in the 11th century when Muslim attacks began.  On the way to the national treasure, city guests will see a necropolis with medieval graves dug in the rock. </p><p>  The defensive structure, located a few kilometers from the sea, delights with power and grandeur, and the restored interior decoration plunges into the atmosphere of the Middle Ages.  In the vicinity of the historical landmark, you can take a walk and enjoy the wonderful view that opens from the observation platforms.  Local guides will not forget to talk about the communidore - a square-shaped building crowning the castle and driving away all evil spirits. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1423819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1423819.jpg?1539074686"></div><h2>  Ancient roman villa </h2><p>  Many tourists like the calm and quiet Calafell, Spain.  The sights of the city silently tell of the affairs of bygone days.  Locals love to show visitors the villa of the ancient Romans, built BC.  Carved porticoes, massive columns adorn the restored El-Vilarenc archaeological site, but galleries with long corridors and the ruins of water-supplying baths created by the skilled architects of Ancient Rome are of most interest. </p><h2>  Esgl√©sia de Sant Miquel </h2><p>  The real treasure of transitional time is considered to be the church of St. Miguel.  The building, closed to visitors, will attract attention with a combination of Gothic and Romanesque styles.  Located in the very center of the resort, a religious monument with small arched windows through which the sun's rays barely break through, can be seen in detail from the outside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1424015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1424015.jpg?1539074686"></div><h2>  The Essence of Calafell </h2><p>  If we talk about modern attractions, then we can not help but mention the unique painting, which was painted by eight artists commissioned by the city hall.  On a huge canvas depicts Calafell (Spain) changing depending on the time of day.  Real professionals have recreated all the features of a popular tourist resort.  And the main storyline is based on the change of the sun and moon. </p><p>  The original work ‚ÄúThe Essence of Calafell‚Äù is a canvas painted in different techniques, which reflects the whole life of a small town.  A large-scale work makes tourists think about the present and the future, and unusual shades and textures make it possible to call the picture a true masterpiece. </p><h2>  What else to see in a small town? </h2><p>  In 2008, at the initiative of local residents, a monument appeared to a peasant.  An iron monument depicting a man and a horse is mounted on a stone wall.  In addition to him, the city has other original structures.  For example, thirty years ago, during a city festival in the historical part of the resort, a fisherman sculpture was installed on the waterfront.  A modest hut of the poet, writer, translator Carlos Barral, currently owned by the municipality, will introduce everyone to the heritage of the Spanish author. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1424016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1424016.jpg?1539074686"></div><h2>  Calafell (Spain): hotels </h2><p>  Of course, first of all, they go to sunny Calafell for the sake of the warm sea and many kilometers of sandy beaches.  Here, young people love families, families with children.  And healing mud, iodine-rich water and wellness treatments attract the attention of older people.  Recently, a whole network of comfortable hotels has grown in the resort area, providing all the necessary amenities for city guests.  I must say that tourists will find rooms for every taste and budget.  Five-star hotels are adjacent to inexpensive campsites, and for those who like to travel, there are comfortable campervans.  They can be removed during the holidays. </p><p>  One of the most popular establishments located in the center of the ancient city is the Miramar Hotel located near the sea.  Calafell (Spain) cares about its guests and offers excellent high-class service.  Miramar is no exception.  Successful businessmen and ordinary tourists, who respond well to the hotel, often recognize it as the best combination of price and quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1423846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1423846.jpg?1539074686"></div><p>  Foreign guests rush to return to the memorable wonderful landscapes and the clear sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãCalafell (Spain) in order to again plunge into the enchanting atmosphere of celebration and relaxation.  A small city full of historical monuments will not let anyone get bored. </p>
