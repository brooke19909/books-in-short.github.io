This is what I wanted to talk about in our article.  This land area is located in Azerbaijan on the western coast of the Caspian Sea.  In order to find it on the map, you need to know the coordinates - 40 ¬∞ 27‚Ä≤49 ‚Ä≥ north latitude and 49 ¬∞ 57‚Ä≤27 ‚Ä≥ east longitude.

    <h2>  Hydronym </h2><p>  The Absheron Peninsula, the photo of which can be viewed in the article, got its name several centuries ago.  A small settlement of the same name that existed before the beginning of the 18th century gave the name to the peninsula, dubbing it a cape.  The word "Absheron" is borrowed from the Tat, and means salt water.  It is believed that at first they designated the <span>Caspian Sea,</span> and only then they began to call the coastal settlement.  This is not the only hypothesis, since there are other options for the origin of the name of the peninsula. </p><h2>  a brief description of </h2><p>  Absheron Peninsula (Azerbaijan) is not very large.  Its length does not exceed 60 km, and the width is 30 km.  The total area is about 2,000 square meters.  km  The surface of the peninsula is a wavy plain with uplifts and mud hills.  Inland basins filled with salt marshes and salt lakes make up the relief of Absheron.  It is very rare to find areas with moving sands.  The highest point of the plain reaches 165 m, and volcanoes rise above sea level by 310 m. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the Absheron Peninsula" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1271083.jpg" width="600"></div>

On the southwestern side at the foot of the horseshoe-shaped bay, the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is an amphitheater.  The Absheron Peninsula is rich in many thermal springs and mud volcanoes.  Here deposits of Neogene and anthropogenous systems are found everywhere; Tabashir deposits are found to be in its northwestern part.  The peninsula itself is located in a seismically active zone. </p><p>  Absheron has a rich history.  Archaeological excavations testify to its settlement from the Bronze Age.  Rock carvings and artifacts that have survived to this day say that fishing, hunting, farming, pottery and weaving were well developed then. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The dry tropical climate year round provides relatively high temperatures in the local territory (on average from +25 ¬∞ C in the summer to +3 ¬∞ C in the winter), which makes the rest on the Absheron peninsula as comfortable as possible.  Depending on the territorial location (north, south, west and east sides), the annual rainfall ranges from 140 to 250 mm.  Strong winds blow here very often. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Absheron peninsula azerbaijan" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1271087.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  On the Absheron Peninsula, the ephemeral semi-desert vegetation predominates.  Hares, foxes, lizards, jerboas, turtles, snakes, frogs and gulls are representatives of the local fauna.  The inhabitants of the Absheron peninsula are engaged in sheep husbandry, in the irrigated lands - melon cultivation, in subtropical orchards they grow saffron, olives, almonds, figs, sweet grapes and olives. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The rich history of the peninsula is illustrated by the sights preserved to this day.  The most popular among tourists is the Nardaran Fortress, built in the XIV century.  Based on many years of research, historians have suggested that it was originally built as a temple. </p><p>  One of the monuments of ancient architecture is a round castle in the village of Mardakan, built in 1232.  Not far from it is the Quadrangular castle.  It was built in the XII century in honor of the victory over the enemies of the ruler of Askhitan I. The castle is a fortress of 5 tiers 22 meters high. </p><p>  No less interesting for guests visiting the Absheron Peninsula is the fire temple "Ateshnyah", located in the village of Surahani.  It got its name due to the gas escaping from the bowels of the earth and flammable in air.  In the XVIII century this place was considered holy, hermits built cells and chapels around it.  They led a restrained lifestyle, pacified the body with heavy chains and <span>quicklime.</span> </p>

    <p>  In the village of Ramana is another historical artifact.  This is a tower 15 meters high.  It was built in the 14th century.  One of the most mysterious legacies of Absheron are the ‚Äústone roads‚Äù.  These are 2-3 (sometimes 5) ditches from 5 to 50 cm deep, hollowed out on rocky surfaces parallel to each other.  All of them are directed towards the sea.  Most of them are destroyed by time, but there are surviving sections up to 100 m long. On the peninsula they can be found between the villages of Govsan and Turkyan, near the settlements of Dubendi, Gala, and Surakhany.  The time of construction of the ‚Äústone roads‚Äù is approximately 4-5 millennium BC. </p><p>  Flora lovers are advised to visit the arboretum located near the village of Mardakan.  Here you can look at various types of wild plants growing in as close as possible to natural conditions. </p><h2>  Village Tours </h2><p>  Trips to the villages of Absheron are very popular with tourists.  Now their number exceeds 60. Most of them appeared a long time ago, the other arose from the workers' settlements of the Soviet era.  During this tour, guests of Azerbaijan are introduced to the cuisine, traditions and customs of the Caucasian people.  Among Azerbaijanis, pilaf is the most popular dish.  Dressing and rice are prepared for him separately.  It is generously seasoned with spices and seasonings.  Very often plums, plums, quinces and apricots are used in this capacity. </p><h2>  Industry </h2><p>  Absheron Peninsula is an important industrial zone of Azerbaijan.  It and the adjacent water area have rich deposits of oil and gas.  Oil production via wells has been carried out for several centuries; on an industrial scale, such developments have been carried out since the end of the 19th century.  The oil and gas producing and refining industries available here (Karadag) have led to major environmental problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Absheron Peninsula photo" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1271080.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  The Absheron Peninsula is a favorite vacation spot for local and foreign tourists, despite the fact that many city beaches are closed for swimming.  Visiting open coastal areas is paid.  For a small cost you will be given the opportunity to use a deck chair, swim in the sea, bring a teapot with a saucer of jam. </p>
