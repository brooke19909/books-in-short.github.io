Does it seem commonplace to you that you will order a biscuit with a mastic design?  Then make <span>a candy cake.</span>  Such yummy will surely please your friends.  And most importantly, the treat will be very unusual.  Look for all the tips for making a non-trivial gift below. </p><h2>  Cake with a box of chocolates </h2><div class="photo" data-original="qadinla.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cake with a box of chocolates" class="if uuid-2419086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2419086.jpg"></div><p>  If you don‚Äôt know what to present to your friends, make a delicious treat.  Your present will decorate the holiday table, and then during the week you will be remembered with warm words.  How to make a cake from sweets?  To create such a two-tier pyramid, you need a box of Raffaello chocolates, 12 kinder and a few packs of kinder chocolate.  Let's start manufacturing.  The first step is to cut out the base for the cake.  It should be a circle of cardboard.  Its diameter can vary between 25-30 cm. Now you should take a thick foam.  We cut out a circle 3-4 cm smaller than the base.  We fasten the centers of the workpieces.  Take the glue gun and kinder chocolates.  Glue vertical rectangles around the entire circumference of the circle.  On top of the foam base we hoist a box of chocolates.  In order for the design to be stable and transportable, the box can be glued to the base.  It remains to lay out around the perimeter of the kinder box. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Heart" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart cake" class="if uuid-2419088" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2419088.jpg"></div><p>  Such a non-trivial candy cake can be presented to a loved one on Valentine's Day or on his birthday.  How to make an unusual present?  To make it, you will need cardboard and sweets.  Let's start by making the basics.  Cut out the heart of cardboard.  Now we make the sides of the future box.  To create them, you need to cut long rectangles with a height of at least 10 cm. Apply glue to one half of the heart.  We begin to make a board from the middle of the upper part of the base.  We are doing the same operation on the other hand.  Now you need to decorate the sides of the box.  Glue kinder chocolates to them.  For greater effect, they can be bandaged with two colored ribbons.  Fill the box with your loved one‚Äôs favorite candies and add a few chocolate eggs with a surprise.  If you wish, you can put a more valuable gift on the bottom of the box, for example, a watch, earrings, tie, etc. </p><h2>  Cake from M &amp; E </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="em &amp; em cake" class="if uuid-2419092" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2419092.jpg"></div><p>  Want to make a gift for a sweet tooth?  Make a cake of sweets and fill it with sweet dragees.  Such a gift will delight those who love Em and Ems.  How to create such a cake?  You need to purchase Kinder chocolates and unpack them.  Now form a circle of chocolate blanks.  You can glue the parts together with a candle or a lighter.  But over the fire you need to melt not a chocolate bar, but heat a spoon.  It is good to glue parts of the base of the cake with each other.  When this painstaking part of the work is done, you will need to bandage the chocolates with a ribbon.  It remains to fill the cake with small sweets or dragees.  You can stick candles in your creation to achieve greater similarity of the product with a holiday cake. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cake with flowers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cake with flowers" class="if uuid-2419100" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2419100.jpg"></div><p>  If you give a present to a woman, then it will be difficult to manage with sweets alone.  Be sure to decorate your creation with fresh flowers.  A woman will enjoy this sign of attention.  How to make a cake out of sweets with your own hands?  First, you need to make two bases for the first and second "cakes".  We‚Äôll ‚Äúbake‚Äù them out of cardboard.  Cut two circles - the base, and then make long rectangles.  We glue the bottom with the side, and inside the first "cake" we put the polystyrene cut into shape.  What for?  To make a dense cake base.  We close the foam with paper and decorate the sidewall of the first tier.  For this purpose, you can use ribbons and colored paper.  Now set the second tier in the center of the first.  Instead of polystyrene foam in the second "cake" you need to put a floral sponge.  We strengthen the flowers in the second box.  It remains to decorate the space of the first tier with sweets.  For this purpose you can choose any sweets.  One option is Ferrero Rocher sweets. </p><h2>  Chocolate cake </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chocolate cake" class="if uuid-2419110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2419110.jpg"></div><p>  An interesting gift option can be a multi-tiered creation.  A photo of a candy cake of such a plan is presented above.  For each layer you need to make a foundation.  We will make it from cardboard.  Cut the base circle, and then create a sidewall from a long rectangle.  Each tier is filled with foam.  If you do not have polystyrene on hand, you can use well-wrinkled newspapers as a filler.  We will glue the cake with the ‚ÄúInspiration‚Äù chocolates.  As additional decorative elements, inserts from other, large chocolates can be used.  When the cake is ready, you can start decorating it.  To do this, use candies in a gold wrapper or in any color.  Glue on top of each row of candy, and between them we strengthen the ribbons.  You can tie bows out of them. </p><h2>  "Tropical island" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kmjanwa.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tropical island" class="if uuid-2419124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2419124.jpg"></div><p>  How to make a cake from sweets?  If you are giving a present to a child or a creative adult, then you can give your creation the shape of a tropical island.  Making such a cake will be easy.  You need to make a box out of cardboard.  If you do not want to do this, you can take a ready-made foundation.  Now we glue the box on the outside with "grass" made of corrugated paper.  Fill the base with sweets.  In the corners we fall asleep sweets in golden candy wrappers, and in the middle we lay out a wavy line of sweets in a blue wrapper.  Now you need to make a palm tree.  For its manufacture we will use sweets in gold candy wrappers.  We spread the sweets around and wrap the row with tape.  We lay out the second tier in a checkerboard pattern relative to the first.  Again we fix the result with tape.  We continue to repeat these steps until the palm tree rises at least 20 cm. Now you have to make the leaves.  You can use live leaves or make them out of colored paper.  As coconuts on a palm tree, you can hang candies in a gold wrapper. </p><h2>  Barbie Cake </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="barbie cake" class="if uuid-2419128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2419128.jpg"></div><p>  Want to make a gift for a girl?  Above you can see a photo <span>of a candy cake.</span>  <span>With your own hands,</span> such a product will be very simple to make.  To make it, you will need a Barbie doll, which will become the main gift.  Take the foil and wrap it around the doll‚Äôs waist.  Fill the skirt with crumpled newspapers and make a bottom of cardboard backing.  So you get a stable base for the cake.  Get a variety of round sweets.  It is advisable to buy sweets in the same color scheme.  Now you will need to put on sweets on toothpicks, and stick them in a skirt.  But do not spread sweets in circles.  It will be too boring.  Better stick the sweets in waves or semicircles. </p><h2>  Cake in kindergarten </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.eyeni.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="one to kindergarten" class="if uuid-2419146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2419146.jpg"></div><p>  Is your child's birthday soon?  Then it's time to think about making a cake from juice and sweets.  Such a treat will look beautiful on the festive table, and most importantly, unlike a regular cake, you will not need to think about how to divide yummy into pieces.  Make three round boxes of cardboard and fill them with polystyrene or newspapers.  Fix the blanks on top of each other in ascending order.  Now you will need to glue the ends of the boxes with corrugated paper.  To make the cake look festive, you can make each tier a different color.  Glue juice boxes to the end of the first row.  Decorate the second tier with cookies or pastries in the package.  But on the third row, stick candy, candy bars or small chocolates.  In the upper box, you can pour lollipops, or any other caramel.  Each tier can be bandaged with colorful ribbons. </p>
