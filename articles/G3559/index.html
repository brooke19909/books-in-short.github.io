As a testing device, you can take the popular Nokia phone (push-button) C2-05.  This model is quite interesting in external parameters, and also unusual in its internal filling. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia c2 05" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1051344.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is included? </h2><p>  When buying this phone in a box, the consumer will find a charger, a headset, the device itself and an instruction manual. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The device is small in size, it is quite compact and convenient.  When compared with the male palm, the phone is completely "immersed" in it.  The weight of the device is 98 grams, dimensions - 9.9x4.7x1.6 cm. Many potential buyers are frightened by the fact that the device is slightly thick.  However, you must remember that this device is a slider, so this thickness is normal for it. </p><p>  According to the design, we can conclude that the <span>Nokia C2-05</span> phone is more designed for the younger generation than for older people.  The fact is that the dominant colors are quite bright and rich.  Three variants of the device can be found on the market at once: black, pink and blue. </p>

    <p>  This review will touch on the black modification.  The panel is made of high quality plastic.  There is practically no gloss (available only near the screen and keys for calling).  The advantage was given to the matte finish.  It also has its advantages.  For instance: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Less commonly exposed to mechanical stress, which can result in a scratch or dent. </li><li>  Cleanliness is the main friend of this surface. </li></ul><p>  The colors are arranged in this way: black from the bottom of the case panel, and a dark gray shade is used from above.  Nokia C2-05 deserves a solid five in terms of build quality and materials.  There is no backlash, no squeaks and staggering either.  Although the design itself has a sliding mechanism, it still feels a monolithic effect.  Closing and opening, the phone gives a barely audible click.  There is an auto-start, which halfway already makes itself felt. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The Nokia phone (push-button) is equipped with a liquid crystal display.  Its diagonal is 2 inches.  Supports about 65 thousand colors.  Resolution - 240x320 pixels.  The brightness is not strong, does not change in the settings, and the colors do not differ in particular brightness.  Blind gaps appear under the sun's rays, but the text remains readable. </p>

    <p>  If you believe the reviews of people who have been using this device for a long time, then scratches on the screen rarely appear, since it is covered with a special protective plastic. </p><h2>  Internal interface </h2><p>  The <span>Nokia C2-05 phone, the</span> updated firmware for which is freely available, operates on the Series 40. The desktop is equipped with a shortcut for mobile communications and charging.  In addition, there you can see the date and time.  Widgets are not uncommon on the screen of this device.  You can freely set a timer, stopwatch, links, chat, multimedia, mail, search, call log and other applications on it.  The menu is called up using a special navigation key. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the locked screen, the host will not see anything new, since nothing is simply displayed on it.  The design of standard <span>Nokia C2-05 themes is</span> changed at the discretion of the buyer, as is the background image of the display. </p><h2>  Book of numbers </h2><p>  Phone memory allows you to have about a thousand contacts.  In each of them a person can save no more than 5 phones.  When entering the last name and first name, you can notice that only 50 text characters are given for each field, which, in principle, is always enough.  For a specific subscriber, its own melody and photo are set.  The numbers are saved both to the card and to the memory of Nokia C2-05. </p>

    <p>  The list can be completed in alphabetical order by first or last name.  There is also a search with which it is easier to find the necessary contact. </p><h2>  Call log </h2><p>  This menu section includes all calls: incoming, missed, outgoing, dialed.  You can find here the total duration of conversations, the duration of a conversation with a particular subscriber, the number of messages sent and other connections.  In addition, there is a speakerphone.  It is quite high-quality, speech is legible.  Call recording is another feature that Nokia C2-05 supports.  It was useful to introduce speed dialing.  Thanks to this, up to 8 numbers can be recorded on each key.  Judging by consumer reviews, this feature is quite in demand. </p><h2>  Messages </h2><p>  A few years ago a unified design for messages was introduced.  Correspondence with a specific contact is grouped into a folder or dialogue.  So it‚Äôs much more convenient to look at the conversation history and search for the necessary information.  The phone supports receiving SMS and MMS messages.  To create the second option, you need to insert a melody, photo, video in a regular message.  The device itself will change the message format to MMS.  The font, or rather its size, can be changed in the settings. </p>

    <p>  From SMS you can transfer data to a calendar, contacts, etc. It is allowed to send them to e-mail or to a regular phone number. </p><h2>  Email </h2><p>  In order for the work in e-mail to be correct and not to show glitches, you must use the "native" application installed by the manufacturer.  It supports the resources of all well-known mail servers, in particular Mail.ru and Gmail.com.  They certainly will not have problems.  The phone is able to receive any message, but there may be problems viewing it.  Best of all, the device is given the opening of graphic images. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  There is a camera, but it is rather weak - only 0.3 megapixels.  Find it easily through the menu of the device.  The design is intuitive, so understanding it will be easy.  You can save pictures both on the phone and on microSD.  The image will be named either as the owner wishes, or automatically.  It is possible to set some effects. </p><h2>  Player </h2><p>  The list of melodies is sorted by alphabet, genre, number of plays, album and singer.  You can create playlists in which you can include songs sequentially or randomly.  During the melody playback, the screen displays the picture of the album (if any), artist name, year of release.  You can change the sound and scroll through the songs using the special key. </p><h2>  Radio </h2><p>  The phone has support for radio stations.  A list of all kinds of waves can contain no more than 20 pieces.  They are added there after an automatic search and manually.  Moreover, this menu section is brought to the desktop. </p><h2>  Video and photo album </h2><p>  ‚ÄúMy photos‚Äù is the folder in which all the pictures taken on the camera are located.  There is a slide show function, the speed of which can be set by the user (from 3 to 10 seconds).  In order to enlarge the picture, you need to click on it, in this case it will open in full screen.  To return to their usual position, you need to do the same manipulations. </p>

    <p>  Video can be viewed in any position: vertical and horizontal.  It is possible to transfer files by mail, MMS and Bluetooth. </p><h2>  Browser </h2><p>  Browser is a program for the <span>Nokia C2-05</span> phone <span>,</span> which is installed by the supplier.  On this unit is Opera Mini.  It is installed on various equipment of this company.  The phone does not have 3G, so you can not even start talking about fast page loading.  The browser itself has a good amount of settings.  Although loading is very slow, the phone can handle the display of even the heaviest sites with the maximum number of graphic elements.  For those who do not care about the Internet on the phone, this option is quite suitable. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  When talking, the speaker shows itself on the favorable side - the interlocutor is heard well, as evidenced by customer reviews.  The melody is also loud, but if the phone rings in a noisy place, you can still not hear it.  There is a vibration function (its power is average). </p><p>  The most advantageous aspects of all Nokia devices are the company's popularity, good assembly, high-quality materials, and a simple and intuitive interface.  The price of this device is only 3 thousand rubles.  Updating its firmware at home is very easy, so do not contact the service for help when downloading software for Nokia C2-05.  RM 724 is the version that is most suitable for this model. </p><p>  Have a nice shopping! </p>
