    <h2>  Crystal Palace Hotel: Russian traveler reviews </h2><p>  Many modern tourists from their experience were able to see how important it is to carefully consider the issue of choosing a hotel in a particular country.  After all, this significantly affects the quality of rest and the impressions that remain from it.  Of course, if we are not talking about all-inclusive hotels, travelers are unlikely to spend much time in their room.  However, everyone wants to live in comfortable and beautiful apartments and be able to count on quality service.  According to many tourists, reviews of those who have already visited a particular place play an invaluable role in helping with choosing a hotel.  After all, former guests can describe in all colors not only the advantages, but also the possible disadvantages of the hotel.  To save your time, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized comments of our compatriots regarding their stay at Crystal Palace Hotel 4 * (Pattaya).  Somewhat ahead of the events, we note that the vast majority of vacationers were satisfied with their choice and are ready to recommend this hotel to all tourists traveling to Pattaya. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crystal palace hotel 4 pattaya" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1052542.jpg" width="586"></div>

So, tourists say that the rooms here are not very large, but there is enough space for everyone.  Furniture and appliances of good quality, everything is almost new.  A funny feature, some travelers considered the fact that the bathroom from the living room is not separated by a wall and a door, but by frosted glass.  However, a similar design can be found today in many hotels in Thailand.  Also, some of our compatriots warn that not all Crystal Palace Hotel <span>4 * (Pattaya)</span> have balconies <span>.</span>  In addition, experienced travelers are advised upon arrival at the hotel to ask the administrator to place you in apartments whose windows do not face the road.  This will be especially true for those guests who are sensitively sleeping.  However, for most tourists this was not a particular problem, since, according to them, they returned to their rooms in the evening tired and almost instantly fell asleep.  As for the wireless Internet, it is not bad at all apartments.  Good connection quality can only be obtained by connecting to Wi-Fi in the lobby.  This fact did not cause any complaints, because most of the time guests spend outside the hotel, returning to it only to change clothes and sleep. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crystal palace hotel 4 thailand pattaya" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1052543.jpg" width="589"></div>

    <h2>  Cleaning service </h2><p>  This paragraph did not cause any complaints from our compatriots.  On the contrary, according to them, all employees of Hotel Crystal Palace (Pattaya, Thailand) are always friendly, hospitable, welcoming and do their job well.  So, the cleaning of the rooms was carried out very high quality, every day.  Towels and bed linen were also regularly updated.  Every day, the maids put bottles of drinking water in the minibar. </p><p>  The rest of the staff also received extremely positive reviews.  So, according to tourists, you can always contact any employee of the hotel, and he will be happy to answer your question or help solve the problem. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crystal palace hotel pattaya" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1052544.jpg" width="592"></div>

    <h2>  Check in, check out </h2><p>  Judging by the comments of our compatriots, the administrators of the Hotel Crystal Palace are always trying to check in the newly arrived guests in their booked rooms as quickly as possible.  So even if you arrive at the hotel early in the morning, you are unlikely to have to wait for the checkout time to get the keys to the apartment.  This attitude towards guests was appreciated by many travelers. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, it is necessary to vacate the occupied room, in accordance with the rules of the hotel, before noon.  However, if necessary, for an additional fee, you can extend your stay for several hours.  But it is advisable to inform the receptionist in advance about your intention. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Own territory near Crystal Palace Hotel (Pattaya), according to tourists, is very compact.  But there is a pool with a sun terrace.  By the way, the hotel has another swimming pool.  But it is located on the roof of the main building.  There is also a sauna.  Guests enjoyed spending time here.  After all, among other things, it offers a beautiful panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  As for the location of the hotel, some travelers were not very pleased with it.  The fact is that, according to them, getting from the hotel on foot is rather problematic.  But most tourists do not support such criticism, arguing that the same situation is typical for many hotels in Thailand.  That is why motorbikes are very popular with travelers, which can be rented quite inexpensively for the entire vacation period.  In addition, all you can get to the place you are interested in tuk-tuk.  For example, the nearest beach and city center can be reached in about a quarter of an hour.  If you rent a motorbike, you can also go round all the surroundings on your own, discover new beaches and explore nearby sights without resorting to the help of travel agencies. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  As tourists note, the price of accommodation at Crystal Palace Hotel 4 * (Thailand, Pattaya) includes only buffet breakfast.  According to them, the choice of dishes here is so large that they could well replace even lunch.  So, in the morning, hotel guests can eat meat, fish, poultry, soup, cereals, pastries, sausage and cheese slices, fresh fruits and vegetables.  During the day, you can eat both in the hotel restaurant (for an additional fee), and a cafe on the beach or in the city.  As tourists say, almost everywhere they cook very tasty, and the prices do not bite at all. </p>
