The sights of this village are incredibly interesting and deserve to get to know them. </p><h2>  History of Starocherkassk </h2><p>  The first mention of the Cossack town located on the right bank of the Don River is found in a document from 1593.  However, the famous Russian historian <span>Vasily Tatishchev</span> in his main work reports that the ‚Äúcity of Cherkassky‚Äù was founded under Tsar Ivan the Terrible.  Be that as it may, throughout the 17th century this locality played an important role in the defense of the southern borders of Russia mainly from the Turks, and in 1644 the main Don army was transferred there.  Having become the capital of the Cossacks, Cherkassk began to develop rapidly, and its Maidan, which was located next to the wooden Voskresensky Cathedral (not preserved), often became the place where the most important issues determining the fate of the Don lands were decided on the Army circles. </p>

    <p>  In the second half of the 17th century, all of Russia learned about Cherkassk, since it became the place where the famous <span>uprising of Stepan Razin began,</span> and a century later a temple was built there, consecrated in the name of the holy <span>apostles Peter</span> and Paul.  Starocherkassk, the sights of which are recognized as the property of mankind, remained the capital of the Don until the fire of 1744, after which it was never able to recover to its previous level.  As a result, it was decided to establish a new administrative center for the Don Army, which Novocherkassk became in the early 19th century, and Cherkassk got its modern name.  Thus, the city lost its significance and by 1900 became a village. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  ‚ÄúCossack‚Äù Starocherkassk: attractions </h2><p>  As already mentioned, in the past few years, the city‚Äôs authorities have been doing everything possible to turn it into one of the main tourist centers of the Rostov region and attract travelers from other regions of Russia and from abroad.  In addition, since 1973, the Starocherkassk Museum-Reserve has been operating on the territory of the village, the initiator of the creation of which was Nobel Prize winner writer Mikhail Sholokhov.  The reserve covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã180 hectares and is included in the list of UNESCO cultural heritage sites.  On its territory there are many architectural monuments of the 17-19 centuries related to the history of the Don Cossacks, therefore, thousands of tourists visit this tourist site annually.  In particular, the Maidan complex is of great interest, on which are stored the trophies of the Cossacks that they acquired during the siege of Azov ‚Äî Turkish cannons, wickets, the gate of the fortress gates and a huge rocker from city scales. </p>
