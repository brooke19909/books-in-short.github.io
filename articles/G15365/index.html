    <h2>  Sri Lanka Hotels </h2><p>  There are not so many luxury hotels on the island, and they belong to several well-known world-famous chains.  They are usually more expensive than in resort countries such as Vietnam or Thailand.  Tourists recommend choosing at least the Quartet, because then you can hope for decent service and a green, well-groomed territory.  In addition, you should pay particular attention to the location of the hotel relative to the coast, as well as whether the beach is good there.  Meals in them are mainly breakfasts.  But in some hotels there is an all-inclusive system, or half board.  Five and four star hotels are located in the area we are describing near Long Beach.  This is Fortress with a good spa center, as well as Koggala Beach.  A lot of cheap, inexpensive guesthouses.  One of the popular hotels is Long Beach Resort 3 * (Sri Lanka). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Long beach resort 4 sri lanka" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1059158.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Koggala </h2><p>  This resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island is located south of the country's capital, Colombo.  It is known throughout the world for its beautiful beach five kilometers long.  Different people strive here - both lovers of sunbathing seamlessly, and those who want to spend a <span>honeymoon</span> on the ocean, and those who prefer to rush along the waves on the boards.  This area is named after a lake parallel to the ocean and the beach.  It also stretches for five to six kilometers along the sea.  It is known to tourists due to the many colorful exotic birds living here.  Tourists are specially brought here on environmental excursions.  From ancient times the lake was chosen by hermits, therefore there are many hermitages and Buddhist temples and shrines.  Legends say that Buddhism in Sri Lanka began to spread from this place.  It is here, in such a spiritual atmosphere and surrounded by wildlife, the hotel The Long Beach Resort 3 * (Sri Lanka) is located.  The largest city in the vicinity is Galle.  It is located twelve kilometers from the hotel, and you can go there either by tuk-tuk or by bus.  There is an old fortress, a Christian church, which was built by the Danes, and various museums.  The most popular of them is dedicated to the Sinhalese folk art. </p><h2>  Location and Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Long Beach Resort (Sri Lanka) is located right on the seafront.  It is surrounded by a beautiful tropical garden.  The location of the hotel tourists call simply excellent.  Imagine that you are leaving the room, taking a few steps along the emerald grass, then along the sand, and here it is - the ocean!  We can say that the hotel is located between the road and the sea.  The hotel area is small, but extremely neat and well maintained.  An extraordinary view of the ocean opens from the central staircase.  Near the reception there are ponds with carps and small turtles.  Based on the location of the buildings in relation to the sea, the Long Beach Resort can be assigned to a different category of ‚Äústardom‚Äù.  Buildings with Sea View are the Four, and the rest are the Three.  Moreover, the classification of hotels in Sri Lanka itself is very conditional.  The hotel is far from the airport, so the transfer takes about four hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Long beach resort 3 sri lanka" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1059161.jpg" width="600"></div>

Near the Long Beach Resort (Sri Lanka) there are several interesting temples for tourists and a turtle farm.  On both sides of the hotel (about a kilometer) there are villages with shops and souvenir shops.  You can also find Food City minimarkets where you can buy food, wine and everything that is missing at the hotel.  Near the hotel there is a lake that gave a name to the whole region - Koggala.

    <h2>  Accommodation - tourist tips </h2><p>  The hotel Long Beach Resort (Sri Lanka) has two hundred and eight rooms.  They are of different categories - there are suites, improved rooms, standard ones.  Most of the rooms are equipped with TV, small fridge, air conditioning.  There is an electric kettle, which is very convenient to use in the evenings or in the morning, as well as a safe.  But most vacationers are advised to book rooms with sea views.  They usually have the best service and are well located.  These buildings have a natural grass carpet on which there are wooden deck chairs and you can sunbathe.  If the noise of ocean waves does not bother you at night, then you will be very pleased.  And the buildings, from which the sea is not visible, overlook the road.  Therefore, in these rooms the noise of passing vehicles is often heard.  But such rooms are quite tolerable for living. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Every day there is fish and seafood - crabs, squids, shrimps.  Fine cakes, jellies, puddings and nuts in chocolate.  Of the fruits, mainly papaya and pineapple.  There are many restaurants near the hotel and in the neighboring villages.  The guests recommend Seafood - there are very reasonable prices, large portions and deliciously cooked.  Some tourists recommend taking all inclusive.  They write that the lunches and dinners at the hotel are very tasty, and for the money it turns out cheaper than eating ‚Äúon the side‚Äù.  In the evening, live music is played in the restaurant. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The Long Beach Resort 4 * Hotel (Sri Lanka) has a parking and services such as car rental.  Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel.  The reception desk is open day and night.  The hotel has a laundry, dry cleaning, exchange office.  But tourists are advised to go to the bank, because there is a better course.  Staff can deliver newspapers, magazines, and food directly to your room.  There is a special room where luggage is deposited.  It is very convenient for tourists who arrive early or depart late.  There is a special room for games that kids love.  For those who can not imagine relaxation without sports, a tennis court is open.  This hotel has received special accolades from the spa.  It has everything you need for fitness, a sauna, good masseurs and a special wellness center.  No wonder this hotel is also called Long <span>Beach Resort SPA 4 *</span> (Sri Lanka). </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  The staff of the hotel Long Beach Resort 4 * (Sri Lanka) reviews are called attentive and executive.  Tipping does not affect the quality of their work.  Swans from towels are not ‚Äútwisted‚Äù here, but on the bed they spread various beautiful words in English from petals of exotic flowers.  There are special beach fights that keep order and security on the beach.  For newlyweds, the hotel makes a special "compliment" - they bring a cake to the room. </p><h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  The Long Beach Resort 4 * hotel (Sri Lanka) has its own beach, which is a rarity for the island.  But keep in mind that this is the ocean, and surfers and those who want to swim in big waves love the Koggaly coast.  Therefore, if you come with children, you will have to go to neighboring beaches.  Unawatuna is ten minutes away, Mirisa is forty.  But there can be jellyfish on this beach.  If you do not want to leave the hotel, then a little to the side is the natural lagoon, where you can safely splash around.  On the shore near the hotel there are beach fights, which at your request will give you sun loungers and umbrellas.  They are located under palm trees, on a green lawn, around which guards are on duty.  In addition, the beach itself is very beautiful, spacious, as in the picture.  The sun is evil, and we must take care, but in general the temperature is very comfortable.  The hotel has two pools where you can swim not only during the day, but also at night.  One of them is small, and the second is larger.  Reviews about him are positive - swimming there is comfortable and pleasant.  Very clean, tidy, and not very many people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Long beach resort 4 sri lanka koggala" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1059166.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Prices and Shopping </h2><p>  The cost of a hotel room starts from four and a half thousand rubles a day.  If you want to get to the neighboring beaches and in the store, use the "tuk-tuk".  Drivers will not only take you wherever you need, but they will also wait while you go shopping or bask in the sun.  Price - from one hundred rupees.  However, excursions and products will be offered right on the beach.  For example, large shrimp at five hundred rubles per kilogram, and mango at one hundred.  A bottle of water in a convenience store is seventy-five rupees, and a beer in a wine shop is about two hundred and fifty.  If you buy an excursion from a tour operator, then two days of travel will cost you $ 275 per person.  The same trip bought at a bureau near The Long Beach Resort 3 * hotel (Sri Lanka) will cost one hundred sixty five dollars, and you will be shown waterfalls and beautiful views.  When buying fruits, souvenirs, seafood you have to bargain.  If you want to buy Ayurvedic cosmetics, then it is better to do this in a pharmacy - there such products are several times cheaper than in specialized stores. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  As we already wrote, tourists appreciate the Long Beach Resort 4 * hotel (Sri Lanka, Koggala) also because it is an excellent place for independent trips, especially along the southern coast of the island.  Surf lovers are advised to head to Weligama and Mirissa.  For shopping, Matara and Galle are good.  In the last town you can explore the fort, wander around inside, buy souvenirs.  And in Matara there is a bus station, from where there is intercity transport.  There are three types of buses - red, state and two commercial.  There are also express trains.  You can get to them anywhere without any problems.  In Dondra there is such an object of tourist interest as a fifty-meter-high lighthouse - the southernmost point of Lanka.  In Matar - an interesting temple on the island with a bridge.  The hotel also has a tour desk.  It can be used for longer trips - to Kandy, Sigiriya, Yallu Nature Reserve.  But you need to know that usually on such excursions they pick up at night - after all, it takes from three to five hours to go to these beauties.  Therefore, guides try to catch it early so that you get there at that time, while it is not too hot.  Traveling to Kandy and Sigiriya takes two days, with a stop at the hotel with panoramic views. </p><h2>  Long Beach Resort (Sri Lanka): reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who visited this hotel claim that upon arrival home they again want to go back.  They nostalgically recall the excellent location of the hotel, good tasty cuisine, polite staff.  The local population is regarded as friendly.  The hotel has a beautiful and clean beach.  Things and territory are very well guarded.  There are no parties here, so the hotel is most likely not suitable for young people, but for a relaxing holiday at sea.  Nevertheless, travelers who have been here recommend this complex for a visit.  After all, a lot of tourists like the resort island and its hotels - it is not for nothing that they call the Long Beach Resort Spa (Sri Lanka) a piece of paradise. </p>
