  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What are moderate political views?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There is hardly a person in modern society who would stand apart from the political events taking place around him, would not show interest in them and would not express his opinion about them.  Naturally, any assessment is given depending on personal political convictions or views, which mean a person‚Äôs point of view on politics, on economic processes, on how the state, society are organized, and what state laws and state morality are.  In addition, the environment in which a person lives, and the stereotypes that exist in it, play a role. </p><p>  Globally, <span>political views</span> can be divided into extreme and moderate.  Moderate political views are middle, neutral between extreme left or right parties.  For example, moderate liberals.  Since the emergence of such a political party, and this happened back in the 13th century, they did not accept harsh judgments and appeals, rejected radical actions based on violence and oppression.  For the liberals of that time, the rights and freedom of each individual, each individual, the equality of all classes, regardless of origin, justice and order in relation to everyone, and not to a separate handful of society, were valuable.  The moderate views of the liberals did not allow them to call on the people to revolution, but only demanded that citizens be given the opportunity to control the activities of the state machine. </p><p>  With the change of historical eras, liberal positions and beliefs have also changed somewhat.  The liberalism of the 20th ‚Äì 21st centuries considers it necessary to establish equal opportunities for all citizens.  The moderate <span>political views of liberals are</span> still expressed in the assertion of the importance, superiority of private life in comparison with public life and the priority of a citizen over state structures. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Conservatism as another political worldview can also be moderate.  If traditionally conservatives do not recognize any innovations in the field of politics, the existing order, but only a stable state and established forms of private property, then conservatives who have moderate political views are ready to somewhat compromise these principles.  Approaching the liberals, they recognize the need for certain freedoms and emancipation of the individual, freeing her from the oppressive oppression of centuries-old traditions.  But moderate conservatives of the modern type recognize civil rights only strictly within the framework of existing laws.  If any changes are permissible, then also only in accordance with the current order, without destroying or undermining their foundations.  In addition, unlike liberals, conservatives affirm the priority of the state over a citizen and public life over private. </p><p>  The political ideology of communism was formed in the middle of the 11th and 10th centuries and became a kind of alternative direction of both moderately liberal and moderately conservative views.  Communist political views, firstly, can be called radical.  For the Communists, in the first place is the overthrow of the old existing system, if it is based on class inequality, oppression of man by man, social and economic injustice.  Instead of the old order, the Communists propose the creation of a new society, which should be based on <span>social equality.</span>  The main tool for the restructuring of society was to be the <span>social revolution,</span> and the dictatorship of the proletariat should be the form of government. </p><p>  <span>Communist ideology</span> declared the battle of private property, social inequality.  The new society was to be classless, harmoniously combine the interests of the state and the individual, to ensure freedom and comprehensive development for every citizen.  In this regard, moderate political views overlap with communist ones.  However, they oppose them, because <span>liberal ideology</span> supports the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãprivate property, and the preferred forms of government in both directions are different. </p><p>  However, in the modern communist movement there are representatives of a moderate trend defending the right to private property.  In general, at the present stage of development of society, a kind of assimilation of various party programs and political movements is observed.  To solve the problems of public life, people resort to the ideas put forward by various political parties. </p>
