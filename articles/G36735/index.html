    <h2>  Texas Hold'em: Combinations </h2><p>  As in any other poker, here the winner is determined by certain combinations of cards.  Before you start playing <span>Texas Hold'em, combinations</span> must be learned first.  The order of their precedence determines whether you won in a particular hand or not.  In fact, these are the main rules of Texas Hold'em. </p><p>  There are 10 combinations in total, where the kicker is the weakest and the royal flush is the strongest and invincible combination.  The first three of them are very rare and almost invincible.  Combinations with 3-7 are considered strong, but even the formidable "full house" can be defeated in the game.  A pair and a deuce often bring victory, but require care when playing. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  "Royal Flush" - "straight flush" from 10s to ace. </li><li>  "Street Flush" - five cards of the same suit in order. </li><li>  Four of a kind - four cards of the same value. </li><li>  "Fullhouse" - a pair and a set in one combination (five cards in total). </li><li>  "Flash" - five cards of the same suit, regardless of dignity. </li><li>  "Street" - five cards in order, regardless of suit. </li><li>  "Set" (or three) - three cards of the same value. </li><li>  Two pairs - a combination of two pairs of the same value. </li><li>  A pair is two cards of the same value. </li><li>  Kicker is the highest card. </li></ol>

    <p>  Thus, when playing Texas Hold'em, combinations are what determine the superiority or weakness of one player over another in a particular hand. </p><h2>  Beginning of the game </h2><p>  The current Texas Hold'em rules clearly spell out all the stages, from the distribution of cards to the determination of the winner.  The game involves from 2 to 10 people.  Cards are dealt either by the dealer (in casinos and gambling clubs), or by the players themselves in turn. </p><p>  The cards in the game are dealt by the player making the last bet.  That is, the last one at the table in the current distribution, to determine the position of this player there is a special token - the "button", indicating the last player in the distribution.  With each new game he goes to the next player.  Clockwise. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The next two players clockwise place the required bets - the small and the big blind.  They correspond to the size of the minimum bet at the table.  After the cards are dealt, the first bet is made by the player to the left of the big blind. </p><h2>  Circle One </h2><p>  The Texas Hold'em game is a poker game played with two cards.  After the cards are dealt, bidding begins, during which each participant evaluates the strength of his hand.  Depending on the pleasant decision, the player who divides the auction can choose one of four actions: </p><ol><li>  Call is a bet equal to the big blind. </li><li>  “Raise” - an increase in the rate (at least twice). </li><li>  “Pass” - refusal to continue playing and discarding cards. </li><li>  All-in or all-in.  All available chips are put into the bank. </li></ol><p>  Of course, you cannot place bets lower than previously set, unless the number of chips in the bank is less than the bet.  In this case, the player, if he considers it correct, announces "All-in". </p><p>  Each player, in order of priority, does one of four actions until the bets are aligned or all players fold to the pass, losing to the most aggressive participant. </p><p>  Texas Hold'em basic rules say that the right decision at this point is crucial for the entire hand, especially for beginners. </p>

    <h2>  Flop game </h2><p>  After all bets have been placed, the dealer opens the "flop" - the first three cards on the table, which are called the "flop".  Thus, the players remaining in the distribution receive maximum information about their hand.  More often than not, it is at this stage of the Hold'em game that combinations are drawn that are capable of winning the game. </p><p>  "Flop" gives a detailed idea of ​​the prospects in a particular hand.  The player may have a ready-made combination or may collect an incomplete "flash" or "straight" (without one card), which make it possible to play further at moderate opponent bets. </p><p>  If the three cards on the table did not improve the hand, then most likely the player needs to throw cards in the “pass” at the opponent’s bet.  The exception is in the hands of a pair of queens, kings and aces.  Trading on the "flop" is the same as on the "preflop" (first round of trading).  However, the stakes are usually noticeably higher. </p>

    <h2>  Turn and River </h2><p>  Any player who is left in the distribution of the “flop” ambassador without a ready-made combination wants to see that card on the table that will change everything in his favor.  However, only with the correct calculation, such hopes are justified more often than in 50% of distributions. </p><p>  “Turn” raises the question with an edge - to play in the hope of the last card or to declare a “pass” and calculate losses.  The choice depends on the opponent, if his bet is too high, it is better to throw cards. </p><p>  The River is the last fifth card in the game.  After it, another round of bidding is announced, and participants open their cards to find out who gets the bank. </p><p>  "River" translates as a river, which is associated with the end of the path.  A strong combination does not always win on the “river”, very often someone takes the pot, forcing other participants out of the game. </p><p>  When playing Texas No Limit Hold'em, the rules say that the best 5-card hand of seven cards wins.  Five cards laid out on the table, and two pocket.  Despite its apparent simplicity, Texas Hold'em is poker that has 2,869,685 variations of various combinations. </p><h2>  Limit and unlimited poker </h2><p>  Unlimited poker is the most popular type of game in which the maximum bet is limited only by the number of player chips.  In this kind of card game, excitement and cold calculation are best combined, as even luck can turn away from a very strong professional overnight.  When playing Texas Unlimited Hold'em, the rules allow you to go all-in at any time in the game, making even the most powerful opponents nervous.  A completely different thing is a game with limited bets. </p><p>  "Limit Hold'em" implies that a player's maximum "raise" does not exceed one or two big blinds.  The maximum possible bet for the entire distribution is only 24 times the minimum bet, and then only if opponents will constantly raise bets.  "Limit Hold'em" - the game is calm and measured, very often it is chosen in order to start playing on the Internet. </p><h2>  Tournaments in Texas Hold'em </h2><p>  Tournament rules are somewhat different from regular games.  The number of participants also starts with two people, but there is no upper limit.  So, in the largest event of 2014 - the main tournament of the WSOP world series in Las Vegas, 6,680 people sat down at the tables.  And the total prize fund exceeded $ 65 million. </p><p>  There are two main differences from a regular cash game: </p><p>  - Rates increase after a certain passage of time.  As a result, the number of blinds in the game decreases over time, and with each new stage the intensity of the game increases. </p><p>  - The second difference is that the tournament participants can finish it only in two cases: having won or lost all the chips.  In the cash game you can leave the table at any time. </p>

    <p>  Tournament experience on the Internet is very important for beginners, as it allows you to get used to the game with a different number of chips.  Tournaments are thought to be more athletic than cash games. </p><h2>  Sit-and-Go Tournaments </h2><p>  These games are very popular on the Internet, in fact they are a tournament at the same table with the participation of 2-10 people.  At the first stage, players have from 50 to 200 big blinds. </p><p>  In tournaments, 1 to 3 prizes are drawn, and the players are primarily attracted by the dynamism of Sit-and-Go.  The pace is growing, the participants drop out one by one, until only one is left at the end. </p><p>  The advantage of Sit-and-Go is that the player participates in all the main stages of the tournament for 30-50 minutes.  A successful game requires flexibility of thinking and the ability to quickly change tactics, depending on the circumstances. </p>

    <h2>  One on one poker </h2><p>  Head to head or heads-up play has its own rules.  "Texas Hold'em" together - this is, above all, a battle of characters.  He is distinguished by a large percentage of bluff and a very aggressive style of play, waiting, there is no way to win. </p><p>  With this game, ace and king cards with a second card below ten, which are considered controversial in a regular game, gain great strength.  With these hands, players often go all-in. </p><p>  The heads-up game, first of all, allows you to understand the psychology of the opponent, which in itself is of great importance. </p><p>  The opportunity to play Texas Hold'em one-on-one is found in all types of games, and being able to play this poker is extremely important, but not many can boast of mastery here. </p><h2>  The basics of poker strategy: position at the table </h2><p>  The closer the player is to the "loaf", the higher his chances of winning the game.  And vice versa, the position of players in the first positions is dangerous for drawing weak and medium strength hands.  The table is divided into 4 zones depending on the position. </p><p>  The most difficult game at an early position is three people sitting after the blinds.  Common designation UTG 1-3.  Then the blinds come, their position is weaker than that of UTG, but the blinds are the last to place preflop bets, and therefore they can make better decisions. </p><p>  The middle position, three places after UTG, is indicated by the letters MP 1-3.  It is believed that these places are especially profitable with strong starting hands.  The last two hands in the draw are most profitable.  This is the cut-off and dealer, they close the distribution and make a decision when all the players have already said the word.  These hands are best for bluffing. </p><p>  When the number of players decreases, the position of UTG decreases first, then MP.  In the game, the six of us remain in only one early and middle position. </p><h2>  Hand power </h2><p>  It is very important to correctly evaluate with which starting hands to place bets depending on the position.  In an early position, bets can only be made with very strong hands: AA;  KK;  QQ;  JJ;  TT  AK;  AQ. </p><p>  The range of hands on the MP position is supplemented by all cards older than ten, as well as pairs from 77 and above. </p><p>  In the late position, the range increases due to suited cards of all pairs and cards that can form "straights" and "flushes" (suited 56; 67; 78; etc.).  If the bet was made from an early position, you can call it with TT cards;  AK;  AQ.  AA cards;  KK;  QQ;  JJ is the right solution for rez.  With the rest of the hands it is better to go to pass. </p><p>  The suggested recommendations are well suited for beginners, with experience the game strategy is changing, becoming more flexible and technically equipped.  Texas Hold'em is a poker game that offers unlimited development opportunities. </p><h2>  Poker bluff </h2><p>  Texas Hold'em rules don't say anything about bluffing.  However, without this element a successful game is impossible.  Bluffing is good when it succeeds, and can be useful when it is opened. </p><p>  In the first case, it makes a profit, in the second it allows you to deceive the opponent, if after the exposure you change the strategy of the game. </p><p>  However, in the absence of sufficient experience, it is still worthwhile to outline some rules.  Texas Hold'em does not forgive bluffing mistakes. </p><ul><li>  You need to bluff only from late positions, when all the players have already said their word. </li><li>  Never bet against players who have made "raises" or big bets. </li><li>  Do not bluff often.  Only if there is a tangible chance of success, and subject to the first two rules. </li><li>  Never bet a lot, the bet should be less than the pot, but more than half (best 2/3). </li><li>  Do not fight for big banks.  Chips lost on bluffs are very difficult to return. </li></ul><p>  There are several effective bluffing strategies, but all of them are based on experience and a fine knowledge of psychology, and therefore you need to enter this part of the game carefully, without making dangerous decisions in the game. </p><h2>  Poker as a Philosophy </h2><p>  Playing Texas Hold'em, rules, combinations, first steps in the game - this is not even the beginning.  Poker is the matrix of human society, which reflects all the <span>strengths of a person</span> and his weaknesses.  Understanding how to play Hold'em, many believe that they have found the missing link in life, have become more integrated and stronger. </p><p>  The popularity of poker is due to the fact that everyone can find their place in the game, their table, their limit and even their company.  And the rules of "Hold'em" just help to find this way.  The main thing in the game is the ability to correctly find your moment, to see the second weakness of the enemy, or, conversely, to guess the treacherous "flash" for simulated nervousness.  This game is a knowledge of the world, yourself and other people.  Poker is the art of winning, even losing. </p>
