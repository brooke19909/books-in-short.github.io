    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many Russians liked the rest in this hotel complex.  Many chose Aegean Breeze Hotel primarily because of its proximity to the airport, and therefore were pleasantly surprised by its other advantages.  Most tourists gave the rooms the highest rating.  Especially Russians liked the family rooms with their pool, located fifty meters from the sea.  The rooms have comfortable furniture, plumbing works fine: judging by the reviews, practically no one had any problems.  There were, of course, some small issues that the hotel management resolved instantly. </p><p>  As for the work of the staff, our compatriots unanimously rated it excellently.  Room cleaning, carried out daily, was unobtrusive, at a convenient time for residents.  Towels were changed every day, even if tourists did not throw them on the floor. </p><p>  Dining at Aegean Breeze Hotel was enjoyed by almost everyone.  Everything was served in large quantities, so no one left the restaurant hungry, even if he came late.  On the table there was always an abundance of salads of fresh vegetables, every day for lunch served chicken in several varieties, fish.  Twice a week there were seafood - octopus and shrimp.  Pasta, an abundance of other side dishes, yoghurts, dairy products during breakfast - everything was always fresh.  For dinner, fruits were served - oranges, peaches, apples, in the season there were watermelon and melon.  The kids especially liked the ice cream.  Many Russians in their reviews express great respect to the chef. </p><p>  The hotel is positioned by tour operators as a family hotel.  Indeed, all conditions have been created for children, starting with paths along which it was convenient for parents to walk with strollers, and ending with a playground and clean shallow pools.  The hotel has a children's and adult animation, which is organized in a separate place, and therefore does not bother anyone.  And this is another advantage of the Aegean Breeze Hotel.  This item was also rated by many Russians for a high score. </p><p> The hotel has an excellent spa, but some did not like the fact that massages or body wraps are available at an additional cost.  But there is also a clean indoor pool, where everyone can swim.  There is also a good gym with various exercise equipment.  In the evenings, shows are held on site, once every ten days you can participate in a Greek party, dance sirtaki and sing with local singers. </p><p>  The sea, judging by the numerous reviews, is simply excellent.  The coast can be reached in just a minute.  As for the hotel beach itself, some did not like it because of the entrance to the water.  At the very edge of the water you need to walk about a meter on the rocks.  But if you go a little to the left of the hotel, then there is only white sand on the beach.  There is little and almost no wind and waves, which is just perfect for bathing young children.  Umbrellas and sun loungers are issued free of charge on the beach, however, they have to be taken from early morning, which some of our compatriots did not like either. </p><p>  Some Russians wrote their reviews in hot pursuit, having just flown in from vacation.  Many loved the stay.  An unforgettable impression was made both by Rhodes itself and the locals - a cheerful and welcoming people. </p><p>  The territory and the beach of the hotel are slowly being equipped, so that by the next season everything will be on top.  According to the administration, several more cafe-restaurants will be opened, in which it is planned to spend days of kitchens of different countries every week. <br>  Judging by the reviews, the Russians who came to this hotel on last minute packages simply turned a blind eye to some of the shortcomings, so they were satisfied with the ‚Äúhumane‚Äù price in the hotel complex.  In a word, there are only a few who were dissatisfied with their vacation, but there are a lot of our compatriots who intend to come here again.  Moreover, most Russians recommend this hotel as very good. </p>
