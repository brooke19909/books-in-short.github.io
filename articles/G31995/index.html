Someone does not see it without the sea and a beach tan, for some it is prettier than the forest air, others are attracted by active tourism, camping in the tent and songs by the fire.  But if a person wants to combine legal leave with a solution to health problems, very often he chooses salt lakes as his vacation spot.  They help with a variety of diseases, although, of course, not with all and, of course, can not be considered a panacea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="salt lakes" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/468519.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The essence of the concept </h2><p>  What is meant by the concept of "salt lakes"?  To be precise in terms, it would be more correct to call them mineral.  Naturally, sodium chloride, the most famous salt (table), is present in large numbers in such lakes, but there are many other compounds there.  Salt lake water begins to be considered if its mineralization is already in one thousandth.  This content is called one ppm.  In most cases, salt lakes are located in arid areas and do not have drains.  It is their absence that determines the high degree of mineralization. </p><h2>  The biggest </h2><p>  The most famous salt lakes on the planet are the Caspian, Dead and <span>Aral Seas, the Great</span> Salt, Elton and Baskunchak.  There are seven of them.  The first in size is really rather the sea, although by geographic characteristics it still refers to the lakes.  Healing mud, high-quality sandy beaches and <span>mineral springs</span> could provide him with a huge influx of vacationers, but because of the tense political relations between the states that own the coast, tourism is not very active here. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Aral is now considered a former lake.  The pumping of water from the rivers feeding it has led to such a severe shallowing that the Aral Sea nowadays is separate salt lakes with the names Southern and Northern Aral.  It is clear that we are no longer talking about any rest and useful properties of water. </p><p>  Another thing is the Dead Sea.  It is actively used both for recreation and for health improvement, like any other, smaller salt lake.  Photos from the coasts of the <span>Dead Sea</span> attract the interest of so many tourists.  And the infrastructure for vacationers is beyond praise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mud of a salt lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/468518.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The largest in the Western Hemisphere of the Earth is the Great Salt Lake.  It is located in the United States, in a fairly deserted area.  Interest in terms of recreation is not enough;  but from the point of view of industry it is very valuable: from here in large quantities are table salt and Glauber's salt. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Elton (Volgograd) and Baskunchak (Astrakhan) are Russian salt lakes.  Both that, and another are very popular resorts known not only throughout the country, but also in foreign countries. </p><h2>  What else is rich in Russia </h2><p>  Many areas of the country boast that salt lakes are located on their territory.  Among them are Kurgan, where there are Medvezhye and Gorky lakes, Orenburg with Lake Razval, Stavropol Territory and <span>Lake Tambukan,</span> Altai with Big Yarovoy Lake located on its territory.  And the Volgograd region boasts not only Elton, but also Bulukhta and Botkul.  And people from all over the country come to the mud of the salt <span>lake Tus</span> in Khakassia.  Do not disdain them and foreign tourists.  In Tuva, Dus-Khol, known for its healing properties, is popular, and the Omsk region has Ulzhay and Ebeyta within its borders. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water of salt lakes" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/468521.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ukrainian </h2><p>  The neighboring country also has healing waters and mud.  These are the salt <span>lakes of Ukraine.</span>  The most famous and popular place is Solotvino, which is located in the Carpathians.  Its salt lakes are warm, the salt content in them reaches 200 ppm, almost like in the Dead Sea.  In addition to the standard range of effects (skin and motor problems), the healing properties of the salt lake in Solotvino also apply to the treatment of respiratory diseases and allergies. </p><p>  Well-known and Slavic salt lakes.  There are three of them: Turnip, Weiss and Blind.  They are interesting as a natural monument, for its healing qualities and unique location - so far from the seas mineral lakes are quite rare.  An added bonus is the pine forests surrounding the salt lakes.  Coniferous odors combined with the miraculous effects of mud and water accelerate treatment and make it more pleasant.  Bottom silt is also extracted here, which is transported to many mud clinics and is used in Slavic resorts in the winter, when swimming is not available. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="healing properties of a salt lake" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/468516.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Water in water </h2><p>  A rare natural phenomenon attracts tourists to the Gulf of Mexico.  Underwater salt lakes are found, of course, in other ocean waters (for example, in the Arctic), but in the bay they are most accessible for observation.  Different streams carry water with different degrees of salinity, and therefore the streams have different densities and do not mix with each other.  The healing properties of the salt lake under water have not been noted, but as an object of observation it is very interesting. </p><h2>  Than attractive </h2><p>  Of course, first of all, with its beneficial effect on the body!  All salt lakes have different compositions of water and bottom mud, so they also help with various diseases.  The most widely known benefits of the salt lake, inherent in almost all such reservoirs - the treatment of psoriasis and other skin diseases.  Rheumatological problems and dysfunctions of the musculoskeletal system are also successfully treated in most of these lakes.  However, the same Baskunchak helps those who have lung problems.  And Tus copes with neurological and gynecological diseases and helps to establish impaired metabolism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the benefits of a salt lake" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/468522.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Not only good </h2><p>  However, the water of salt lakes can not only cure, but also cause significant harm.  Those who resort to her help must remember that she is a medicine, and in large doses, the medicine becomes poison.  And the use of any drug must be approved by a doctor.  So, cores can resort to this type of treatment only under vigilant medical supervision: the water of salt lakes and their mud strongly affect the heart.  Even healthy people are advised to swim in them no longer than half an hour.  In addition, the salt in such waters is so concentrated that even microbes and bacteria cannot survive in them.  It is not difficult to conclude that it is dangerous to take such a solution seriously inside - just a sip of it can lead to a serious burn of the larynx and esophagus, and possibly the insides.  The disadvantage of most resorts based on salt lakes is that there is practically no vegetation around the reservoirs, and therefore it is easy to get heat or sunstroke. </p><p>  However, if you follow the recommendations of doctors and do not strive to get an instant result, treatment in the waters and muds of salt lakes will be not only effective, but also very pleasant.  The main thing is to choose the resort that is designed to treat your disease. </p>
