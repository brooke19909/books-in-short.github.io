    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  Before you connect the tariff ‚ÄúPink‚Äù (‚ÄúTele2‚Äù), you‚Äôll have to understand what we‚Äôll be dealing with.  Perhaps this proposal will not be as profitable as it seems at first glance.  And then it will be possible not to think about the issue of connection at all. </p><p>  What can offer us the tariff "Pink" ("Tele2")?  Syktyvkar or any other city is not so important.  The main thing is that inside your home region you can talk with other subscribers of this mobile operator absolutely free.  True, only 30 minutes a day.  After that, the per-minute billing will start - 50 kopecks per minute.  For other operators, calls require 1 ruble 10 kopecks.  In principle, everything is fine so far. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But with other regions the situation is a little more complicated.  So, for example, if you call "Tele2" (Omsk, tariff "Pink") from Moscow, then you will immediately pay 2 rubles per minute.  And when calling home numbers and other operators in Russia - 9 and 5 rubles, respectively. </p><p>  SMS within your region will cost 1.1 rubles.  In Russia - 2.5 rubles.  With MMS a little easier - any message will cost only 5 rubles.  Here is such an interesting and profitable tariff "Pink" ("Tele2").  Komi or any other locality - it doesn‚Äôt matter at all where you connect to this plan.  The main thing is that it helps you to always be in touch.  But now it's worth talking about connection methods.  There are quite a few of them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff pink tele2 syktyvkar" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/879445.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Office purchase </h2><p>  The first scenario is considered "ancient."  For him you will need a mobile phone, as well as a passport.  After all, we are talking about buying a new SIM card with an already connected tariff plan. </p><p>  Go to the nearest mobile office of Tele2 operator, and then inform the employee about your intentions.  Say that you would like to connect your ‚ÄúPink‚Äù tariff.  Next, they will need to tell you the details of the selected plan, and also ask if you really want to connect.  In truth, sometimes they don‚Äôt. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next, pass your passport to an office worker.  He will quickly issue a new SIM card for you and return the contract for signature.  Save it.  In case of problems with the number, you can always get help thanks to this "paper".  That's all the problems are solved.  Now you have the "Pink" ("Tele2") tariff activated.  It remains to insert the SIM card into the phone and use it. </p><p>  To be honest, today there are other options for the development of events.  You can connect a new tariff plan in other ways.  More modern and versatile.  Which ones?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff pink tele2 komi" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/879446.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  We call the operator </h2><p>  The second scenario is making a call to your mobile operator.  This method is suitable when you have already used Tele2.  So to speak, this is a kind of tariff plan change on your number. </p><p>  Dial 611 from your mobile phone, and then press the "dialer" key.  Wait a bit - the operator will answer you.  He will have to say that you wanted to start using the tariff "Pink" ("Tele2").  Connect it with this method is not difficult.  In response to your desire, the operator will have to tell you the details of the tariff plan, and then ask for your passport data.  This will make sure that you are the true owner of the number. </p><p>  After this process has been completed, just wait a while.  You should receive an SMS alert informing you that the tariff plan change was successful.  In addition, combinations will be indicated there to help you find out all the nuances of your chosen tariff.  That's all - no problem. </p><p>  This method has ceased (since recently) to be especially popular.  This is all because now instead of living operators, customers often talk with an answering machine.  And this greatly inhibits the process of obtaining the necessary information.  Thus, you will have to look for other ways to help get the tariff "Pink" ("Tele2").  Do they have any? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tele2 omsk tariff pink" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/879447.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Special combinations </h2><p>  Yes, of course.  For example, now all customers of mobile operators can use special commands to independently connect and disconnect new features.  They are called USSD commands. </p><p>  In order to change the tariff plan to ‚ÄúPink‚Äù just dial * 155 * 0 # from your mobile phone, and then press the subscriber‚Äôs call button.  You will be sent a request.  As soon as it is processed, you will receive an SMS notification about the successful transition to a new tariff plan. </p><p>  It is this method that has been used by most customers.  True, progress does not stand still.  You can take some other approaches.  For example, resort to the help of the Internet.  How to do it?  Let's find out about it. </p><h2>  Internet to help </h2><p>  The tariff "Pink" ("Tele2") can be connected using the official website of the mobile operator.  Visit him, and then go through authorization.  To do this, click on "My Account" in the upper right corner of the screen.  Now dial your mobile phone and password that you specified during registration.  Or register for the first time. </p><p>  In the end, you will be taken to the "My Account".  There you should click on "Services", after - "Rates".  Find the one you need there, and then click on it.  Now you will see a small menu with details of the cellular plan, as well as some possible actions.  Select "Connect" and confirm your actions.  In some cases, you have to dial the number that we connect.  That's all - we are waiting for alerts and enjoy the results. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff pink tele2 connect" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/879448.jpg"></div>
