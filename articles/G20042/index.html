    <h2>  How to make the application "Salute" </h2><p>  Any work performed in this technique involves gluing on the basis of elements made in advance.  As a blank for decoration, they often use a flat surface, for example, a sheet of cardboard.  In addition, a postcard, packaging (box), as well as a decorative object in the form of a vase, are suitable.  The application "Salute" can be made of paper, thread, plasticine, fabric, cereals, grains, beads, buttons.  Paper is the simplest material that even small children can work with. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="salute applique" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/883190.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <h2>  Making from round billets </h2><p>  The application "Victory Salute" can be made of large parts created according to one pattern from different colors of design paper.  This is one of the easiest ways. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="applique victory salute" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/883206.jpg" width="600"></div>  To make such an ornament for a postcard, a wall panel or other decor, go through the following steps:

Metallized and pearly thick paper or cardboard will look great. </li><li>  Prepare a template (or several) from a regular sheet.  Make a round workpiece of the desired diameter.  Choose any size.  It can be from 2-3 cm for postcards to 10 cm for wall panels. </li><li>  One pattern cut out several circles from prepared sheets of paper.  On each, make cuts from the edge to the center, you can even decorate the outer circle in the form of waves or cloves. </li><li>  Glue the cut parts to the base, preferably dark.  Arrange the elements so that the small circles are at the bottom, and the large ones are at the top or on the sides. <br>  This will make it possible to create a more realistic picture by creating the illusion of perspective. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, doing such a job is easy.  The child will cope with the task independently, if he already knows how to handle scissors. </p><h2>  We make a salute from small circles and threads </h2><p>  This option is simple, since it does not require the use of scissors. </p>

    <p>  To make parts you need a hole punch.  An ordinary clerical one, which performs two round holes, will do.  Even more impressive is the work done using elements made using a curly stamp.  Such holes are used in scrapbooking and other types of decorative activities.  The application "Salute to May 9" can be made of many stars, and for a birthday or other holiday - from flowers or hearts.  The decoration looks even more spectacular if two hole punchers were used, which make blanks of different sizes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This decor is performed in the following sequence: </p><ol><li>  Make a lot of blanks from multi-colored paper.  If you use a regular hole punch, then you get something like confetti. </li><li>  Draw based on an approximate arrangement of parts. </li><li>  Apply glue to the surface of a postcard, panel or other object.  Create a composition by applying colored blanks.  Add glue if necessary. </li><li>  After the ‚Äúcaps‚Äù of the fireworks are formed, cut the threads of the corresponding colors and stick them in the form of bunches diverging from the bottom up. </li></ol><p>  The composition will turn out spectacular.  It can be supplemented with sparkles, details painted with paints. </p><h2>  Application "Salute" in kindergarten from crumpled paper </h2><p>  The easiest option that even kids can do is without scissors and hole punching.  You will need thin colored paper, which the child can tear into small pieces independently.  If the baby still does not know how to handle glue, you can use plasticine.  Such work will turn out beautiful, in addition, the process of creating jewelry will be useful.  Such actions develop fine motor skills of the fingers, which is very important for the baby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="applique salute in kindergarten" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/883207.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <p>  Such a lesson is easy to conduct at home alone with a child or in an organized group environment, timed to coincide with a holiday, such as the New Year, which can be easily told even to small children at an affordable level. </p><h2>  Salute of small stars </h2><p>  It is this form of the element that will be more natural and at the same time decorative.  The most spectacular application "Festive Salute" will turn out if you use hole punch with a clich√© of the appropriate form (as mentioned above).  However, if there is no opportunity to purchase this tool, you can cut parts with scissors.  It is worth considering that the smaller you want to get blanks, the less you will need a tool to create them.  The easiest way is to use a plastic stencil so as not to draw a contour by hand.  If you have a template that you can circle around the outer edge, this will greatly facilitate the work.  It will be enough just to cut out the part along the contour without first drawing the contour with a pencil.  It is not difficult to cut such a blank yourself, you just need a very thick cardboard or other suitable material. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="applique fireworks for may 9" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/883195.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <p>  To quickly cut out a lot of small details with scissors, it is worth using a method such as bending the sheet the right number of times.  To do this, you can cut the strip and fold it with an accordion so that your template fits on the resulting plane.  Cutting its contour once, you get several finished parts at once.  This will significantly reduce the time required for the preliminary work.  All other actions are performed in the same way as in the case of making stars with a hole punch. </p><h2>  Cut large blanks in the form of stars </h2><p>  Everything that was said in the previous section is also suitable for creating large figures.  Only they will need much less. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper salute applique" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/883189.jpg" width="600"></div>  Here the work will be structured as follows:

Quick and easy. </p><h2>  Work in the technique of quilling </h2><p>  This is the most difficult option presented, but the result will be very effective.  This method is suitable for older children, as it will require not only more perseverance, patience, but also certain finger skills. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="applique fireworks" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/883197.jpg" width="500"></div>  The sequence of actions will be as follows:

      <p></p>
    <ol><li>  Whatever elements you choose to create a salute (rings, curls, triangles, etc.), you will need to cut many strips of colored paper about 5 mm wide.  You can buy ready-made ones, but it will be difficult to choose the colors appropriate to the idea.  Often strips are sold in sets where a certain amount of one or another shade is present.  It‚Äôs easier to make yourself out of the paper you have chosen.  Use scissors, but an office cutter is best suited, which, for example, is used to make business cards at home or in small print shops. </li><li>  Take a toothpick, knitting needle, skewer or special <span>quilling tool</span> and wind the strip onto the stick.  Give the parts the desired shape and glue the parts in the right places. </li><li>  When the necessary number of parts is done, proceed with the arrangement and gluing them to the base. </li><li>  The finished composition can be supplemented with sparkles, lines, finished with a <span>gel pen</span> or brush, although usually such works are completely completed, requiring no additions. </li></ol><p>  So, you have learned how the Salute applique is made of paper.  Choose the appropriate option and create spectacular gifts while engaging in a fun creative process with your children. </p>
