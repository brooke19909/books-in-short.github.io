Occupied area is approximately 130 square meters.  kilometers, the population is about 500 people, which increases during the holiday season.  The nearest town, Genichesk, is 12 kilometers away.

    <h2>  Scythe Arabat Spit </h2><p>  The spit, starting in the south from the Ak-Monai Isthmus, ends with the Strait of Genic, separating it from the mainland.  The length is about 150 kilometers, and the width is from 300 meters to 8 kilometers.  During spring tides, a huge amount of seawater, rich in minerals used in medicine and cosmetics, enters <span>Lake Sivash</span> .  The lake has a huge factory for the extraction of sea salt by evaporation.  At present, a spa and wellness vacation is organized on the spit, and a large number of boarding houses and recreation centers have been built around the settlements. </p><h2>  Genic Hill: how to get there? </h2><p>  The most convenient and fastest option to get to the place of rest is a personal car or fixed-route taxis that come from different cities.  If this is not possible, the task is complicated, in which case it is necessary to get to the Novoalekseevka station by the Crimean train.  From the station there are regular buses to Genichesk.  You can hire a taxi, but it will cost more.  A bus stop is located on the back of the train station.  To get there, you must cross the railway track and walk a hundred meters.  Buses run at intervals of thirty to forty minutes, until seven in the evening.  You can also take the train to Genichesk.  In any case, there is a need from the city to look for passing trucks or taxis to get directly to the spit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Genic Hill: how to get there?" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/2028902.jpg" width="567"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews about the rest on the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov </h2><p>  Rest in Genicheskaya Gorka is well suited for families with children.  This shallow coastline is riddled with numerous shallows, where the water warms up to a comfortable temperature, which is necessary for bathing babies.  According to the guests of the resort, the developed infrastructure allows you to relax, play sports and heal.  The only inconvenience of the resort is the poor organization of the transfer from the Novoalekseevka railway station. </p><p>  The Arabat Spit is not only a beach-entertaining, but also a health resort.  Lake Sivash supplies unique mineral compounds and mud.  They allow you to treat people with problems of the musculoskeletal system and diseases of the cardiovascular system.  Air saturated with iodine compounds is excellent for the prevention and treatment of pulmonary diseases. </p>
