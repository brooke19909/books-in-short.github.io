Along the coastline of 2 km, among the pines, rose bushes, bougainvilleas and other original plants, many bungalows were built, decorated with carved wooden ornaments of incredible beauty.  The hotel complex was designed by the famous architect Nail Chakirkhan in Turkey.  According to his plan, all the buildings on the territory of the hotel should have been harmoniously woven into the surrounding nature and, having united, become a single whole. </p><p>  His idea was a success, and today tourists, having crossed the threshold <span>of Club Hotel</span> Letoonia, are experiencing a real aesthetic shock from the beauty they have seen.  Of course, the service at the hotel corresponds to its 5 stars, but for tourists who have chosen this place, in the first place is its location and the opportunity to feel divorced from the whole world.  Letoonia Club Hotel is the place you wish to return to again and again.  After all, not everyone manages to visit such a hotel where you feel an incredible proximity to pristine nature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Hotel guests write that when they were offered to relax on a private peninsula, they could not imagine how amazing and incredible their stay here would be.  What impressed them most was that, living in conditions of increased comfort, they nevertheless feel closeness to the natural, natural, feel like robinsons.  Waterfalls, fishing opportunities, picnics.  Of course, not everyone appreciates this.  There are minor reviews, and they mainly belong to people for whom noisy entertainment in clubs and discos comes first.  The hotel is especially popular with families with children. </p>
