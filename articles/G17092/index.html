    <h2>  Why apply for a mortgage </h2><p>  In cases where state aid is used to build housing, acquire square meters, pay for educational services or form the funded part of the pension, it is impossible to receive money until the child is three years old.  If the maternity capital goes to pay off the mortgage, you do not need to wait until the decree expires.  That is why the registration of a home loan with the right to early repayment becomes for parents the main means of gaining access to subsidies. </p>

    <h2>  Pay attention to loan repayment terms </h2><p>  Commercial banks, as a rule, are not interested in having clients repay the loan ahead of time.  Therefore, many potential borrowers are worried about whether it is possible to repay a mortgage loan at Sberbank ahead of schedule. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When obtaining a loan, it is important to read and analyze the loan documentation line by line, not succumbing to the provocation of employees who want to rush you.  The terms of <span>loan repayment</span> are usually devoted to a whole section of the contract.  Pay attention to the payment schedule - it can be taken out in a separate application.  Are the dates indicated in it convenient for you?  Is the monthly payment amount too large?  The terms of prepayment are described in detail, although they can be found in footnotes or hidden in an abundance of text in small print. </p>

    <h2>  Tricks of Lenders </h2><p>  Many banks try to limit the right of customers to repay a loan in whole or in part earlier than the terms specified in the contract.  For this, additional conditions are often made to the loan documentation.  For example, such: </p><ol><li>  Early repayment is allowed no earlier than after a long time period, which may be 6 months or more. </li><li>  Set a minimum threshold for the amount of payment ahead of time.  For example, a borrower is prohibited from sending less than 10 thousand rubles in repayment.  Accordingly, the bonus that was suddenly received at work, if it is not too large, cannot be paid to reduce debt. </li><li>  The documentation may establish a fee for early repayment of the loan.  As a rule, its size discourages the desire to pay off obligations ahead of time. </li><li>  Much less often in loan documentation there is an enslaving condition obliging you to pay interest and fees in full for a specified period of time (for example, a month or a quarter), despite the fact that you are repaying a loan ahead of schedule. </li></ol>

No commission is required.  It is permissible to deposit money even the next day after receiving a loan.

It is important only to inform the bank in writing no later than two business days of what date and what amount you want to return ahead of schedule.  Based on this notification, responsible employees will carry out the redemption transaction.  Otherwise, the funds you deposit are deposited in a special account and will be debited to the account for repayment of the loan debt on a monthly basis in accordance with the payment schedule. </p>

The operation to repay loan obligations will take place on the same day if the office in which the loan was issued works.  If the branch is closed on Saturday, repayment of the mortgage will be carried out on the next weekday.  No credit operations are performed on Sunday. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Are there interest-free housing loans? </h2><p>  Some customers who are familiar with the principles of credit cards work wonder if it is possible to repay a mortgage in Sberbank ahead of schedule without interest.  Indeed, according to ‚Äúplastic‚Äù, a grace period is almost always established, which can be up to 50-60 days.  When repaying the loan in full before the expiration of the specified period, interest is not paid.  However, the grace period is not set for the mortgage.  Even if you repaid the loan the next day, you will have to pay interest for the day of using credit money. </p><h2>  Applying for a subsidy </h2><p>  The <span>Pension Fund of the Russian Federation</span> also often receives requests whether it is possible to early repay a mortgage in Sberbank using maternity capital. </p><p>  In 2016, the size of the parent certificate is still 453,026 rubles. </p><p>  To take advantage of the subsidy, parents of two or more children will need to collect a package of documents established by law: </p><p>  - identification; </p><p>  - SNILS; </p><p>  - TIN; </p><p>  - certificate of marriage (divorce); </p><p>  - a certificate from the housing department about the composition of the family; </p><p>  - birth certificates of all children; </p><p>  - generic certificate; </p><p>  - notarial obligation of parents to allocate a share in housing to children. </p>

    <h2>  To start all over from scratch? </h2><p>  Parents who plan to receive maternity capital in the near future are often interested in whether it is possible to repay a loan ahead of schedule in Sberbank and take a new one.  According to the law, any private person can conclude several <span>loan agreements</span> at the same time <span>.</span>  From this point of view, in order to get a new loan, it is not necessary to repay an existing one. </p><p>  But lending services of the bank, analyzing the possibility of providing a loan, calculate your solvency.  It is determined on the basis of income statements.  Existing obligations are also taken into account.  The level of debt burden on a person should be such that he can pay debts on time, while providing food for himself and non-working family members.  There are also some loan products, which must be covered by pledges or sureties. </p><p>  Having paid the mortgage ahead of schedule, you can again offer the housing free from encumbrance to the bank as security for new loans.  Secured by financial institutions, loans are much easier and more willing. </p><p>  However, if your loan is mortgage, do not rush to repay it ahead of schedule if you assume that funds may soon be needed again.  Housing loans are usually the cheapest to maintain, and the financing terms for them are the longest.  Mortgage interest rate is from 11% per annum.  On consumer loans, it increases to a level of 14.9 to 21.9% per annum.  For housing loans, the maximum financing term is 30 years, for consumer loans - only 5 years.  Mortgage loan repayment is possible only upon the purchase of a new property. </p>

Indeed, to carry out this operation, it is necessary to come to the bank office, in which the <span>housing loan was</span> issued <span>,</span> to sign the notice. </p><p>  In this regard, for parents preparing to move, the question of whether it is possible to repay a loan ahead of schedule by proxy early becomes relevant.  After all, it depends on whether it will be possible to instruct any of the relatives or friends to return the housing loan. </p><h2>  Why go to a notary </h2><p>  In order to deposit money into a special account designed to accumulate funds, a power of attorney is not needed.  However, in order for the operation to repay the loan ahead of schedule, a notice signed by the borrower or another person authorized to act on his behalf is required. </p><p>  The right to represent the interests of the client in the bank is certified by a <span>notarized power of attorney.</span>  Its text must contain phrases that mean that your friend or relative is allowed to repay the loan obligations ahead of schedule. </p><h2>  "Card games" </h2><p>  Some customers are also interested in the question of whether there are programs for issuing mortgages for ‚Äúplastic‚Äù and whether it is possible to repay a loan in advance with Sberbank by credit card.  Housing loans may in some cases be provided in non-cash form.  Including, by agreement with the bank, they are issued on plastic cards. </p><p>  However, the mortgage is not credited to credit cards.  Plastic cards with large loan limits are intended solely for the payment of current consumer spending.  Maturities on them are very short, all settlements on obligations occur within one year.  If you, however, have spent a certain amount on your credit card to pay for the cost of housing, you will have to return it on a consumer credit basis. </p>
