Who are these people?  These are top class warriors!  So they were called in <span>medieval Europe.</span>  Equestrian chivalry is a kind of aristocracy on the battlefield.  Moreover, this is a kind of military caste.  More about this in our article. </p><p>  <strong>How did the first knights appear?</strong> </p><p>  Who are these warriors, and how did they appear in the history of mankind?  The answers to these questions are rooted in medieval England.  It was there that in 971 the <span>first knightly</span> title appeared.  Since then, much has been said and written about these riders, the definition of which is ‚Äúknights‚Äù. </p><p>  <strong>Who are the knights of the Middle Ages?</strong> </p><p>  It is curious that for some people <span>of the Middle Ages,</span> knights were the most ordinary greedy robbers, horse thieves, rapists and oppressors of the common mortal people, while for others they were the real embodiment of nobility, valor and, of course, gallantry towards the ladies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knights who are" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13151/286374.jpg" width="394"></div>

    <p>  Today it is generally accepted that a knight is a valiant warrior in shining armor, a courageous soldier.  But what a sin to conceal, among <span>these warriors there</span> really were a variety of people - the last villains, and the inveterate robbers, and famous poets, and religious fanatics.  And all of them are knights! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Who are the knights in terms of lifestyle?</strong> </p><p>  Not surprisingly, the life of these warriors was wholly and completely connected with military campaigns and battles.  Each of them was none other than a true hero.  The knight was considered one of the most significant figures in the <span>Middle Ages.</span>  Such a high <span>social position</span> is explained by the fact that in the hands of the supreme rulers (kings, clergy) not as much power was concentrated as they wanted.  After all, then this very power belonged to those who fought better than others!  In addition, those who had horses, heavy weapons and other necessary ammunition were given significant privileges, and, most importantly, they knew how to use it wisely! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hero knight" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13151/286376.jpg" width="390"></div>

    <p>  According to cultural tradition, a knight in armor (or Chevalier, Reitar, and Knight) is a "horseman."  This is how this word is translated into any language of the world.  The horseman, who was chained in steel armor, professionally owned a spear and a sword.  In other words, this is a real fearless warrior who gave rise to such an independent culture as chivalry! </p><p>  <strong>Modern "chivalry" is the military valor and courage of the Middle Ages!</strong> </p><p>  Chivalry, as the cultural tradition of that era, left a very deep trace in human memory.  It has become synonymous with military courage and valor.  It is no coincidence that today, speaking of a lofty and gentlemanly attitude towards the opposite sex, we relate this precisely to the era of chivalry!  That is why today the most brave daredevil, ready to stand up for the weak, defend the honor of a woman or fight for the truth, is perceived by the public consciousness as a real knight! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knight in armor" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13151/286375.jpg" width="441"></div>

    <p>  <strong>For statistics</strong> </p><p>  Here are some numbers.  There were not so many knights as a combat unit.  For example, at the end of the 13th century in England there were about 3 thousand of these brave warriors.  At the same time, from dozens to several hundred warriors in armor usually took part in battles.  And only in the most ambitious and major battles were knights in the thousands. </p>
