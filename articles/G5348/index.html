    <p>  Where is the Vyshnevolotsk reservoir located?  What are its attractions and features?  Is it possible to relax here with the whole family and go fishing well?  If you are interested in learning the answers to these questions, then this article is for you! </p><h2>  The location of the pond </h2><p>  A reservoir is an artificially constructed reservoir formed in river valleys due to the water supply system for saving water for the purpose of its further use in the national economy. </p><p>  The Tver region adjoins the western border of the Russian Federation, the main waterway of which is considered to be the Volga ‚Äî one of the largest rivers on Earth and the longest in Europe.  The region is also famous for its hydrographic indicators.  Many rivers, lakes and reservoirs are distributed over its territory.  One of such reservoirs - Vyshnevolotskoye, is located in the Vyshnevolotsk region, in the valleys of <span>the Tsna</span> and Shlini <span>rivers</span> .  Vyshnevolotsky district, located on the borders of the rivers of the Baltic and Caspian basins, has long been famous for its water resources and open spaces.  One of its most beautiful and enchanting places is the Vyshnevolotsk reservoir.  How to get to this picturesque magnificent region? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the sights </h2><p>  119 km north-west of Tver is the small town of Vyshny Volochek, with a population of forty-eight thousand people and a well-developed infrastructure.  A little west of this city is the reservoir of interest to us. </p><p>  Getting to it is very easy and simple.  Since Vyshny Volochek is located on 297 km of the Federal Road ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù (Moscow-St. Petersburg highway), the roads there are handy and convenient.  In addition, the town has a railway station, which also makes it easier for everyone to visit the famous reservoir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyshnevolotsk reservoir fishing" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1889059.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  You can get to the reservoir by your own transport or by city.  If it is more convenient for you to travel in the second way, then you can take the buses with license plates: 3, 5.4, 15, 6, whose routes pass near many places of the reservoir. </p><p>  The settlements of the Vyshnevolotsk reservoir of the Tver region are not limited to the Vyshny Volochyok.  Large and small villages, such as the village of Krasnomaysky, the village of Kasharovo, the villages of Rvenitsa, Yermakoko, Yazvikha, Nikiforovo and others, are founded on the banks of the reservoir.  As you can see, the reservoir is not in a wild or extremely deserted place, so if you get lost, the locals will happily show you the way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Important key parameters </h2><p>  The reservoir is one of the main reservoirs of the Tver region.  In length, it reaches twelve kilometers, and in width - nine, so the area occupied by the water basin is quite impressive and respectable - one hundred and eight square kilometers. </p><p>  What are the depths of the Vyshnevolotsk reservoir?  The average depth of the reservoir is almost 3 m, although sometimes it can reach a maximum mark of 7 m.It is interesting that the total volume of the reservoir‚Äôs water is three hundred twenty two million cubic meters, while the useful volume is two hundred forty-two million cubic meters. </p><p>  Mentioning the official size and parameters of the reservoir, it should be mentioned its coastal extent (51 km), altitude (163.5 m), and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãflooded land (31 km square). </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the Vyshnevolotsk reservoir is the sixth in the Tver region in terms of completeness and utility of the volume. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  In addition, this pond has an interesting and rich history dating back to the time of Peter I. </p><p>  The history of the Vyshnevolotsk reservoir is truly fascinating.  It began to form in the distant XVIII century in accordance with the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãPeter the Great to maintain the navigable level of all of Russia.  The emperor‚Äôs idea was carried out by the famous hydraulic engineer and shipbuilder, a merchant by profession, Mikhail Ivanovich Serdyukov, known for his significant contribution to the development of the entire Vyshnevolodsk water system. </p><h2>  And it all started like this </h2><p>  In the early 1700s, Mikhail Ivanovich rented spacious lands around the Vyshny Volochyok for the construction of a plant.  For the best functioning of the enterprise, he needed to build a canal, which, due to the inexperience and youth of the owner, was poorly constructed and worked intermittently.  When, after a few years, the floodgate system was damaged in the spring flood, the already experienced and wise merchant wanted to personally control its repair.  Since locks were an important hydraulic structure for moving a ship from one water basin to another, Serdyukov decided to personally contact the emperor with concrete proposals for fixing them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyshnevolotsk reservoir history of creation" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1889063.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Vyshnevolotsky Canal was an important strategic object for supplying St. Petersburg with food and other goods from central lands.  Therefore, Peter the Great called the merchant to himself, got acquainted with his ideas and granted him the official right to engage in Vyshnevolotsky shipping. </p><p>  Serdyukov Mikhail Ivanovich turned out to be a good specialist and leader.  Under his vigilant, wise supervision, a canal was built, which had even greater capabilities than the previous one, and an artificial reservoir was built, an area of ‚Äã‚Äãsix kilometers square.  The new reservoir, which provided the opportunity to maintain the required water level throughout the canal, had its original name - Zavodskaya.  This happened in 1741. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the construction of the reservoir hydrotechnologist gained many enemies.  These were monasteries, deprived of their vast lands, through which the waters of Zavodsky passed, as well as artisans of coachmen who had lost their cab work.  Be that as it may, Serdyukov, guarded by the tsar, completed the construction.  In 1774, twenty years after the death of the merchant, Vyshnevolotsk reservoirs and canals were transferred to the state treasury. </p><p>  About two hundred years later, in the early 1950s, the retaining structures of the reservoir were reconstructed. </p><h2>  The social significance of the reservoir </h2><p>  Since the reservoir has a sufficiently high water level, it carries out seasonal stabilization of runoff and serves for local water supply, as well as energy, fisheries, timber rafting and water transport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyshnevolotsk reservoir Tver region" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1889066.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the reservoir supplies water to two small hydropower plants located next to it. </p><p>  The Novo-Tveretskaya hydroelectric power station, located between the reservoir and <span>the Tvertsa River,</span> was created in 1947.  Now it produces electricity in the amount of 8.8 million kW / h per year.  A hydroelectric station equipped with two turbines has a water flow rate of twenty cubic meters per second. </p><p>  Another small hydroelectric power station is Novo-Tsninskaya.  It is located on the river Tsna and is intended for the sanitary use of water.  Equipped with one turbine, the hydroelectric power station consumes from four to nine cubic meters of water per second. </p><p>  And now, when we briefly got acquainted with the history and technical features of the reservoir, let's talk about its aesthetic use. </p><h2>  Fisherman's Note </h2><p>  Is the Vyshnevolotsk reservoir rich in fish?  Fishing here is truly interesting and diverse.  In the waters you can find pike and catfish, perch and pike perch, bream and burbot, rudd and gudgeon. </p><p>  It pecks best at reaches near the villages of Zdeshevo, Pererva, Gradolyublya, Krasnomaysky, as well as around numerous islets and in the mouths of the Shlin, Cheremnitsa, and Tsna rivers. </p><p>  Depending on your wishes and preferences, you can catch in a pond both in wiring and fly fishing, both on tugs and on spinning, regardless of weather conditions and time of year. </p><h2>  Winter fishing </h2><p>  Since ice is installed on the reservoir in early November, and begins to melt already in April, then during this period you can safely make winter fishing.  The average thickness of ice in a pond is about half a meter, and the maximum is 120 cm, so do not be afraid to fall into cold icy water.  In some places, the ice surface of the reservoir is adapted to travel by car.  True, there is a large snow cover on the ice, which can reach a meter in length. </p><p>  In winter, you can catch perch, pike and bream in a pond, and a good catch is achieved by fishing on flags and zerglovitsa.  Of course, the fishing place needs to be fed, and it is better to use bloodworms as bait. </p><h2>  Summer fishing </h2><p>  Summer fishing here, of course, is more interesting and diverse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyshnevolotsk reservoir" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1889078.jpg" width="600"></div>  In the warmer months, you can catch on a boat, which is the most productive and efficient method.  As a nozzle, rye bread and worms should be used.

    <p>  You can use different methods - fishing rod, fly fishing, donkeys, jigsaw, spinning, and even bait.  They note that here you can catch a bream weighing five kilograms! </p><p>  If you have forgotten or lost your gear and bait, then everything you need can be purchased in city stores and even at the railway station. </p><h2>  Various recreation on the pond </h2><p>  Is it possible to have a good rest on the reservoir?  Yes, since the reservoir is a poorly overgrown body of water (it has no more than five percent of the overgrown area) and has in its waters the amount of oil products and phenols within the limits acceptable for fisheries. </p><p>  Rest on the Vyshnevolotsk reservoir is suitable for both couples in love and spouses with children, both lovers of silence and hunters for noisy companies. </p><p>  Amazing landscapes, measured splashing of waves, clean moist air - these are just a few of the benefits of relaxing on a pond. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyshnevolotsk reservoir how to get" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1889082.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  On the reservoir itself there are various recreation centers (the village of Zdeshevo, the village of Rvenica, some islands of the water area).  Here you will be provided with all kinds of entertainments and amusements - riding on water transport and bicycles, fishing and barbecue, windsurfing, kiting and wakeboarding, bars and restaurants, privacy and delicious food. </p><p>  The beaches of the reservoir are also well equipped and cleaned.  They are good for sunbathing, swimming and just enjoying nature. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the bottom of the reservoir is sandy and gravel, in some places silty.  Although livestock farms and industrial enterprises are located around the reservoir, sewage and sewage are not discharged into the reservoir. </p><h2>  Reservoir water area </h2><p>  On the territory of the reservoir there are small picturesque islets where you can also find inspiring privacy and a refreshing vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyshnevolotsk reservoir" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1889072.jpg" width="600"></div>
