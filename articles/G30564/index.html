Spectators saw many in at least one film, but they know very little about them, about their life.  This galaxy of young talents includes the famous comedian Alexei Likhnitsky. </p><h2>  Personality formation </h2><p>  Alexey Likhnitsky was born in 1981 in the <span>capital of North Ossetia, the</span> city ​​of Ordzhonikidze (current Vladikavkaz).  His family did not stand out for anything special among hundreds of other simple families in Vladikavkaz.  He went to a regular secondary school.  It was in school years that teachers began to notice the talent of a comedian in him, but Alexei himself at that time decided to get a higher education and, after graduation, planned to engage in scientific activities.  Aleksey managed to enter the Timiryazev Academy.  He received a diploma of an agronomist and ecologist.  During the training, our hero had very difficult times of lack of money.  In these situations, he always showed his vital strength, stamina.  For example, there is such a legend that it seems that Aleksey Likhnitsky (photo below) spent 50 kopecks a week, and earned money on food by doing homework for his fellow students. </p>

    <h2>  Becoming an agronomist was not destined </h2><p>  The first serious humorous experience Alexey Likhnitsky received at the university.  At that time, KVN was still very popular, and therefore he decided to try his hand at the university team "RosNOU".  KVN occupation so fascinated Likhnitsky that he decided to devote himself to creative work after graduation.  It was in this KVN team that the creative duet “Roman Yunusov and Aleksey Likhnitsky” was formed, better known as the “Zaitsev Sisters”.  As soon as the participants of this duet graduated from the <span>Timiryazev Academy,</span> they came to the Comedy Club, which at that time was already gaining momentum and gaining popularity among the audience. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

The morning show at one of the Moscow FM stations was also very popular among listeners.  They can’t keep their air dry!  This is constant creativity, jokes, unexpected twists!  But the listener only needs this, especially in the morning, to quickly wake up and leave the house.  On television, this duet also once had a program called "Proverb Destroyers."  Created in 2016, the entertainment show "Moscow Nights" was also instructed to lead this duet.
