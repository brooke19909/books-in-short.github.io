    <h2>  Why is the support service useful? </h2><p>  The first step is to find out why you should call Megafon.  What does a support service offer its customers?  It is a multifunctional center that provides information about services.  Customers also come here when they have any complaints or wishes.  What functions does the Megafon support service perform?  It: </p><ul><li>  advising clients (including potential); </li><li>  receiving complaints and suggestions; </li><li>  <span>providing information</span> on tariffs and services; </li><li>  connecting / disconnecting certain features; </li><li>  tariff plan change. </li></ul><p>  In principle, nothing special.  The only thing you need to know is how to contact the operator.  There are several ways to do this.  You can choose the most suitable option for your case. </p><h2>  Phone for subscribers </h2><p>  Do you use the services that the Megafon operator provides?  How to call the support service of this company?  For example, use a short number.  This is a combination of 0500. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="operator megaphone telephones" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1351604.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Perhaps this is the most common communication option.  Usually after making a call you will hear an answering machine.  It serves as a support service.  You can independently activate and deactivate services, as well as clarify information that interests you.  But you can also talk to a ‚Äúlive‚Äù operator using a combination of 0500.  To do this, when the answering machine is working, press the button that is responsible for communication with the operator.  Then wait a bit - and the problem is solved.  You can ask your questions. </p><p>  By the way, a call using a short number is free.  And only Megafon subscribers can bring their ideas to life.  If you need to make a call from other numbers, you will have to use other combinations. </p><h2>  Federal number </h2><p>  What else does the Megafon operator offer?  The phone number that can be used by subscribers of this company is already known.  But what if you need to call from a stationary device or from another operator‚Äôs number? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="operator megaphone phone number" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1351600.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  There is a separate combination for this.  By the way, it is also called the "hot line" of the company.  This is a federal number.  It looks as follows: 8 800 550 05 00. You can use it anywhere in Russia.  This is the combination that the Megafon operator offers.  This phone is suitable for subscribers of the company, and for all other numbers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How much will you have to pay per minute?  Not at all.  Calls in Russia in the case of using the federal number are absolutely free.  The advantage of this type of communication is that you can reach the support service at any time of the day.  The Hotline is on a 24/7 schedule. </p><h2>  Roaming </h2><p>  Of course, travelers were not forgotten either.  Indeed, very often the issues of providing certain services in the field of mobile communications arise precisely in roaming.  Therefore, a special number was invented for citizens, which allows you to quickly solve all problems that arise.  Federal and short combinations are not good here. </p><p>  Do you need the Megafon operator in roaming?  How to call him?  The number +7 926 111 05 00 will help solve this problem. You can use this combination at any time of the day.  Please note that this number is only suitable for communication with the operator while in roaming.  In all other cases, it is recommended to use the previously listed numbers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone number" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1351601.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  reference </h2><p>  The operator "Megaphone" has the so-called universal help.  With it, everyone can get all the information they need about tariffs, services and service prices.  This is something like a hotline.  But instead of live operators, a robot voice will talk to you.  This service is used extremely rarely.  Customers prefer to use either a federal number or a short combination. </p><p>  What if you want to call the unified help desk of our today's company?  What does the Megafon operator propose to do?  How to call him in this case?  To do this, use the number 0567. </p><p>  Such a technique, as already mentioned, is not in demand among customers.  Indeed, unlike previous communication methods, this number requires payment for the service.  Including VAT, you will have to pay about 44 rubles for using the Megafon universal certificate.  Not too much, but why pay when you can get the data you need absolutely free?  Therefore, this option should be considered only as a theoretical possibility of communication with the operator.  In practice, putting it into practice is not recommended.  Although, if you wish, you can try. </p><h2>  head office </h2><p>  Sometimes problems that arise for subscribers cannot be resolved in the support service.  Or claims and wishes are not considered.  How to be then?  What solution does the Megafon operator offer?  How to call the management of this organization? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to call a megaphone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1351602.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  A separate number is also provided for this.  You can call the head office of the corporation using the combination of +7 499 755 21 55. The call is paid, charging is done according to your tariff plan.  Moreover, this rule applies to all phones, regardless of operator. </p><p>  In practice, customers rarely use this method of communication with Megafon.  After all, most of the problems are solved by means of a "hot line" and a short operator number.  But that is not all that this company has prepared for us.  There are several more ways to keep in touch.  Which ones? </p><h2>  Internet to help </h2><p>  For example, using special virtual services.  Now every large and conscientious company has them.  We can say that everything is done for the convenience of the client.  You need to go to the official page of the company "Megaphone" and look at the section "Contacts".  Here you can see several types of communication with the operator directly via the Internet! </p><p>  You can ask a question online in a special chat.  The method is good, it is used often.  You will get an answer in a few minutes.  The most suitable scenario for those who prefer virtual communication without voice communication. </p><p>  Also, you have every right to talk with the operator through social networks.  Not the most popular, but quite successful way.  There are official groups on the Megafon website.  Usually they are used in order to find out the feedback of other subscribers about certain services.  Or for complaints and suggestions.  But this does not end with possible means of communication. </p><h2>  Letters, letters </h2><p>  The last option that only takes place is sending an email.  Also a very good way of communication, but it is mainly used for complaints and suggestions.  Implemented by several methods.  The first is going to the Megafon website and accessing the Contacts section.  Find the "Email Us" feature there.  Click on this line, fill in the fields and send your request for processing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone phone number" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1351603.jpg"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  There is also the option of sending a question to the short number 0500. Write what you want to know, then send a message using the specified combination.  After about 10 minutes, you will receive a detailed answer.  That's all.  Such opportunities are offered by the Megafon operator.  How to call this company and generally contact it?  This is no longer a secret.  Choose the method that suits you best and bring it to life! </p>
