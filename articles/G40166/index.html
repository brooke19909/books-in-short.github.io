These include Grigory Potemkin.  When mentioning the name of this person, the first association that arises among the average Russian is the Potemkin villages.  It is generally accepted that this is a synonym for a grandiose historical farce and the pretense by which Gregory ‚Äúsplurged‚Äù Empress <span>Catherine and</span> her foreign guests.  But few people know that this, to put it mildly, does not quite correspond to the truth. </p>

Moreover, there was no sarcasm in their words: they were indeed amazed at the scale of the work and the efforts made by the empress's favorite.  Despite his craving for luxury and other elements of a ‚Äúbeautiful life‚Äù, this person was able to work and did it with splendor!

    <h2>  Historical contradictions </h2><p>  The story is a ‚Äúlady‚Äù capricious and unjust.  Just think about it: the same Pyrrhus, a talented and intelligent commander, remained in the memory of his descendants only as a negligent commander, "heaped the enemy with meat."  And no one at the same time recalls that Pyrrhus himself was of a low opinion of his victory.  So is Grigory Potemkin.  Despite all his deeds for the glory of Russia, he is remembered only in dirty dishes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  I immediately recall his love affair with Catherine, a craving for luxury and all the same unfortunate villages ... In fact, Gregory was one of the most talented organizers of the time with an undeniable gift and abilities in the field of public administration.  Simply put, he was indeed a great man.  Not simple, with its own quirks, but all its shortcomings were a logical continuation of its undoubted merits.  So is it true, as the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof some historians echo that, the monument to Grigory Potemkin was erected undeservedly?  Of course not.  The prince really earned all his honors and regalia.  To verify this, you just need to know the main milestones of his biography. </p>

    <h2>  How it all began </h2><p>  He was born in <span>Smolensk province.</span>  Place of birth - a small village Chizhovo.  It happened on September 13 (24), 1739.  Father was Alexander Vasilyevich Potemkin, a retired major.  His character was, as is now customary to say, "not sugar."  That's what he did not spare for his son, so it was beatings, which were a natural consequence of violent temper and craving for a drink.  Fortunately, Gregory, all this lasted only until seven years, and then his father was gone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Mother, Daria Vasilievna, tried her best to protect her son from the evil influence of her father and constantly stood up for him, which was why she was repeatedly beaten.  Therefore, after the death of Alexander Vasilyevich, the whole family sighed with relief.  The Potemkins moved to Moscow, and this was largely due to the desire to give a better education to Gregory.  Again, due to the nature of the boy, this desire did not quite come true.  However, we will talk about everything in order. </p><h2>  Student </h2><p>  From the youngest years, Grigory Potemkin was distinguished by a very peculiar character: he literally caught fire to the idea that interested him and could work on it almost around the clock, but he cooled off just as quickly.  However, he completed most of his endeavors.  In particular, he did his best for successful studies.  It was not in vain - already in 1755 he became a student at Moscow University, and just a year later, young Gregory received a gold medal "For academic success." </p><p>  In those days, it was indeed an outstanding recognition of merit.  Everything indicated that a new name could soon be added to the list of the luminaries of Russian science.  If everything was really so, then, without a doubt, Potemkin would surely be able to become an outstanding scientist.  Who knows, maybe we lost another Lomonosov ... </p><p>  A year later, he was introduced to Elizabeth in a group of 12 best students.  It‚Äôs just that everything went wrong ... Just three years after that, he was expelled for ‚Äúlaziness and non-attendance of lectures‚Äù.  But in vain.  After all, he had all the makings to become a luminary of science.  It was just that at that time there was not a single authoritative mentor nearby who could indicate the erroneousness of his actions.  At the same time, Gregory showed himself to be an exemplary son: mindful of the suffering of his mother, who was keenly worried about his expulsion, he subsequently knocked out the high rank of state-lady for her.  However, then this was out of the question.  The army of the Russian State was waiting for the young "mediocrity". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ambition and pleasant surprises </h2><p>  All contemporaries said that one of Potemkin‚Äôs main shortcomings was pride, sometimes turning into open vanity and arrogance.  However, this was not always bad: calmly accepting his deduction, he immediately decided to embark on a military path.  At that time, a peculiar analogue of the military department already existed, and therefore yesterday‚Äôs student was formally enrolled in the army and was in active military service.  It was a good incentive for a further career! </p><p>  So, in 1761, he already had the rank of chief officer, while not serving a single day.  At the same time, a former student arrives in St. Petersburg and is at the location of the regiment.  His appearance was so impressive that he was immediately made the orderly of Field Marshal George Ludwig (Duke of Schleswig-Holstein). </p>

    <h2>  Conspirator </h2><p>  Despite the warm welcome in the army, Gregory did not have any tender feelings for her tyrant to the commander, Peter III, who by that time had already managed to give up lands, abundantly watered with the blood of Russian soldiers, to his idol Friedrich.  And this completely fell back on him: the army of the State of Russia simply could not forgive such a betrayal.  It is not surprising that Potemkin easily joins the ranks of the conspirators.  The day of the coup, June 28, 1762, was a turning point in the fate of not only Russia, but also the leader.  Catherine II immediately liked the handsome handsome man. </p><p>  Unlike their "colleagues" in the conspiracy, who were only promoted to cornet, the future statesman is immediately appointed to the second lieutenant.  In general, this is the same as if a <span>senior sergeant had</span> become a major in a day today.  It is precisely this circumstance that historians blame, precisely for this reason that he gains many enemies in a day.  However, the future count himself does not see anything bad in this, since his vanity amuses himself from the realization of his exceptionalism. </p><h2>  Desperation and courage </h2><p>  However, at that time Potemkin could not dream of a greater favor of the empress.  The fact is that her favorite was Count Orlov, and he simply could not compete with him.  Despite the regalia and awards brought by the service, Gregory gradually began to cool to his occupation.  At that time, an amazing incident almost happened: Potemkin Grigory Alexandrovich almost became a monk!  He conducted long theological conversations with the ministers of the church, striking them with his knowledge, and seriously prepared for tonsure.  But then another Russian-Turkish war began. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúIlliterate, but brave beyond measure‚Äù </h2><p>  In 1769, a young major general (for nine years !!!) goes to this war as a volunteer.  His active nature simply could not pass by such an opportunity to prove himself.  Oddly enough, the devoted fans and haters of Potemkin said the same thing: "As a general, he is an empty place, but at the same time immensely brave and never loses courage in battle." </p><p>  He climbed to places where there was definitely nothing to do, and at the same time killed people, but fought shoulder to shoulder with them and never hid behind the backs of soldiers.  Potemkin participated in almost all land battles. </p>

Although this is unlikely: even his worst enemies spoke of his courage.  Of course, this does not justify unnecessary and often stupid losses.

    <h2>  Favorite </h2><p>  In 1774, Potemkin arrives at the court on the wings of glory.  Orlov at this time is already in disgrace, and therefore at the court a new favorite of Catherine quickly appears.  Gregory quickly receives the title of count and the rank of general-general. </p><p>  Historians still argue about how far the relationship between Potemkin and Catherine has gone.  There is a version that their relationship even gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth. </p><p>  Allegedly, the girl was transferred to the education of the closest relatives of the newly made Count.  Her surname was Temkina, as the tradition of those years said that illegitimate children should be given the father's surname, subtracting the first syllable from the last.  But were Grigory Potemkin and Ekaterina her parents? </p><h2>  "Was there a boy? .." </h2><p>  In the Tretyakov Gallery there is a portrait of this woman, so there is no argument about her existence.  Her father could well have been Gregory, but did her mother Ekaterina?  The fact is that by the time of the birth of Elizabeth she was already 45 years old, which even for the present time is somewhat unsuitable for childbearing, and even in those days it was something unthinkable.  Whatever it was, but in those years, the relationship of Potemkin and Catherine were the most trusting. </p><p>  Here I would like to make one digression.  The empress has had many favorites and close associates throughout her life.  But all of them, having lost the grace of the ruler, immediately went into the shadows and did not remind themselves of anything.  Potemkin, even though he was removed from the court, still played a crucial role in public administration, and therefore it was unfair to judge him only from the point of view of a talented courtier. </p><h2>  Construction of New Russia </h2><p>  In 1776, the empress‚Äôs protege receives a task of national importance: to engage in the arrangement of New Russia, Azov, and other lands in those parts.  Almost everyone agrees that Prince Grigory Potemkin of Tauride achieved incredible successes in this field.  Historians believe that he did more for the south of our country than Peter I did for the northern territories (debatable, since Peter had to work in very difficult conditions).  He founded many cities and villages where nomadic troops flashed yesterday, and there was nothing but thickets of steppe grass. </p>

This plan was not implemented, but the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe annexation of Crimea was fully implemented.  There he continued his work to strengthen the borders of Russia, establishing cities and fortresses.  In particular, it was he who laid the city of Kherson, Odessa and others.

    <h2>  Vanity and luxury </h2><p>  It will not be superfluous to say that the prince's craving for luxury was really <span>a byword.</span>  In particular, his hat was so heavy with orders and decorations that he had to carry it on the hands of an orderly.  Even at that moment when Catherine herself and her guests preferred to present in public in simple hunting camisoles, Potemkin remained true to himself, blinding everyone present with a sparkle of gold and diamonds.  The same character trait was clearly manifested in the architectural plans of Potemkin: the same city of Kherson was originally conceived on such a scale that even modern Moscow could envy him in something.  In practice, it was not possible to realize a tenth of the plan. </p><h2>  "Dust in the eyes" or reality? </h2><p>  In 1787, Catherine decided to honor the Crimea with her attention.  Potemkin, who by then had already received such a rank as Field Marshal, could not miss such an outstanding opportunity to remind himself again.  So the ‚ÄúPotemkin villages‚Äù, although far from being in the form we are talking about today, really were.  Once again, they were quite real, the peasants really lived permanently in these settlements, but Grigory obviously could not do without the appropriate surroundings and excessive luxury.  That's why there was talk about the farce and "unreality" seen by Catherine and her foreign guests. </p><p>  Few people know, but by the time the Empress visited the Crimea, he had created a special ‚Äúcompany of Amazons,‚Äù which was recruited exclusively from girls of noble blood.  Naturally, after Catherine's departure, she was disbanded, since Potemkin perfectly understood the absolute futility of such a military formation in a real war.  Nevertheless, he received the title "Field Marshal" not only because of the sympathy of the Empress.  At that time, everyone recognized that the amount of work performed by the empress' favorite was really amazing, and therefore they easily forgave him the irrepressible craving for luxury and brilliance. </p><h2>  Positive and negative </h2><p>  One and a half dozen large and twenty small vessels staged a grandiose salute, which was the apotheosis of Catherine‚Äôs visit to the peninsula.  This fleet, which appeared off the coast of Crimea literally from the air, especially shocked the foreigners who accompanied the empress. </p><p>  Many contemporaries and historians believe that the quality of construction of these ships was "awful."  Yes, this is true, but during the next war with Turkey, these ships played an important role, despite all their shortcomings.  It was after this that Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin, whose biography is considered as part of this article, officially received the Tauride title, indicating his special successes in the development of new lands. </p>

It is known that Potemkin could not stand Suvorov, and the honored commander answered him the same, since he openly hated arrogance and vanity.  In addition, he could not help but know that Grigory Potemkin often ascribes to himself his merits in the military field.

    <p>  Although Suvorov had reasons to respect his ill-wisher: it was thanks to Potemkin that the Russian army finally got rid of the ridiculous Prussian heritage in the form of wigs, letters and pigtails, which made the everyday uniform much more convenient and practical.  This greatly facilitated the hard labor of soldiers.  Finally, under him, the cavalry of Russia underwent their heyday, since he had done a lot for the development of this kind of troops.  This work bore fruit in 1812, when it was the cavalrymen who became the main striking force against the invading army of Napoleon. </p><p>  Also, the <span>great commander</span> admitted that Potemkin is an excellent rear organizer.  Under him, the army never knew the problems with the timely delivery of provisions, weapons and everything necessary.  So Prince Grigory Potemkin really enjoyed the respect of even his enemies (which he wound up solely because of vanity and some arrogance). </p><h2>  Opal and removal </h2><p>  The courtier‚Äôs career is fragile.  Our hero also found out about this when a young Plato Zurabov turned out to be close to the court.  This man was not only younger than Potemkin, but also turned out to be no less talented organizer.  The days of the old favorite were numbered.  Zurabov did not want to put up with the constant presence of an old competitor, and therefore insisted on his removal.  In 1791 he was forced to leave Petersburg. </p><h2>  Last luxury </h2><p> Already in January, he arrives there again, returning from another Turkish war.  Four consecutive months in the <span>Tauride Palace,</span> one after another, incredibly sumptuous feasts were given, at which Potemkin squandered 850 thousand rubles.  At that time it was a tremendous amount.  All this pursued only one goal - to return the favor of Catherine, but she did not back down from her decision.  It is noteworthy that even Zurabov understood the undesirability of removing Potemkin from state affairs, so the aging prince was simply hinted that his continued presence in St. Petersburg was undesirable. </p><p>  He actively participates in peace talks with the Turks.  But all this was just a screen: vanity this time did Grigory a disservice, he simply could not survive his parting with Catherine.  Nervous, he became seriously ill, but still tried to participate in government affairs.  Russia, the 18th century for which it became a time of prosperity and renaissance, will soon lose one of its most odious and ambiguous sons. </p>

    <h2>  The last day </h2><p>  On October 5, 1791, the prince became ill right in the carriage that followed from Iasi to Nikolaev.  His last words are known.  He ordered the carriage to stop and said: ‚ÄúThat's all, nowhere to go, I am dying!  Take me out of the carriage: I want to die on the field! ‚Äù  The accompanying retinue carefully carried their master to the autumn field.  A few minutes later the prince was gone.  He was buried in the Kherson fortress, in the Cathedral of St. Catherine (which was built under his leadership). </p><p>  So Grigory Alexandrovich Potemkin died (1739-1791).  This controversial man left a deep mark in the history of our country, and therefore one should not forget about his role in any case.  Surely without him everything would have been different. </p>
