  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Truman Doctrine</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Truman's doctrine, which laid the foundation for a strategy to contain the communist regime, was developed by the next US presidents during the Cold War.  Its main goal was to resist the widespread offensive of the Communists. </p><p>  After the war, the USSR did everything to ensure that in central and southeastern Europe pro-Soviet forces could come to power, especially the Communist Party.  And it was for this purpose that he presented territorial claims against Turkey, demanding that the status of the Black Sea straits be changed, including the <span>Dardanelles,</span> where the Union needed a <span>naval base.</span> </p><p>  At the same time, the <span>partisan movement</span> led by the communists was growing stronger in Greece.  It was supported by the border Albania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, where a communist regime was already established. </p><p>  At a meeting in London, which brought together the foreign ministers of all those countries that were members of the Security Council, the Soviet Union demanded that he be granted the right to protectorate over Libya to ensure his presence in the Mediterranean.  This attempt to use this collective organization to expand its power aroused alarm among Western countries. </p><p>  The Communist Parties of Italy and France were considered the largest forces in these countries, and in the governments of other states there were communists.  The USSR, after the withdrawal of American allied forces, became the dominant military force in continental Europe. </p><p>  It would seem that nothing will hinder the plans of the leadership of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  However, overseas were also worried about the situation in Europe and were looking for ways to resolve it.  US diplomacy was manifested in a policy of severe ‚Äúcontainment‚Äù of the widespread penetration of communism.  According to Washington, this was the only way to prevent war. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The United States foreign policy program was presented by President G. Truman in a message to Congress in the spring of 1947.  After the approval of the relevant bill, she received the force of law. </p><p>  Truman's doctrine, which he proclaimed in his speech, condemned the repressiveness of communist rule.  The President, in harsh terms, demonstrated the danger that will arise in the world as a result of the establishment of such systems in some countries.  As a result, powers were received from Congress to assist first Turkey and Greece, and then other countries that would be at risk of the ‚Äúcommunist disease‚Äù. </p><p>  Truman's doctrine provided for the provision of financial assistance to Turkey and Greece - four hundred million dollars, allegedly to combat the "communist danger" that threatened these countries. </p><p>  Such economic diplomacy ended with the signing of agreements with the governments of these countries in June-July 1947. </p><p>  Truman's doctrine pursued one goal: to limit the growth of the socialist and democratic movement after the Second World War, thereby exerting constant pressure on the Soviet Union and other <span>countries of the socialist</span> camp. </p><p>  The United States adhered to a policy of supporting any reactionary forces and regimes, and therefore Truman's doctrine became a tool for Washington's imperialist intervention in the internal politics of European countries.  The result was the Cold War and the international situation, which was pushed to the limit.  This was the beginning of large-scale military assistance to ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù US countries, the creation of entire networks of military bases on their territories. </p><p>  The Truman Doctrine was developed with the active participation of Allen Dulles, Loy Henderson, George Kennan and other American politicians and diplomats.  At the same time, Egard Wallace, a former US vice president, Roosevelt's associate, considered her an insane step towards the war, which would result in a deep international crisis. </p>
