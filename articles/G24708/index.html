Inspecting its sights, guests plunge into the atmosphere of the times of the great kings and empresses.  Only 25 kilometers separate St. Petersburg from the city of Pushkin. </p><h2>  Museum Name </h2><p>  Some may be surprised, but this place was named not because it has gorgeous parks and palace buildings.  It was the geographical location that reflected in the fact that the settlement became known as Tsarskoye Selo.  The Museum-Reserve is located on the Izhora Upland.  Initially, when there were no palaces yet, it was a small estate of Sarskaya Manor.  In Finnish, this phrase means "in a high place."  The name was not given by chance, since the estate really stands on a hill (150 m above sea level).  Only with time did they begin to call it Tsarskaya. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal village museum reserve" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1041950.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The transformation of the estate </h2><p>  In 1710, Peter I made a gift to Catherine and wrote to her this territory along with the estate.  And gradually the Tsar‚Äôs manor turned into the Tsar‚Äôs Village.  At this time, the construction of the residence began and magnificent palaces began to grow.  Today, Tsarskoye Selo, a museum-reserve, includes the Catherine and Alexander palaces.  And on the territory of 300 hectares a lush park grows.  The local landscape is decorated with marble monuments, bridges, ponds and various pavilions.  In 1992 Tsarskoye Selo received the status of a reserve. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ekaterinburg park </h2><p>  We can say that Tsarskoye Selo is a museum-reserve, divided into two parts.  These are Catherine and <span>Alexander parks.</span>  Each has its own attractions.  <span>Catherine Park</span> consists of an <span>English park</span> and the Old Garden.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis territory reaches 107 hectares.  Inside is a large pond.  Of particular historical value is the Great <span>Catherine Palace.</span>  Its final design in the Baroque style falls on the 1750s.  The palace is adjoined by a front yard, a four-story outbuilding (now a museum), buildings (completed at the end of the 18th century) and many other historical sights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal village working hours" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1041949.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Also in the <span>Catherine Park</span> is the Hermitage, which previously hosted receptions for the tsar‚Äôs guests.  Of particular note is the elegant ‚ÄúGrotto‚Äù pavilion with snow-white columns and nautical-themed modeling, this design took place in 1749-1761.  And in 1773 several buildings of the same type were erected - the Admiralty. </p><h2>  Alexandrovsky park </h2><p>  It also has two parts, called the <span>Landscape Park</span> and the New Garden, in which there are three ponds and the Kuzminka River.  In 1792, a grandiose construction began here.  Now many are eager to visit the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoye Selo.  This is an elongated two-story building with impressive columns in two rows from the main facade.  At the moment it is a working museum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to the palace, the park includes a Children's House, in which the children of Nicholas I played. There is also an Arsenal made in the Gothic style, and the White Tower, reminiscent of a knight's castle, around which there is a moat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alexander palace in the royal village" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1041951.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Many visitors to the park like to stay at the Chinese Village Hotel.  The complex includes low buildings.  They were erected in 1778 with Chinese flavor.  Also on the territory there are ruins of the "Chinese Theater", in 1941 it burned down and was not restored. </p><h2>  Museum-reserve ‚ÄúTsarskoye Selo‚Äù: working hours </h2><p>  These places are attracted not only by their royal origin, but also by the fact that Lermontov, Yesenin, Tyutchev, Tolstoy, Akhmatova and other talented writers were here, lived and inspired.  To plunge into history and feel the former luxury and peace, many visit Tsarskoye Selo.  But this reserve works by the hour.  To get to the Yekaterinburg Palace, you need to arrive from 10.00 to 18.00.  Monday is a long day, and reception lasts until 21.00. </p><p>  The Alexander Palace is open from 10.00 to 18.00.  But every Tuesday and the last Wednesday of the month are days off.  If you want to go on a guided tour, you must not forget that ticket offices sell tickets until 17.00. </p>
