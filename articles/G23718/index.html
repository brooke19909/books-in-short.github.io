More and more often, mothers purchase or sew a special <span>envelope for discharge from the hospital.</span>  This is the right decision, since modern warmed, natural, lightweight fabrics are better than heavy, voluminous grandmother's blankets.  The pattern of the envelope for a newborn with a hood can be different, depending on the purpose, models, material. </p><h2>  Types of Envelopes </h2><ul><li>  Bag.  A very simple model in the form of a bag with a hood.  Inside - natural material, outside - <span>waterproof fabric.</span>  Fixation of the baby occurs due to Velcro, zippers. </li><li>  Blanket.  Pattern of an envelope for a newborn with a hood is a blanket with Velcro, bindings, zippers.  The model transforms into a child, turning into a cone. </li><li>  Overalls.  The most popular envelope.  The top is made like a jacket with sleeves, and the bottom is made of a bag.  Suitable for active kids. </li><li>  Automotive.  The model can go as a bag or overalls.  The main difference of an automobile envelope is the accounting of special slots for seat belts. </li><li>  Envelope with the bottom.  Similar to the first model, it only has a rigid, dense removable bottom that allows you to fix the back of the baby.  Suitable for young dads who are afraid to take newborns in their arms. </li></ul><p>  All types of envelopes can be winter, summer, demi-season, with and without decorations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="envelope pattern for a newborn with a hood" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/1479376.jpg" width="321"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Summer envelope with a hood for newborns: pattern </h2><p>  Measure a rectangle 90x80 cm. Dotted line indicate the middle (through 45 cm).  Step back from the edges by 20 centimeters.  Draw a rectangle (40x90 cm) with rounded corners.  This is the basis of the envelope.  Immediately note the hood, the lower part. </p><p>  For the hood, measure 30 cm in the center of the rectangle.  Draw a trapezoid on the resulting quadrangle (30x20 cm), where the top of the base is 10 centimeters and the bottom is 30 cm. The front part is five centimeters shorter.  To do this, on a pattern of a quadrangle (30x20 cm) from the base of the envelope, measure 5 cm, drawing a solid line.  Cut out a hood on this pattern. </p><p>  The result was a rectangular envelope with a hood for newborns.  The bottom pattern can be in the form of a bag or panties.  In our case, consider the second option.  To do this, back from the base of the envelope on both sides by 20 centimeters.  Draw panties, where the bottom of the legs is placed on the central 10 cm, and up - 25 cm. </p><p>  To determine the front of the pants, draw a trapezoid 25 centimeters high from the base of the envelope with oval upper corners.  That is, the upper part of the trapezoid corresponds to 30 cm, is parallel to the bottom of the hood, and the base is 45 cm. This will be the third pattern of the product. </p><h2>  Cutting and sewing a summer envelope </h2><p>  A soft fleece model is sewn (1x1.5 m).  You stab on the fabric the first piece of the envelope with a hood and panties.  Cut the part without allowances at the edges. </p><p>  On a paper piece, cut out the front of the hood (taking into account the allowance for the lapel) and panties.  Pin with pins, cut off.  Now stitch all the parts.  Please note: if the envelope is made of one fabric, then the seams go out (decorate with a zigzag or braid). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you make a pattern of cotton, fleece, then sew, as usual.  First, sew patterns from two fabrics between each other (the wrong side to each other), and then - a hood, panties.  Sew on the edges of ties, Velcro, buttons. </p><p>  Whoever sews poorly, just make the bottom like a sleeping bag (for newborns).  The pattern will be an inverted trapezoid with an oval lower (30 cm) and upper (50 cm from the base of the envelope) base. </p><p>  Such models are good at home: wrap the baby after bathing or before bedtime.  Especially suitable for kids who are scared in a dream and wake up from trembling hands, feet.  Such an envelope does not constrain the child, but at the same time prevents from sharp swings. </p><h2>  How to sew an envelope for a newborn with your own hands in 2 hours </h2><p>  The model is suitable for walking.  The pattern is somewhat reminiscent of the first envelope, but it is an oval of irregular shape.  A wide hood, panties give the child complete freedom, and belts on the belt fix his position. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="envelope with a hood for newborns pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/1478813.jpg" width="535"></div>

    <p>  This is the simplest and most convenient pattern for an envelope for a newborn with a hood, since it does not require strict patterns.  Even a novice seamstress will cope with the marking of an oval envelope.  But the wide hood does not save the baby from the wind, so put on a hat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is cut out and sewn according to the principle of the first envelope.  The base is stitched with a hood, belts are sewn in the middle, then panties.  Edges are processed by a slanting inlay.  If you want an unusual envelope in the image of an animal, then choose the appropriate color, material, cut out ears, sew with a hood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="envelope pattern for a newborn with a hood" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/1479373.jpg" width="485"></div>

    <p>  Pay attention to the following fact.  Any appliqu√©s, sequins, beads, other decorations are sewn, and not fixed with glue.  Small parts are not placed close to the face or hands.  A model with decorations begins with decorating them, and then stitching all the linings. </p><h2>  Warm blanket </h2><p>  For a blanket, you need cotton, a synthetic winterizer measuring 1.8x1.5 meters, about one meter of oblique beak, 50 centimeters of elastic, zippers 25 and 55 cm long. The pattern of a winter envelope for a newborn with a hood is a rectangle (90x85 cm) with a pocket (15x45 cm) ) </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a winter envelope for a newborn" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/1479395.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <p>  First, cut out the patterns of two parts from all materials, taking into account allowances for the seams.  Then grind the pocket, at the top we sew the drawstring for the elastic, twist it, iron it along the seam.  Insert the elastic band, treat the edges with an oblique collar, attach to the front of the envelope. </p><p>  Stitch the details of the blanket, sew the zippers from the edges, turn them out, sew the unstitched section with a blind seam.  Iron all seams.  Now put the envelope with your pocket down.  Close the long zipper halfway, close it with your pocket, twisting it.  Put the child in the envelope, fasten the zipper to a certain level.  Fasten a short zipper if you need a hood. </p><h2>  What material to choose for a winter envelope </h2><p>  Regardless of whether you sew the envelope yourself or buy, pay attention to the lining: </p><ul><li>  The synthetic winterizer at an inexpensive price, does not deform when washing, is easily cut.  But it doesn‚Äôt warm well, so use it for spring and autumn models. </li><li>  Bamboo has the same properties as a synthetic winterizer.  That is, it is lightweight, resistant to deformation, not suitable for winter due to low thermoregulation properties. </li><li>  Sheepskin is used for removable linings.  The material retains heat even in winter.  Any unpleasant odors can be eliminated by airing.  The material is hypoallergenic, lightweight. </li><li>  Thermoregulation of goose down is not inferior to sheepskin, but loses in caring for it.  The fluff when washing rolls into lumps, can come out of the seams. </li></ul><p>  The lining can be removable or solid.  Use cotton, chintz, flannel, calico for the inside of the envelope.  For the front part, use any fabric (fleece, satin, raincoat fabric), just note that an envelope with a smooth surface can slip in your hands. </p><h2>  Knitted patterns </h2><p>  For knitting, any pattern of an envelope for a newborn with a hood is suitable.  If you choose a hook, then create the patterns exactly according to the pattern, since the product is dense.  If you choose knitting needles, first knit a sample, carry out the work of calculating the loops.  You can knit all the patterns with knitting needles, and adjust the shape with a crochet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew an envelope for a newborn do it yourself" class="if" height="304" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/1479393.jpg" width="491"></div>

    <p>  Attach children's pants, a blouse on paper and draw a pattern in the form of a star.  Now tie the pentagon in columns with one crochet.  As a basis, you can take the scheme of a five-pointed napkin, adding two columns in each row.  Then finish knitting each limb separately.  Next, knit the same elements, creating a hood, sleeves, panties.  Sew buttons on the side. </p><p>  You can link a regular rectangle.  As a pattern, take an elastic band or alternation of front rows with braids.  Sew corners from one end to get a hood.  Attach a brush on top.  Crochet the edges.  Sew buttons on the sides, the envelope is ready. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern envelope jumpsuit for a newborn with a hood" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/1479375.jpg" width="500"></div>
