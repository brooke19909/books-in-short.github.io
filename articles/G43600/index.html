This was due to the fact that residents of ancient eras believed that the name will play a role in the whole future life of the baby, and that is why they tried to put a special meaning in it, which they considered the most important not only for children, but also for the family as a whole.  Of course, one cannot fail to note the veneration of the Gods, which in ancient Egypt were many.  Some families could appease several Deities at once, giving the corresponding names to their many children. </p>

That is, the girl could be called ‚ÄúBeauty‚Äù, the boy - ‚ÄúBrave‚Äù or ‚ÄúStrong‚Äù.  It should be noted that in modern times this tradition from Egypt was adopted by many cultures, but it was most widely spread among the eastern peoples, who also give names to children in accordance with their physical or other individual qualities.  In another case, the baby could be called so that a specific application form was adopted.  Most often, the names included the name of God, after which some action took place, for example, ‚Äúsatisfied,‚Äù ‚Äúpersonified,‚Äù ‚Äúsatisfied,‚Äù and much more.

In fact, this state of things is characteristic of many countries not only in the past, but also directly in the present.  The only difference was that the ending of the female name, as well as the male one, was distinguished by the corresponding hieroglyph.  It should also be noted that several children in the same family, regardless of their gender, could also be called the same.  So that the child could understand that his parents or other people were turning to him, epithets were used - senior, middle or younger.

    <p>  Ancient Egyptian names, female and male, could change throughout life.  However, in order for this opportunity to arise, some kind of event had to take place, which could affect the personality of a person.  People preferred to call themselves differently when they visited the temple of another, not corresponding to the name of God.  Various abbreviations and nicknames were also common. </p><p>  In general, ancient Egyptian names have always been of great importance, which the people have managed to preserve so far.  At the moment, as in the past, it is impossible to erase hieroglyphs from certain monuments, since along with them, according to popular beliefs, the memory as well as the history of the person, which is implied in the inscription, are erased. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient egyptian female names" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11532/296595.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <p>  The ancient Egyptian names had not only the meaning that everyone knows today, but also another, mysterious.  They were used in order to drive away trouble from one family or the whole settlement, to preserve the harvest, or to help in any other business.  To do this, it was necessary to write the selected name, which symbolized something negative - an evil spirit or a ferocious beast, on dishes or other fragile object, and then break it.  Of course, this was available only to those who knew the names, since only in this case did power gain over the subject. </p>
