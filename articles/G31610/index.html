Foreign and domestic trade in Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Features of trade in the 17th century become key factors in the development of new <span>types of economic relations.</span>  The old system of handicraft is gradually becoming obsolete; small-scale production is replacing it.  What were the features of trade in the 17th century, how new relations were formed in Russia and abroad - we will consider below. </p><h2>  New phenomena in the craft industry </h2><p>  About what were the features of trade in the 17th century, we can approximately judge by the principles of development of production relations.  Previously, the development of handicraft took place within the framework of subsistence farming - the craftsman could not provide a large amount of his own production - various things were made to order. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what were the features of trade in the 17th century" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1212189.jpg" width="600"></div>  The expansion of trade relations made it possible to enlarge production - now the artisan could make goods “for future use”, counting on a future buyer.  There is a specialization of crafts - certain regions of the Russian lands become the main producers of certain goods.  For example, Belozerye was famous for its spoons, Nizhny Novgorod craftsmen made strong castles, and Vologda craftsmen wove amazing lace.  So are the regional centers of various crafts. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what were the features of trade in the 17th century in Russia" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1212211.jpg" width="550"></div>

Maybe that is why the cities closest to Moscow - Tula, Kashira, Serpukhov - become the very first centers of domestic metallurgy.  Metalworking, as the most labor-intensive business, demanded considerable labor resources - so hired labor gradually began to be used.  The first manufactory, which used the labor of hired workers, was the Cannon Yard, which arose in the 15th century.  In total, in the 17th century, about thirty different manufactories were created.  For the first time, dynasties of industrialists were formed - the Sveshnikovs, Demidovs, Stroganovs and others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="features of trade in the 17th century" class="if" height="261" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1212214.jpg" width="380"></div>

    <h2>  The development of domestic trade </h2><p>  What were the features of trade in the 17th century in Russia?  The country gradually overcame isolation and gained access to European markets.  A new all-Russian market began to form with its own centers for the development of trade.  The key role was played by large fairs - Arkhangelsk, Irbit, Nizhny Novgorod.  The first buyers appeared - wholesalers who bought goods in large quantities and sold them in smaller wholesale.  Boxing spread - buying ribbons, scarves, scallops, popular prints and simple ornaments at the fair, they went around towns and villages selling their goods to local residents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what were the features of trade in the 17th century briefly" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1212213.jpg" width="468"></div>  The emergence of manufactories, wholesale trade and the development of a network of fairs - these are the main points that give an idea of ​​what were the features of trade in the 17th century on the domestic market of Russia.

Numerous requisitions seriously hindered the promotion of goods on the market, making trade an unprofitable and expensive activity.  But in 1653 a Customs decree was issued, which eliminated inter-county levies, introduced uniform rules for customs duties.  Thus, the tsarist government sought to revive trade within the country. </p><h2>  International trade </h2><p>  What were the features of <span>foreign trade</span> in the 17th century?  Russian merchants not only actively developed domestic trade, but already had access to the markets of northern European countries.  Unfortunately, access to the ice-free Baltic Sea at that time was not available.  Merchants had to use several summer months of navigation in order to get from the northern ports to the markets of Sweden, England, Denmark.  Import and export components of foreign trade during this period remained virtually unchanged compared to previous periods, therefore, in terms of foreign trade relations it is difficult to say what were the features of trade in the 17th century.  As always, the main export items were cereals, furs, flax, hemp, lard, and leather.  Russia imported <span>luxury goods,</span> cloth, industrial equipment, tea, coffee, spices. </p><h2>  Dumping </h2><p>  But thanks to trade unions, the penetration of foreign traders into the Russian market has become commonplace.  Often they interrupted the prices of Russian merchants.  Numerous complaints of the Russian merchants were heard, and in 1667 the <span>Novotrade charter</span> was adopted <span>,</span> thanks to which foreign merchants no longer had the same rights and freedoms in the Russian domestic market.  Foreigners could deal only in bulk and in large bulk - retail was forbidden for them.  Special duties were introduced on imported goods, thanks to which the cost of domestic and imported goods was almost equal.  In addition, new duties successfully replenished the royal treasury. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what were the features of foreign trade in the 17th century" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1212203.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Summing up, we can say what were the features of trade in the 17th century.  Briefly, they boiled down to the emergence of new trade relations, the simplification <span>of trade rules, the</span> development of the domestic market, and the first attempts to protect domestic producers and representatives of trading estates from foreign interference.  And equalizing the value of Russian and foreign goods by introducing special duties stimulated the development of domestic industry. </p>
