Undoubtedly, the majority prefers to while away their leisure near the warm sea and bask in the bright rays of the sun.  The most suitable place for such a pastime is the <span>resort Crimean cities</span> and towns.  But anyone who wants to go there on their own in a private car must understand what you need to be prepared for and what roads are in the Crimea. </p><h2>  Motorway Status </h2><p>  Today, approximately ninety percent of the roads and peninsula highways require repairs.  This conclusion was reached by specialists who examined the entire road network of the republic. </p>

    <p>  The Minister of Transport at the next meeting said that roads of social importance are being restored and restored in Crimea, and an appeal has already been prepared addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic on additional financing for repairs and further maintenance of asphalt pavement in cities and regions of the peninsula. </p><h2>  The first way to travel to Crimea from Russia </h2><p>  If one of the tourists still decides to go on their own to the shores of the Black Sea, then for such a trip there are several options for the route.  The most common of them is the Moscow-Crimea road.  First, from the capital it will be necessary to go to Simferopol highway and drive through the following settlements: Tula, Kursk, Orel and Belgorod.  Then, upon reaching the border, it is necessary to cross it in Cossack Lopani.  Thus, the further path will pass through Ukraine through such cities: Kharkov, Zaporozhye, Dnepropetrovsk and Melitopol. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After this follows Chongar, and after him - Dzhankoy.  Then it remains only to choose the desired resort of the republic and, having left on the roads in the Crimea, quickly get to the intended place. </p><p>  The advantages of this method are the relatively small distance, the lowest fuel costs and the minimum travel time.  But, if you choose this route in the midst of the season, there is the opportunity to get into the kilometer-long queue at the border, thereby losing several hours of your time. </p>

    <h2>  Second route </h2><p>  Another of the most popular ways to get to the peninsula from Russia is the Don highway, which passes through the following cities: Moscow, Rostov, Crimea.  A section of this path also runs through Ukrainian lands.  To do this, first go from the capital through Voronezh, and then Rostov-on-Don.  After that you need to turn towards the west and move through Taganrog, approaching the border with Ukraine. </p><p>  After successfully passing the border service, the route runs through Novoazovsk, Mariupol, Melitopol and Berdyansk.  Having passed these settlements, you will need to turn south and get to Genichesk, and then the roads in Crimea begin. </p><p>  The advantage of this route is that most of the route passes through Russian cities, and the disadvantages are that it is much longer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Third option </h2><p>  This way of travel involves not only a trip by car, but also a ferry.  It also passes through cities such as Moscow, Rostov, Crimea.  Only in this case it will be necessary to turn off not to Taganrog, but to Krasnodar.  From there, the path will lead to Krymsk, Anapa and to the Taman Peninsula, where the car is loaded onto a ferry.  After a short trip by water, the passenger, together with his car, ends up in Kerch and gets on the roads in Crimea. </p><p>  The biggest plus of such a trip is that the entire route runs through the territory of Russia, and its duration is a serious minus. </p>

    <h2>  How else can I get from the capital to the <span>Crimean peninsula?</span> </h2><p>  According to avid travelers, this route is the most interesting and fascinating.  First, follow the Don highway to Voronezh, and then take the bypass road and head to Rossosh.  After this settlement, you will need to turn to the village of Novobeloy, which is divided into two parts by the border between Russia and Ukraine.  Then you need to follow small towns, such as Novopskov, Starobelsk, Novoaydar and Happiness. </p><p>  After them, the Don bypass road leading to Mariupol begins immediately.  Then follows Volodarskoe, Mangush, Berdyansk, and only after Melitopol it is necessary to turn south, that is, towards the Crimea.  The first city to meet tourists will be Dzhankoy. </p><p>  The most significant advantage of this route is that it passes by all the major cities.  Therefore, the road promises to be quiet and calm.  The disadvantage of this method can be considered that it is the longest. </p>

    <h2>  Opinion of motorists </h2><p>  Tourists who came to the peninsula from Russia and personally tried the roads in the Crimea left extremely good reviews about such a trip.  Motorists appreciated not only the satisfactory quality of the tracks, but also the large number of roadside cafes and gas stations encountered during the trip. </p><p>  Since the trip is long, there is always the opportunity to stay in comfortable hotels and motels.  Arriving in Crimea, vacationers also noted the good condition of the road surface, but still you can find unsuccessful sections in some places. </p><p>  Therefore, anyone who decides to get to the Crimean Peninsula in their car can choose any of the proposed routes and feel free to hit the road.  Such a trip promises to be interesting and give a lot of positive impressions, regardless of the number of hours spent on the road. </p>
