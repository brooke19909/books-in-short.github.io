Tourists again began to actively come here, although there are not so many of them as, say, in Greece or Turkey.  Vacationers prefer hotels with a water park, where there are attractions for children and adults.  Unfortunately, it is in this country that they are few.  Why so is unknown.  But those hotels that exist deserve attention and are able to make the holidays the most colorful and memorable.  In addition, you can choose hotels near city water parks.  This is no less attractive and convenient option. </p>

It is located in the resort "Sunny Beach".  Within walking distance is the city center with many other interesting activities.  Various events are constantly held at the hotel itself, so you won‚Äôt be bored.  Moreover, there is a large water park with many slides for vacationers of different age groups: there are high-speed, small, simple, in the form of a gutter.  Also on the territory there are several pools.  It will be nice to know that drinks in the water park are free for hotel guests. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Near Aqua Nevis there is a well-maintained beach.  It also provides plenty of entertainment.  You can even go for a boat ride.

    <h2>  All Inclusive Bulgaria Hotels with Water Park </h2><p>  For many tourists, it is preferable to pay immediately once, so that then you should not think about anything other than relaxation.  These people are suitable hotels that operate on an all-inclusive basis.  Now almost all hotels for complete convenience and to satisfy most of the requirements of their guests offer check-in by several systems, including <span>all inclusive.</span>  For example, Aqua Nevis, <span>Grand Varna Hotel</span> and Kuban in the Golden Sands resort, Sol Luna Bay Resort and Royal Park Hotel in Burgas. </p><h2>  The best city water parks </h2><p>  You can also paint holidays with bright colors with the help of urban water activities, even if you chose Bulgaria hotels with a water park for relaxation.  One of the best is called ‚ÄúAquapolis‚Äù - it is one of the most respectable and beautiful, since a mixture of Moorish and Mediterranean styles was used in the construction.  Action Aquapark and Aqua Planet are also noteworthy.  All objects have many different slides, separate areas for children's games and for adults are equipped.  And you can have lunch in restaurants and bars in the parks. </p>

    <h2>  Alternative - hotels near water parks </h2><p>  If hotels with a water park in Bulgaria for some reason are not suitable (for example, because of the high price), you can choose a hotel near one of the city's water parks.  In the immediate vicinity of the Aquapolis are Apartamentos Inbesal (600 m) and Albeniz (400 m).  Near the Action Aquapark you can find the Nessebar Fort Club (100 m), and if you want to visit the Aqua Planet, you should pay attention to the Sunrise Hotel (100 m). </p>

    <h2>  What do tourists recommend? </h2><p>  The most popular resort is Golden Sands.  It is believed that it is here that the rest will be the best and will surely appeal to small and adult.  Many hotels have water parks or several slides on their territory that will give a lot of emotions and vivid impressions.  Many other activities and services are offered.  It is believed that the best hotels in Bulgaria with a water park are located in this territory. </p><p>  Mixed feelings are evoked by the ‚ÄúResort of Saints Constantine and Helena‚Äù - someone likes it, but someone is, to put it mildly, not happy.  Recommended hotels Rubin, Dolphin and Dolphin Marina.  Just this place is suitable for those who have children, since all the hotels have a lot of kids.  And the kids in the company will not be bored.  They also recommend Albena and Kaliakra, but if the first is quite crowded, then the second is relatively calm. </p><p>  In all of these resorts, hotels have water slides, large or small water parks.  But the price for accommodation, as a rule, in such hotels is higher.  It may happen that in the desired hotel with a water park there will be no places.  Then you can safely book rooms in hotels located near water parks. </p>
