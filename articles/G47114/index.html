Drowning in greenery, cozy, far from the splendor and bustle of large resorts, with a population of three hundred people, Dzhanhot (photo below) like many vacationers. </p>

    <h2>  Contemplative Rest </h2><p>  Tourists can‚Äôt get enough here on the clear sea.  They are attracted by picturesque and comfortable beaches, stunning grandeur rocks, a botanical natural monument - relict forests, almost complete absence of allergen plants.  Having seen such powerful advantages, many believe: a vacation promises to be magnificent! </p><p>  So it will be, however, if you do not consider the above ‚Äúfree application‚Äù to fun discos, parties in cafes, noisy beach events, numerous thematic excursions, which, in your opinion, can not do without.  Then you better choose <span>Gelendzhik, Divnomorskoe</span> or Kabardinka - there is more than <span>enough of</span> this stuff. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, the beaches of Dzhanhot, like the resort farm itself, are more designed for meditators who adore the vibrant, lush <span>nature of the Caucasus.</span>  Tourist infrastructure is limited to one seasonal cafe on the beach, two small shops, a small market, there is a post office.  There are no beach activities.  In general, it is cool here for those who are "secular bustle" rather fed up or never liked. </p><h2>  Luxury bay </h2><p>  This in no way suggests that few people know about the farm or it is not popular.  Try to walk through the private sector in the summer, and you will find: there are very few empty rental rooms.  Thousands of tourists a season is a good confirmation that the coast, the beaches of Dzhanhot attract newcomers, remain in the memory of experienced connoisseurs of relaxation by the sea, who often return here. </p><p>  There is an opinion that a luxurious small bay and the farm itself are one of the most comfortable, expressive places to relax.  The resort "registered" on a long strip running along the coast of the "world's bluest" sea.  Most of those who come to Dzhanhot to "wallow" on the beach to the fullest under the generous Krasnodar sun, admiring the nature, the choice, as a rule, is not disappointed. </p>

    <p>  The sea is such that it‚Äôs a sin not to plunge - exactly the kind that was dreamed of at home on cold winter evenings.  In general, unity with nature is ensured.  But experts call not to build illusions about the "sweet loneliness": in the summer there are many vacationers, nearby are areas allocated for the beaches of children's camps (including the sports and creative Academy of Leadership, the health club Malozemelets).  By the way, the kids in the recreation program have enough contests and discos. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fedor Shcherbina and Vladimir Korolenko </h2><p>  The dzhanhot that stretches along the mountain beauty Hotetsay (by the way, another translation of the unusual name "river flowing along the beam") has a rich history.  In this place once lived Adyghe tribes.  But if we talk about a farm, then its appearance dates back to the end of the 19th century. </p><p>  It is noteworthy: the writer V. G. Korolenko lived and worked on the same slope of the gorge in the estate (at the dacha) of his younger brother for some time (years of life 1853-1921).  Korolenko Sr. chose a site for construction with the help of the Zemstvo leader, historian, author of the book "History of the Kuban Cossack Army" F. Shcherbina. </p><p>  The latter already had land on the opposite slope (the Shcherbin brothers were well-known landowners in the area), he built the estate there.  In the summer, the Korolenko Museum-Estate is actively visited by tourists from different parts of Russia, who have chosen the coast of Dzhanhot for recreation. </p><h2>  Moral obligations </h2><p>  Fedor promoted the resort as best he could, participated in the Russian Riviera exhibition, and made a speech at the congress, as the tour operators of the Black Sea coast would say today, at the Gelendzhik Port and Resort.  V. G. Korolenko visited Shcherbina. </p><p>  Vladimir Galaktionovich saw how Fyodor Andreyevich dreams of populating the place with good people, so that the new land would settle in more quickly, and wished him every success in this difficult matter.  In his letters, Korolenko wrote about the following. </p>

    <p>  ‚ÄúShcherbina is working hard so that culture comes here sooner, which means that she takes on moral obligations to begin development soon.‚Äù  Of course, when managing, the owner pursued not only public, but also personal goals.  But there was a certain balance.  Dzhanhota's beaches were still ‚Äúin the project‚Äù, but there was an excellent swimming pool with services of the highest class (for that time).  The stone parapet of the bath, which Fedor Shcherbina built for summer residents, has been preserved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Lonely Sail Sails </h2><p>  Rest in Janhot is very useful.  <span>Pitsunda pine</span> (a sample of the tertiary flora that has existed on Earth 65-70 million years) emits active substances that inhibit the development of pathogenic bacteria (phytoncides).  Healing air has a beneficial effect on the human respiratory and digestive systems.  Pine forest is spread over a thousand hectares! </p><p>  Mountainous terrain, cliffs covered with mixed forests surrounding the valley.  On the shore there are bays hidden from the eyes, separated from the sea by sand spits, cozy beaches.  Surprising people for years steadily resisting free winds, a monolith of sandstone - rock Sail.  A popular tourist route leads to this natural monument in the form of a wall against the background of the sea. </p><p>  Dzhanhot is located in the region where the subtropical climate spreads, which is not characterized by sharp temperature fluctuations.  Massifs on three sides carefully protect the bay from the wind.  Only the sea "elusive reveler" can "wander" on land to refresh holidaymakers who have filled the beaches of Janhot. </p><h2>  Between Janhot and Paraskoveevka </h2><p>  In high season, the air temperature is comfortable: plus twenty-five degrees (water - plus twenty-three).  Winter is mild, only occasionally does the thermometer drop to zero.  You can swim in the sea for five consecutive months: from mid-May to the very "bottom" of October. </p>

    <p>  The resort village of Paraskoveevka is located very close to Dzhanhot.  If you look at the map, all places for swimming are located between these settlements.  The sloping shores, ready to shelter bathers, are among the cleanest in the whole region. </p><p>  Jahnhot, wild beach - is it fiction or reality?  Pebble beaches are well equipped, demanded by tourists.  However, as you move away from places chosen and inhabited by a person, you can get into a world of lack of abundance of people - this is not a myth. </p><h2>  Where to go swimming </h2><p>  For those who personally visited Dzhanhot, beaches, reviews of places - a matter of life.  They will instantly recommend you where to go swimming.  For example, on Tsentralny beach (the main acting ‚Äúperson‚Äù in the bathing host).  Two hundred meters long, thirty wide, covered with large pebbles.  There is the following "surprise": the depth is growing very quickly.  It will be reported that there are rental points, cafes, a locker room, and parking.  But there is an opinion that there are not enough of them at all. </p><p>  The beach "Eaglet" is the same in length as the Central (almost 200 m) and also large-pebble.  From the main "brother" it is separated by a pier.  This place is considered to be children's, as there are special sections with a fence, for the convenience of children in the sea water.  There is a cafe, a locker room, a viewing platform (viewing). </p><p>  The beach behind the buna is covered with large pebbles, surrounded by high cliffs.  Buna (half-dam) protects the bay from storms.  The entrance to the water is rocky.  Cafes, no locker rooms. </p>

    <h2>  Blue abyss </h2><p>  The beach "Blue Abyss" (Janhot) is a special story.  Rather, the place where he is.  A really interesting area northwest of Janhot.  Directions to her are tickling her nerves: the road is not wide, on one side there is a cliff. </p><p>  Upon arrival, you can find campsites, parking lots.  This is the only place with signs of civilization.  There are people who constantly feel the slope of the terrain towards the sea and are afraid of "rolling down".  But most visitors love risk, they all like it. </p><p>  To reach the beach (narrow strip), you need to overcome a steep, poorly equipped descent.  Therefore, people far from sports in the "Blue Abyss" have nothing to do (except to admire the marvelous expanse from above).  But many deftly make their way to the water and back.  The sandy beach does not occupy too large territories, mainly everywhere - wonderful rounded pebbles of various sizes (pebbles). </p><p>  About the name.  Rocks, reflected in the water, create a shadow, and it seems that before you is a frozen, unique deep abyss.  Not far from the "Blue Abyss" is the beach Sosnovy Bor.  The shore is rocky.  In summer, there is a camp for campers (camping).  We talked about the rock Sail.  There is also a beach, almost 800 meters long.  The coast is rocky, narrow, but the bathing place is comfortable (although deep). </p><p>  There are many wild beaches near the unusual sail-like cliff.  Sometimes they are wide, sometimes very narrow stripes, but in the season and on some, and on the other you can see fervent bathers.  Often these are people who prefer to travel savages. </p><p>  Therefore, moving from Dzhanhot to Paroskoveevka and back, you can see many tourist tents.  They, as they say, under each bush is ready both a table and a house.  For lovers of comfort, all this is not too hearty, and the "robinsons" are just that. </p><h2>  Potter Tour </h2><p>  Wild and secluded relaxation is great.  But should there be at least some entertainment?  There are suggestions: excursions are conducted here on the Dudiny‚Äôs compound.  The head of the family - the master of pottery, has something to show and what to tell tourists about.  Janhot (photo below) is proud of a craftsman. </p><p>  We have already mentioned the house-museum of V. G. Korolenko.  There is a route to Pshad falls.  This is a lot of small cascading flows.  But the path to the goal is not easy - the factor should be taken into account by those who decide to go on the road in order to correctly assess strength. </p><p>  It is interesting to visit Gelendzhik, at 33 waterfalls <span>(Sochi National Park),</span> in the valley <span>of the Zhane River</span> near dolmens (stone tables).  You can relax in Abrau Durso.  Hiking along the coast (or horseback riding around the farm) is popular. </p>

    <h2>  Price and quality </h2><p>  Cafe called "Evening", as well as "Surf" and <span>"Shack", a restaurant</span> at the hotel "Empress" - all this is in the village.  But not only positive feedback gets Janhot.  Rest, the prices of which are too high, impedes the growth of tourist flow.  What about this?  Judge for yourself: rental housing - from three hundred rubles a day or more (depending on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresidence, the initial amount for the most economical). </p><p>  A room in a private mini-hotel is already pulling two thousand two hundred rubles a day.  In the <span>boarding house "Janhot" a</span> standard room costs four thousand eight hundred rubles.  There is a "Sun Valley" (hotel).  "Safonovo" (hotel), "Under the blue roof" (guest house).  You can probably choose the right one. </p><p>  Standard apartments, suites, cottages - there is a choice.  And although there are different opinions about staying in rooms (from plus to minus), everyone can choose the right one for the price and quality. </p><p>  Reviews about the rest are very different: from enthusiastic to those that are "with sadness."  Mostly parents with children wish for the best.  They believe that there are few equipped places for children.  They do not agree with the fact that there are pensions in Janhot with their own beach, assuring that the declared beach at the hotel actually turns out to be a territory divided into sectors. </p><h2>  We are going to Janhot! </h2><p>  Arriving in Janhot, the sandy beach, vast, covered with sparkling grains of sand, is hard to find.  No matter how you move around - stony, with loose blotches.  By the way, about the distances.  From Dzhanhot to Divnomorsk - 10 km (along the coast - 5 km), to Gelendzhik - 25 km (by the coast the ‚Äúmileage‚Äù is reduced to 14 km).  About the depths.  Where Hotetsay flows into the Black Sea, the bottom is steep, but a sandbank stretches to the edges of the beach, and you can walk 15-20 meters, being waist-deep in water. </p>

    <p>  Yes, you can read a lot of different opinions about the rest in Janhot.  This is understandable: it is impossible to be nice to the whole world: neither a person, nor a geographical point.  It is probably too early for farmers to catch butterflies, there is something to work on in terms of improving infrastructure and attracting tourists. </p><p>  But be that as it may, every single guest was admired by nature, most were struck on the spot by the purity of the sea, healing air.  Many are satisfied with the service and generally everything.  How do you know which category you will fall into?  There is only one way out - to go on vacation to Janhot! </p>
