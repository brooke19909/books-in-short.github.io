The very favorable location of the island contributed to prosperity.  He stood on sea routes from Egypt, Asia and Europe.  Among the ten large settlements, the leading function was performed by the city of Knossos, which became the center of the Minoan civilization.

    <p>  In the period up to 2000 BC.  e.  lush palaces were built on the island that served as residences for local kings.  Part was destroyed by earthquakes.  At the place where the ruins of the old building lay, a new one was soon erected.  It is this architectural building that is today considered the <span>hallmark of the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãand pleases the guests of the island. </p><h2>  The mistake of archaeologists </h2><p>  The palace at Knossos had a special purpose.  It focused on political, economic and social life.  This is evidenced by many finds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first studies began back in 1878.  They were conducted by the Greek Minos Kalokerino.  He was interested in a strange hilly area.  The man began work and even found several significant objects in support of the theory that the palace lies underground.  But the excavations had to be stopped due to the ban of the then Turkish authorities. </p><p>  Arthur Evans continued the business in 1900.  The Englishman bought up the lands on which he believed there were chambers.  The goal was to learn as much as possible about the period from 1400 BC.  e.  Therefore, all subsequent layers, which would tell about the further history of this part, were destroyed.  But this was not the only mistake of the archaeologist who discovered Knossos.  This is a city that not only lost several centuries, but did not preserve its original appearance.  During the excavations, Evans restored the found palace, guided by his ideas. </p>

    <h2>  A mixture of myths </h2><p>  The Englishman Sir Arthur is not the first to try to find the legendary castle.  Many centuries before him, researchers excavated in places where the ruins of the complex could lie.  Attracted by archaeologists is not only the historical side and the value of the structure, but also the stories with which it is shrouded. </p><p>  Knossos Palace is a whole cycle of myths related to each other.  Events begin with the fact that Daedalus lived in Athens - a man of divine origin who was second to none in engineering.  But one day, guided by pride, he decided to get rid of his rival student.  Because the man was trying to commit the murder, he was kicked out of the city with shame.  The genius was taken by <span>King Minos.</span>  As a board, Daedalus worked hard.  One of the first orders was a wooden cow for the king‚Äôs wife.  Pasifaya is the name of a woman, thus secretly satisfying her passion for the <span>sacred bull.</span>  Subsequently, she became pregnant and gave birth to the Minotaur - a man with the head of an animal.  It was for this dangerous creature that Daedalus built a maze. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hero's feat </h2><p>  The city of Knossos was only 350 km from Athens.  These two points were combined by one story.  According to legend, the Athenians killed one of the sons of King Minus.  For this, the ruler punished them.  The Greeks paid a terrible tribute: every eight years they sent to the island the 14 most beautiful young people.  This continued until the hero Theseus appeared. </p><p>  The young man was the son of the god Poseidon and the heir to the Athenian king Aegeus.  When the young man found out about the misfortune of his people, he agreed to help.  Together with the captives, the guy went to the terrible monster. </p><p>  The complexity of the feat was not only that it was necessary to confront the strongman bull.  The labyrinth itself became a problem.  Everyone who entered there never returned.  Rescued daughter Minos, who gave Theseus a thread.  The guy tied the beginning to the front door and later, when he defeated the monster, he easily found a way out. </p><h2>  The genius of architecture </h2><p>  In fact, the Knossos palace is a lot of rooms in which it is very easy to get lost.  The huge multi-story building with more than a thousand rooms for various purposes was stunning.  Such a system, according to scientists, arose because every year something was being built to the wards.  The halls were connected by stairs and cunning corridors.  Architects did not think about aesthetics. </p>

So, for example, the complex had plumbing and sewage.  With the help of some pipes, water entered the building, others filled the baths, and others removed the slops.  In the construction there were not only toilet rooms, but also toilet bowls.

    <p>  The total area is 24,000 square meters.  On this territory there was a theater, warehouses, workshops, rooms for worship and, of course, the luxurious chambers of the royal family. </p><h2>  Museum of the past </h2><p>  You can enter the territory through the Western courtyard.  From here begins the tour.  There you can go to the main staircase that connects four floors.  The path along the perimeter runs in a circle.  The first stop is the courtyard, which is divided by three roads.  He once served as a prayer book.  This is evidenced by the altars. </p><p>  One of the most ancient premises is the kulures.  These are large pits that could fulfill the role of both a warehouse for grain and a place for remains after the sacrifice.  The throne room with the stone throne of the ruler is popular among the guests.  Many walls of the corridors and rooms were decorated with frescoes, paintings and expensive metals. </p>

    <h2>  The myth of lovers of myths </h2><p>  Today the complex is one of the most visited places in Greece.  Entrance to the ruins is open to all comers for a nominal fee.  An <span>open-air museum is open</span> daily. </p><p>  Business card attractions - red columns.  Their difference from others is a strange design, because they are devoid of a clear geometry and narrow or expand, forming the effect of irrationality.  Their reconstruction, like many others, was made by Arthur Evans. </p><p>  Despite the fact that only ruins remained of the thousand-year miracle, the palace is still impressive. </p><p>  Many skeptics claim that in fact the inhabitants of the city of Knossos did not recognize symmetry and harmony.  A strange building layout system is associated with this. </p><p>  Interestingly, for the ceremonies on the island of Crete, a double-ended hatchet ‚ÄúLabris‚Äù was used.  It was this word that the ancient Greeks subsequently associated with intricate corridors and secret rooms, which they called the ‚Äúlabyrinth‚Äù.  They also own the legend of the mythical king Minos, the cannibal Minotaur and the hero Theseus. </p><h2>  Wonder of the world </h2><p>  The first palace was defeated by an earthquake around 1700 BC.  e.  The ensemble, which guests of the island observe today, was laid over the next several centuries.  But the building was not destined to survive.  At first, it was partially destroyed by a tsunami caused by a volcano on a neighboring island. </p>

A major fire not only destroyed the building, but also marked the end of the Minoan civilization.  It is worth noting that during excavations, the remains of people were not found.  There is a version that after the eruption, the inhabitants left the island and settled in other regions.
