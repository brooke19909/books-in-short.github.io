    <h2>  Hotel "Northern Crown" </h2><p>  This is a very interesting, even outstanding city hotel.  The Northern Crown (Vyborg) occupies an old building of the 18th century, which is a historical monument.  The building itself is small, only four-story, but it has been preserved just magnificent.  And inside you will find a real fairy tale.  The interiors are very modern and beautiful.  The hotel offers you comfortable accommodation at affordable prices, as well as secure parking.  The hotel is supposed to accommodate in double rooms of the type "economy" and "standard".  There is no pricing information on the official website, however there are many reviews from tourists.  Most of them are words of gratitude to the staff who performed their work quickly, professionally and quietly, but there are also those who report shortcomings.  This claims to the quality of cleaning, to the lack of fumigators and bitterness of water, to cool batteries in the winter.  However, it is quite possible that these are special cases that need to be addressed with the administration. </p><h2>  Hotel "Bat" </h2><p>  The unique appearance of this city has developed over more than seven centuries, and therefore architectural monuments represent different eras and ethnic groups.

These are the House on the Rock, the Church of Hyacinth, the House of the Merchant Verkut and the House of the Rich Citizen, as well as several other buildings.  Moreover, all of them were built before the appearance of the first urban development plan.  In order to examine them all, you must first select a hotel with a convenient location.  This is exactly what the Bat Hotel (Vyborg) is.  Only two minutes walk separates it from the old part of the city, where the main attractions are located.  And just across the road from the hotel, the stunning promenade of the Gulf of Finland begins.

    <h2>  Hotel Braun-House </h2><p>  The original hotel, which is located in a Finnish chopped house.  Nondescript from the outside, it offers the opportunity for a great vacation.  Not all <span>hotels in Vyborg</span> with a pool have affordable prices, so you should pay attention to this.  In total, four rooms are offered, including standard double rooms, with a cost of 3,000 rubles, a family room - 4,500, and a suite with a jacuzzi for 4,000 rubles.  There are three types of saunas, a pool and a fireplace room.  Each room has a whole set of furniture, a TV and a bed, internet is connected.  A kitchen is available for guests and breakfast is included in the price.  The rooms are ideal for couples as well as single travelers.  This hotel is very small, so it‚Äôs hard to find any reviews about it.  However, judging by the description, this is a wonderful hotel, the equal of which is difficult to find in the whole city. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  We have listed far from all the hotels in this city.  They can be called the most popular, the best representatives of their class, but there are dozens, if not hundreds, of excellent hotels that are not so famous, but nevertheless provide services of the same high class.  Before you look for a hotel for yourself, carefully review all the information provided and make the right choice.  Remember that it is not always possible to rely on reviews, since all people are different, their requests and ratings differ.  However, this information is very useful for the initial choice, to weed out something that obviously does not suit you. </p>
