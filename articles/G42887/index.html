    <h2>  Holidays in Ajman </h2><p>  So, before proceeding directly to the topic of what Ajman hotels with their own beach exist in this resort, it is worth noting a few interesting facts about the city itself.  The emirate is famous for its pearl mining, fishing, delicious dates, shipbuilding and, of course, perfumery and furniture.  This city has its own medical institute and a separate university.  Interestingly, due to the size of the emirate, it is not just an airport that is missing - even there are no bus services to other large regions.  So you need to get to Ajman by taxi from the nearby emirates.  But problems should not arise, since the nearest point is <span>Dubai Airport,</span> which is 30 minutes by car from Ajman.  In the emirate, there is something to see, in addition to the warm sea and the gentle sun.  For example, an ancient fort, which is one of the main attractions.  With pleasure, visitors visit the National History Museum.  And, of course, it is impossible not to mention natural attractions: it is a limitless sea, flowering agricultural territories, picturesque mountains.  In general, Ajman has everything you need for your vacation.  And after potential tourists are convinced of this, they begin to search for a temporary residence.  Especially popular is the Ramada Beach <span>Hotel 4 *.</span>  It is necessary to tell more about this place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Convenient location </h2><p>  When choosing a hotel, tourists first of all turn their attention to where and how it is located.  It is important!  Ramada <span>Beach Hotel 4 * is</span> located almost on the seashore.

So, the first thing to be noted is an understandable and, as it is customary to say now, a transparent economy.  Room reservation is carried out without commission, in addition, the hotel regularly receives favorable offers with discounts and promotions.  Also, one cannot fail to note that customers leave positive reviews about the hotel, which will be discussed below.  And, of course, an important and very significant nuance: the hotel staff speaks three languages ‚Äã‚Äã- in Arabic, English and Russian.  Also attracted by the fact that the hotel staff is very attentive.  At the request of the guest, they can deliver food or drinks to their rooms, meet them at the airport, provide ironing services, concierge services, and even a place to store luggage.  The hotel has an elevator and <span>smoking area.</span>  Private smoking rooms are also available.  However, this type of reservation is possible if these rooms are free.  I must also say that the prices for vacations in this hotel are very affordable: you can spend 6 nights together in such a wonderful resort, paying only 2128 dollars for a ticket, checking into a standard room and eating only breakfast in the hotel restaurant.  If you need a room of the highest category - Two Bedroom Suite - and the all-inclusive system, then you have to fork out for $ 3208.  In a word, you can choose everything for every taste and prosperity. </p>

If the child is more than five years old, then you will need to pay extra 100 AED per night.  This room can accommodate a maximum of one crib or extra bed.  By the way, this issue should be discussed with hotel representatives in advance - it is necessary for the administration to confirm the implementation of this service.
