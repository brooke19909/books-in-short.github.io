  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to tie a woman’s knot, options and methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There is no need to talk about the reliability of the Indian knot, since the technique of its creation does not differ in strength and endurance.  Due to repeated winding of a rope or thread, a volumetric connection is created, but under heavy or static load it quickly unwinds.  There are several methods and options for tying, which differ in the level of complexity.  A woman’s knot is used both in everyday life and in various fields of human activity. </p><h2>  Application options </h2><p>  Basically, a woman’s knot is used in everyday life for tying threads of different thicknesses or rope tension.  Due to the frequent slipping and the inability to quickly untie, sailors sometimes use it in the fleet, but only in exceptional cases when it comes to a possible danger to life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.canva.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knot tying" class="if uuid-2608276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2608276.jpg"></div><p>  In needlework, the technique is used only for decoration in seam techniques.  This is one of the few options where you can combine different in texture and density of the thread to create a three-dimensional plexus.  The knot belongs to the connecting one, therefore it is often used in places of breaking the rope or for tensioning. </p><h2>  Simple technique </h2><p>  You can knit a woman’s knot in different ways, from simple ones (reliability will be low) and ending with a multi-stage action to create a strong and strong knot.  For the process, you need to take a rope with one running end and tie a half-loop with another, the strength in the future will depend on the tension of the thread, if you need to pull the rope, the loop will tie tightly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="briontoss.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple woman knot" class="if uuid-2608299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2608299.jpg"></div><p>  After that, in exactly the same way, by the already existing stretch, tie another loop, pressing it tightly to the previous one.  The result is a tight stretch and a strong knot.  Unfortunately, due to the slipping of the threads, it will not be durable and may become loose over time, so it is worth considering the reliability factor when choosing the place of application. </p><h2>  Strong knot </h2><p>  To create a more reliable loop, another technique is used, which allows due to simple actions to reliably connect two elements of the thread.  Knit step by step a woman’s knot according to the instructions: </p><ul><li>  Make a simple knot with a rope crossing.  Tighten as much as required during use. </li><li>  Bend one part of the rope in half, grasping the other, and pull.  It should be a crossover, as in the Celtic knot. </li><li>  Tighten stronger. </li></ul><p>  The peculiarity of the sealed knot is that it will not untie at a crucial moment, and due to the interweaving of the rope elements, the risk of slipping is reduced.  But he will not be able to withstand a high load, so it is better not to use this technique to create control nodes.  Untie the knot yourself without load will not work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="survivallife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="strong knot" class="if uuid-2608281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2608281.jpg"></div><p>  You can enhance its safety with the help of an additional loop, but this will only work if there is sufficient supply of threads.  Knots are not always created on ropes with a normal length, often the connection occurs on the individual elements of the thread that are broken. </p><h2>  Options and replacement </h2><p>  An alternative to the knot's knot can be a straight line that is tied in a similar way, but with a different arrangement of rope elements.  Thanks to the <span>straight knot,</span> you can create the necessary stretch and get a strong rope.  By pulling the rope through the loop, you can create a strong knot, and so that the sliding force does not interfere with the strength, add another loop.  The tension can only be fixed when the hinges are at the desired length.  After tying the right knots are difficult to correct.  A good alternative for this type is the Celtic knot, but it is suitable only for thick threads and coarse ropes, in other cases you can use the technique of a strong or straight knot. </p>
