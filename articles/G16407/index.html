    <h2>  History and Economics </h2><p>  The village of White Clay of the <span>Krasnodar Territory</span> was founded in 1820 by Voronezh peasants.  It got its name thanks to the huge deposits of kaolin, which is mined in pits on the banks of the river.  This clay is highly plastic and was previously used for making dishes.  Today, the most famous hereditary pottery professionals live in the village. </p><p>  The settlement became part of the district in 1924, and over the twelve years of its existence it has been a part of the Southeast Region, the North Caucasus and the Azov-Black Sea Territory.  The village became part of the Krasnodar Territory only in the autumn of 1937. </p><p>  The economy of the region is based on diversified agriculture and processing industry.  The agricultural complex here consists of thirteen farms of the collective sector and four hundred peasant farms.  Large are engaged in the cultivation of sugar beets, the production of meat, milk and sunflower seeds.  And one of the highly specialized enterprises is focused on fruit crops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Every year, an agricultural culture is growing in the region, new technologies are actively used, which helps to get an excellent crop, even under not very good climatic conditions.

    <p>  In the full sense of the word, there are no attractions in the area, but there are a number of cultural monuments worthy of attention, for example: </p><ul><li>  Museum of the first hero of the USSR pilot A.V. Lyapidevsky; </li><li>  a memorial dedicated to the memory of the heroes of those who died in World War II, established in 1974; </li><li>  a monument to the victims of fascism, which can be found four kilometers from the administrative center (on its territory in 1942-1943 more than 3,500 thousand innocent people were killed by Hitler troops); </li><li>  a monument to the young generation of the thirties, erected in 1995; </li><li>  a monument to the pilot S. Belousov shot down in 1942. </li></ul><p>  Among the architectural monuments, the secondary school building built back in 1903, as well as the musical school building erected at the expense of landowners in the late eighteenth century, stands out.  It was from the balcony of this house in 1920 that Mikhail I. Kalinin spoke. </p><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  The central park alley is a real pride of the village, in beauty it is not inferior to the alleys of large cities.  Its coziness has a pleasant calm rest and unhurried walks.  All paths are paved, and flowers and trees stretch on both sides.  At the end of the alley is a year-round fountain and a memorial with eternal flame. </p><p>  The banks of numerous rivers (Rassypnaya, Meklet, Tatarka and Kalala) are overgrown with reeds in which waterfowl are found, therefore hunting is developed and popular in the region and there are several large stocked ponds. </p><p>  On the territory of the village work the Museum of Local History, the House of Culture.  Zvyagin, a cinema under the Soviet name "Drummer", a central and children's library and a sports complex. </p>
