Commemorative Coins of Cuba</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Republic of Cuba at one time maintained very friendly relations with the USSR.  Therefore, thousands of Soviet citizens had the opportunity to visit this distant country.  Many houses still have light aluminum coins from Liberty Island.  We will talk about them in our article. </p><h2>  Cuban money </h2><p>  Cuba is an island nation located in the Caribbean.  The country's currency is Cuban <span>Peso (Peso</span> Cubano).  International code: CUP.  On the island there are both paper banknotes and coins.  One peso consists of 100 centavos.  In addition, the second <span>currency of Cuba</span> is the so-called convertible peso.  It replaces dollars and is intended for foreign diplomats and tourists. </p><p>  The history of the Cuban currency dates back to 1857.  It was then that the island began to print its internal banknotes, which were called pesos.  One peso was equal to eight Spanish reals.  The very first Cuban coins were minted in 1915.  The author of their design was Charles Barber, who had previously developed the appearance of a half-dollar coin for the United States.  These coins depicted the poet and publicist Jose Marti, the ‚ÄúApostle of Independence‚Äù of Cuba. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.coinshome.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cuban coins photo" class="if uuid-2623582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2623582.jpg"></div><h2>  Cuban coins: pesos and centavos </h2><p>  Today, only seven coins are in circulation in Cuba.  These are 1 and 3 pesos, as well as 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 centavos. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In July 2004, a Cuban coin of 40 centavos in value was withdrawn from circulation. </p><p>  The subject of images on the banknotes of Cuba is extremely diverse.  So, on the coins of this country you can see the faces of presidents, writers, poets, scientists and saints.  Many of them depict important historical events, cities, temples, architectural monuments, plants and animals, ships and fishing boats (how could the island state be without them?). </p><h2>  Commemorative and colored coins </h2><p>  Between 1962 and 2011, about two hundred commemorative coins were minted in Cuba.  They were timed to various anniversary dates and all sorts of significant events in Cuban history.  Most of these coins are made of copper-nickel alloy and are of high artistic value.  As a rule, these are coins with a face value of one peso. </p><p>  Among the commemorative Cuban coins, it is worth highlighting one peso of 1980, dedicated to the XXII Olympic Games in Moscow.  On his obverse are three Olympic sports - boxing, weightlifting and javelin.  No less interesting is the 1981 series of coins dedicated to the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America.  They depict three Spanish ships on which Columbus set off on his landmark journey - Pinta, Santa Maria and Nina.  Noteworthy is the commemorative coin of 2010, which displays the meeting of E. Hemingway with Fidel Castro. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.argcollectibles.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="colored cube coins" class="if uuid-2623584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2623584.jpg"></div><p>  Separately, it is worth talking about colored Cuban coins (see photo above).  They were produced in the 90s and 2000s.  These coins depict various representatives of the flora and fauna of the Cuban region.  Among them are turner, orchid, pink flamingo, stingray, woodpecker, pelican and other animals and plants. </p><h2>  The cheapest and most expensive coins of Cuba </h2><p>  Among the cheapest (meaning collection value) are very light Cuban coins of the 70-80s, made of aluminum.  On their obverse is a five-pointed star and the inscription Patria y Libertad (‚ÄúHomeland and Freedom‚Äù).  Denomination is indicated in Roman numerals.  The reverse decorates the national <span>emblem of Cuba.</span>  Such coins can be purchased at a price of 50 to 100 rubles. </p><p>  One of the most expensive Cuban coins, according to the Numismat Internet club, is a 10 peso silver coin, issued in 1990.  It depicts the famous navigator Christopher Columbus.  The coin contains 5 ounces of pure silver.  Its approximate price is about 10 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.filateliamonge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cuban peso coins" class="if uuid-2623583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2623583.jpg"></div><p>  Among numismatists, a silver coin in denomination of 5 pesos is also valued (year of issue - 1988).  On its obverse is the Zeppelin airship.  The site numizmatik.ru offers to purchase this Cuban coin for 6800 rubles. </p>
