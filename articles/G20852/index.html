    <h2>  What does the regulator consist of? </h2><p>  The main element of the regulator is considered to be a thyristor.  The zener diode in the system is usually installed alone.  In turn, the number of resistors depends on the type of model.  Additionally, a resistor must be provided in the circuit, which is connected to the capacitor through a fuse.  At the output of the system there are special <span>resistors of variable</span> type. </p><h2>  The principle of operation of the device </h2><p>  The work of the regulator begins with the appearance of spark breakdowns in the system.  At this stage, the thyristor is turned on.  Its main task is to suppress the signal.  At this moment, he changes the angle.  Depending on the settings of the device, its gradual increase further occurs.  The increase in the angle is carried out using transistors.  To convert energy in the circuit, a capacitor is installed.  With overloads, a simple voltage regulator on the thyristor copes with a fuse.  Additionally, diodes can be used in the models. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Functions Performed </h2><p>  The main function of the voltage regulator is considered to be the change in the breakdown frequency.  Additionally, devices are able to influence the rate of deionization.  This is largely due to the various modes of operation.  Automatic shutdown in models is provided.  In this case, voltage recovery occurs rather quickly.  Also of note is the primary current function.  It consists in controlling the voltage limit value.  The secondary current function involves adjusting the thyristor opening angle.  In an emergency, voltage regulators can block interference.  Diagnostics of power supplies can also be carried out. </p>

    <h2>  Manual mode </h2><p>  To change the device parameters manually, the controller usually has <span>touch panels.</span>  By default, all metrics are reset.  Values ‚Äã‚Äãare controlled by controlling the central unit.  Algorithms for tasks depend on the structural elements of the device </p><h2>  Features of automatic operation </h2><p>  In automatic mode, there is no need to adjust the voltage limit.  The current of the electrostatic precipitator will also be regulated independently.  The deionization time in this case depends on the chosen algorithm.  The step of reducing the voltage will also depend on it.  To increase the current, individual settings are entered. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Homemade Regulators </h2><p>  A homemade voltage regulator on a thyristor 12V can be done.  <span>The coefficient of performance</span> will be no more than 70%.  Thyristors are easiest to use with the marking "KU202".  Zener diodes set different power.  A lot in this situation depends on which resistors are used.  The most simple types are considered "MLT".  In turn, transistors should be taken as a minimum of the "KT3" series. </p><p>  If we consider the resistors of the MLT-2 series, then their resistance indicator is at around 2 kOhm.  Thus, the capacitor in the network must be good.  Choosing the K73 model, you should know that it is designed for a voltage of 250 V. In this case, the maximum deviation in the network cannot exceed 10%.  Fuses in regulators are usually set to 10 A. </p><h2>  Dinistor Regulators </h2><p>  The voltage regulator 220V on a thyristor of this type differs from conventional devices in that it has two outputs.  There are usually three analog channels installed in the system.  Due to this, the measurement of the amplitude of the oscillations occurs rather quickly.  The output voltage of many models reaches just over 230 V. A filtering system is available in the regulators.  For synchronization in models there is only one channel. </p>

    <p>  The minimum voltage in it is maintained at 210 V. Two channels are provided for discrete control of the device.  The output current parameter is quite high due to the good quality of signal transmission.  The minimum opening angle of the thyristor is 160 degrees.  At the same time, you can set 200 degrees.  <span>The power consumption of</span> regulators of this type reaches no more than 20 kW.  In terms of dimensions, we can say that the devices are not too bulky and weigh about 2 kg on average. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What is the difference between models with triode thyristors? </h2><p>  The triode voltage regulator on the thyristor (the circuit is shown below) is different in that it does not pass the return signal.  As a result, it is rather difficult to control current pulses.  Regulators of this type are usually used in conjunction with low-frequency devices.  They work, as a rule, in automatic mode.  There are three analog channels in this configuration.  The input voltage parameter fluctuates around 24 V. </p><p>  In this case, the maximum deviation in the circuit can be 15%.  There are two synchronization channels in the device.  Thus, the limit frequency can be adjusted.  For discrete control, there are two output channels.  The minimum thyristor angle in the system is 150 degrees.  The maximum is the ability to set it an average of 180 degrees.  The power consumption of many models is 220 V. In terms of dimensions, these devices are quite different. </p>

    <h2>  Lockable Thyristor Properties </h2><p>  These voltage regulators on thyristors are called lockable, because they are able to turn off using a current pulse.  At this time, the reverse current also changes.  The disadvantages of this type include a low coefficient of performance.  Most models of this type are available in single-phase, however, two-phase modifications also exist. </p><p>  <span>The</span> regulators maintain the <span>voltage limit</span> at 110 V. The maximum deviation in the circuit can be only 10%.  Thyristor voltage regulators are able to maintain the rated frequency at 50 Hz.  The device can withstand a current load of 1 A. Automatic control in many models is provided by the manufacturer.  As a result, you can change the discrete value of the current.  Thus, it is possible to directly influence the alternating cycle, on which the power of the electric motor depends. </p>

    <p>  Display systems in the devices are very diverse.  Most often on the market you can find four-digit displays.  With their help, you can quite comfortably observe all the indicators of the voltage regulator.  There are also stepped display systems.  Their feature is fast data processing.  For more accurate indicators, bar-mounted indicator systems are installed in the voltage regulators on thyristors.  They also process information fairly quickly.  Finally, the last type of indicator systems can be called LED devices. </p><h2>  Combined shut-off regulators </h2><p>  The combined turn-off voltage regulator on the thyristor (the circuit is shown below) is very similar to lockable devices.  At the same time, turning it off takes a little longer.  Most models today are made single-phase.  The parameter of the supplied voltage on average is about 120 V. The limit frequency of such regulators fluctuates around 30 Hz.  Automatic control is provided for them. </p><p>  Additionally, it should be noted the possibility of operation using feedback.  As a result, the quality of the output signal increases significantly.  The resistive load voltage regulators on the thyristors withstand poorly, and this should be considered.  The average power consumption of devices is 8 watts.  Indication systems, as a rule, are provided for sensory ones.  However, there are line patterns for displaying data.  Additionally, the regulators have fans for cooling the resistors.  With their help, you can achieve a significant increase in efficiency.  Rectifiers with a <span>thyristor voltage regulator of</span> this type can also be installed on an electric motor. </p>

    <h2>  Models with Triacs </h2><p>  Thyristors in such models are parallel to each other.  The current carrying capacity in this case increases significantly.  The voltage in the circuit can pass in all directions.  Bipolar pulses by the regulator are perceived well due to the large number of analog channels.  The input voltage parameter is usually 50 watts. </p>

    <p>  There are 3 channels for synchronization in the device. Due to them, the voltage in the circuit is kept large.  The permissible current is 3 A. The resistance of the transistors is maintained at around 4 MPa.  The supply voltage of the system in many models is 240 V. Thus, the limit frequency can be at the level of 45 Hz.  The angle of the thyristor in the regulator depends solely on the magnitude of the voltage of the input signal. </p><h2>  Overview of Avalanche Regulators </h2><p>  The avalanche DC voltage regulator on the thyristor is called so because the characteristics of the device increase with time, and the indicators become more and more.  A distinctive feature of these devices can be safely considered good resistance to various vibrations.  Due to this model of this type are absolutely not afraid of overvoltage.  The areas of use of avalanche regulators are quite extensive.  Most often they are used for the normal operation of high-frequency equipment for pumping liquid. </p><p>  The average number of analog channels is 3. The input voltage in the circuit is maintained at 230 V. For synchronization, there is only 1 channel in the circuit.  The limiting frequency is quite stable.  If we consider the voltage regulator on the thyristor "Ku202n", then the parameter of the permissible current fluctuates around 2 A. The resistance in the circuit is maintained on average about 3 MPa.  The supply voltage in the models is 230 V. The power consumption in this case depends on the manufacturer. </p>
