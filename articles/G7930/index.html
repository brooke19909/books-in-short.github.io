According to a common version, he was the son of Prince Ivan Alexandrovich, and according to another - Ivan Korotopol.  At the same time, both of his alleged fathers belonged to the same branch of the Rurikovich, being cousins. </p><h2>  Prince's biography </h2><div class="photo" data-original="frolovchik.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Prince Oleg" class="if uuid-2543337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2543337.jpg"></div><p>  Prince Oleg Ryazansky was born in 1335.  Around 1350, he received the city of Rostislavl, which has not survived to this day, from the heirs of Yaroslav Pronsky. </p><p>  He was a very warlike ruler.  Prince Oleg Ryazansky ravaged yet another Old Russian city - Lopasnyu, which was located on the border of Ryazan lands and which has not survived to our time.  He did this to avenge his ancestor, Prince Constantine, whom Yuri III killed in Moscow.  Oleg Ivanovich hosted the Moscow boyars in his residence, who were unhappy with the reign of Ivan II. </p><p>  He played a role in the era of the Great Memorial.  Before power was concentrated in Mamaia‚Äôs hands, he, united with Vladimir Pronsky, as well as Tit Kozelsky, defeated Beck Tagay in 1365.  This happened at the Shishevsky forest. </p><p>  Prince Oleg Ryazansky also became famous for the fact that from 1370 to 1387 he made repeated attempts to maintain the independence of his principality, which was most often subjected to raids by the Horde. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Suspicions of treason </h2><p>  In Russian history, Prince Oleg Ivanovich is often evaluated negatively because of suspicions of his betrayal during the Battle of Kulikovo.  Basically, they are based on negotiations conducted by the prince with Mamai and Jagailo against Dmitry Ivanovich. </p><div class="photo" data-original="slavyanskaya-kultura.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Betrayal of prince Oleg" class="if uuid-2543341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2543341.jpg"></div><p>  Most interpret this as treason to the princes, who decided to unite against the Mongol yoke.  At the same time, some researchers believe that this was a delicate political game, the main purpose of which is to save their lands from ruin. </p><p>  Thus, the Grand Duke of Ryazan sought to persuade Dmitry to meet Mamay before he was on the Ryazan land, and also deliberately tried to mislead Jagiel and Mamai, regarding the likely connection with him in the Oka region. </p><p>  Moreover, the very existence of such a conspiracy has repeatedly been called into question by Russian historians.  The main attacks on Oleg are contained in the Simeon Chronicle.  Many are sure that these are later inserts, since such information is not available in other annals of that period. </p><p>  Moreover, in Zadonshchina, which, as is reliably known, was written shortly after the Battle of Kulikovo, Oleg is not mentioned even once.  Therefore, his alliance with Mamaia remains a big question, and the rumors that Prince Oleg Ryazansky could participate on the side of the Tatars in the Battle of Kulikovo were spread by his opponents to take possession of Ryazan lands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="diletant.media" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kulikovo battle" class="if uuid-2543339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2543339.jpg"></div><p>  As a result, only in 1381, Oleg Ryazansky recognized himself as a "younger brother", having concluded an agreement with Dmitry.  His cunning policy bore fruit, the powerful army of Mamaia was destroyed, the Ryazan principality was saved from ruin, and its own squad was preserved.  In fact, from this moment, the annexation of the Ryazan principality to the Moscow state began, although officially it ended only in 1456. </p><p>  A new round of confrontation with the Tatars happened when in 1382 Tokhtamysh attacked Russia.  Dmitry did not have time to gather strength.  Oleg, in order to save his lands again from ruin, pointed them to the fords on the Oka River.  But Ryazan was still partially plundered when the army returned back.  In the same fall, Dmitry made a punitive expedition to Ryazan.  After this, the need for the annexation of the Ryazan principality to the Moscow state became apparent. </p><h2>  Participation in the Perevitsky cue ball </h2><p>  In the history of Russia, the Perevitsky cue ball is also often mentioned.  It happened when in 1385 Oleg took advantage of the fact that Moscow was weakened after the invasion of Tokhtamysh.  He set off on a campaign to the future Russian capital, capturing Kolomna. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Battle of Perevitsky, which almost left no trace in history, is relevant to this period, but it is of great importance for the entire state.  It happened in the spring of 1385.  The Moscow army was commanded by Vladimir Andreevich Serpukhovskaya, whom Ryazan detachments completely defeated. </p><p>  The focus was precisely on Kolomna, which was taken by force from Moscow at the very beginning of the century, as well as the fact that Oleg remained neutral in the Battle of Kulikovo. </p><h2>  Attack on the Principality of Moscow </h2><p>  Prince Oleg carefully thought out everything and on March 25, 1385 attacked the Moscow principality.  Moscow did not hesitate to answer, gathering a powerful army under the command of Prince Vladimir Serpukhov.  Learning about this, Oleg hastened to leave Kolomna, as he felt that he was not able to keep the city.  He took his troops just to Perevitsk.  It was a powerful, well-fortified fortress located on the borders of the Ryazan principality. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the Moscow forces were defeated in that battle, however, most chronicles are silent about this event.  A certain decisive role in the confrontation was played by the fact that the river flood began.  Because of him, Muscovites could not strike back, and besides, they were very weakened. </p><p>  Dmitry Ivanovich was actually squeezed into a corner.  He was forced to send a rich ransom to rescue the prisoners, but the ambassadors returned twice empty-handed. </p><p>  Ryazan insisted on territorial concessions from Moscow.  This war, which ended in failure for the future capital principality, Yelets was subordinated to Ryazan. </p><h2>  The role of Sergius of Radonezh </h2><p>  In fact, neighboring principalities at that moment were on the verge of another internecine war.  They managed to escape it only thanks to Sergius of Radonezh.  The saint made Dmitry and Oleg make peace.  They strengthened it in 1387, when Oleg gave his son Fedor out for his daughter Dmitry Sofya. </p><div class="photo" data-original="logos-podcasting.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sergius of Radonezh" class="if uuid-2543343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2543343.jpg"></div><p>  Sergius asked Dmitry to go with the embassy in Ryazan.  He was in no hurry, having waited two months, only when the Christmas fast began, hit the road.  The fact is that one of the key contents of this particular post is repentance.  A person is aware of all his sins and forgives the errors of other people. </p><p>  From Moscow to the guard joined the prince and the boyars.  On horseback train they went to Ryazan.  Having passed Kolomna, a moleben was served.  Once on the Ryazan side, they were accompanied by people of the Ryazan prince.  In the Philippines post, they arrived in Pereslav-Ryazan. </p><h2>  The agreement between Oleg and Dmitry </h2><p>  The peace treaty concluded between the princes Oleg and Dmitry, is described in detail by the historian Ilovaysky.  He notes that Oleg at that time was sharply criticized by the chroniclers and their followers.  This world was especially remarkable in that it actually lived up to its name by becoming eternal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="konek-shema.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holy Prince Oleg" class="if uuid-2543338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2543338.jpg"></div><p>  After that, there were no wars between Dmitry Donskoy and Oleg Ivanovich, even their descendants no longer went against each other.  In the place of fierce and bloody struggle came neighborly and friendly relations, which were reinforced by family ties.  The Ryazan principality managed to extend its politically independent existence by about 125 years. </p><p>  Sergius blessed to open a monastery in Kolomna, which has become a kind of apple of discord.  Since then, Oleg in every possible way began to support his son-in-law, Prince Smolensk Yuri Svyatoslavich, when he opposed the Lithuanian Vitovt, who was trying to capture the city.  At the same time, clashes took place in Ryazan and Lithuanian territories from 1393 to 1401. </p><p>  Before his death, Oleg accepted monasticism; he was tonsured a monk under the name Joachim.  This happened in the Solotchinsky monastery, founded by him 18 kilometers from the capital of the principality. </p><h2>  Oleg's death </h2><p>  Prince Oleg died in 1402.  First, he was buried in a stone coffin on the territory of the Solotchinsky monastery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.temples.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Solotchinsky monastery" class="if uuid-2543342" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2543342.jpg"></div><p>  The monastery was closed during the Soviet era in 1923.  Then the remains of the prince were transferred to the Ryazan Provincial Museum.  Already in 1990, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, they were transferred to St. John the Theological Monastery, and in 2001 they finally returned to the Solotchinsky monastery.  In the end, Oleg and his wife were reburied in the cathedral of the Ryazan Kremlin. </p><h2>  Board Assessment </h2><p>  Today, differently assess the period of the reign of Prince Oleg.  It is worth recognizing that he had a difficult and controversial fate, the evil fame about him has survived to the present day, although, probably, all this became the work of later chroniclers. </p><p>  Although he was considered by many a traitor, he was recognized as a saint as a result.  The prince was often called the "second Svyatopolk" for his cruelty and treachery.  But at the same time he was loved in Ryazan, because he did everything possible to protect his city from ruin, for the sake of this he was even ready to negotiate with enemies.  He became one of the brightest and most significant figures in Russian history of the XIV century. </p><p>  Prince Oleg was a very influential and authoritative figure, for example, he often acted as an arbiter in disputes between Moscow and Tver princes. </p><h2>  Memory of the prince </h2><p>  Today, a monument to Prince Oleg is installed in Ryazan.  He appeared in 2007. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Oleg Ryazansky" class="if uuid-2543336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2543336.jpg"></div><p>  Zurab Tsereteli worked on the project of the monument in the Cathedral Square of Ryazan.  Its official opening was timed to celebrations in honor of the 70th anniversary of the Ryazan region. </p><p>  Today it is one of the main decorations of the Cathedral Square of Ryazan.  Tsereteli‚Äôs monument itself was donated to Ryazans. </p>
