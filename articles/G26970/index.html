It captures the length of time from the beginning of the formation of society <span>(BC</span> 800-1000 thousand years) to the appearance of the first feudal formations (the beginning of our era, the first centuries).  This concept covers two huge historical periods, which many have known since school days as a primitive society and a slave system. </p><p>  The definition of the Ancient World cannot be given in a few words.  This concept is capacious, including the events of a huge period of human development.  If it‚Äôs easier to talk about the time period, then this is the period that began in the <span>prehistoric era</span> and ended at the beginning of the Middle Ages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient world is" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2074698.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Many people know that Ancient Greece, which is a country with a surprisingly turbulent history and developed culture, is the birthplace of philosophy, and it is from there that the Olympic Games that have survived to the present day have their origin.  Many people know that gunpowder and paper were invented in China, and the long Great Wall of China was built. </p><p>  One of the most important stages in the development of the Ancient World is the formation and prosperity of the great Roman Empire, which for many centuries has been the largest and most powerful state of antiquity.  In the Ancient East, states were formed in those days, amazing structures were built - the great pyramids that have survived to this day in Egypt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient History: Definition" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2074658.jpg"></div>

These are the most important city-countries created by Greek tribes.  This is a union of slave cities in Italy, led by Ancient Rome. </p><p>  By the end of the 1st century BC, Rome had become the capital of the Empire, which included all the countries of the Mediterranean, part of the Black Sea coast and many Western European countries.  Slave labor was more widespread in this state than in Greece and the East.  Due to the brutal exploitation of forced labor, the highest culture was created here, which became the basis for the subsequent development of the peoples of Europe. </p><p>  Greek scientists and thinkers laid the foundation for many scientific knowledge, and they gave their names to many branches of science.  Theater first appeared in Greece.  Having mastered the Greek culture, the Romans made remarkable discoveries in the field of construction technology.  They first developed the science of court and law. </p><p>  It turns out that the Ancient World is all kinds of transformations in almost all areas of human activity: in science, culture, construction, etc. All this has become the basis for the further successful development of all mankind. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is the Ancient World: a brief definition" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2074650.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How did it end? </h2><p>  How did it all begin and how did it end?  Ancient Rome at first was a small village located on the banks <span>of the Tiber River.</span>  After a long period of time, he turned into the capital of a great, powerful power, which captured, one might say, almost the whole world.  But over time, he became exhausted in the fight against slaves and conquered peoples.  The Roman state fell as a result of numerous attacks by barbarian tribes and again split into many parts.  The peoples who seized the territory of the former great empire formed their kingdoms and began to create their own civilization. </p><p>  This is the final point in the history of the Ancient World - the fall of the Western Roman Empire. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  <span>The definition of the history of the</span> Ancient World is quite capacious.  It should be noted that many writers, poets, historians and scholars of those times made a valuable contribution to the treasury of <span>world culture</span> .  The same Roman poetry had a significant impact on the great European poets, among which A.S. Pushkin, G.R. Derzhavin and many others. </p>
