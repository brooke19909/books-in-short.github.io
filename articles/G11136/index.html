    <h2>  Name History </h2><p>  The first mention of the small monastery of St. Nicholas on Pesca dates back to 1473.  It arose on the site of a graveyard, and a little later around a small monastery there appeared a small village of 5 yards, called Nikolskoye on Sand.  In the documents there is a record that in 1618 it was here that a solemn meeting of Filaret, who later became the patriarch, was organized.  He was returning from Polish captivity.  Not far from this small monastery was the village of Aksinino, in the parish school of which the throne was transferred in the middle of the 17th century, and Nikolina Gora, so they began to call this place, was empty for three long centuries. </p><h2>  Rebirth </h2><p>  The second life of this area begins in the twenties, when in the beautiful pine forests of the Moscow region, summer cottages begin to be actively built.  In the years 1922‚Äì1925, cottages were erected by the cottage-building cooperative of workers at the Academy of Sciences and Arts (RANIS).  The terrain here is wonderful, the hill is almost completely surrounded by a river (Moscow), a stream (Maslovsky, or the Uborka river) and two swamps (Maslovsky from the north, Aksinsky from the west).  The beautiful beaches of Diplomatic (embassy staff loved to go here) and Koroviy added charms to these already wonderful places.  Century-old forest (pine forest) is the main attraction of these places.  The built village became popular and was known as Nikolina Gora. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Center of culture </h2><p>  Workers of science and culture who lived here on short visits or permanently, as composer Sergei Prokofiev brought him fame.  The whole country knew the names of the owners of local dachas: O. Yu. Shmidt and P. L. Kapitsa, V. I. Kachalov and S. V. Mikhalkov, V. V. Veresaev and A. S. Novikov-Priboy, <span>M. M Botvinnik</span> and A. V. Nezhdanova.  And so many other great people.  There were no current fences in those days, world celebrities freely visited, made friends and talked to.  In connection with the artist Pyotr Konchalovsky, Nikolina Gora - the house where his <span>gifted children,</span> grandchildren and great-grandchildren lived and stayed - is mentioned much more often than in connection with other figures of science and culture.  The large family of Mikhalkov and Konchalovsky is famous for the fact that each of its representatives is a well-known and public person.  They were jokingly called the ‚Äúchicks of Petrovna‚Äôs nest,‚Äù meaning Granddaughter of Surikov, daughter of Peter Konchalovsky, wife of Sergei Mikhalkov, mother of Andrei Konchalovsky, Nikita Mikhalkov, Ekaterina Semenova (wife of Julian Semenov) - Natalya Petrovna Konchalovskaya.  A talented poetess, children's writer, translator, incredibly interesting person, she was loved by the whole huge family.  She is familiar to modern people as the author of the translation of the song ‚ÄúEternal Love‚Äù.  Amazing poems.  Nikolina Gora, like Peredelkino, were at that time a kind of cultural center, where many sought to get. </p><h2>  Modern news </h2><p>  Now Nikolina Gora, like other settlements of this kind, are becoming, for the most part, lordly settlements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Husky park nikolina gora" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/797014.jpg" width="590"></div>  This concept includes not only magnificent mansions, excellent infrastructure, but also recreation places of the corresponding class.  Therefore, it is not at all surprising that it is here that such an exotic place as Husky Park appears.  Nikolina Gora, this village of celestials, as they used to call it, referring not to the current nouveau riche people who buy everything, but to great scientists, artists and writers, is itself a landmark that many Muscovites and guests of the capital would like to visit.  And the opportunity to ride a deer or the beauties of a husky, just take a walk along the pine forest with her, turns this place into a pilgrimage center.

Given this factor, elite complexes or detached cottages such as Sosnovy Bor, Ship Pines, Maslovo and Cotton Way villages are being built here.  And it should be noted that the sale and rental of houses on Nikolina Gora is active.  In addition to the above factors, this is facilitated by proximity to the metropolis, guaranteed <span>housing</span> safety <span>, a socially favorable</span> atmosphere and amazing nature.

    <h2>  Authentic Rublevs </h2><p>  We can only say that there is absolutely everything for a full life, all the best that the Moscow Region can offer rich people.  Nikolina Gora has always been a privileged object, but it is unlikely that anyone will object to the assertion that in the old days there were hundreds of times more spirituality under the "branded" Soviet power.  Here and now there is a RANIS cooperative headed by <span>Yuri Bashmet.</span>  And now, representatives of the ‚Äúold Rublevka‚Äù are outraged by frauds around the district, which has become a symbol of prestige, the bad taste brought here by the nouveau riches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow region Nikolina Gora" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/797018.jpg" width="600"></div>  World-famous old-timers do not give up, and Nikolina‚Äôs mountain can stand, then they‚Äôre a mountain, so that muddy waves flow down.  This place will forever remain connected with those great people who lived here and created their beautiful creations.
