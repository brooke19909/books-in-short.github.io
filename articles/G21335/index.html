  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The main methods of water purification</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Methods of <span>water purification</span> today are a rather pressing issue.  After all, water is <span>an integral part of the</span> life of both man and humanity.  That is why modern science is constantly working on the creation of new methods of purification. </p><p>  Methods of <span>water purification</span> primarily depend on the quantity and quality of the liquid being cleaned.  Say, in industry, only methods are used, and at home, it is possible to treat running water in a completely different way. </p><h2>  Industrial methods of water purification </h2><p>  Water taken from ponds or underground sources, before entering the water supply <span>system</span> , passes through <span>a treatment system.</span>  These methods are also used in wastewater treatment, which are an integral part of the work of any industrial plant or factory. </p><ol><li>  <strong>Mechanical methods of water purification</strong> .  The name of the method itself indicates what kind of goal is being pursued here.  Using a variety of filters, water is purified from unnecessary and harmful particles.  To begin with, the liquid enters the surface of the filter, from where it passes through the entire loading <span>filter material,</span> so particles of certain sizes are delayed.  But if using this method you can get rid of relatively large pollutants, then filters cannot save bacteria and small organic particles. </li><li>  <strong>Chlorination of water</strong> .  A fairly well-known method of cleaning, which allows you to sanitize water.  But this technique also has its own drawback, which every person knows about.  Drinking such water is simply impossible. </li><li>  <strong>Ozonation</strong>  A relatively new and quite effective way to purify water, which allows you to get rid of organic residues.  Ozone is also considered a very powerful disinfectant.  Unfortunately, this method is quite expensive and is just starting to catch on. </li></ol><p>  Unfortunately, the water that houses and apartments are provided with is not always of high quality.  That is why it is necessary to think about how to make it better at home. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ways to <span>purify water</span> at home </h2><p>  As a rule, there are some problems with the water flowing from the tap.  Firstly, it contains salts of magnesium and calcium, which make it hard.  Another danger is the presence of unnecessary organic decomposition products, including nitrites and ammonia.  Also, water may contain impurities of iron and manganese - such a liquid acquires a yellowish color.  Most often, rust sediment in water is the result of its movement through old pipes.  And, of course, one of the main problems is chlorine. </p><p>  But water can be purified and made suitable for use on its own.  There are several very effective and common ways. </p><ol><li>  Upholding.  In order for the water to become clean, it must be placed in a container and allowed to stand for at least a day.  During this time, approximately 90% of chlorine will disappear from the liquid.  If a reddish precipitate forms at the bottom, the water must be filtered.  But this method will not work if the liquid is saturated with bacteria and microscopic algae. </li><li>  Boiling.  This method allows you to significantly soften the water, since magnesium and calcium salts simply settle on the walls of the dishes.  During boiling, all chlorine will disappear from the liquid.  In addition, high temperatures will help destroy most of the living microorganisms.  But if the water has a high level of organic substances, it cannot be boiled, since nitrogen compounds will quickly react with chlorine. </li><li>  Household filters for water purification.  Today we are offered a huge selection of a wide variety of filters.  The operation of passive filters is based on simple filtration, when a part of the polluting particles simply settles in the pores.  By the way, <span>activated carbon</span> is often used as a filling for such a filter <span>.</span> </li></ol><p>  There are active filters containing a certain number of substances.  When passing water, these substances react with pollutants, thus neutralizing them. </p><p>  It should be noted that the water filter must be selected very carefully.  First of all, be guided precisely by the problem of your water, whether it is hardness or the presence of organic matter. </p>
