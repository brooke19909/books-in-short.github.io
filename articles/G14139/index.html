    <p>  All messages and calls to local numbers will cost 1.5 rubles.  Not very much if you think about it.  But the Internet will already be more expensive.  For every 150 megabytes of traffic you will give 25 rubles.  All this thanks to the automatic activation of the "Extend speed" service.  In Russia, by the way, all calls will also cost a subscriber 1.5 rubles.  This moment brings a lot of pleasure to customers.  It turns out that even after spending 300 free minutes of conversation per month, you can save money.  In CIS countries, the cost of dialogue is 2 rubles, in Europe, Canada and the United States - 50. Here, a slight dissatisfaction of subscribers is visible, but not too often.  After all, Europe, the USA and Canada are extremely rarely called. </p><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  What in general can be said about our offer today?  As you can see, "All for 300" is an advantageous offer for outgoing subscribers.  True, in some cases, you may encounter customer dissatisfaction.  On the one hand, 300 minutes per month is very small.  And on the other, enough for business communication.  If you try and fit into the limits, there will be no problems.  For 300 rubles you will receive really favorable conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="favorable rates beeline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1132084.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In cases where this limit is not enough, subscribers say that the cost of communication is huge.  And this is despite the fact that all the prices for messages, Internet and calls are set quite humane.  In this situation, you just need to pay attention to other packages of the "ALL" line.  Perhaps among them you can pick up something worthwhile.  In any case, no one expresses a direct disgust for "All for 300."  The average subscriber is quite enough of the limit, which is given for a monthly fee.  The main thing is to be able to distribute minutes, as well as messages for a month.  And then you will not have any unnecessary problems and costs.  Refusing "All for 300" is not worth it.  In any case, a large mass of subscribers advises trying this offer in practice.  Most likely, it will pleasantly surprise you.  As you can see, Beeline Corporation tariffs can be quite profitable and interesting. </p>
