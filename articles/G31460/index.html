    <p>  Today, basketball is considered one of the most popular and spectacular <span>team games.</span>  It is worth noting that the history of basketball is very interesting.  After all, this is one of the few sports whose appearance was clearly fixed - both the date and the place of its creation are known. </p><p>  <strong>Basketball History</strong> </p><p>  Despite the fact that it is considered an American <span>invention of the 19th century,</span> an analogue of such a game existed several millennia ago.  It was an ancient <span>Mayan</span> ritual game called pok-ta-pok.  A stone ring was attached to the wall of the arena, the diameter of which almost corresponded to the diameter of the ball.  By the way, in those days, balls were made of rubber and there was no cavity inside them - they weighed from 2 to 4 kilograms. </p><p>  The rules were slightly different from modern basketballs - the ball could not be touched, all blows on the topic were applied with the back, hips or elbows.  Indeed, such a game was incredibly challenging.  The losing team was sacrificed to the gods.  Or, conversely, the lucky winners were sent to compete with the gods themselves. </p><p>  <strong>Basketball History: Making a Game</strong> </p><p>  In fact, it is not known whether the inventor of modern basketball knew about the ancient ‚Äúpok-ta-pok‚Äù. </p><p>  <span>James Naismith, a</span> young Canadian physical education teacher, worked at the Springfield School of the Christian Union of Young People in Massachusetts.  In winter, gymnastics was the only possible sport for young students.  In order to somehow diversify the pastime of youth, the teacher decided to invent a new game. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First he asked to attach baskets to the balconies without a bottom.  The principle of the game was quite simple - the students were divided into two teams and tried to throw as many balls as possible into the opponent‚Äôs basket.  In December 1891, Naismith presented his ‚Äúinvention‚Äù to his students - that is how the history of basketball began.  Further, the creator developed the first 13 rules that changed and improved with each match held. </p><p>  It is unlikely that the young gym teacher expected such a stir around the game he had invented.  The first competition was held <span>on December 21,</span> 1891.  The match was attended by 18 students of the school.  It is interesting that the first game ended with a score of 1-0, which is by no means impressive today. </p><p>  But the popularity of basketball grew like a snowball.  The students, traveling home for the holidays, gladly introduced their friends to a new, amazing game.  Pretty soon, basketball courts could be seen across the country.  But rumors of a new competition also leaked outside the United States, as Naismith's students were residents of Canada and Japan. </p><p>  <strong>The history of basketball as a professional sport</strong> </p><p>  A few years later, he became a real professional sport.  Already in 1898, the <span>National Basketball</span> League was created, which lasted five years, after which it split into several separate clubs. </p><p>  It is worth noting that stable teams in those years did not exist.  Laws allowed to change the composition of each of them several times per season.  Before each new game, the composition could completely change.  By the way, the most successful basketball players were paid from one dollar per minute of the game, which at that time was considered a very good income. </p><p>  In 1925, the American Basketball League was created.  <span>The rules of basketball</span> have been changing all the time, making the game more dynamic, active and safe.  And already in 1936, basketball appeared in the program of the Summer Olympic Games, which were held in Berlin. </p><p>  To date, there is hardly any one person who does not know what basketball is.  Its history is very interesting for both professional players and amateurs. </p>
