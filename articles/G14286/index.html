The history of the emergence of a coalition government in Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 1917, after the February Revolution, the first coalition interim government appeared.  In order to understand the meaning of this definition, let's delve into the historical events of that time. </p><h2>  The reasons for the Russo-Japanese war </h2><p>  One of the reasons for the emergence of a <span>coalition government</span> is the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.  Russia during this period of time was a strong power.  Its influence began to spread to Europe and the Far East.  The first goals were Korea and China. </p><p>  Japan did not like Russian intervention.  She wanted to get the <span>Liaodong Peninsula,</span> which belonged to China, but the Russian Empire made a deal and leased the peninsula and sent troops to the neighboring province of Manchuria. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2093681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63614/2093681.jpg?1532183114"></div><h2>  Japan requirements </h2><p>  Japan has put forward demands: Russia must leave the province.  Nicholas II understood that this territory was extremely important for the spread of Russian influence in the Far East, and refused to withdraw troops.  Thus began the Russo-Japanese war. </p><h2>  Results of the Russo-Japanese War </h2><p>  Both powers were strong, fierce battles were fought over the territory.  A year later, Russian troops began to retreat.  The Japanese army, still fighting, was also exhausted.  Japan‚Äôs proposal to conclude an agreement to end the war was successful.  In August 1905, both parties signed a peace agreement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to the document, Port Arthur and the southern lands of the Sakhalin Peninsula joined Japan.  So the Japanese state increased its influence in the territory of Korea, and Russia, as the loser, did not receive anything. </p><p>  The results of the Russo-Japanese war led to the fact that the discontent towards the <span>reign of Nicholas II</span> only intensified.  There was a political crisis. </p><h2>  Background of the revolution of 1905-1907 </h2><p>  In 1905-1907  a revolution broke out in Russia.  There were several reasons for the coup: </p><ul><li>  the government did not want to carry out liberal reforms to legalize free trade, inviolability of private property, freedom of choice; </li><li>  poverty of peasants; </li><li>  14 hours working day; </li><li>  conducting violent Russification of the state; </li><li>  defeat in the Russo-Polish war. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2093683" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63614/2093683.jpg?1532183114"></div><h2>  Revolution </h2><p>  Unrest provoked Bloody Sunday, January 9, 1905. The workers refused to go to work and staged a peaceful demonstration after the unfair dismissal of 4 employees of the Putilov enterprise.  The rally participants, about 100 people, were shot. </p><p>  In the fall of 1905, unionization against the government took place.  Then Nicholas II made concessions: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  created the State Duma; </li><li>  signed a document guaranteeing freedom of speech and press. </li></ul><p>  Representatives of the Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and members of the Constitutional Democratic Party announced the end of the revolution.  But in December 1905 there was an armed attempt at a coup, which was neutralized in the first half of 1907, after the creation of the second State Duma - the first did not remain in power. </p><h2>  The results of the revolution </h2><p>  The results of the revolution of 1905-1907  these are: </p><ul><li>  the appearance of the State Duma; </li><li>  legitimacy of the actions of political parties; </li><li>  abolition of redemption payments of peasants; </li><li>  affirmation of the right of peasants to freedom of movement and the right to independently choose a city for residence; </li><li>  permission to organize unions; </li><li>  reduction of the working day. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2093682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63614/2093682.jpg?1532183114"></div><h2>  World War I </h2><p>  The situation during the First World War, which began in 1914, was devastating for the state.  Russian economy after the revolution of 1905-1907  was in decline.  State participation in the world war only exacerbated the situation.  The crisis manifested itself in hunger, poverty, and the disorder of the military.  The closure of a large number of plants and factories led to a lack of jobs. </p><h2>  February revolution </h2><p>  Problems in economic, political and class issues were not resolved.  The discontent of the people led to the February Revolution of 1917.  The overthrow of Nicholas II, the creation of a coalition government - all this became a necessary measure to overcome the crisis.  In addition, after the coup, Russia automatically withdrew from the First World War. </p><h2>  Coalition government </h2><p>  Let's start with the term.  A coalition government is an interim government that is created by the union of several parties only in a parliamentary state.  This is due to the fragmentation of deputies between numerous parties.  The need to form a coalition government is to create a stable political system. </p><p>  After the French Revolution, power changed four times.  State Duma participants proposed to Nicholas II a choice of different options for lists of persons for the new government.  The king did not agree.  After the victory of the participants in the February Revolution, March 1, 1917, he signed the document and resigned as head of state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2093684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63614/2093684.jpg?1532183114"></div><h2>  First coalition government </h2><p>  After the decision of the Provisional Committee of the Duma, on May 5, the first coalition government was formed.  It was a desperate attempt to stabilize the economy in the country and establish a democratic path of development.  People in power of the Mensheviks loved the people less than the Bolsheviks.  The Navy offensive program proposed by Minister of War Kerensky did not find support among the population.  In July there was a political crisis. </p><h2>  Second Coalition Government </h2><p>  The Second Coalition Government was created under the command of Kornilov.  Kerensky, who was appointed to the post of minister-chairman, began a trial of the leaders of the Bolshevik party, and the representatives of the socialists took half of the seats in the Duma.  But <span>this coalition</span> government collapsed. </p><h2>  Third Coalition Government </h2><p>  The desire to create a state without representatives of the bourgeoisie at the top of power led to the convening of the Democratic Conference on September 24 - the Mensheviks could not rally the forces against the Bolsheviks.  Then they agreed to create the Third Coalition Government of Kerensky, who became the head of the state administration apparatus.  Power belonged to him until December 15, 1917.  He was overthrown during the next coup, which was prepared by Lenin and Trotsky. </p><p>  In Russia at the beginning of the 20th century, coalition governments are provisional governments that tried to stop the economic decline after military operations and revolutions in order to introduce a democratic form of government.  In total, three such governments were created, but not one of them was able to maintain power. </p>
