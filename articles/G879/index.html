This is not surprising, because many of our friends and acquaintances have already acquired their tablets and smartphones, and those who did not have time, gradually do it. </p><p>  Obviously, the constant increase in the number of users of gadgets is beneficial to those who produce them, as well as to those who provide communication services.  The Megafon company, whose tablet is now sold with an already pre-installed Internet package, can be said, is a vivid example. </p><h2>  Corporate tablet MegaFon Login 3 </h2>

    <p>  Perhaps, everyone knows that Megafon is one of the leaders in mobile communications in Russia.  Megafon is the strongest player in the industry market, keeping up with giants such as MTS and VimpelCom.  And although the decision to produce branded devices on request is not original, this is really an achievement for the operator, because the Megafon tablet (its characteristics will be given later in the article) is in certain demand. </p><p>  In general, the following can be said about the device: it belongs to the budget family, since its cost is slightly more than 6,600 rubles (despite the fact that part of this amount must be paid for Internet communication services).  Profitable enough, right? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Advantages of the tablet from "Megaphone" </h2>

    <p>  In addition to the fact that the device is offered at a very reasonable price, at Megafon the tablet will be configured in such a way that you do not need to worry about connecting to Internet services.  Moreover, as already noted, you will be forced to pay the package for several months in advance.  It turns out that when you purchase a tablet from the Megafon operator, you at the same time buy an Internet connection for several months. </p><h2>  What is a ‚ÄúMegaphone Login‚Äù tablet?  Device Reviews </h2><p>  So, in this section we will try to reveal the characteristics of MegaFon Login 3 - the tablet model that is currently being offered by Megafon.  They can be read in the product description.  It states that the tablet is equipped with a processor with a frequency of 1.2 GHz and 1 GB of RAM.  In addition, the model is sold with a 3500 mAh battery, the charge of which should be enough for 7-10 hours of active use. </p>

    <p>  In addition to these parameters, the tablet is also equipped with a camera and a 7-inch display.  The device is offered with a 3G communication module, which is capable of reading information from SIM cards.  True, Login 3 is combined exclusively with Megafon cards - this provides a special lock, which can be seen on Apple products and not only. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From the Megafon company, the tablet, therefore, is very similar to a number of Chinese gadgets.  As the mobile operator himself indicates, the manufacturer of these devices is Foxda Industrial, and a batch of tablets was released by order of Megafon.  This means that such products will be slightly cheaper than the one that can be purchased in the usual format, since it is promoted by the mobile operator itself. </p><p>  Reviews about the model are quite flattering: users claim that the tablet justifies its means (although you should not expect higher-end device performance from it).  As a budget version of the portable multimedia platform, Login 3 fits perfectly.  You can also sit on the Internet. </p><h2>  Tablet Purchase Terms </h2>

    <p>  You cannot buy a device without a prepaid Internet package.  Therefore, in fact, the price indicated in the store of 5,990 rubles is not real, it will still have to pay 700 rubles to it.  Thus, the basic service will be the Internet S package.  If we compare all the tariffs for a tablet available with the Megafon operator, then this can be called the most optimal and beneficial for a simple user. </p><p>  This tariff, in turn, includes the amount of total traffic ready for use in the amount of 5 GB for a fee of 300 rubles per month.  Thus, to browse news sites, weather and check mail using your ‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù (tablet), this will be quite enough.  You can also increase the supply of traffic and reduce its consumption in two ways.  The first is the purchase of special packages, which will cost more, but will allow you to sit on the Internet from your tablet longer.  The second way is to save money by disabling images or reducing the quality in which they are downloaded.  You can do this, say, using some browsers, for example Opera Mini.  If you resort to these techniques, as well as constantly monitor the consumption of the number of megabytes, which is not at all difficult, the Internet in the indicated amount of traffic will be enough for you ‚Äúwith your head‚Äù. </p><h2>  Where could I buy </h2><p>  You can buy a device, as well as connect and configure it, at the same time replenishing the balance for the required amount, in the Megafon salons.  You can do all this in any other network market of communication services, such as Svyaznoy or Euroset.  There, qualified specialists will explain to you all the details of what ‚ÄúMegafon‚Äù tariffs for the tablet are preparing and what needs to be done to use them.  Here you can also issue a starter pack in your name, which is again quite convenient. </p>

    <h2>  Market alternative </h2><p>  Of course, our mobile communications industry is sufficiently developed to offer a decent alternative.  If the Internet ‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù for the tablet connects, it seems to you, too slow or expensive, you can switch to another operator.  For example, the same MTS has a lot of plans, which in your case will be more profitable.  Some of the tariffs, by the way, are offered in the same format - with the finished product in the form of a tablet computer, released under the operator‚Äôs brand. </p><p>  To find them, it is enough to conduct a little <span>monitoring of the</span> communication services <span>market</span> and find out who has the most favorable conditions.  It may even be that the Megafon Internet for a tablet released under their brand will provide more affordable than competitors.  Therefore, think and count.  By connecting to the mobile Internet service once, you will use it for the next months and maybe even years.  Do not lose! </p>
