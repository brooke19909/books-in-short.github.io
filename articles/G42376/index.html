    <h2>  Choosing a Mobile Phone </h2><p>  Everyone is eager to acquire the latest gadget designs.  This indicates that at present, mankind is highly dependent on technology.  However, contrary to predictions, <span>old mobile phones have</span> not completely gone out of use.  They can now be found in the hands of users.  As a rule, such a choice is influenced by more than one reason.  First of all, modern smartphones can not be considered reliable, since even the most expensive copies can not boast a long battery life.  And, for example, Nokia 2610 has been functioning for at least 7 days without recharging. </p><p>  Simple mobile phones are capable of performing a rather limited list of tasks.  It consists only of communication capabilities.  We are talking about SMS messages (receiving / sending) and calls.  It will also not be amiss to note that such devices are of good quality and durability. </p><h2>  Nokia 2610: specs briefly </h2><p>  The manufacturer positioned this model as a youth.  It refers to budget devices, so during the release it became quite popular.  Phone production started in 2006.  Then the devices of the Finnish company were at the peak of popularity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What are the characteristics distinguished Nokia 2610? </p><ul><li>  Case type: monoblock. </li><li>  Weight: 91 g. </li><li>  Dimensions: 104 √ó 43 √ó 18 mm. </li><li>  Communication standard: GSM 900/1800 (2G). </li><li>  Autonomy: 970 mAh battery. </li><li>  Screen Capabilities: 128 √ó 128 px. </li><li>  Ringtones: 24-tone polyphony. </li><li>  Base: Series 40 2nd Edition. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Design features </h2><p>  The first thing that catches your eye when inspecting this mobile phone is its compactness.  Thanks to the optimally selected sizes, all users without exception claim that the device is quite comfortable in the hand.  Use it comfortably.  As for the weight, the device can be safely carried not only in a purse, but also in the pockets of trousers or a shirt. </p><p>  Externally, the Nokia 2610 looks pretty elegant.  However, at present its design can be called retro-style.  In all the features of the case, versatility is visible, thanks to which not only a girl, but also a young man can use the gadget.  In the age category of buyers there are also no restrictions.  The design is uniquely matched by the manufacturer optimally.  Clearly visible restraint and conciseness.  The geometry of the forms is perfectly combined and completely merges into the general concept. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Designers used the accent technique.  In this role, the frame that frames the screen is presented.  For its decoration, a dark color (black) is selected.  In order to avoid rudeness and bulkyness, the manufacturer preferred a slightly arched shape for the edges and corners.  The whole design is made up of inserts that are used for contrast.  This is a kind of marketing move that has attracted the attention of customers.  On the shelves at the time of sales were presented three color solutions: black (classic) and two combined - gray-purple and silver-graphite. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 2610 phone" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1728776.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  The Finnish mobile phone is controlled via a push-button keyboard.  It is made of plastic.  Represents two blocks.  The first is soft keys.  Their number (4) and location are standard.  The joystick is five-position.  The central button allows you to enter the menu.  The arrows are located on the chrome rim.  They can be programmed for quick access to any function, for example, select ringtones or change the alarm time. </p><p>  The keys of the digital unit have a traditional rectangular shape.  Their sizes are standard.  Location - tight to each other.  There is a backlight that well distinguishes all the symbols printed on the buttons.  According to most owners, there are no comments on the keyboard.  The key travel is soft, pressing is easy, they work quickly without false presses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 2610 specifications" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1728777.jpg" width="409"></div>

    <h2>  Connectors </h2><p>  In order to fully use the device Nokia 2610, the developers have provided the presence of important connectors.  The first is to connect the charger.  Its model is Nokia ACP-7.  There is also the possibility of using road memory.  A big advantage is the presence of an audio jack.  The jack has a standard type - "mini-jack."  Used to connect a headset.  However, buyers should be aware that headphones are not provided, so you will have to purchase them separately. </p><p>  On the case, you can see the port for connecting the cable connecting the phone to the PC.  This method is used during data transfer.  There is also a special connector, but it focuses only on the engineering cord.  As a rule, this connection method is necessary only to change the device firmware. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The small size of the display does not surprise anyone when it comes to a push-button phone.  Especially if the device was made ten years ago.  In defense of this model, let's say that at that time smartphones with large touch screens were simply not produced. </p><p>  With what help is the graphic information displayed in a Finnish phone with an index of 2610?  The display is made using outdated technology, which is based on a passive matrix STN.  The resolution of the picture is critically small - only 128 √ó 128 px.  A feature of the screen is low power consumption and low cost. </p><p>  Talking about image clarity and lack of graininess will be at least incorrect.  The matrix can reproduce only 65,000 colors, which indicates a low color rendering.  It is almost impossible to read information on the street, because with direct sunlight, the screen is very glare. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 2610 menu" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1728778.jpg" width="501"></div>

    <h2>  Battery Summary </h2><p>  Battery life Nokia 2610 is carried out using a removable battery (model - BL-5C).  It is based on lithium-ion technology.  The capacity can be safely considered large, since its volume is 970 mAh.  In standby mode, the phone does not need to be charged for about 15 days.  The manufacturer in the instructions indicates that when talking with the subscriber, the battery will be discharged after 3 hours. </p><p>  Given that the type of battery is removable, if the phone breaks or malfunctions, it can be removed and replaced with a new one.  To do this, you need to open the back cover lock.  After a barely audible click, the panel can be removed.  Under it is a battery in a special niche with grooves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 2610 description" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1728779.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <h2>  Menu </h2><p>  In Nokia 2610, the menu is typical of a device that runs on the Series 40 2nd Edition platform.  It is displayed on the screen in the form of an icon 3 * 3 in size.  The menu consists of a standard set of options.  These include the following elements: </p><ul><li>  Address Book - Up to five numbers can be stored in the memory of one entry. </li><li>  Messages - the user has the ability to send not only text notifications, but also with the contents of multimedia files. </li><li>  Calls - a menu in the phone containing information about incoming, missed and outgoing calls.  You can also view their duration here. </li><li>  Settings - controls all available functions (ringtones, themes, etc.). </li></ul><p>  Of course, it was not without such menu items as ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù, ‚ÄúGallery‚Äù, ‚ÄúOrganizer‚Äù. </p>
