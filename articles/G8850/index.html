    <p>  In the article, we consider the <span>features of bankruptcy of insurance organizations</span> . </p><h2>  Key Points </h2><p>  As a general sign of insolvency of legal entities is the inability to repay liabilities to creditors and the budget within three months from the date when the claims were to be satisfied. </p><p>  Key regulatory provisions defining the features of bankruptcy of <span>insurance organizations are</span> enshrined in Federal Law No. 127. </p><h2>  Preventive action </h2><p>  To prevent <span>insolvency (bankruptcy) of insurance organizations</span> , the following regulatory instruments are provided: </p><ul><li>  The provision of financial assistance by the founders / participants of a legal entity or other entities. </li><li>  Change in the structure of liabilities and assets. </li><li>  Increase in authorized capital. </li><li>  Reorganization. </li><li>  Other measures not prohibited by law. </li></ul><h2>  Reasons for implementing preventive measures </h2><p>  Measures to prevent <span>bankruptcy of the insurance company are</span> taken when: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Repeated refusal to repay monetary obligations to creditors within a month.  Refusal should be understood as non-fulfillment / improper fulfillment of requirements within ten days from the date of occurrence of the corresponding obligation, unless otherwise provided by law.  Only business days are taken into account. </li><li>  Failure to fulfill the obligation to deduct payments to the budget within 10 days (working) from the date of its occurrence. </li><li>  Insufficient amount of funds for timely repayment of debts (including to the budget), if the deadline for this has come. </li><li>  Repeated violation of the requirements for the structure and composition of assets established by the Ministry of Finance within 12 months.  from the date of detection of the first violation. </li><li>  Revocation, suspension or limitation of the license to conduct business. </li></ol><p>  Within 15 days from the date of the occurrence of these circumstances, the insurance company must send a notice to the supervisor (Central Bank) about this.  Attached is a plan to restore solvency.  These actions are performed if there are no signs of <span>bankruptcy of the insurance company</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="features of bankruptcy of insurance organizations" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1902859.jpg" width="357"></div>  Within 30 days (workers) after receiving the plan based on the results of its study, the supervisor makes a decision on the appointment of an interim administration in the insurance company or on the inappropriateness of this appointment.  In cases provided for by resolutions of the Ministry of Finance, he is also entitled to decide on a field inspection.  The audit is carried out in the manner prescribed by the supervisor.

These entities have the right to vote. </p><p>  Representatives of: </p><ul><li>  employees of the debtor; </li><li>  participants / founders; </li><li>  the self-regulatory organization in which the arbitration manager is a member; </li><li>  supervisory authority. </li></ul><p>  These persons may speak on issues on the agenda of the meeting.  As a rule, the address where creditors' meetings are held in Moscow based on decisions of the bankruptcy court of insurance companies is Bolshoi Golovin Pereulok, 3, bldg.  2 (2nd floor). </p><h2>  Transfer of insurance portfolio </h2><p>  Beneficiaries and policyholders must be notified by the interim administration, the bankruptcy trustee or (if they are not appointed) the insurance company itself about the upcoming transfer of the portfolio.  The notice is published in the manner prescribed by Art.  28 ‚Ññ ‚Ññ 127, not later than a month before the procedure. </p><p>  The notification must include the following information: </p><ol><li>  Name of the company transferring the insurance portfolio, state registration number in legal entity status, TIN, address. </li><li>  The grounds for this operation. </li><li>  Information on the suspension / limitation of the powers of the executive structures of the organization transferring the portfolio. </li><li>  The name of the management company, identifying signs (TIN, state registration number), address. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bankruptcy Procedure of Insurance Organizations" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1902863.jpg" width="600"></div>  IC "Investments and Finances" </h2><p>  In July 2016, by decision of the Central Bank, the powers of the executive structures of the company were suspended.  In October of the same year, information appeared about the revocation of the license <span>from the Investment and Finance insurance company.</span>  <span>The bankruptcy of the</span> enterprise was initiated by the interim administration appointed by the Central Bank. </p><p>  The decision to revoke the license was due to: </p><ol><li>  Commitment by the company of actions contrary to the laws of the Russian Federation </li><li>  The presence of deviations from the provisions of regulatory acts that are not corrected within the prescribed period. </li><li>  Failure to comply with the requirements of the Central Bank. </li></ol><p>  When the first information about the likelihood of initiating proceedings against the company appeared, it was recommended to customers and partners to draw up their claims in writing as soon as possible and forward them to the arbitration court. </p><h2>  SG "Uralsib" </h2><p>  The first application by individuals to declare the company insolvent was sent to the court in December 2016. On January 31, 2017, the first appeal was submitted from the legal entity. </p><p>  As a survey of a number of market participants showed, the debt of an enterprise to partners reaches several tens of millions of rubles. </p><p>  Analysis of financial statements for 2015 showed that the organization worked for two years in a row with negative capital.  The company's assets by the end of the year were less than the amount of liabilities by 2.9 billion rubles.  In addition, the company violated the standards of the Central Bank on the solvency margin, the allocation of own funds and insurance reserves. </p><p>  On August 11, 2016, the license of SG Uralsib was limited in connection with the failure to comply with the requirements of the Central Bank. </p><p>  At the end of January, a company reliability rating of B ++ was confirmed. </p><p>  According to experts, such a low indicator is associated with non-compliance with regulatory requirements and a negative deviation of the actual solvency margin from the established norm. </p><p>  Specialists also noted: </p><ul><li>  negative return on equity and assets; </li><li>  reduction of own funds; </li><li>  negative result of insurance operations reviewed for 4 consecutive quarters without a cumulative total; </li><li>  reduction in contributions; </li><li>  low liquidity (payback) of investments and a decrease in their value; </li><li>  high ratio of receivables and payables to assets, etc. </li></ul><p>  It is worth saying that the rumors about the bankruptcy of the <span>insurance company Uralsib</span> <span><strong> </strong></span>  walked quite a while.  This company is part of the assets of Uralsib Bank, in which, since the fall of 2015, a rehabilitation procedure has been carried out with the participation of the head of the Oil and Gas Industry <span>V. Kogan</span> and the Deposit Insurance Agency. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bankruptcy procedure of insurance companies" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1902864.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  IC "Moscow Region" </h2><p>  Since May 24, 2017, the organization has a temporary administration.  On July 20, a bankruptcy petition was filed with the Moscow Arbitration Court.  Insurance company "Moscow Region" <strong> </strong>  Lost its licenses the very next day - on July 21, it was recalled by the Central Bank.  The company is forbidden to conduct activities on voluntary personal and property insurance, as well as on compulsory motor liability insurance. </p><p>  The relevant decision was made by the regulator in connection with the failure of the company to eliminate violations of the provisions of the legislation governing insurance activities within the time limit set by the Central Bank, in connection with which the licenses were suspended. </p><p>  In particular, the company did not comply with the requirements for solvency and financial stability in terms of creating insurance reserves, and did not comply with the conditions and procedure for investing reserve and own funds. </p><p>  According to the Central Bank, the amount of insurance company fees for 2016 exceeded 1.6 billion rubles, and payments amounted to 596.7 million rubles. </p>
