Children of Alexey Petrovich</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The heir to <span>Peter I</span> Alexei Petrovich is one of the most tragic and mysterious figures in the history of the Romanov dynasty.  Due to a conflict with his father, he fled abroad, but was returned to his homeland, sentenced to death, and died under unclear circumstances in custody. </p><h2>  Unloved son </h2><p>  Alexey Petrovich Romanov was born on February 18, 1690.  His mother was <span>Evdokia Lopukhina,</span> whom young Peter married a couple of years before the appearance of the heir.  However, very soon the monarch had a new hobby - the daughter of a foreign master <span>Anna Mons</span> from his beloved German settlement, where the ruler spent most of his free time.  The autocrat finally parted with Evdokia Lopukhina in 1694, when his eldest son was very young. </p><p>  Therefore, Alexei Petrovich Romanov never knew a family idyll.  Very quickly, he actually became a burden on his father.  The situation worsened when Peter I sent Evdokia to the Intercession Monastery in Suzdal.  At that time, shearing formally replaced the divorce procedure.  At first, Evdokia did not succumb to the persuasion of her husband.  She even asked for the intercession from the patriarch Hadrian.  The head of the clergy really tried to protect the princess from her husband, which only infuriated Peter.  As a result, Evdokia went to the monastery under escort.  This happened in 1698, against the backdrop of the opened Streltsy riot in Moscow. </p>

    <h2>  Education </h2><p>  The disgusting story of the expulsion of the mother could not but affect Alexei Petrovich.  After the incident, the boy remained in the care of his aunt, Princess Natalya Alekseevna.  The father did not take much care of his son, as he was constantly on the move.  The whole life of Peter I was devoted to state affairs, meanwhile, he did not have time or desire to spend it on his family. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Alexei had several teachers.  The first of them - the clerk Nikifor Vyazemsky - was attributed to the six-year-old prince.  He taught the boy the alphabet, and then foreign languages.  At some point, Peter even wanted to send his son to study in Dresden along with advanced noble youth, but changed his mind.  Instead, the Germans were discharged to Alexei Preobrazhensky Palace - Martin Neugebauer and Heinrich Guyssen.  The monarch entrusted supervision of them to his favorite and right hand, Alexander Menshikov. </p><h2>  Heir </h2><p>  Over the years, the relationship of the father and his child did not get warmer.  On the contrary, there was more and more mutual suspicion in them.  The son of Peter 1 Alexei Petrovich was well educated, he knew foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãand exact sciences.  But his father was saddened by the fact that he was not interested in military affairs.  Sometimes the monarch took the heir on campaigns.  The first time this happened in 1704, when domestic troops triumphantly stormed Narva. </p><p>  Then, when the Swedish army of Charles XII had already invaded Russia, Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich was responsible for preparing Moscow for defense in the event of an attack by enemies.  The father‚Äôs letters were preserved in which he chastised his son for inaction and negligence.  Peter's anger was caused by another circumstance.  Shortly before that, Alexei secretly went to the monastery to his exiled mother.  The autocrat did everything to limit the contacts of his son and first wife.  He learned about the visit of Alexei Petrovich through the denunciation of his spies.  The son was able to appease his father thanks to letters from his favorite and future Empress Catherine I. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  In Germany </h2><p>  In 1709, the son of Peter the Great, Alexei Petrovich, nevertheless went to Germany to study.  In addition, his father wanted to find him a foreign bride there.  Prior to this, the Russian tsars married exclusively to Russian women, and by their origin they could have been noble.  This attitude towards marriage was characteristic of the 17th century.  The tsar, having made Russia a part of Europe, considered dynastic weddings an important diplomatic tool.  On the advice of the teacher Alexei Petrovich, he decided to organize the marriage of his son with Charlotte Wolfenb√ºttelskaya - the daughter of the German Duke and sister of the future Empress of Austria. </p><p>  However, before marrying, the prince had to complete his education.  The episode is widely known when, after returning to Russia, frightened by a drawing exam, he shot a pistol in his hand.  This act angered his father again.  Peter not only beat his son for this, but also forbade him to appear at court.  After a while, the monarch calmed down and reconciled with the child.  It was in such outbursts of fury that Peter's whole character lay.  For all his talents and hard work, he was a despot who could not stand disobedience.  That is why all the close autocrats were non-independent figures.  They were afraid to argue with the king.  This also explains the lack of will that distinguished Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich.  He was largely a victim of his father‚Äôs abrupt temper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Wedding and kids </h2><p>  Despite all the family squabbles and ups and downs, the planned wedding still took place.  October 14, 1711 in the city of Torgau, the marriage of Alexei and Charlotte Wolfenb√ºttel.  Peter I himself attended the ceremony. It soon became clear that the union of the newlyweds would have a very difficult fate.  Charlotte moved to St. Petersburg, but remained a stranger to a foreigner.  She could not get close to either her husband or her father-in-law. </p><p>  And although the personal relations of the spouses did not work out, the princess nevertheless fulfilled her main dynastic function.  In 1714, the young couple had a daughter, Natalia, and a year later, the long-awaited son Peter.  However, after his birth, his mother felt bad.  Her condition worsened, and ten days after giving birth, Princess Natalya (as they began to call her in Russia) died.  The son of Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich Peter 12 years later became Emperor <span>Peter II.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Continuation of the conflict </h2><p>  The young children of Alexei Petrovich were not the only replenishment in the royal family.  The ruler himself, after his unloved son, got another child.  The child was named Peter Petrovich (his future mother was <span>Catherine I).</span>  So suddenly Alexey ceased to be the only heir to his father (now he had a second son and grandson).  The situation put him in an ambiguous position. </p><p>  In addition, such a character as Aleksey Petrovich clearly did not fit into the life of the new St. Petersburg.  The photo of his portraits shows the man a little painful and indecisive.  He continued to fulfill the government orders of the powerful father, although he did so with obvious reluctance, which again and again angered the autocrat. </p><p>  While still studying in Germany, Alexey asked his Moscow friends to send him a new confessor, whom he could openly confess about everything that bothered the young man.  Tsarevich was deeply religious, but at the same time he was very afraid of his father's spies.  However, the new confessor, Jacob Ignatiev, was indeed not one of Peter's proteges.  Once Alexei in his hearts told him that he was waiting for the death of his father.  Ignatiev replied that many Moscow friends of the heir want the same.  So, quite unexpectedly, Alexey found supporters and embarked on the path that led him to death. </p>

    <h2>  Difficult decision </h2><p>  In 1715, Peter sent a letter to his son, in which he had a choice: either Alexei corrects himself (that is, begins to take up the army and accepts his father‚Äôs policy) or goes to the monastery.  The heir is at an impasse.  He did not like many of Peter's undertakings, including his endless military campaigns and cardinal changes in life in the country.  This mood was shared by many aristocrats (mainly from Moscow).  In the elite, there really was a rejection of hasty reforms, but no one dared to openly protest, since participation in any opposition could end in disgrace or execution. </p><p>  The autocrat, having given an ultimatum to his son, gave him time to consider his decision.  The biography of Alexei Petrovich has many similar ambiguous episodes, but this situation has become crucial.  After consulting with close associates (primarily with the head of the St. Petersburg Admiralty, Alexander Kikin), he decided to flee from Russia. </p><h2>  Escape </h2><p>  In 1716, a delegation headed from St. Petersburg to Copenhagen led by Alexei Petrovich.  Peter's son was supposed to see his father in Denmark.  However, while in Polish Gdansk, the prince suddenly changed his route and actually fled to Vienna.  There Alex began to negotiate for political asylum.  The Austrians sent him to secluded Naples. </p><p>  The fugitive‚Äôs plan was to wait for the death of the then ill Russian Tsar, and then return to his throne to the throne, if necessary, with a foreign army.  Alexey spoke about this later in the investigation.  However, one cannot confidently take these words for truth, since the necessary evidence was simply knocked out of the arrested person.  According to the Austrians, the prince was in hysteria.  Therefore, it is more likely to say that he went to Europe from despair and fear for his future. </p>

    <h2>  In Austria </h2><p>  Peter quickly found out where his son was running.  People loyal to the tsar immediately went to Austria.  The head of an important mission was appointed experienced diplomat Pyotr Tolstoy.  He reported to the Austrian emperor Charles VI that the very fact of the presence of Alexei on the land of the Habsburgs was a slap in the face of Russia.  The fugitive chose Vienna because of his kinship with this monarch for his short marriage. </p><p>  Perhaps <span>Charles VI</span> would have protected the exile in other circumstances, but at that time Austria was at war with the Ottoman Empire and was preparing for a conflict with Spain.  The emperor did not want to get such a powerful enemy as Peter the Great under such conditions.  In addition, Alexei himself also blundered.  He behaved in a panicky manner and was clearly not confident in himself.  As a result, the Austrian authorities made concessions.  Peter Tolstoy got the right to see the fugitive. </p><h2>  Conversation </h2><p>  Peter Tolstoy, having met with Alexei, began to use all possible methods and tricks to return him to his homeland.  Kind assurances were used that his father would forgive him and allow him to live freely in his own estate. </p><p>  The messenger did not forget about clever hints.  He convinced the tsarevich that Charles VI, not wanting to spoil relations with Peter, would not in any case cover him, and then Alex would definitely be in Russia as a criminal.  In the end, the prince agreed to return to his native country. </p><h2>  Court </h2><p>  February 3, 1718 Peter and Alex met in the Moscow Kremlin.  The heir cried and begged for forgiveness.  The king pretended not to be angry if his son abandoned the throne and inheritance (which he did). </p><p>  After that, the trial began.  First, the fugitive betrayed all his supporters who ‚Äúpersuaded‚Äù him to a rash act.  Arrests and lawful executions followed.  Peter wanted to see his first wife Evdokia Lopukhina and the opposition clergy at the head of the conspiracy.  However, the investigation found that the king was unhappy with a much larger number of people. </p>

    <h2>  Death </h2><p>  Not a single biography of Alexei Petrovich contains accurate information about the circumstances of his death.  As a result of the investigation, which was conducted by the same Peter Tolstoy, the fugitive was sentenced to death.  However, it never took place.  Alex died on June 26, 1718 in the Peter and Paul Fortress, where he was kept during the trial.  It was officially announced that he had a seizure.  Perhaps the Tsarevich was killed on the secret order of Peter, or maybe he died on his own, without suffering the torture suffered during the investigation.  For the omnipotent monarch, the execution of his own son would be too shameful an event.  Therefore, there is reason to believe that he ordered to deal with Alexei in advance.  One way or another, but the descendants did not know the truth. </p><p>  After the death of Alexei Petrovich, a classic point of view was formed about the causes of the drama.
