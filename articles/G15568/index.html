Due to this popularity, holders of plastic cards of these financial institutions often use the services of transferring money among themselves.  Consider how to transfer money from an Alfa-Bank card to a Sberbank card. </p><h2>  About Alfa Bank </h2><p>  It was founded in 1990, is a universal institution that carries out all the main types of operations presented in the financial services market, including servicing corporate and private clients, leasing, investment business, factoring and so on. </p><p>  Many people are interested in transferring money from an Alfa-Bank card to a Sberbank card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alfabank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alfa Bank Card" class="if uuid-3128303" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128303.jpg"></div><h2>  Money transfer </h2><p>  There are several ways to carry out payment transactions without visiting a financial institution.  To do this, you need to know only the card number of the person to whom you need to send money.  You can do this on the institution‚Äôs website using the services of Alfa-Mobile or Alfa-Click.  It is worth noting that all payments are protected by 3D Secure, which guarantees confidentiality with transaction security. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Customers ask how much can be sent from an Alfa-Bank debit card to a Sberbank card.  Consider the answer to this question. </p><h2>  Maximum and minimum transaction amount </h2><p>  As part of the transfer through the services of Alfa-Mobile or Alfa-Click, one card has the following restrictions: </p><ul><li>  The maximum amount of one-time transactions is one hundred thousand rubles, excluding commission fees. </li><li>  The daily limit is one hundred and fifty thousand rubles, and for a month it is one and a half million (that is, no more than fifty operations, provided that the maximum allowable amount is transferred at a time). </li></ul><p>  It is worth emphasizing that a fee is charged from the sender.  Therefore, this must be foreseen in the calculation of the amount sent.  A similar limit is set when transferring from Alfa-Bank credit cards to Sberbank. </p><p>  How to transfer from Alfa-Bank card to Sberbank card without commission?  This is impossible to do. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sokolka.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to transfer money from Alfa-Bank card to Sberbank card" class="if uuid-3128299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128299.jpg"></div><h2>  Commission fee </h2><p>  The tariff for debit card transfers is 1.95% of the total amount (the minimum commission fee is thirty rubles).

The address can be found on the official website. </li><li>  Go to the cash window, fill out the form for a money transfer.

Even those people who do not have modern gadgets can figure out the algorithm of this financial transaction.

For example, "translation 5555 4444 3333 2222 500."  This means that 500 rubles are sent to the indicated card.  Next, you need from the bank in response to receive a message with the calculated commission amount, transfer parameters and a one-time password.
