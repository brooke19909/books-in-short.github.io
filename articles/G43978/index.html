Skhidnytsia - a resort located twenty-five kilometers from this sensational resort of Ukraine, began to develop much later, from the seventies of the last century.  In those days, they discovered a mineral spring, which in its properties was similar to the famous "rejuvenating water" "Naftusya".  And still, despite political upheavals and a change of government, Skhidnytsia continues to be a tempting place to relax.  Especially for people who want to leave behind the frantic pace of life, to breathe in the clear mountain air and imbued with life in "Ukrainian Switzerland". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanatorium skhodnitsa" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/854579.jpg" width="473"></div>
