A high level of professionalism is evidenced by membership in SWIFT, the Association of Russian Banks and ARBK.  For a long time, a financial institution has provided a wide range of services to legal entities and individuals.  But in February of this year, he began to have problems. </p>

    <h2>  First Issue Information </h2><p>  In April of this year, it was announced the suspension of deposits in the "Lights of <span>Moscow".</span>  <span>The bank</span> explained the <span>problems</span> with technical difficulties.  It was announced that a new deposit program was being developed, so the acceptance of deposits was temporarily suspended.  Also, the credit institution did not carry out transactions between legal entities and individuals.  Despite the official statement, rumors appeared already that the problems were related to the ban of the Central Bank. </p><p>  In February 2014, a scheduled check of the Central Bank was conducted, as a result of which restrictions were introduced.  12 million rubles - the maximum allowable total amount of deposits attracted to the bank “Moscow Lights”.  The <span>credit institution</span> rating up to this point was rather low.  The bank was in the second hundred (172nd place) in terms of assets.  For the first quarter of 2013, he received 142 million profit, and for the same period of the current year - 57 million loss.  As a result, two branches were closed - in Dubna and Podolsk - due to unprofitability.  After this message, the reliability of the bank “Moscow Lights” in the eyes of many customers has declined sharply. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  License revocation </h2><p>  On May 16, 2014, the Bank of Russia announced the revocation of a license from two capital credit institutions.  One of them is the Moscow Lights Bank.  The license was revoked due to repeated non-compliance with the rules and regulations.  At the same time, it was announced that deposits would be paid no later than May 27.  This decision was made by the Agency for Insurance Deposits (DIA).  For participants of the mentioned system, revocation of a license is an insurance event.  Under the agreement, the depositor is entitled to a 100% reimbursement of the deposit, but the total amount of reimbursements should not exceed seven hundred thousand rubles.  Former customers of a credit institution began to be actively interested in the registry for insurance payments. </p><h2>  Problems with DIA when returning deposits </h2><p>  Not all former customers of the bank saw themselves on the lists for compensation payments.  Many claimed that they were denied payment due to the fact that their names were not in the bank registry of deposits.  As it turned out later, transactions were carried out without notifying customers about the closure of accounts.  Responsible for these frauds is the Moscow Lights Bank.  Customer reviews on the forums confirm this.  In the hands of depositors there are extracts that prove that they did not give consent to such operations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  There must always be a way out </h2><p>  Despite the <span>termination of contracts unilaterally, the</span> bank accrued interest on deposits, so some of the funds can be withdrawn.  The rest remains to wait for the decision of the DIA.  The agency reported that they are actively working to resolve this issue, and there should not be problems with compensation.  Applications for <span>insurance compensation</span> may be submitted within two years.  This is the average term for liquidation of banks. </p><p>  Those investors who initially did not find themselves in the registry of compensation payments, lawyers recommend that you follow the following procedure.  To begin, write a statement to the DIA for inclusion in the register of insurance payments.  Next, you need to write a statement to the police about the situation and file a lawsuit.  If within 30 calendar days the DIA does not give an answer, then a second suit should be filed - already with the agency.  This procedure should not be neglected.  This may be the only way to return the funds invested in the Bank of Moscow.  The feedback of former Master Bank depositors, whose license was revoked back in December 2013, only confirms this.  Many of the clients still cannot receive a response from the DIA. </p>

    <h2>  Fires of Moscow Bank: customer reviews on the money back procedure </h2><p>  Compensation payments can be obtained through a branch of Sberbank.  A financial institution returns funds strictly according to the DIA register.  The Bank is also an intermediary between the client and the DIA in the event that your data is not in the registry.  Directly in the organization’s office, you can write an application and provide all the necessary documents for inclusion in the registry. </p><p>  After checking the "Lights of Moscow" a number of transactions were discovered that were not displayed in the balance sheet and were not in the banking system.  This scheme is very similar to the situation with Mosoblbank and Master Bank.  The first, after signing the agreements with the client and making the depositor money to the account, transferred funds to the accounts of related companies at night of the same day.  If clients found out about such operations, it was only by chance.  The second bank had a separate group of VIP depositors, whose funds did not go through a common cash desk. </p>

Copies or originals of supporting documents must be attached to the application.  It can be: </p><ul><li>  agreement with the bank; </li><li>  court decision that has entered into force; </li><li>  documents that confirm transactions to an account with a credit institution; </li><li>  account statement indicating the balance, preferably on the date of revocation of the license; </li><li>  other supporting documents. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Earlier it was reported that the DIA could not find confirmation that more than two thousand customers made deposits totaling one billion rubles to the bank “Moscow Lights”.  Feedback from customers who were depositors of banks who also had their license revoked confirms that the cash-back procedure is quite long.  First you need to collect all the documents confirming the fact of investment.  You must contact Sberbank with these papers to receive an insurance payment.  If your last name was not found in the DIA register, then you can write a statement to the association directly through Sberbank and then wait for their decision. </p>
