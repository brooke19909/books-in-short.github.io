Sony is also testing its strength on this site, using both the conceptual approaches of competitors and its own developments.  Her journey of mastering IT bracelets began with the application of the experience of Samsung developers, who provided their Gear Fit product with a bendable screen and the functionality of a full-fledged fitness gadget.  According to the same principles, a version of Sony SmartBand SWR10 was created, which, however, did not offer any innovations, but only duplicated the typical functionality of similar devices. </p><p>  Sony's contribution to the development of the segment could go unnoticed, but the Japanese soon surprised fans with a more interesting development - SWR30.  Although the direction of development of the gadget has remained the same, the company has provided for it a number of technological features.  This is not to say that another attempt to take its rightful place in the market of fitness bracelets offers a completely unprecedented option, but some advantages highlight the new product in the Sony SmartBand line, an overview of which is presented below. </p>

    <h2>  Device and design </h2><p>  When examining the gadget, a display with E-Ink technology and a button for adjusting the volume are immediately evident.  On the left side is a Micro-USB port with a plug - it can be used for charging.  Here is the speaker output.  On the right side is the main control button.  By and large, the stylistic features and the configuration of the controls repeat the Sony SmartBand SWR10, but there are also significant differences.  For example, in the new modification, a plastic block with electronics and a display is in sight, and the strap is fastened at the edges.  It should be noted that the ability to conveniently adjust the strap allows you to literally merge the gadget with your hand, eliminating the feeling of discomfort and stiffness of movement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In terms of design, everything is predictable, but without obvious failures.  Against the background of competitors, this model is still distinguished by the E-Ink screen - although there are disagreements, is this difference a plus or minus?  The device looks original, but it can be called fashionable and stylish with big reservations.  In general, the manufacturer is known for a careful approach to design development, and for this reason it is not clear why the Sony SmartBand family has not yet acquired a beautiful individual image. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  According to the officially announced <span>specifications, the offer</span> from Sony looks even more interesting than the Samsung bracelet.  True, a considerable advantage of the Korean device is the Super Amoled screen.  The development of E-Ink competes with him: </p><ul><li>  Type - fitness bracelet. </li><li>  The software platform is Android 4.4. </li><li>  Vibration - provided. </li><li>  The material of the device is plastic. </li><li>  The time display is electronic. </li><li>  Mass - 24 g. </li><li>  Screen type - touch monochrome with E-Ink technology. </li><li>  The display size is 1.4 inches. </li><li>  The amount of main memory is 2 MB. </li><li>  Resolution - 296 x 128. </li><li>  Interfaces - Bluetooth 4, NFC, USB connector. </li><li>  The processor of the bracelet is Cortex M4. </li><li>  Additional functionality - altimeter, accelerometer, activity and sleep monitoring. </li><li>  Battery capacity - 70 mAh. </li></ul><p>  If we note other criteria for comparing the new Sony SmartBand model with competitors, then communication capabilities will come to the fore.  Japanese bracelet has an advantage in terms of wide possibilities of combining with other gadgets, but loses due to lack of access to the Network. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  It has been emphasized more than once that the model is equipped with an E-Ink screen, in which backlighting is not provided.  Accordingly, the optimal conditions for using the gadget provides good lighting.  In this case, the screen has a stretched shape.  On the one hand, thanks to this solution, the Sony SmartBand bracelet is characterized by a high density of points, but on the other hand, the displayed objects are somewhat blurred at the edges.  Among the minuses of this part is the presence of traces from previous actions.  That is, when you change the function, the old image goes away gradually, and not immediately. </p><p>  The screen is implemented as a touch, but multitouch support is not provided.  Moreover, the sensor function itself is unstable - according to users, you often have to double-click, which is inconvenient.  Here it should be noted and the plastic coating of the display, while the premium wearable electronics for the most part is provided by glass surfaces.  It is worth highlighting the positive side of the screen, which is equipped with all representatives of the Sony SmartBand family, including the initial version of SWR10.  For example, in the sun, information is perceived better than on screens with any backlight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Screens and Extensions </h2><p>  The main screen displays the time and distance traveled per day.  The second screen informs about the number of steps taken, as well as the running and walking times.  The contents and arrangement of the remaining sections depend on the user settings of the extensions.  In particular, you can assign a music player or voice notes to the contents of the next screen.  From an additional option, it is worth highlighting the Voice Control function.  In this case, the developers of Sony SmartBand Talk sought to implement something similar to Google Now or Siri.  This ability allows you to recognize voice commands by combining the results with an Internet search. </p><p>  But for Russian-speaking users, this innovation is useless, since the system only supports working with phrases in English - and even with significant problems.  The Calendar and Weather extensions are more useful.  As in other devices, these options are responsible for displaying the weather and calendar day.  But the creators of Sony SmartBand have slightly expanded the traditional approach to such information, providing for and outputting information for several days in advance. </p><h2>  Communication abilities </h2><p>  The gadget only interacts with devices that run on the Android platform, and only version 4.4.  Pairing can be implemented on two channels - using Bluetooth or NFC.  There are no special problems in organizing the connection - the electronics willingly interacts with smartphones.  I must say that the Sony SmartBand SWR10 bracelet is seriously losing the new modification in terms of the possibilities of working with mobile devices. </p><p>  One of the main advantages of the SWR30 version is support for calls and notifications.  This means that when a call comes to the phone, the bracelet starts to notify the user with vibration.  Through the same device, you can accept the call.  Moreover, the gadget is quite suitable for the role of a wireless headset, allowing the owner to talk without reaching for a smartphone.  Active users of social networks will also like the work of the bracelet with notifications, but, unfortunately, they can only be received as alerts, and the answers are sent through the main device. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Here one can note one more advantage of E-Ink technology, which distinguishes screens from the background of LCD displays.  Sony fitness bracelet can work longer than competitors without recharging due to the use of this technology.  But only subject to the availability of batteries with the same capacity.  Significant autonomy can be achieved if the gadget functions are used rationally. </p><p>  For example, a modification of Sony SmartBand Talk can remain operational for 4 days, provided that any synchronization with the phone is turned off.  But this advantage applies to the screen, and the overall performance of the battery leaves much to be desired.  The battery capacity is only 70 mAh.  For comparison, Samsung's direct competitor provides its fitness bracelets with 210 mAh power elements.  As a result, Korean gadgets are able to work for 5 days without recharging, while not limiting the user in functionality. </p><h2>  Positive bracelet reviews </h2><p>  The model makes a positive impression due to its simplicity, ergonomics and good functionality.  While most manufacturers of new electronics seek to give products new and, as a rule, not particularly useless opportunities, the Japanese company offered a truly effective option.  As the owners themselves note, the Sony SmartBand Talk SWR30 is very convenient with the ability to receive calls and notifications, not to mention the basic functions of a fitness tracker. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The list of flaws may exceed positive reviews.  But the point is not even in their quantity, but in significance.  For example, many owners are not happy with the lack of a heart rate monitor and backlight.  Although the model perfectly displays information in the sun, in the dark it is almost useless.  There are also claims to the device of the strap with latches, which, together with an inconvenient connector for recharging, often cause breakdowns.  As already noted, the Sony SmartBand Talk SWR30 comes with a plastic-coated screen.  This decision immediately caused two shortcomings: firstly, the weak function of the sensors when pressed, and secondly, the susceptibility to mechanical damage. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The device turned out to be ambiguous and in many respects unfinished.  Weak battery, slurred configuration of menu sections, inconvenient interface, screen with its own set of shortcomings - these minuses do not allow calling the Sony SmartBand Talk SWR30 bracelet a good offer in the wearable electronics segment.  Moreover, the lack of competitive products in this area is all the more surprising because the company is practically a pioneer in the field.  But if, from the point of view of the user, Sony fitness bracelets are not particularly attractive so far, then the developers of such devices are following with great interest the steps of the Japanese manufacturer, which at this stage are more likely experimental. </p>
