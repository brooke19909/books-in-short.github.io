    <p>  Energy is a physical quantity.  It implies the whole variety of movement of natural substances.  Different <span>forms of matter</span> correspond to different types of energy. </p><p>  In everyday reality, one can most often observe the direct movement and interaction of physical substances and their parts.  In this case, mechanical energy is released.  It has been known to mankind since ancient times.  Its most common sources are wind and river currents, sea <span>tides,</span> animals and humans.  Types of energy of the mechanical type are divided into two groups.  These include the kinetic form possessed by bodies in motion, and the potential form, which is contained in resting matter. </p><p>  The various <span>types of energy that</span> exist in nature include the light form.  She is known to everyone and accompanies everyone throughout his life period.  Types of light energy sources have been known since antiquity.  These are the Sun and the Moon, stars, bonfires and torches, as well as plants and animals of certain chemiluminescent families.  All living things on our planet are able to exist only thanks to the energy of light.  Its main source on Earth was and remains the Sun.  Without this star, our planet would have looked like a lifeless body chained in a huge thickness of an ice shell.  The rays sent by the celestial body are able to accumulate in other forms of energy.  So, by warming the atmosphere and the Earth's surface, the Sun is a source of heat.  This type of energy is the root cause of the wind.  In turn, this natural phenomenon serves as a source of <span>mechanical motion.</span>  Thanks to the <span>sun's rays</span> , the energy of gas, oil and coal deposits, as well as forests, fields and meadows, called chemical, is generated. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The movement of water particles also possesses tremendous power.  Wave energy is a constant transition from a kinetic form to a potential one.  Each of these <span>types of movement</span> is capable of being transmitted at its own characteristic speed.  The primary source that feeds the energy of the waves, in most cases, is the wind, which occurs as a result of heating the earth's surface. </p><p>  In nature, there is also the movement of sound waves.  The energy transmitted alternately compressible and discharged layers of air spreads in space at the speed of sound.  The movement of <span>waves of electromagnetic</span> fields in physics is called radiation.  The energy of this type is transferred similarly to sound and water.  Its main sources are cosmic radiation, the magnetic field of our planet, as well as certain types of fish. </p><p>  When it comes to the use of energy, it is classified into free (mechanical and electrical, chemical and electromagnetic, as well as nuclear) and chaotic (thermal).  All types of movement do not arise from nothing and do not leave without a trace.  Free types of energy turn into chaotic, having a lower temperature, and can be used almost completely. </p><p>  In the modern world, humanity uses not only the power of natural phenomena.  It learned to distinguish it from other forms: chemical, mechanical, and electromagnetic. </p><p>  The primary source of any type of energy is <span>thermonuclear reactions</span> occurring on the Sun.  In this regard, scientists of our planet have set themselves the task, the solution of which will allow to obtain an artificial luminary.  New types of energy should give impetus to the rapid development of the agro-industrial complex and industry.  If mankind possesses inexhaustible reserves of a thermonuclear source, then it will be able to fulfill any of its dreams. </p>
