  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to strengthen chest muscles</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The chest muscles</span> can be a real decoration of a beautiful torso - and not only male, but also female.  However, strengthening them is not so easy, on the contrary, pumping these muscle groups is one of the urgent problems for visitors to ‚Äúrocking chairs‚Äù and fitness centers. </p><p>  Many people want to have beautiful, convex muscles of the chest, but not everyone knows how to work them out effectively.  It‚Äôs worth starting with the fact that muscle volume is not always an indicator of their strength and development.  The result of effective workouts is not just bloated, but well-developed muscles.  All parts of the pectoral muscles, including the lower and internal muscles of the chest, need to be trained.  <span>The structure of the muscles of the</span> chest is divided into three bundles - internal, lower and middle.  Externally, the structure of the breast can be divided into the upper part and the lower - the lower <span>muscles of the chest,</span> located just below the sternum.  To develop each of these parts, you need to use separate exercises and different equipment for training. </p><p>  The structure of your chest is a factor that significantly affects the possible effectiveness of training.  By such a factor as the type of chest, one can conditionally divide all the trainees into two groups.  The first group - people with a flat chest, as if slightly flattened.  That is, if you put such a person sideways, you won‚Äôt even see a hint of a convex chest.  Such people even often have broad shoulders.  In this case, it is easy to pump up the muscles of the chest, even without particularly burdening yourself with giant bars.  However, power indicators in the bench press for such people leave much to be desired. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the second group, the chest is as if flattened on the sides, but when viewed from the side, it seems that the chest is a wheel.  In fact, this is not so - it is for this category that breast development is often problematic.  But trained people with such a constitution can easily perform exercises such as push-ups (bench press).  This can be explained by the fact that due to the convex chest, the trajectory of the hands becomes shorter. </p><p>  To strengthen the muscles of the chest located in the upper part of the chest, exercises should be performed lying on a bench, the angle of which can be no more than 50 degrees.  Among these exercises - barbell bench press, dumbbell bench press, crossovers.  Push-ups will be very useful, during which the legs are on an elevation - for example, a chair. </p><p>  Push-ups are also useful to pump the internal muscles of the chest.  It‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that when doing push-ups, you don‚Äôt need to try to master such complex types of push-ups as push-ups on several fingers, the outside of the hand or push-ups with a change in the position of the brush, on one hand - after all, these types of exercises are not available to all athletes, but to a poorly trained person generally it is better to skip them to avoid injuries to the hand.  Regardless of which type of push-ups you perform - on your fists or just on the palms - do not forget that you should be comfortable doing them, otherwise you need to change the position of the hands or reduce the number of push-ups. </p><p>  To develop the internal muscles of the chest, they are also well suited: push-ups on the uneven bars, as well as exercises from a lying position on the bench - all kinds of bench presses, wiring dumbbells;  classes on the simulator "Butterfly".  Perform all the presses, stains and other exercises with equipment of considerable, but affordable weight.  For example, to carry out wiring, you should not take dumbbells that are very large and heavy for you, because if you take too large, you will become stronger to bend your elbows, and the exercise will not do you any good.  In addition, depending on the level of your training, it is better to start with something that does not lead to great physical fatigue, and enhanced training will come later.  A variety of presses are good because they train all parts of the chest, including the lower muscles of the chest, at the same time.  Other exercises have a narrower effect. </p><p>  To get the greatest effect, pump alternately the internal muscles of the chest and upper pectoral muscles.  But you should not forget about the lower ones either. </p><p>  To ‚Äústuff‚Äù the lower muscles, do the presses with an inclination downward from a sitting position on a bench - hands holding the upper grip on the dumbbells, have them straightened straight ahead, putting them at chest level.  Bending <span>at the elbows,</span> bring your hands to the lower side edges of your chest, then straighten again. </p><p>  Beginners should start with a typical, simple standard complex.  Then move on to a more serious combination that develops the upper, internal, lower pectoral muscles. </p>
