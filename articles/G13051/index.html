About 15 million tourists come there every year.  What attracts them?  A high level of service, a clean warm sea, the beauty of nature and an abundance of historical and architectural monuments are what Turkey is famous for.  It is quite easy to find a good beach there, because it is for this that most tourists come to this country. </p><h2>  Turkey beaches </h2><p>  This state is considered the best for families, so the greatest interest is not the availability of developed infrastructure, but sandy clean beaches.  Especially important for most tourists, a gentle descent into the water and a shallow depth near the shore.  Recently, all Turkish beaches have become publicly available, even for a sunbed and an umbrella, you do not have to pay everywhere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turkey nice beach" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/466970.jpg" width="295"></div>

    <p>  A lot of wonderful places of rest are located far from the resorts, and they are known only to local residents.  Tourists most often visit city beaches or those owned by hotels and restaurants.  Most of them need to pay for umbrellas and sunbeds, and only in expensive hotels is this included in the price.  Therefore, when buying a ticket you need to choose not only a resort, but also a hotel, because often even two beaches are different nearby.  Turkey is a country with a rocky topography, so many of them are rocky and pebbled.  The most popular tourist destinations are the coasts of the Mediterranean and <span>Aegean Seas.</span>  The mild climate and developed resort infrastructure attract people here.  Sandy beaches of Turkey are located mainly along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beach Behavior </h2><p>  There are several rules that all vacationers should know: </p><ul><li>  Many hotels often prohibit outsiders from entering their territory, but most beaches can be accessed for free.  But for the sunbed and umbrella have to pay. </li><li>  On the beaches owned by restaurants, you can relax only if you order something. </li><li>  After <span>sunset</span> , it is forbidden to swim on city beaches, because the current in the sea is very strong and can drag a person far into the open sea. </li><li>  Shared beaches are rarely cleaned and cleaned, only hotels maintain cleanliness.  Especially where the surface is covered with small pebbles, garbage is noticeable: cigarette butts, food debris. </li><li>  More than 100 beaches in Turkey are awarded the Blue Flag sign, which means that there is very clean water and sand, so littering is prohibited there. </li></ul><h2>  Sandy beaches in the Mediterranean </h2><p>  Magnificent landscapes, a clean warm sea and mild climate attract tourists on the Mediterranean coast.  The most popular resorts are located east of Antalya.  This is a large modern city with a developed infrastructure and an abundance of entertainment for tourists.  The holiday season here lasts from April to October, and the sea warms up to 27 degrees.  It is best to relax in the suburbs.  One of the most popular is Lara, located 12 kilometers from Antalya.  Many hotels, a long strip of sandy beaches and proximity to a large city attract tourists with children here.  The sand here is shallow and soft, and the descent into the water is gentle.  In addition to Antalya, on the Mediterranean coast there are many resorts with sandy beaches, for example, Belek, Side and other less well-known.  The largest of them is Alanya.  The beaches there are covered with dense yellow sand and are mainly located in the bay, so there are no big waves on them.  The coastline stretches in a narrow strip for 20 kilometers.  Very interesting is a two-kilometer stretch of coast, which is called <span>Cleopatra's beach.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rest on pebble beaches </h2><p>  But not only because of this, Turkey is famous.  A good beach is not necessarily sand.  Many pebble beaches are also very popular.  They are located in the central and western parts of the coast.  Their peculiarity is that water in such places </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sandy beaches of turkey" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/466947.jpg" width="443"></div>  usually more transparent.  But mainly young people choose such beaches, since when entering the water there is a sharp decrease, often they make descent from the pontoons or on the stairs.  In those places where large smooth cobbles, such as in Belbidi, you can slip at the entrance to the water.  On some beaches, pebbles are mixed with coarse sand.  Such places are difficult to clean, so they are usually quite dirty.  Cigarette butts and food debris are often visible.  But the prices there are much more affordable.
