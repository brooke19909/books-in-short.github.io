Since then, their appearance and face values ‚Äã‚Äãhave changed many times.  But at almost all times, there were 10 rubles in Russia. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian coins 10 rubles" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/809238.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  <span>Royal coins</span> 10 rubles </h2><p>  In 1755, a trial coin with a face value of 10 rubles appeared.  At that time, Empress Elizaveta Petrovna was on the throne.  She ordered to name the novelty of the mint "Elizabeth Golden".  For quite a long time (right up to the reign of Paul I), much of this coin remained unchanged.  For example, design: five crosswise cartouches;  the state emblem located in the center and the Moscow, Kazan, Siberian and Astrakhan emblems surrounding it.  The date of minting was indicated at the corners of the cross, dignity was indicated by words (ten rubles), and not by numbers.  The declarative inscription ‚ÄúImperial Russian coin‚Äù determined the name that has been used for a long time: ‚ÄúImperial‚Äù.  It was minted for ten years, and then from 1885 to 1917.  Imperial and 10 silver rubles were equivalent. </p><p>  The sample of 1755 was made of high-grade gold, weighed almost 13 grams.  Tsarist coins of Russia 10 rubles, issued in different years of the XIX century, differed from their predecessors primarily in weight.  Most of them weighed less than 10 grams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Soviet coins of 10 rubles </h2><p>  In Soviet times, paper pieces were much more widespread than gold ones.  Coins of this denomination were issued by a sufficiently large party in 1922.  But with their help, <span>trading</span> operations were mainly paid for <span>externally</span> , that is, they were rarely encountered in the country. </p><p>  The golden Soviet chervonets, like its pre-revolutionary predecessor, weighed about 9 grams and was made of gold of the 900th test.  However, the external design was called for active propaganda of the communist system.  The obverse of the coin was decorated with the <span>emblem of the RSFSR,</span> and the reverse with the image of a peasant sower, made according to the sculpture of Shadr. </p><p>  The release <span>of the Soviet gold</span> chervonets was resumed in 1975 (250,000 copies).  And then in the next 7 years each year they minted 1 million coins of this denomination. </p><p>  In 1991, due to inflation, lower-value banknotes were not in demand at all.  Therefore, just then coins of a new type were put into circulation in denominations of 10 and 50 kopecks .;  1, 5 and 10 rubles.  The front side was now decorated not with the emblem and abbreviation ‚ÄúUSSR‚Äù, but with fragments of the Kremlin and the inscription: ‚ÄúState Bank of the USSR‚Äù.  These were the first coins of Soviet Russia, on which there was no coat of arms.  And this is no accident, because literally a few days before the release, the Belovezhskaya agreement on the collapse of the USSR was signed.  Such chervonets were in circulation for about a year.  Numismatists call them "GKChP coins." </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian coins 10 rubles 2014" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/809243.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The first pieces of gold of a new sample </h2><p>  In 1992, the Bank of Russia began to mint coins.  <span>A coin of 10 rubles</span> along with others (with a face value of 1 to 100 rubles) was issued in various editions, which often replaced each other in circulation.  Chervonets was made from an alloy of copper and nickel, its diameter was 21 mm.  The front side was decorated with a double-headed eagle.  The name of the country did not appear anywhere. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When, due to inflation, the ‚Äúrubles‚Äù and ‚Äúnickels‚Äù were practically not used, a coin of 10 rubles became the smallest.  By the end of the 90s, there was a need to stabilize the circulation of banknotes.  That is why the ruble was denominated.  After that, all the coins again became widespread. </p><p>  For several years, combined coins of Russia 10 rubles were minted.  They consisted of a white core made of cupronickel and a yellow outer ring made of an alloy of copper and zinc (brass).  As a rule, coins with a face value of 10 rubles were issued by the Central Bank in limited editions, timed to coincide with some significant events. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="modern coins of Russia 10 rubles" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/803987.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><h2>  What determines the cost of anniversary coins </h2><p>  The value of a coin of 10 rubles is summed up taking into account many factors.  In particular, it depends on the age and condition of the metal piece of gold.  It is also important on which mint the coin was minted (SPMD or MMD).  The analogues differing by this criterion can have absolutely opposite value.  Another significant factor: this is rare.  There are special chervonets, the number of which is limited to several hundred.  As a result, their price is very high.  Coins that have not been circulated are also significantly more expensive than their seasoned twins. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="valuable coins of Russia 10 rubles" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/809260.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Modern coins of Russia 10 rubles </h2><p>  In 2006, a representative of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation made a statement that one of the immediate plans of the Central Bank is to replace 10 rubles banknotes with coins of such denomination.  In 2009, they are already being produced in fairly large editions. </p><p>  The interest of numismatists to modern Russian coins is justified.  Such a money can be easily found in your own wallet.  It is these specimens that often become the first in the collection of enthusiastic people.  Particular attention is drawn to commemorative coins, including 10-ruble ones.  Some of them have a high market value, as they are very rare in circulation. </p>

    <p>  People who are not even interested in collecting, as a rule, are in no hurry to part with anniversary jubilees.  Most of them are well aware that after some time, many of them can skyrocket in price.  Of course, this does not apply to coins issued in large numbers.  Here we are talking about such chervonets, which were produced in small quantities. </p><h2>  Rare coins of Russia 10 rubles </h2><p>  Numismatists have some discrimination based on the list of coins that a collector has.  For example, the ‚Äúeighth level‚Äù can be obtained only if you have three valuable modern pieces of gold, which many experts in this field call NNP.  This is a kind of abbreviation, because we are talking about coins on which are depicted: the Chechen Republic (5000 rubles), the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (1000-15 000 rubles), Perm Territory (2500 rubles). </p><p>  But there are other <span>valuable coins of</span> Russia 10 rubles.  The increase in prices was due to the emergence of a second wave of numismatists who could not get the rarest chervonets in their collections.  We are talking about 10 rubles: "Gagarin", "Politruk", a series of "Ministries and departments of Russia." </p><p>  One of the newest are the gold coins of the series ‚ÄúCities of Military Glory‚Äù.  These are commemorative coins of Russia 10 rubles in 2014, which are issued in runs of 10 million copies.  In this series, the cities are immortalized: Vyborg, Vladivostok, Tver, Stary Oskol, etc. </p>
