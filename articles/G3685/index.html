There are many resorts on its coast, and among them is the respectable and slightly conservative Hammamet.  However, this does not mean that there are no discos, clubs, bars and other entertainment venues.  Just plenty, just the contingent of vacationers is distinguished by a certain stiffness.  However, the situation has changed a bit lately, and all thanks to Russian tourists, who, with their presence, brought Hammamet‚Äôs measured life to liveliness and inherent ease. </p><p>  Along the coastline of the resort, magnificent hotel buildings flaunt.  Many of them are surrounded by neat bungalows in oriental or Andalusian style.  Many tourists prefer to stay in separate bungalows with terraces or oriental courtyards, where you can relax in the evenings, breathing in the intoxicating aroma of the sea and southern exotic plants.  Such hotel complexes include Thalassa Shalimar 4 * (Tunisia).  In almost all 4 and 5 star hotels, thalassotherapy centers can be found.  The ‚Äúsea and sun‚Äù treatment has been practiced in this country since the time of French colonization.  The shores of the Mediterranean are simply magnificent, the sun almost always shines brightly and gently. </p>

    <p>  There is no hotel thalassotherapy center in the Thalasso Shalimar hotel, however, you can order a lot of wellness treatments at the SPA center, among which there are those based on seafood (seaweed, sea water, pearl powder, caviar, etc.).  The biggest feature of the hotel are low housing prices (food is included in this amount).  The minimum cost of daily living can be reduced in the low season to 1,500 rubles.  In the high season, tours are a little more expensive - up to 3000 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  general description </h2><p>  Hotel Thalassa Shalimar 4 * was founded at the very end of the 20th century, in 1999.  Since it did not correspond to today's concepts of comfort, it had to be closed for some time and subjected to complex reconstruction, and already in 2005 it reopened its hospitable doors before visitors and appeared in an updated and more modern form.  Despite the fact that it is on the second coastline, it has its own 3,000-meter-long beach, where all amenities (sunbeds, umbrellas, mattresses) are provided to tourists free of charge, and this is a big plus for vacationers.  Le Shalimar Ex Thalassa 4 * in its structure is a hotel complex, which consists of the main building - a three-story building with beautiful architectural solutions - and more than 50 one-story bungalows in the traditional Andalusian style.  Naturally, the infrastructure includes <span>restaurants, cafes,</span> markets and kiosks, and much more.  The complex has several pools at once - both for children and adults. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  As already noted, Shalimar Ex Thalassa Shalimar 4 * is located in the south of the Tunisian resort of Hammamet.  From the international airport located in Infida, the complex can be reached in about half an hour, since there is a distance of 35 km between them.  The airport that is more known to us, in the city of Monastir, is 90 km away, but from the center of Hammamet resort to the complex is only 9 km.  Tourists from Russia, and from other countries, mainly fly to this same Infida airport, and from there they get by car to their destination.  You can take a taxi, take a bus or minibus, you can even rent a car before arriving in Tunisia.  Nevertheless, the best option is to pay for a transfer from the airport to the hotel, and then you will not need to delve into the road map in search of the desired address.  This can be agreed both with the tour operator and with the hotel itself.  Almost all hotels have this service.  Near the complex there are spacious golf courses - Citrus and Yasmin, as well as a water park. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Thalassa Shalimar 4 *: reviews and ratings of tourists </h2><p>  As already noted above, you can find both positive and negative comments about this hotel complex on thematic portals.  But much more admired reviews.  That was as it should be, because thanks to the hospitality and helpful attitude of the staff, as well as the high level of service in all the institutions inside the hotel complex, vacationers turn a blind eye to the minor imperfections that exist in any such institution.  For example, there are comments that the hotel restaurant is like a dining room, but the cuisine here is amazing, and the cooks are just professionals.  Some recall that at first they were confused by the tiles on the walls, but they immediately began to describe how well Thalassa Shalimar 4 * employees clean rooms and other rooms.  In a word, the positive in the hotel is much more than the negative. </p>
