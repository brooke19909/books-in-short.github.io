Dwelling houses, as a rule, on two floors, are popularly called "cottages."  Their construction began in the 50s and was carried out using German projects.  <span>The center of cultural</span> and creative life of the village was the House of Culture, erected in 1953, its doors are still hospitably open for northerners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The infrastructure of the village consists of shopping centers, clinics, kindergartens, schools, hotels, an experimental complex of higher sports. </p><h2>  Cottage Village North: architecture </h2><p>  The village is built up with 2-storey residential buildings, each of which has four apartments. </p>

    <p>  Basically, the architecture of the cottage village of Severny attracts two types of buildings: some of them provide for the presence of a pediment and rounded windows on the ground floor, others are made in a more simple style, with fewer decorative elements.  Both types of structures alternate, which eliminates the uniformity of the appearance of the settlement. </p>
