But since two thousand and thirteen, it is simply called ‚ÄúShish Khan‚Äù.  This hotel complex, on the sign of which flaunts four stars, stands right on the beach.  It was built in the two thousandth year, and after ten years, it underwent a major overhaul and a complete renovation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iberostar Chich Khan (Iberostar ChichKhan 4)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1536281.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get and when to go </h2><p>  The nearest to the hotel Iberostar Chich Khan (Iberostar ChichKhan 4 *) is <span>Enfida Airport.</span>  Before him, only thirty-nine kilometers.  The <span>airports of Monastir</span> and Tunisia are respectively 101 and 79 km away.  If your trip is part of an organized group, then usually a transfer will pick you up.  But independent travelers are useful to know how to get there.  From each airport to Hammamet get trains (electric trains) or minibuses (piles).  And already to Yasmine special intercity buses run between Hammamet and neighboring Nabeul.  The peak tourist season in Yasmine is summer, although at this time of the year it is very hot here.  But the ideal months to visit this resort are September and October, when the air has already cooled slightly and the water is still very warm - about twenty-four degrees with a plus sign. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Yasmine Hammamet </h2><p>  This area is considered the best in Tunisia for tourism and recreation.  It was specially built up only with hotels, shops, cafes, restaurants, parks and discos.  There are not even neighborhoods populated by locals.  Along the sea there is a beautiful embankment lined with date palm trees.  On it, trains and carriages with horses ride (kaleshes, as gigs are called here).  Here is the largest in Tunisia amusement park "Cartageland".  The famous port of Yasmine is located very close to the Iberostar Chich Khan 4 * hotel.  Hotel reviews indicate that there are taverns with the best seafood in the area.  Yasmine Hammamet is located in the very south of the resort area surrounding the city of the same name.  They walk here mainly on foot, along wide and comfortable sidewalks, especially since the distances everywhere are very small.  And if you want to get to the old Hammamet and the neighboring city of Nabeul - take a taxi, they are not too expensive, or take the red and white public buses.  They go at least once every half an hour.  One of the most interesting places in Hammamet is the New Medina.  It is made in the style of ‚ÄúTunisia in miniature‚Äù.  Many of its buildings are copies of a particular landmark of the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chich Khan 4 Tunisia Hammamet" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1536369.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, all the entertainment of this village is at your service, especially riding a gig or a tourist train.  On the street where the hotel stands, there are a lot of different shops with souvenirs, and their prices are lower than in the center.  Nearby is a water park, and in the evening you can take a walk in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNew Medina.  It is beautiful and safe there.  Nearby are many cafes.  And if you come with a child, then right from the hotel you go to the children's amusement park. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The Iberostar Chich Khan Hotel (Iberostar ChichKhan 4) consists of arched buildings and cottages.  The hotel has a car park.  The hotel buildings are surrounded by a beautiful garden with a variety of tree species.  They are selected so that in any season the splendor of flowering is rampant in the hotel park.  The hotel also has a small shop and an exchange office.  The territory is large, spacious and compact at the same time.  Children often play in the garden, among fruit trees.  The buildings and the park are decorated in the Moorish style, which does not let you forget for a minute that you are in Tunisia - all kinds of pillows, sofas, recesses in the walls, elaborate armchairs, vases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iberostar Chich Khan Numbers" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1536290.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Staff at Iberostar Chich Khan Hotel clean their rooms very carefully.  The staff is attentive, friendly, friendly to tourists, regardless of country of origin.  The waiters are always emphasized decently dressed, welcome guests when they enter the restaurant.  The staff in the bar is also friendly, smiling, always trying to please.  A great team of animators, especially for children.  Evening entertainment takes place in French and English, but they are so incendiary that everything is clear without words.  The staff also speaks a little Russian, so it‚Äôs quite possible to explain. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Tourists find the food at the Iberostar ChichKhan (Hammamet, Tunisia) great.  The description of its guests is almost always carried out in enthusiastic colors.  First of all, we‚Äôll clarify that the hotel practices all inclusive and a buffet.  Under this system, tourists are served three times a day in the main restaurant.  Alcohol is provided to all-inclusive guests from ten in the morning until midnight.  Between lunch and dinner, guests can enjoy a meal in the barbecue area.  There are three bars at the disposal of tourists - in the lobby, by the pool and on the beach.  The latter is open until six in the evening or before sunset.  There is also an √† la carte restaurant with Mexican cuisine (it can be visited once for free for the entire stay).  A disco bar and a Moorish cafe are paid.  The food at the hotel, according to tourists, is excellent.  There is always fish, beef, chicken, baked and fresh vegetables, rice, pasta.  For lunch and dinner, different fruits - grapes, apples, peaches, melon, dates, plums - depending on the season.  Among the snacks between meals, four types of ice cream are served.  Delicious pastries, desserts, meringues.  Fresh and warm buns.  Of the highlights of the kitchen are liver casseroles, sausages, meat and fish, barbecue, as well as shrimp with vegetables.  The restaurant serves only beer and wine from alcoholic beverages, and all that is stronger should be taken at the bar.  If the tourists of neighboring hotels complained about the lack of food and the frequent lack of enough cutlery, then in Shish Khan this was all right. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iberostar Chich Khan 4 Hotel in Hammamet" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1536283.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Hotel Iberostar Chich Khan 4 * in Hammamet does not have access to its own beach, because it is located on the second line.  Go there for about two hundred meters (five minutes, no more).  To do this, cross two roads - the main street and a small, parallel to the sea.  Since the beach belongs to the hotel, all the accessories for relaxing on the water on the coast are free - and deck chairs, and umbrellas, and sun loungers.  It is better to come here in the morning, because after lunch there are a lot of people.  Beach towels are provided at the hotel.  Sometimes it brings black algae to the shore, but this happens for a short time, for a maximum of a day or two.  On the beach there is a hotel bar where you can eat.  The coast is wide, like almost everywhere in Yasmine, with a smooth gentle entry into the water.  In addition, the hotel has three swimming pools - two in the air (with a children's area), and one under the roof. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iberostar Chich Khan 4 hotel reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1536285.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  In Yasmine itself, it‚Äôs worth going around all the amusement parks and shows, like a performance about the life of the pirate Hayreddin Barbarossa or the Tunisian Odyssey.  You also need to visit the old Hammamet with narrow streets of traditional quarters and a fortress.  In the port of Yasmina, you can buy tickets for the excursion on the so-called "pirate ship".  The same entertainment is offered at the hotel, but the issue price is completely different.  If tour operators this boat trip costs twenty-five dollars, then in the port - the same number of <span>Tunisian dinars,</span> and children ride for free.  From long excursions, hotel guests advise trips to the capital, Tunisia, and the ‚ÄúBlue City‚Äù Sidi Bou Said.  Lovers of antiquities should visit the ancient Phoenician ports and the ruins of the famous Carthage.  If you have enough time on vacation, take a sightseeing tour of the country's cities - Djerba, Sousse, Mahdia, Tunisia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iberostar ChichKhan Hammamet Tunisia Description" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1536282.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Chich Khan (ex Iberostar ChichKhan): prices for various services and shopping </h2><p>  The cost of a safe at the reception for guests is three and a half dinars per day (1 dinar is 27 rubles).  Additionally, you need to pay a deposit.  Its amount is twenty dinars, but then it is returned.  The same deposit is taken for beach towels.  Riding a train on Yasmine costs five dinars per person.  From supermarkets and shopping malls, tourists recommend shopping centers such as Costa and Joyce.  There are very reasonable prices, good quality goods and more than acceptable service.  Tunisian ceramics, oriental sweets and olive oil are usually brought from Hammamet.  Local wines are also not bad, but keep in mind that on Fridays the departments with alcohol are covered with a curtain so as not to offend the feelings of Muslim believers.  But in tourist-oriented shops, even this holy day will sell you anything. </p><h2>  Iberostar Chich Khan 4 (Hammamet, Tunisia): reviews and prices </h2><p>  The price for a room in this hotel for independent travelers starts from two thousand eight hundred rubles per day.  This is a colorful hotel, unlike other Tunisian resort complexes.  Tourists in Shishkhan like good service, attentiveness and hospitality of the staff.  The hotel is quite calm, except with the exception of periods when large groups settle there.  There is no stormy nightlife on its territory, so you can get enough sleep.  All arising issues are quickly and quickly resolved by the administration.  The food is varied, and the pool bar is often even better than in the main restaurant.  The hotel has a great location almost in the center of the resort, so you can get everywhere on foot.  Therefore, many recommend this hotel for relaxation.  Here, neither children nor adults will be bored. </p>
