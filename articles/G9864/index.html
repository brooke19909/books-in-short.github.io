  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a kitchen hood</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern people are increasingly getting used to high-quality, comfortable housing.  This process is associated with the development of equipment, furniture manufacturing technologies, and design solutions.  But there is one process, which is very problematic to take out of the apartment, is cooking.  It is clear that this event is accompanied by abundant release of not only moisture, but also smoke, as well as odors, which adversely affect the well-being of people, and the state of equipment and furniture.  For this reason, the question of how to choose a kitchen hood is very relevant in any family. </p><p>  As statistics show, in our country the two types of hoods are most common.  The first of them uses the so-called principle of air recirculation.  The essence of this process is that, according to the principle of a vacuum cleaner, the device draws in air that has accumulated under it, passes it through special filters and, in the future, returns it to the environment.  The second option of the exhaust system is the installation, which sucks in air and sends it through the duct system to the ventilation.  In this case, cooker hoods should be selected, the dimensions of the outlet duct of the duct and ventilation systems for which will coincide. </p><p>  Naturally, devices focused on the principle of air purification are inherently less practical to use, since <span>carbon filters</span> for this type of cooker hoods become clogged over time and lose their properties.  With a certain periodicity they will have to be replaced with new ones.  These systems are suitable for use in rooms where there is no <span>ventilation system,</span> most often in houses of an old construction.  It is clear that the duct can be organized to some extent through a window, but this procedure will require a lot of time, and, most importantly, additional financial costs, which is sometimes an important argument. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When solving the problem of how to choose a <span>kitchen hood,</span> it is worth considering the aesthetic component.  Agree that a device that will sharply contrast with the interior items available in the room will seem slightly inappropriate.  It is worth focusing on the <span>compatibility of colors,</span> as well as the stylistic features of kitchen furniture and hoods. </p><p>  Another point that must be taken into account when discussing with the family the topic of how to choose a kitchen hood.  It should be understood that there are flat, so-called domed and <span>built-in hoods.</span>  Each of them differs not only in features of design solutions, but also, most importantly, in functionality.  If we talk about flat hoods, in the vast majority of cases on the market, manufacturers offer hoods, air purifiers, which are almost impossible to remake and which have disposable filters.  In addition, these devices are equipped, as a rule, with low-power motors, which significantly reduces their efficiency.  A significant advantage of such hoods is, of course, their low price.  Dome hoods are much more powerful, and they are equipped with air vents.  If we talk about embedded systems, their main and main advantage is the ability to effectively integrate them into an existing kitchen interior without compromising the design solution. </p><p>  Asked how to choose a kitchen hood, it is worth considering many factors, but the ideal option, of course, is to contact specialized stores, centers or a professional, where you can get the most comprehensive advice and answers to all questions.  In this case, you really will be satisfied with the purchase. </p>
