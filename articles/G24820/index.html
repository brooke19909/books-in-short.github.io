This blouse is fixed between the legs of the child, does not bulge on the back of newborns and leaves the lower back always closed in older children who are actively moving.  In addition, it makes it easy to change the diaper. </p><p>  The body can be sleeveless, with short or long sleeves, an open neck or collar, almost no fasteners or with buttons along the entire length.  These clothes are easy to sew with your own hands. </p><p>  A body pattern for newborns with a description of the sewing process will be proposed later in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sferamagazine.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bodysuit for a newborn" class="if uuid-2891272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2891272.jpg"></div><p>  By the way, preparing a dowry for a baby with their own hands is not only a pleasant pastime, but also a way to save the family budget.  The cost of a bodysuit for a newborn (you can sew such a pattern in 1.5 hours or less) is much lower than the price of ready-made clothes. </p><h2>  The choice of fabric for sewing </h2><p>  The main rule for the first baby clothes is natural fabric, external seams, a minimum of dyes and decorative elements.  The first sets should be comfortable to put on the child, they should not interfere, rub or irritate somewhere. </p><p>  It is best to choose chintz, kulik, footer, interlock, flannel for sewing <span>children's clothing</span> .  Chintz is a light cotton fabric, the products of which are almost not felt on the body.  The flannel is very soft, has a rare furry fleece and has heat-saving properties.  The flannel body will be very pleasant to the touch and dense. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.diynetwork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric for tailoring" class="if uuid-2891276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2891276.jpg"></div><p>  A cooler is a thin and durable knitted fabric.  Children's clothing from the cooler will allow air to pass through well.  Interlock is characterized by thermal protective properties and durability;  For sewing warm bodys, you can still use the bike. </p><p>  You will need a slanting inlay for processing slices.  The main task of processing is to protect the edges of the product from stretching and deformation.  Clothing treated with inlay looks more attractive even after a long period of regular wear. </p><p>  Before sewing a children's bodysuit for newborns according to the pattern, it is necessary to manually wash the fabric at low temperature and dry.  When washing for the first time, the fabric may sit slightly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="katesewingblog.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="body pattern size 62" class="if uuid-2891268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2891268.jpg"></div><h2>  Finished pattern </h2><p>  The bodysuit for a newborn can be sewn according to a standard pattern.  For beginners, it may be more convenient not to build the pattern yourself on paper, but to use a different method: buy one body of the style you want to sew and make a pattern for it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The body pattern for newborns with sizes can be found in the article.  Here are the sizes 62 (for large newborns) and 68 (for 3-6 months).  The numbers indicate the length of the segment in centimeters. </p><p>  As for the sizes, it is not worth sewing the smallest clothes (50-56 cm), although such body patterns for newborns can also be found.  Firstly, the children of the first months of life grow very quickly, and secondly, the baby can be born with a body length of 46 to 58 centimeters, so that the smallest body can immediately become small. </p><div class="photo" data-original="katesewingblog.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="body pattern size 68" class="if uuid-2891269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2891269.jpg"></div><p>  According to this pattern, the body for a newborn with his own hands can be sewn with short, long sleeves or even without sleeves.  Buttons are supposed only between the legs, and not along the entire length of the product. </p><h2>  Transfer patterns to fabric </h2><p>  How to sew a bodysuit for a newborn?  The pattern is first translated into tracing paper or newsprint in size.  On each side you need to leave one centimeter for allowances, and then cut in front, back and two sleeves of the desired length. </p><h2>  Neck and Bottom Processing </h2><p>  It is convenient to take the edging from 3 to 5 cm wide for processing edges. Knitted products do not require oblique edging processing because they stretch well, so you can take a straight line for them.  The required length is calculated as follows: neck length minus 2 cm. </p><p>  The necklace needs to be folded in half with the wrong side inward, attached to the neck and pinned with pins.  To make the product look neat, you should first notice the trim with contrasting threads.  Then sew in a zigzag, stepping back one centimeter from the edge.  Excess fabric is cut close to the stitch. </p><p>  The lower part of the body for the newborn (back and front) must be treated in the same way.  After the sleeves are sewn, open sections also need to be processed, but in a different way.  On the sleeves, 0.5-1 cm is simply tucked inside out and attached. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.spoonflower.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a body do it yourself" class="if uuid-2891280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2891280.jpg"></div><h2>  How to sew on sleeves </h2><p>  The sleeve must be folded in half, to find the highest part of the shoulder.  This middle is applied face to face with shoulder overlap.  The edges of the sleeve are applied to the edge of the sewing on the sleeves of the back and front.  Then the fabric must be evenly distributed and sewn in a line. </p><h2>  Sew side seams </h2><p>  It remains only to sew the side seams.  It is very easy to do.  It is better to use the line "zigzag" (goat), and then cut the fabric close to the cut.  By the way, the body for a newborn in a pattern can also be done with seams out.  Such clothes will not rub delicate skin and certainly will not cause inconvenience to the baby. </p><h2>  Insert buttons in the body </h2><p>  Buttons in this model can be inserted not only between the legs, but also on the shoulders.  This can be done quickly, efficiently and effortlessly with a special tool.  It is enough just to fix such forceps on the fabric in the right place and knock the buttons several times with a hammer so that they fall into place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.spoonflower.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a body" class="if uuid-2891277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2891277.jpg"></div><p>  The body pattern for a newborn is very simple, even a novice craftswoman will cope with such work.  But what a pleasure - to sew the first clothes to your beloved baby with your own hands! </p><p>  It also significantly saves the family budget.  After all, children grow up very quickly, and the expectant mother usually buys a lot of clothes for the smallest, which eventually turns out to be unclaimed.  Needlework will help to spend prenatal leave with benefit and pleasure. </p>
