Sochi 5 star hotels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many choose to spend their holidays a city that proudly bears the name of Sochi.  All-inclusive hotels are the best vacation option you can choose. </p><h2>  Hotel Prometheus Club </h2><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi All Inclusive Hotels" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/478189.jpg" width="520">  One of the most cozy and comfortable hotels that exist in Lazarevsky.  The first thing to note is the presence of your own beach.  This is a very important factor that all tourists take into account when choosing Sochi hotels.  The Prometey Club hotel is located on the seashore in the very center of the resort village of Lazarevskoye.  The location is ideal in terms of infrastructure: 1.5 kilometers from the railway station, 15 minutes by car to the center of Sochi, 100 km from the Sochi airport.  The hotel complex consists of residential buildings, pools, bars, restaurants.  There is a spa center and, of course, as was said before, a private beach.  If you go to Sochi, all-inclusive hotels will be the right choice.  Prometheus Club is just such a hotel.  Guests can choose from 325 rooms of various categories.  The rooms are located in Sea and ordinary cottages, in the New building. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All numbers are divided into nine categories.  The rooms are equipped with the most necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãplumbing, modern furniture, additional accessories.  Cleaning is done every day, linen changes every three days, and towels daily.  Most of the rooms offer a luxurious view, which you can admire while standing on the balcony (they are in almost all rooms). </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays in sochi hotels" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/478190.jpg" width="600">  Comfortable rooms are not the only thing a person needs for a good rest in Sochi.  All-inclusive hotels should provide their guests with good food.  It is worth returning to the previously mentioned example - the Prometey Club hotel, where three meals a day are organized as a buffet, which is served in the Tavern restaurant. </p><p>  But that‚Äôs not all: the hotel has several more exquisite places to eat.  These include the Galileo restaurant and the children's restaurant, which is located in the Eastwood complex.  The Galileo and Tavern serve the following dishes in unlimited quantities: cold appetizers, ice cream, beer, coffee, tea, various sweets, pastries.  Alcohol is also offered: vodka, semisweet and dry wines, champagne.  And, of course, a non-alcoholic assortment: mineral water, juices and carbonated drinks.  And for VIP-guests a light breakfast is offered - desserts, coffee, tea, juices and champagne (which in some countries, by the way, is drunk at breakfast). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Picturesque places </h2><p><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels in sochi" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/478191.jpg" width="600">  If we talk about hotel complexes of the highest level, then the Grand Hotel is worth noting.  Sochi is a city in which there are several such hotels.  And one of the most popular is the Grand Hotel Polyana.  This hotel complex is picturesquely situated in the protected areas of the national park of Sochi.  Around the <span>Caucasus mountains</span> extend <span>,</span> nearby is the famous Krasnaya Polyana.  Guests who come here fully enjoy the beauty of unique waterfalls and canyons, caves and alpine meadows, magnificent vegetation and rich wildlife.  Landscapes will appeal to even the most sophisticated traveler.  Good service and developed structure of the hotel complex - what else is included in the rest in Sochi?  Hotels, in addition to comfortable accommodation, offer original entertainment so that guests in the intense heat can spend time productively, and not just sit out at the hotel. </p><h2>  Everything for leisure </h2><p>  The Grand Hotel has 413 comfortable rooms, restaurants, bars, wooden villas, fine cuisine, a kids club and even a conceptual health center.  If a guest is tired of swimming in the sea and sunbathing, then he can have a good time in the hotel.  There are sports fields and tennis courts, ski slopes and cable cars - all that is needed for outdoor activities.  Guests are offered entertainment and sightseeing programs.  At the Grand Hotel, everything is organized at the highest level: <span>service, service,</span> atmosphere.  The guests are offered a wide alcoholic and non-alcoholic assortment; there are bars both at the water park and on the beach.  Yes, your own beach is what you need for a good vacation.  By the way, lovers of gourmet and exotic food are offered sushi and grill bars.  This hotel will also appeal to lovers of quality tobacco - on the territory there is a cigar club called ‚ÄúMarine‚Äù. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi hotels 5 stars" class="if" height="245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/478192.jpg" width="456"></p><h2>  Variety of rooms </h2><p>  People choosing 5-star Sochi hotels pay attention to many details, because they want everything to be perfect - from service to room cleaning.  Continuing the theme of the Grand Hotel Polyana, it is worth noting the extraordinary variety of rooms.  It is important!  <span>The best hotels in Sochi</span> offer their guests a wide variety of rooms for every taste, color and wallet. </p><p>  An ideal option for small friendly companies will be a magnificent two-story villa.  It stands apart from other buildings.  It can freely accommodate seven people.  There are five bedrooms, a kitchen, a dining room, a living room and even a sauna.  The house has everything that is necessary for a full company vacation. </p><p>  There are deluxe rooms - one spacious room with an entrance and a bathroom will appeal to lovers of exquisite rooms, in fact, like a luxury studio. </p><p>  There is a honeymoon room decorated in the best design traditions. </p><p>  Two-room suite for two, a business suite, ideal for both fruitful work and a comfortable stay, a family suite, a panoramic suite and even rooms designed for people with disabilities - all this is offered to guests.  Everyone will find a haven to their liking. </p><h2>  Respectability - Above All </h2><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Hotel Sochi" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/478193.jpg" width="600"></p><p>  So what else can the city of Sochi have to offer?  All-inclusive hotels in their category include another complex - Atelika Gamma Resort &amp; SPA. </p><p>  The five-star luxury hotel is located in the Tuapse district of Sochi.  It will be an excellent choice for those who respect respectable rest with a high level of service and the undoubted quality of the services offered. </p><p>  Guests are served as an ultra all inclusive.  The list of services is maximally expanded, and everything that employees offer is included in the price.  If you decide to relax so that you feel like a master of life, Atelika Gamma Resort &amp; SPA will be an ideal place. </p><p>  And, of course, one cannot fail to tell about such a place in Sochi as the Grand Hotel &amp; SPA Rodina.  A private beach, several gourmet restaurants, indoor and outdoor pools, a kids club, a lot of different institutions and a spa center are all for a comfortable stay.  But this is not all the charms of the hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel Feature </h2><p>  The first thing worth noting is the presence of its own promenade, the length of which is 700 meters.  There is a refinement of style in everything: in the interior of rooms, premises, in landscape design, in the design of restaurants and bars. </p><p>  It offers spacious rooms.  Top-level service: daily cleaning and linen change with towels. </p><p>  It is worth noting the nutrition, because it is very important: three times a day "buffet" and intermediate meals.  Other establishments are located on the territory of the complex: the Oliva restaurant, made in the Greek style, the pizza cafe with the spectacular name Fiesta, lobby and sports bars, a tasting room that offers the best wines of Kuban producers, a cafe with Caucasian cuisine , phyto-bar and many other interesting places. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi hotels by the sea" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/478194.jpg" width="462"></p><h2>  Memories for life </h2><p>  It is not without reason that they say that Sochi is a dream city, to which they come in order to fully breathe the aroma of freedom, to feel serene and to devote themselves to all kinds of entertainments for the duration of the vacation.  When deciding to come to this wonderful city on vacation, carefully approach the issue of selecting temporary housing.  After all, the quality of rest depends on this.  Moreover, a wide selection of various hotels in <span>Sochi</span> allows you to find exactly the option that will be acceptable both in quality and price. </p>
