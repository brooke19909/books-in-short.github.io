This can be partially explained by the oversaturation of the market, the uniformity of low-quality goods and the need for diversity.  In addition, the therapeutic benefits of such activities have been proven (way out of depressive states, sedative effect, the development of fine motor skills). </p><p>  Women's <span>sweaters</span> with <span>knitting needles</span> with braids (patterns for which are very diverse) can be attributed to the most popular products with which many craftswomen begin their career.  A sweater is a product without fasteners with a high neck. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit sweater women" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1139326.jpg" width="298"></div>

    <h2>  The principle of forming a pattern of braids </h2><p>  The first association of many people with the words "knitting" is just tows, arana or braids.  These relief elements are able to decorate almost any product.  Patterns including braids are suitable for the manufacture of most models of women's, men's and children's clothes, interior pillows and bedspreads.  They are easy to learn and remember and do not require a high level of knitter skill. </p><p>  An elementary braid is formed by literally crossing the loops and knitting them in this position.  For knitting a tourniquet, you can use any number of loops, starting with two and ending with several tens.  The more crossed loops, the more voluminous the canvas comes out.  The main thing to remember when <span>tackling a</span> knitted <span>sweater with braids</span> is that the tows tighten the fabric and significantly increase yarn consumption.  Therefore, it is necessary at the preparatory stage to tie a small sample, for example, 20 loops in 20 rows.  It should be accurately measured so that it is possible to calculate the parameters of the planned product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of knitting braids with knitting needles </h2><p>  To illustrate the verbal description below are pictures.  They depict directly the process of formation of a tourniquet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="women's sweaters with knitting pattern" class="if" height="239" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1139472.jpg" width="336"></div>

    <p>  So, in this example, the braid consists of interweaving two strands of 4 loops in each.  In order to weave the harness to the right, you should: </p><ul><li>  To put on 4 not knitted loops of the first lock on the right knitting needle. </li><li>  Transfer 4 loops of the second strand to the auxiliary knitting needle, which should be the same number as the main ones. </li><li>  Return the stitches of the first strand to the left knitting needle. </li><li>  Put the loops of the second strand on the left knitting needle from the auxiliary tool. </li><li>  Knit the resulting tourniquet. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted sweater" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1139473.jpg" width="287"></div></li></ul><p>  Performing these manipulations requires a certain space, so the bundles are very inconvenient to knit when the fabric density is too high. </p><h2>  Doing back braid </h2><p>  The braid in the opposite direction (to the left) requires a slightly different knitting order and sequence: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The loops of the first strand should be untied to the auxiliary tool. </li><li>  Loops of the second strand - on the right knitting needle. </li><li>  After crossing, put them on the left knitting needle. </li><li>  Knit in a new order. </li></ul><p>  Understanding the principle and mastering this technique will allow you to perform braids of any complexity. </p><h2>  Important Notice </h2><p>  Intending to <span>knit a sweater</span> with braids with knitting needles (female or male), the craftswoman should have a good spatial imagination and be able to mentally compose the elements of individual patterns.  Of course, you can rely on luck and, at the risk, fully follow the instructions in the magazine.  However, you can suddenly find that the dimensions of the finished sweater do not correspond to the planned ones, the pattern looks much smaller or larger than that in the magazine, and the braid associated with such effort is completely invisible due to the bright melange. </p><p>  You should know that the simpler the knitted product, the more attractive it is.  If desired, you can use no more than one bright component in one model (either a complex pattern and simple yarn, or vice versa). </p><h2>  Pattern: specifics and the need to build </h2><p>  An important condition for the manufacture of really high-quality things can be called: </p><ul><li>  The correct calculation of the size of the future sweater and the number of loops in the details. </li><li>  Compliance with the scheme. </li><li>  Proper formation of armholes and necks. </li><li>  Thoughtful selection of yarn. </li></ul><p>  This is not to say that a women's sweater with braids, knitted with needles, necessarily requires a pattern, especially if the craftswoman plans to knit some simple model.  For example, sweaters, all details of which are in the form of rectangles or raglans. </p><p>  If you nevertheless decided to work on the pattern, you need to take the measurements correctly, carry out the calculations and build it on paper. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sweaters with braids knitting scheme with a description" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1139439.jpg" width="379"></div>

    <p>  In the picture above, the model is presented as a pattern.  The ‚Äúlive‚Äù sweater associated with this pattern will look like in the picture below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted women sweater with braids" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1139450.jpg" width="600"></div>  Due to the fact that it is extremely difficult to achieve smooth lines when knitting a neck and a sleeve, you can give the parts a slightly angular shape (as shown in the picture).  In a sock it will be imperceptible.

    <h2>  Pattern: basic aspects of its selection and adaptation </h2><p>  The choice of pattern for work is determined taking into account the type of product, its purpose and the skills of the craftswoman. </p><p>  The distribution of the ornament in the center of the canvas, as in the previous picture (with a red sweater), is used most often. </p><p>  All the harnesses used in the formation of the pattern are knitted the same way.  A description of the process is given above.  In the center of the front part there is one large braid, on its sides - the same elements of a smaller size.  The sleeve is decorated only with a large scythe running in the center.  In this case, the number of harnesses is odd, so they are all made in the same direction.  If there are more of them or the number of elements can be divided in half, the braids are directed in different directions or towards each other. </p><p>  Combined <span>women's sweaters</span> with <span>knitting needles</span> and braids also look good, patterns can be developed independently or found in specialized literature.  Harnesses are suitable for combination with other patterns, most importantly, do not overdo it. </p><h2>  Knitting sweaters with <span>braids knitting needles (diagrams</span> with description) </h2><p>  After determining the dimensions of the future product, choosing a pattern and knitting a sample, you can proceed directly to knitting a model.  The picture below shows a sweater with braids for knitting for women with rather interesting custom harnesses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit sweater for women" class="if" height="245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1139331.jpg" width="564"></div>

Those strands that go ‚Äúon top‚Äù consist of 5 loops, and those that remain below - of 8 loops.

    <p>  Empty cells in the diagram are facial loops, cells with a dot in the center are purl.  Long slanting strokes indicate the direction in which the loops should cross to form a tourniquet. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the fact that weaving is performed in a checkerboard pattern.  That is, if at first the braids are directed to the right, then at the next stage they should be placed with an inclination to the left. </p><h2>  Eraser: start and end </h2><p>  Careful design of the bottom edge of the product is very important.  Often they use an elastic band 1: 1 or 2: 2 (as in the picture).  So begin to <span>knit women's sweaters</span> with <span>knitting needles</span> with braids.  Gum knitting patterns are usually not indicated, since the principle of operation is obvious: 2 facial, 2 wrong.  The cuffs and collar are designed in the same way. </p><p>  In knitting, an important role is played by ingenuity and improvisation, which can not be avoided if an unexpected situation arises. </p><p>  In any case, forethought, the ability to count loops and follow the pattern, as well as basic common sense, will help almost every craftswoman to create excellent women's sweaters with knitting needles with braids.  Knitting patterns serve as a wonderful field for the creativity of many experienced knitters.  These patterns will always be relevant and fashionable. </p>
