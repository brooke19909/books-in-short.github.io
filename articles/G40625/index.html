It is she who is the founder of the tourism business in Phuket, which was started by local residents.  They came to the beach on weekends to swim, relax and sunbathe under the gentle rays of the sun. </p><h2>  General facts </h2><p>  Rawai, Phuket, is located about seventeen kilometers from the city.  Now Rawai is perceived as a starting point for numerous excursions, which are put forward several times a day in different directions.  In 2007, a mall was erected here, which was originally conceived as a walking place for residents, as well as for fishing enthusiasts.  It is here that along the coast you can find "parked" light boats that you can rent for any amount of time and embark on a sea expedition to neighboring islands. </p><p>  Another thing is evening.  It is at dusk that Rawai pier in Phuket, Sea Jeepsie Village, and this is the name of the mall, comes to life and turns into a concentration of recreational activities that are enjoyed not only by travelers, but also by local residents.  Bright lights shine with bars where local music groups, restaurants and discos perform.  Cafes on Rawai Beach are notable for their unbridled fun and tear-down discos at the end of the work week. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.phuket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rawai Beach" class="if uuid-3241331" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3241331.jpg"></div><h2>  Road to the beach </h2><p>  Getting to Rawai is easy, because everywhere there are many signs.  The main thing is to follow the Hanging Road.  It runs parallel to the coast and leads straight to Rawai beach, Phuket.  You need to follow up to the dead end on the pier, then turn right - and you are on the beach.  There is no further road, so you need to park in a convenient place and, taking everything you need, move on foot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.2112design.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sunset on Rawai" class="if uuid-3241336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3241336.jpg"></div><h2>  The beach itself </h2><p>  Description of Rawai beach in Phuket is by no means the most colorful.

The beauty of such a rental is that the captain of the boat or boat will wait for you as long as you need for a leisurely walk around the island and bring you back.  Thus, no need to worry about the return trip home. </p><p>  The special charm of Rawai beach, Phuket, is a gastronomic trip.  Numerous restaurants provide the option of ordering food.  Couriers deliver it to you anywhere.  You can order delicious food and sit on the beach, suppose to contemplate the sunset.  Pay attention to what institutions the Thais themselves prefer.
