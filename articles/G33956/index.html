    <h2>  Impressions of guests </h2><p>  Many people choose Cyprus for holidays.  Capo Bay Hotel reviews are extremely positive.  After all, this is one of those hotels in which every tourist dreams of staying.  Since this is really a chic hotel, which is exactly what it is presented in the descriptions. </p><p>  Separate attention travelers note the kitchen.  Here you can try anything - from sesame paste called "tahini" and hummus to yogurt sauce "zaziki", souvlaki and <span>grilled halumi cheese</span> .  The restaurant menu is really amazing.  The buffet is certainly simpler, but its dishes are striking in their taste and variety.  Here even champagne for breakfast is served with caviar and red fish. </p><p>  Even more warmly, guests speak about the beach.  Clean, with friable sand of a soft golden hue and convenient water entrances.  In addition, a certain deck chair is assigned to the guest upon arrival, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about getting up early in the morning and taking a seat. </p><p>  And of course, the staff.  This is a separate issue.  At Hotel Capo Bay, each guest is respected, trying to do everything possible to make him comfortable.  But to find fault with the service is really difficult - housekeeping and replacement of linen with towels is arranged daily and with high quality.  Cosmetics are regularly updated, replenished coffee and tea, and bring bottled water. </p><p>  All in all an ideal hotel.  The best in Protaras, as tourists say.  Therefore, if you want to have a good rest at the sea and enjoy good service, you should go here. </p>
