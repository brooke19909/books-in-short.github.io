Human PS are an intermediate position between personal <span>mental properties</span> that are stable and stable, and <span>mental processes that</span> occur at a particular point in time.  PS can last for months, but under favorable conditions change rapidly.  Usually, a mental state is understood as any energy characteristic that affects a person‚Äôs activity - fatigue, vigor, euphoria, depression, apathy. </p><p>  <strong>What are mental conditions?</strong> </p><p>  Mental states are integral characteristics of mental activity in a certain period of time.  They accompany human life, constantly changing, in its relations with society, people, etc.  Any PS consists of three measurements common to all: </p><p>  - motivational and incentive, </p><p>  - emotionally evaluative, </p><p>  - activation and energy. </p><p>  The first dimension is decisive. </p><p>  There are also ‚Äúmassive" PS, that is, states common to certain groups of people.  Two such conditions are considered in the scientific literature - public mood and public opinion. </p><p>  Human PS can be characterized by mobility, integrity, relative stability, polarity, typicality and individual identity, interconnection with personality properties and processes and extreme diversity. </p><p>  <strong>Classification of Mental Conditions</strong> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Modern science distinguishes mono-states and poly-states.  The former can be characterized by the fact that one or two manifestations are dominant at a certain point in time: these can be intellectual states (thoughtfulness, doubts), affective states (anger, fear, envy).  The latter are complex multicomponent combinations (fatigue, responsibility). </p><p>  <span>Mental states of a</span> person are different in duration: lasting several seconds-minutes - operational;  lasting hours-days - current;  lasting weeks to months, even years are long. </p><p>  There are different types of mental states of norm and pathology.  PS norms are characterized by repeatability of structural characteristics, balance, unity, subordination, the adequacy of mental regulation and reflection can also be attributed to this.  In other words, these are harmonic states.  If violations occur in the above characteristics, this leads to the appearance of pathologies.  Separately, borderline states are distinguished - psychopathy, neurosis. </p><p>  PS can also be positive and negative - in terms of the quality of influence on the results of activity. </p><p>  There are also classifications in which the following formations are classified: </p><p>  - levels of mental activity of consciousness, </p><p>  - levels of activation of reticular information. </p><p>  Classification by indicators of consciousness activity includes: </p><p>  - a state of increased mental activity, </p><p>  - state of optimal (average) mental activity, </p><p>  - <span>state of altered consciousness</span> , </p><p>  - a state of reduced mental activity, </p><p>  - the state of transition from vigilance to sleep, </p><p>  - state of vigorous sleep (with dreams), </p><p>  - state of deep sleep (slow), </p><p>  - state of loss of consciousness. </p><p>  Qualitative classifications of PS are based on the levels listed above. </p><p>  In conclusion, we consider mental states as <span>mental phenomena:</span> they are the result of a holistic adaptive personal reaction to changes in internal and external conditions, aimed at achieving a positive result and manifesting itself in the degree of mobilization of functional capabilities and human experiences. </p>
