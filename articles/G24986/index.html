  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotel "Golden Valley" in Novosibirsk: address, room reservation, services and reviews with photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among the vast Siberian forests, on the shore of the reservoir that feeds Novosibirsk, half an hour from the center of this unofficial capital of Siberia is the world-famous scientific enclave - Akademgorodok.  With the light hand of the initiator of its creation, Academician Lavrentyev, his location was subsequently acclaimed as the Golden Valley.  However, the topic of this article is the modernized comfortable hotel of the same name, favorably located within the Akademgorodok. </p><p>  The Zolotaya Dolina Hotel (Novosibirsk) has been familiar to many scientists visiting the Academgorodok for many years.  They note the renovation carried out in it since 2014, the improvement of living conditions.  Working in the daytime in the laboratories, conducting research with colleagues, scientists will return to their cozy rooms in the evening, preparing in comfort for the next working day. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Ideal for the people of science, who were sent to Akademgorodok, the Golden Valley Hotel (Novosibirsk) was built.  The photo of her only building contains an image of a modernized standard eight-story building, on the ground floor of which there is a restaurant with a lounge.  Some get to her from Tolmachevo airport by taxi, others from the city from Karl Marx Square by shuttle bus number 1015, and others from the railway station by bus number 8. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gold-valley.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Golden Valley Novosibirsk Akademgorodok" class="if uuid-3020753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/3020753.jpg"></div><p>  Within walking distance from the hotel are the main research institutes: thermal physics, inorganic chemistry, catalysis, organic chemistry, nuclear physics, computer systems, computational mathematics, computer technology, cytology and genetics, chemical biology and fundamental medicine, cell and molecular biology, geophysics and oil and gas biology, agricultural chemistry and soil science, electrometry and automation, applied and theoretical mechanics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Near the hotel there is a shopping center.  27 km - State Scientific Library of Russia.  The Novosibirsk State Opera and Ballet Theater is 29 km away. </p><h2>  Briefly about ecology </h2><p>  It is Akademgorodok, where the hotel under consideration is located, is the most environmentally friendly area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe capital of Siberia.  Therefore, guests of Novosibirsk, who monitor their health, try to settle in the hotels of the scientific town.  It rarely happens when a relict forest adjoins the city line, when the alluring expanses of the Ob reservoir lie nearby.  In summer, there is a water park and a yacht club.  In winter, vacationers are greeted by the famous ski resort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="siberiantimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel golden valley novosibirsk reviews" class="if uuid-3020769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/3020769.jpg"></div><p>  Those living in the Siberian scientific enclave do not feel themselves on the periphery: a developed transport network connects Akademgorodok with the infrastructure of the rest of Novosibirsk, which has a truly developed leisure industry. </p><h2>  Contacts </h2><p>  Legally, at Novosibirsk, Akademika Lavrentyev Avenue, in fact - at a different address (Novosibirsk, Ilyich St., 10) is the hotel "Golden Valley" (Novosibirsk).  Contact phone numbers can be found on the official website. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is not particularly difficult to book a room in this hotel, guaranteeing a good price / quality ratio.  The hotel‚Äôs corporate website can be found on the Internet.  On the left side of its main page is a panel for booking rooms.  After entering the dates of entry and departure and determining the number, the potential customer is determined by the amount of payment.  The payment section on the same site opens immediately after booking with the appropriate button redirecting to the payment gateway of Sberbank of Russia.  The receipt printed at the same time is an official document. </p><p>  Scientific institutions also use another type of reservation, traditional.  Private correspondence with a hotel is usually carried out by private individuals through the Golden Valley address box.  A guarantee letter is sent, and then the arriving employee pays in cash or by card at the hotel cash desk. </p><p>  For legal entities, additional contacts are also offered.  Note that also through the phones of the directorate (management apparatus) and the reservation department, the Golden Valley Hotel (Novosibirsk) communicates with other legal entities and potential customers.  These contacts are carried out according to the numbers indicated on the official website. </p><h2>  Reviews: hotel at Akademgorodok </h2><p>  A budget-type hotel, judging by the reviews of its guests, is in full compliance with the requests of scientists sent to Akademgorodok.  By reading such reviews, one can sense a tendency for the systematic work of the administration, as already mentioned.  Those visitors who have already been here several times a year note a dynamic improvement - from year to year - of living conditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.gold-valley.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Golden Valley Novosibirsk" class="if uuid-3020766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/3020766.jpg"></div><p>  We list the most often deserved hotel "Golden Valley" (Novosibirsk) reviews: </p><ul><li>  convenient location; </li><li>  good reception work; </li><li>  diligent and polite staff; </li><li>  tasty and hearty breakfast; </li><li>  The hotel is kept clean. </li></ul><h2>  Services </h2><p>  The comfort of any hotel establishment is determined by the quality of its services.

There are no complaints about its quality, there are only thanks: hearty, varied, tasty. </p><h2>  Business hotel </h2><p>  An important aspect of the stay of a seconded person at a hotel is usually two things: the first is to have a bite and relax, the second is to collect your thoughts and summarize the amount of work performed per day.  We have already written to one degree or another about the first aspect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotel-inn.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Golden Valley Novosibirsk contacts" class="if uuid-3020771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/3020771.jpg"></div><p>  What opportunities does the Golden Valley business trip provide?

In addition, its specialized premises (conference room and meeting rooms on the 6th and 7th floors) are quite suitable for holding various business meetings and meetings. </p><h2>  Leisure at the hotel </h2><p>  Obviously, a city non-resort hotel, located on the balance of Akademgorodok, has a limited leisure infrastructure.  After all, its guests in their vast majority in the daytime work. </p><p>  Nevertheless, it is possible for them to continue communicating with colleagues in an informal setting in the hotel restaurant-lounge.  They can also comfortably spend time at a game of billiards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gold-valley.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Golden Valley Novosibirsk rooms" class="if uuid-3020770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/3020770.jpg"></div><p>  However, those who wish to have fun more thoroughly do not feel constrained here.
