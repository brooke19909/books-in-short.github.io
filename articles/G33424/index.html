    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  Snow Pad in Vladivostok is a new residential neighborhood under construction under the state program Housing for a Russian Family.  On an area of ‚Äã‚Äã27.8 hectares there will be 12 houses of varying number of storeys, each of which will be equipped with an intercom, a high-speed noiseless elevator, as well as a fire safety system. </p><p>  The architectural concept of the Snowfall microdistrict fully reflects the needs and requirements of modern residents.  The convenient location of residential buildings relative to each other and infrastructure, a well-maintained house territory, a sufficient number of parking spaces, spacious apartments of improved layout are what all residents will receive.  Houses on the 9th, 18th and 25th floors form a single concept. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The developer of the Snegovaya Pad microdistrict is Primorskraystroy, a state-owned enterprise in the Primorsky Territory.  This is the largest developer of the region, with the help of which many socially significant objects were built.  All work is carried out using modern materials and unique technologies, which allows us to achieve amazing results.  The company employs real professionals with many years of experience.  The microdistrict is being built as part of the state program, so each stage of work is closely monitored.  There is not the slightest reason to doubt the quality of work and the timing of completion of the facility. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Microdistrict "Snow Pad" is located in an ecologically clean area - in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Second River.  A special microclimate gives it popularity and attractiveness: it is always sunny and warm here.  Affected by the lack of harmful production.  Space, the opportunity to enjoy the clean air, the beauty of the landscape for many residents of Vladivostok is a dream.  The project is being built as part of a support program for young families, so most of the buyers of apartments are young families with small children who care about their health. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The first real estate buyers note that the windows of apartments in Vladivostok now offer a picturesque view of the forest and river, and not the pipes of factories. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The Pervorechensky <span>district of Vladivostok</span> is located in some isolation from the central part of the city, which scares potential buyers.  The proximity to the Sedanka-Patroclus highway provides the necessary transport accessibility: within half an hour you can get from the complex to anywhere in the city.  New buildings are being built as part of the state program to help young families, so there is enough public transport in their direction: minibuses and buses.  Stops are within walking distance of each home. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  "Snow Pad" is part of an already created and equipped microdistrict.  All its residents will have access to the necessary infrastructure.  Kindergartens, schools, a clinic, a shopping and entertainment center have already been built in the district, cafes and bank branches have been opened.  The first floors of the houses will be reserved for commercial facilities in the service sector: residents of the micro-district will have their own hairdresser, fitness center, atelier and much more. </p>

    <p>  The project provides for the improvement of the local area: here there will be modern playgrounds and sports grounds, areas for walking and recreation.  Residents of the complex will not have to leave its territory to enjoy the delights of summer and winter outdoor recreation. </p><p>  Car owners will appreciate the availability of ample parking with a sufficient number of parking spaces.  The complex is under round-the-clock security, there is a video surveillance system that guarantees the necessary safety to car owners. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  Several construction companies offer apartments in Vladivostok, but the state-owned enterprise managed to take into account all the wishes of modern residents.  A variety of planning solutions are provided for customers to choose from, among which everyone will find something special for himself. </p><p>  The developer proposed one-, two- and three-room apartments of improved layout.  They turned out to be spacious, bright, with stunning views of the forest and river.  Here everyone will find the best option for themselves, starting from a small compact odnushka for a young family and ending with a spacious three-room apartment with isolated rooms and an additional bathroom.  Housing is rented without finishing, but if necessary, qualified experienced craftsmen will implement a design project for your cozy nest and help in choosing the necessary materials. </p>

    <h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  Apartments in the Snegovaya Pad microdistrict (Vladivostok) can hardly be called low-cost, because the price of a one-room apartment starts from 4.5 million rubles for an area of ‚Äã‚Äã49-55 square meters.  But due to state support, it is possible to provide young families with favorable conditions for the acquisition of real estate, as well as an excellent interest rate on a mortgage loan.  Government programs are an excellent opportunity to acquire your own housing, so do not miss this opportunity. </p><h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  The first phase of the microdistrict is for rent in the fourth quarter of 2017.  To date, a number of buildings have begun interior decoration.  Interest holders emphasize that construction is ahead of schedule.  Accordingly, there is a chance to get the keys to your new cozy nest a little earlier.  Each stage is controlled by the state, which guarantees reliability, quality and compliance with all expectations of residents. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Microdistrict "Snow Pad" (Vladivostok) is a profitable investment, an excellent complex in an ecologically clean and well-maintained area of ‚Äã‚ÄãVladivostok, where all the necessary conditions for a comfortable life are created.  Take a closer look at the project, be sure to visit the construction site in order to personally verify all the described advantages, especially in the environment. </p>
