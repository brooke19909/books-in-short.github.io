    <p>  Disadvantages of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  The quality of the Internet connection.  According to many vacationers at <span>Mackenzie</span> <span>Beach, the</span> hotel needs to improve the quality of its connection to wireless networks.  The Internet almost always works intermittently, which is not very convenient, and for many people this fact, to put it mildly, upsets. </li><li>  Poor cleaning quality.  The rooms are poorly cleaned, and it does not interfere with redecorating the rooms and improving sound insulation. </li><li>  Nutrition.  Almost all tourists agree that it is better not to take meals at the hotel.  According to them, the food is all monotonous, the choice is small, the cooks should also work on the taste. </li></ul><h2>  The cost of trips </h2><p>  As mentioned above, <span>Mackenzie</span> <span>Beach</span> is a reasonably priced vacation option.  The cost of trips to this hotel starts from 35 thousand rubles for two adults for seven nights with meals according to the "breakfast" system.  If the family goes on vacation with the child, then about 15 thousand rubles will be added to this cost. </p><p>  When planning a vacation on the island, you should know that entry to its territory is only possible with a visa.  It is not a problem to make a visa; its production time is one working day.  It should also be noted that you do not need to pay for a visa, for residents of Russia it is completely free. </p><h2>  Holidays in Larnaca </h2><p>  Larnaca is a great resort for people who prefer active entertainment and beach vacations.  The most popular beaches in the city are Finikoudes Beach and <span>Mackenzie</span> <span>Beach.</span>  Here you can not only swim and sunbathe, but also have fun.  These beaches have long been considered centers of outdoor activities, here you can go diving, windsurfing, go for a boat trip, paraglide and more.  In the evenings there are always night clubs, colorful bars, festivals and concerts are often held on the coast. </p><p>  To diversify your vacation, you can visit the island's local attractions: St. Lazarus Church, Larnaca Castle, Kition excavation site.
