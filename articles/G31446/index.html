    <p>  The three-story building of the hotel was built in 2008.  Located 30 meters from the sea, on the very shore near Cape Kazantip.  For people who want to combine rest on the sea with a pleasant pastime in the reserve, the Riga Hotel in Schelkino is an ideal option. </p><p>  The hotel has only two buildings: the first is a recreation center, located closer to the city.  Only economy class rooms can be purchased here.  Two and four-bed standard rooms are presented.  Each room is equipped with a private bathroom, toilet, refrigerator, TV, access to the terrace and air conditioning.  In each room you can use the Internet.  In wooden houses installed directly on the sandy shore, only deluxe rooms.  In total there are no more than 10, each has the same set of amenities: TV, fridge, terrace, air conditioning and shower with toilet.  However, the view from the balcony is different - it offers a breathtaking panorama of the sea and beaches.  It is especially beautiful at night, when the water glistens under the moonlight and the beach is empty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
