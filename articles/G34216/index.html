This device is universal and capable of working with both 2G and 3G cellular networks.  When connected directly to a personal computer, it turns into a regular wireless modem.  But if it functions separately, then this is a portable access point to the Global Web.  It is to this universal and at the same time affordable technical solution that our material is dedicated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shop.mts.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mts 3g modem internet" class="if uuid-2386746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2386746.jpg"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Considered in the framework of this short review <span>, the MTS Connect</span> mobile <span>3G modem</span> has the following equipment: </p><ol><li>  Mobile access point with battery installed. </li><li>  Warranty card. </li><li>  Complete paper user guide. </li><li>  A proprietary interface cord with which this device can be synchronized with the PC system unit or charged via a power adapter. </li><li>  Tray for installing a SIM card of a mobile operator. </li><li>  Starter pack. </li><li>  Power adapter. </li></ol><p>  It should be noted in the previous list the lack of a CD.  But the need for its supply automatically disappeared for the reason that the drivers, control software of the mobile operator and the documentation were recorded on the memory chip integrated into the modem.  As a result, there is no need to duplicate the same information on a separate medium.  In addition to this, most modern computers are no longer equipped with drives for reading information from CDs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The presence of the following technical specifications boasts the MTS 3G modem considered with this review material with an integrated Wi-Fi transmitter: </p><ol><li>  The USB wired port is for charging the integrated battery.  Also, with its help, you can synchronize the device with any personal computer and, due to this, turn it into a regular Internet access point. </li><li>  Supported cellular standards include 2G and 3G.  In the first situation, the highest speed can be 500 kbit / s and the device successfully operates in both GPRS and EDGE modes.  In the second case, the peak exchange of information may already amount to 7.2 Mbps for upload and 5.76 Mbps for upload, and UMTS technology is supported. </li><li>  The built-in Wi-Fi transmitter allows you to connect up to 5 mobile devices to this modem. </li><li>  The type of SIM card to be installed is micro (standard).  If necessary, you can put a USIM card with 4G support in the tray, but this will not give much gain because the list of specifications for this mobile device does not include LTE technology. </li><li>  The battery life on one battery charge is 6 hours. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="shop.mts.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS tariffs for 3g modem" class="if uuid-2386748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2386748.jpg"></div><h2>  Modem Functionality </h2><p>  Essentially, this solution can work in one of two modes.  The main one is the mobile point.  In this case, the portable router turns into a kind of gateway.  On the one hand, it is connected to the cellular network and already with its help exchanges information with the Internet.  Moreover, the choice of a signal occurs in automatic mode.  On the other hand, up to 5 mobile subscribers can be connected to it, and the traffic consumed between them is distributed depending on their needs and capabilities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An alternative use case is a stationary access point directly connected to a computer system.  In this case, the hero of this review is exchanged with the cellular network, and the Wi-Fi transmitter is deactivated. </p><p>  Internet tariffs for MTS 3G modems currently include a fairly large amount of traffic, but their monthly subscription is quite affordable.  That is, such devices are great for widespread use.  And both at home and in office conditions. </p><h2>  Setting procedure </h2><p>  Configuring the MTS 3G modem is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Unpack the box and remove the device from it.  Then you need to get the tray out of it. </li><li>  Next, we extract the SIM card from the starter pack.  We install it in the tray and return it to its place. </li><li>  We turn on the mobile access point and wait for the completion of its initialization process. </li><li>  Using WPS technology, we synchronize consumers and this model of a portable stand-alone modem.  After that, the mobile network is configured and ready for operation. </li></ol><p>  In case of switching from a PC, it is necessary to install an additional set of drivers and diagnostic software.  Then, using the latter, a connection to the Global Web is established. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shop.mts.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mts connect 3g modem" class="if uuid-2386750" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2386750.jpg"></div><h2>  Checking the health of the mobile access point to the global web </h2><p>  Unlimited Internet, MTS 3G-modem and the presence of a cellular network signal allow you to access the Internet almost anywhere.  After the previous settings, it is necessary to check the operability of the created Wi-Fi coverage.  To do this, on any switched device, just launch the browser and go to any information resource.  Previously, the Wi-Fi transmitter must be activated on the latter and synchronized using special WPS technology.  As experience shows, to date, the operator has minimized human participation in the process of setting up the router.  Therefore, the probability of an error in this case is minimal, no problems should certainly arise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shop.mts.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="3g modem pay unlimited" class="if uuid-2386755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2386755.jpg"></div><h2>  Tariff Plans </h2><p>  The following MTS tariffs for the 3G modem are currently current: </p><ul><li>  The basic one is Internet Mini.  In this case, the subscriber receives 7 GB of traffic per calendar month at the highest possible speed.  The monthly fee for this is 500 rubles.  After the limit has been exhausted, 150 rubles will be debited from the account, in return of which 1 GB of traffic will be provided. </li><li>  The mid-level segment is occupied by the Internet Maxi tariff.  In this case, the monthly fee increases to 800 rubles, but in return the user receives already 15 GB of traffic for the same calendar month.  Moreover, from 00:00 to 7:00 the amount of information transmitted is not taken into account.  That is, 15 GB are used only in the remaining time of the day.  If you exceed the limit of 1 GB, as before, it will cost 150 rubles. </li><li>  The greatest opportunities in terms of the amount of data and information transmitted are provided by the Internet VIP tariff plan.  When activated, the user receives 30 GB for a monthly fee of 1200 rubles.  Accounting, as before, is from 7:00 to 00:00.  In the remaining time, the amount of information is not limited.  If the volume is exceeded, each additional gigabyte will cost the same 150 rubles, which are automatically debited from the subscriber‚Äôs account. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.avito.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS Internet tariffs for 3g modems" class="if uuid-2386756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2386756.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  You can also buy a MTS 3G modem.  And even in a new state.  Its price will be only 1,500 rubles.  But again, in a company store it is already impossible to purchase, but only from third-party companies or private individuals.  In used form, its cost will decrease even more and will amount to 500-900 rubles, depending on the condition and degree of wear. </p><h2>  Device relevance </h2><p>  Although it is still possible to meet MTS unlimited 3G-modem with various users, but now it has been replaced by new devices from the shelves that are aimed at functioning as part of 4G networks and support LTE technology.  In this case, the maximum speed can increase to 100-150 Mbit / s.  At the same time, the price is practically no different.  Also, such new mobile routers are backward compatible with 3G and even 2G standards.  That is, they are able to completely and completely replace the models of the previous generation. </p><p>  Therefore, those who use MTS 3G will still operate them until they become outdated or fail.  But when choosing a new access point, experts recommend paying attention to those solutions that can operate in 4G mode. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gizmodo.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unlimited internet pay 3g modem" class="if uuid-2386758" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2386758.jpg"></div><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  According to user reviews, the MTS 3G modem boasts a number of significant advantages.  The Internet with high-quality coverage has a fairly high speed - this is the first plus of this device.  Also, the advantages include autonomy and cost.  In addition to this, the setup procedure is as simple as possible and requires minimal user participation. </p><p>  The disadvantages of the owners in this situation include the lack of 4G / LTE support and strict binding to the MTS network and SIM card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.brightonbc.org.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="setup 3g modem pay" class="if uuid-2386760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2386760.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As part of this review, an MTS 3G modem with support for Wi-Fi wireless technology and the possibility of creating portable Internet access points was considered.  Low cost makes this device very, very affordable.  At the same time, the process of setting it up is as simple as possible.  In fact, its only drawback is that the software can only work with MTS equipment.  It is most optimal to use such a portable solution at home or in a small office to implement a primary or backup Wi-Fi network. </p>
