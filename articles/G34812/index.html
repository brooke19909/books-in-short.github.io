  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Unforgettable holidays in Barcelona</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Going to Spain, you must definitely include Barcelona in the list of cities that you plan to visit.  This is the second largest and largest city in the country, as well as a place full of all possible architectural monuments and interesting museums.  In addition, <span>beach vacations</span> in Barcelona are possible because it is located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and is one of the largest ports in Europe.  Not falling in love with this city is simply impossible! </p><p>  The mild Mediterranean climate, a huge number of beautiful churches and cathedrals, streets that have preserved the spirit of the Middle Ages and modern shops where world fashion names are represented, I can not leave anyone indifferent.  Here for the holidays you forget about all your problems.  In order to make your stay in Barcelona as interesting as possible, you need to visit some of the most popular places that will introduce you to the history of the city and simply give you a new experience.  In 1996, the Aquarium was opened in the port of this city - the largest water exhibition in Europe, consisting of 21 reservoirs and a huge glazed hotel with sharks.  All fish habitats are represented here.  The construction fascinates with its scale, the full impression is created, but that you are at the bottom of the ocean.  Art lovers must visit the Picasso Museum - one of the greatest <span>artists of the 20th century.</span>  The museum was opened in 1963.  It presents a very uneven set of works from different eras.  This is due to the fact that mainly the creations that the author left with his parents in Spain are exhibited.  As the museum grew, so did the number of works donated by collectors.  Today, the Picasso Museum occupies half the street of Moncada and is the largest exhibition of his paintings in the world. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is impossible to imagine a vacation in Barcelona without visiting the singing fountains.  This bewitching spectacle cannot leave anyone indifferent.  The performance is performed to the classical music of famous composers: Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, and consists of two acts of 20 minutes each.  During the show, a large fountain, consisting of many small ones, creates all kinds of figures.  During the performance, the backlight turns on, also changing to the music. </p><p>  Even if a traveler bought last-minute trips to Barcelona with a minimum set of excursions, he must visit the Gothic Quarter, which has preserved the spirit of the Middle Ages and its architecture.  It is located between the Town Hall and the Cathedral.  Due to the great interest in it, active <span>restoration work</span> began at the beginning of the 20th century <span>,</span> which helped to keep most of the buildings almost intact.  The quarter originates from the oldest Plaza Nova square, where 2 ancient towers of the 13th century are still preserved.  Here is the Episcopal Palace, which was created at the same time.  The former residence of the archdeacon Luis Despla - Casa del Ardica currently houses the city archive.  Some tourists mistakenly assume that the building was built in <span>modern times.</span>  In fact, this is not so, and part of it dates back to the reign of the Romans. </p><p>  For many women, rest in Barcelona is associated with continuous shopping at the most attractive prices.  Many popular brands, both premium and mass production, were created in Spain.  This explains such low prices for things.  Moreover, they are all of excellent quality, and the range is amazing.  Some people buy last-minute tours to Barcelona just for these purposes.  Whatever the purpose of the visit to this beautiful <span>Spanish city, the</span> time spent in it will fly by unnoticed, leaving behind a lot of wonderful impressions.  Have a nice rest! </p>
