    <h2>  Krini Beach 3 *: photo, description </h2><p>  Creeney Beach is a small and very comfortable three-star hotel, built on a sandy beach.  It was erected in 2003, in a traditional island architectural style.  The hotel offers its guests to stay in one of 60 comfortable rooms.  The hotel has a small but very well-groomed area, in public areas you can use the wireless Internet access.  The hotel staff is always happy to help guests in all matters, and the front desk is open around the clock.  The restaurant ‚ÄúConey Beach‚Äù offers delicious dishes of both Greek and international cuisine, and in the bars you can enjoy your favorite drinks.  Krini Beach 3 * guests will also find an interesting entertainment program in the form of daily evening shows and musicians' performances.  Holidays in this hotel are perfect for both family people with children and young people who want to relax on a budget in one of the <span>best resorts in Greece.</span> </p><h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  As with most hotels around the world, the Creeny Beach has a set check-in and check-out time.  So, check-in at the hotel is carried out after two in the afternoon.  But the reception staff at Rethymno Krini Beach 3 * always try to do everything possible so that guests arriving earlier than the specified time can enter their rooms immediately after arrival.  However, this is not always possible at the height of the tourist season, when the hotel is 100% full.  In this case, guests can leave their luggage in the luggage room and eat in the restaurant, take a swim in the pool or go directly to the beach.  As for the day of departure, it is necessary to vacate the room before noon.  If your plane leaves only in the evening or at night, then you can extend your stay at the hotel for an additional fee.  Please note that the possibility of extension should be agreed in advance with the Creeney Beach administration, as during the high season you may be refused due to the full workload of the hotel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Reservation and payment for accommodation </h2><p>  Most of our compatriots prefer to book their accommodation in the Krini Beach 3 * hotel through travel agencies.  Bookings can be carried out independently through special sites.  In this case, the hotel reserves the right to withhold the prepayment amount from you.  So when you evict from the hotel you only have to pay the difference between the full cost of living and using additional services and the prepayment made.  As for people who have already fully paid for their room with a travel agency, when they hand over the keys, they will need to pay only additional services if they resorted to them.  The hotel accepts both cash and plastic cards of payment systems such as Visa and Mastercard. </p><h2>  Accommodation for children and pets </h2><p>  Since Krini Beach 3 * (Crete) is also a family hotel, the placement of guests with children of different age groups is only welcome here.  Extra beds and extra beds are available upon prior request.  As for the accommodation of guests with pets at the hotel, this issue should be agreed with the hotel in advance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the three-star Creeny Beach Hotel is built almost on the beach and is located on the first coastline, it does not have its own beach.  By the way, for Greece (unlike, for example, Turkey or Egypt) this is a standard situation.  The beach near the hotel is municipal.  It is sandy, clean and quite large.  For the rental of sun loungers and parasols here have to pay.  Also on the beach there is everything you need for relaxation and sports on the water. </p><h2>  Pool </h2><p>  Hotel Krini Beach 3 * (island of Crete, Greece) has on its territory a freshwater pool.

In addition, the hotel also has a children's pool, where the smallest guests can safely frolic in warm water. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Since the territory of the hotel is small, there are not so many conditions for outdoor activities.

    <h2>  Krini Beach 3 * (Crete): traveler reviews </h2><p>  Since many of our compatriots, preparing for a trip to a particular country, carefully study the comments of other tourists both about sights and hotels, today we decided to find out what Russians think about their stay in Creeny Beach, who happened to be here in this year.  First of all, it should be said that the vast majority of travelers were quite satisfied with their choice of hotel.  But we offer to understand everything in more detail. </p><p>  So, the first thing that tourists pay attention to when checking into a hotel is, of course, the condition of the rooms.  Krini Beach 3 * (Greece) is no exception.  Most of the guests were satisfied with the condition of their rooms and the work of the equipment.  So, despite the fact that the hotel has only three stars, it is regularly renovated, the furniture is not new, but it is in good condition.  Refrigerator, TV and air conditioning, plumbing work without interruption.  Our compatriot also liked how regular cleaning is carried out here.  As a result, the rooms are always clean and tidy.  The only thing some tourists were a little unhappy with was the noise in the rooms due to their location next to the restaurant.  Also, the guests complained about the noise, whose windows overlooked the road.  However, all these problems could easily be fixed by closing the balcony door tightly. </p><p>  Another very important issue for many tourists is the food in the hotel.  It should be noted that the food in Krini Beach 3 * (Crete) seemed quite satisfactory to the vast majority of guests.  Of course, the menu here is not as diverse as in four- or five-star hotels, but a sufficient selection of high-quality and delicious dishes has been presented.  Also, our compatriots were pleased with the presence of fish and seafood dishes, fresh fruits and delicious desserts on the menu.  Tourists who came to rest with children also did not complain about food, since the children here ate with pleasure to the joy of their mothers and fathers. </p><p>  Many travelers call its location a great advantage of the Creeny Beach Hotel.  So, it is literally 50 meters from the beach.  However, the beach here is far from the best, since when you enter the water there are large sharp stones.  But if you are not too lazy to go just a hundred meters to the side, then you will reach a more convenient beach with a sandy entrance to the sea.  There is also a bus stop 200 meters from the hotel with links to Rethymnon in just 10 minutes. </p><p>  Our compatriots were also satisfied with the staff and the quality of service at the three-star Hotel Creeney Beach.  So, all the hotel staff were always friendly, smiling and ready to help.  A pleasant fact was that many hotel workers speak Russian. </p><p>  As for the pools, here they are regularly cleaned.  So, both adults and children can swim without fear.  Also, many travelers noted in their reviews the lack of animation on site.  For some, this was a small minus, while someone, on the contrary, was only too happy. </p><p>  In general, the vast majority of tourists were quite satisfied with their stay in the three-star Cretey Beach Crete hotel.  They admit the possibility of their return to this hotel in the future, and are also willing to recommend this place to their friends and relatives. </p>
