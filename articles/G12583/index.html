And at the same time, it is not only their sum.  The main elements of the political system can theoretically be split according to some criterion.  Then the value of each of its components is much better visible. </p><p>  For example, if you structure it on the basis of role-based understanding, then you should consider it from the point of view of the types of interaction between actors who fulfill certain roles in politics, being guided by patterns of behavior of others in this area. </p><p>  Elements of the political system can also be distinguished taking into account the institutional approach.  This means that each of its institutes is engaged in satisfying certain needs and performs certain functions in politics. </p><p>  Elements of the political system can also be structured in order of the actual exercise of power by certain groups, that is, on the basis of political stratification.  So, direct decisions are made by the political elite.  Bureaucracy implements these decisions.  Ordinary citizens form a power representing their interests.  That is, the political system includes several subsystems.  They form its integrity. </p><p>  Elements of the political system of society are impossible in the first place without an institutional subsystem.  The combination of several institutions expresses and represents interests that vary in importance (from public to private).  Power and resources are maximally concentrated in the hands of the state; therefore, it acts as the main instrument for realizing the interests of society.  It is the state that is engaged in the distribution of values ‚Äã‚Äãand pushes citizens to implement decisions of the authorities without fail.  Also in this subsystem includes various parties, the media, the church. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The next element of the political system is the regulatory subsystem.  In legal documents certain rules are fixed, on the basis of which there is an interaction between subjects entering into political interaction.  Some norms are passed orally in the form of customs, traditions from generation to generation. </p><p>  The subjects of <span>political relations,</span> following these rules (written and unwritten), interact with each other.  Types of such interaction, based on disagreement and approval, its strength - all this makes up a communicative subsystem.  Using means of communication, the government enters into a dialogue, exchanges information with the public, and responds to the requirements of the subjects. </p><p>  Political interaction always occurs in a certain cultural and religious environment, due to its homogeneity.  The cultural subsystem consists of subcultures, faiths, prevailing in society and forming their own <span>system of values,</span> priorities, beliefs, norms of behavior and thinking regarding politics.  Thus, the actions of politicians are given a meaning that is important for everyone, there is an effect on stabilization in society, on the agreement between its subjects.  The more uniform the culture, the more the <span>activity of political</span> institutions will be more effective.  The dominant element of this subsystem is religion.  On its basis, a model of interaction between members of society and the behavior of each individual is determined. </p><p>  Power is realized in various ways and methods, the totality of which is determined by the models of society that correspond to the values ‚Äã‚Äãand ideas of this culture.  This combination of technologies used in politics makes up a functional subsystem.  The relationship between power and society, their integration and integrity are characterized by what methods it uses to implement <span>power relations</span> (consent or coercion). </p><p>  All elements of the political system depend on each other.  Interacting, they affect the state of the system as a whole, help its full functioning in society. </p>
