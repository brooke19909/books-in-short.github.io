It is called the Holy Lake.  He is part of the group of <span>lakes of the Meshchersky</span> ring.  This is a shallow (depth not more than 5 meters) reservoir with transparent, slightly greenish water, soft to the touch.  The lake covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã702.2 hectares.  Spits of sandy origin stretch along its shores.  According to scientists, Lake Svyatoe (Ryazan region) has a meteorite origin.  And the locals have their own legend, telling about the mystical appearance of the reservoir.  And all because the water of the Holy Lake is considered healing.  The reservoir is constantly fueled by underground keys.  The water here is clean, clear and cold.  Even in the hottest weather, the lake warms up no more than 2.5 meters in depth.  From a bird's eye view, it resembles a drop of water that is about to fall.

Near it were houses of peasants, outbuildings and several houses where the church clergy lived.  One morning, the locals woke up from the terrifying scream of a shepherd.  People rushed out into the street and saw that the majestic church disappeared along with the surrounding buildings.  A water surface appeared in its place, which excited people from time to time with rising bubbles.  The next day, local residents again came to this place and froze in fear.  They saw the church dome slowly peep out of the water and plunge into the lake again.  People decided that it was God's providence.  Thus, the Almighty punished the parishioners for their sins. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Ryazan region lake" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/448522.jpg" width="393"></div>  Since then, the pond is considered holy.  Rumor has it that every year at 12.00 a.m. (the day of the death of people) the <span>dome of the church</span> rises from the surface of the water.  At this time, a bell ringing is heard from a reservoir.  However, divers more than once examined Lake Svyatoe (Ryazan Region), sank to its bottom, but still did not find signs of a flooded church.

    <h2>  Shilovsky District: Holy Lake <strong><br></strong> </h2><p>  For many years, people want to unravel the nature of the <span>Tunguska meteorite.</span>  Fragments of iron resembling a real meteorite were found in the village of Borovoye.  Here is the Holy Lake (Shilovsky district).  Some scientists prescribe a meteorite origin.  They call the main cause of the appearance of the lake the fall of the Tunguska meteorite.  This origin of the reservoir is confirmed by its regular round shape.  At the same time, the nature of the funnel should be taken into account.  The fall of the meteorite occurred more than 1 thousand years ago.  Unlearned people tell more interesting details about the origin of the reservoir.  As in other "holy" lakes, here once was a church, which eventually fell underground.  In fact, such reservoirs often arise in places of conservation of water of glacial origin and underground water reservoirs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holy lake shilovsky district" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/448520.jpg" width="436"></div>

They are famous for the Nizhny Novgorod region.  Eight karst lakes are protected here as natural monuments.  The most notable of these is Lake Svyato.  The Nizhny Novgorod region is rich in ponds that adorn the picturesque flora.  Holy Lake is the youngest.  It is replenished with water from the channel of Lake.  Great.  During spring climbs, its water flows into the craters of the coast.  It is precisely because of the ‚Äúmiraculous‚Äù departure of water flows that the reservoir received the ‚Äúholy‚Äù name.  Trunks of trees peep out from the <span>watery surface of</span> Lake Svyato.  This is the result of the beavers.  In general, 6 species of mammals, 7 species of bats live here, coastal and waterfowl nest.  The lake is truly mesmerizing with its majestic and mysterious beauty.  The water here is always cool. </p><h2>  What secrets does the Holy Lake in Kosino hide? </h2>

This group includes Lake Svyatoe (Kosino).  This is a historical and cultural monument of the city.  The pond has a round shape.  A thick layer of silt covers its bottom.  The lake is surrounded by a quagmire, reeds and small trees.  Water in a reservoir has healing properties.  It contains a large amount of iodine, silver, bromine, and it never blooms.

    <p>  One amazing legend is associated with the lake.  Once there was a church, which gradually sank into the water.  It is for this reason that the reservoir acquired healing properties.  The locals sincerely believe in this.  They say that when the temple was immersed in water, the Divine Liturgy was performed in it.  And still the priest, who died that day, prays for the health of people.  Religious procession is organized annually on Holy Lake.  This takes place on the day of commemoration of the Kosinsk Icon of the Mother of God.  Since ancient times, people have used the water of the Holy Lake to cure serious ailments, including rheumatism, skin diseases.  They swam in a pond and wiped themselves with lake silt. </p><h2>  Are the ‚Äúholy‚Äù lakes rich in fish? </h2>

But avid fishermen are interested in the question of whether it is possible to catch a decent catch in them.  The answer is yes.  Practically every ‚Äúholy‚Äù lake is rich in fish.  In the reservoirs of the Ryazan region, it is especially large.  Pike is well caught in Svyatoye Lake, and in June, fishermen boast of a rich catch of perch.  There is also a large ide, roach, bluecock, sabrefish, and silver bream.  Cultural <span>fisheries</span> operate on the Holy Lake in Kosino <span>.</span>  In spring and summer, you can catch perch, ruff, roach, crucian carp and carp here.  For bream experienced fishermen recommend going to the lakes of the Shilov district.  Fish loves clean, ‚Äúfresh‚Äù water, and therefore fishing on each of the ‚Äúholy‚Äù lakes can bring a good catch.
