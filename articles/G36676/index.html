Millions of tourists come to this city every day in order to enjoy its greatness.  The expression "travel to a magical land" is the best suited for a tour to this wonderful city. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="48.8722344" data-lng="2.775807900000018" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/0/6/1806.png"></div><p>  It is here that the largest amusement park in Europe is located, so a vacation in Paris is perfect not only for a romantic pastime of two lovers of love, but also for families with children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital of France from above" class="if uuid-2354260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2354260.jpg"></div><p>  In our article, we will consider the main tours to Disneyland, introduce the reader to this fabulous place and tell all about Paris.  Ready?  Then let's go! </p><h2>  The largest amusement park in Europe </h2><p>  Disneyland is the dream of every child!  The famous <span>amusement park</span> is not located in Paris itself, but in its suburban surroundings.  For the first time the doors of this magical place were opened in front of visitors in 1992, but already today Disneyland in Paris is almost the main attraction of France.  The state allocated a huge area for the construction of an amusement park equal to almost two thousand hectares. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Disneyland is a place where even adults can return to childhood for a while.  Visitors are greeted by a pink French castle, which has already become a symbol of Disneyland.  From it to the palace of the sleeping beauty stretches the main street, made in the original American style.  Children‚Äôs laughter sounds everywhere, and cafes and restaurants are filled with country music. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.traveltothemagic.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cartoon Characters on Disneyland High Street" class="if uuid-2354247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2354247.jpg"></div><h2>  Tours at Disneyland Paris </h2><p>  Full-fledged trips from the city are organized to the amusement park; they can be for several days or for one.  Let's look at the main options for a holiday at Disneyland. </p><p>  In most cases, for all tourists, if they came to rest in Paris from a tourist organization, local guides offer to arrange a tourist trip with a stop in the park.  This is usually a one-day weekend from Paris to Disneyland. </p><p>  Tours to France involve a full package, in other words, includes flight, accommodation and a basic transfer between points.  There are many hotels in the vicinity of Disneyland, which are usually visited by local organizations.  From here follows a wide range of prices for tours to Disneyland.  The amusement park of Paris is a special space, it is impossible to completely get around in one day.  Therefore, if you plan a trip here, you should count on a long stay, otherwise you will be able to see only a small part. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.rayburntours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Disneyland Main Castle" class="if uuid-2354250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2354250.jpg"></div><p>  The average price for a tour to Disneyland for 3 days is about 1300 euros per person, which is 90 thousand rubles in terms of Russian currency.  This price includes accommodation in a five-star hotel and all tickets for the main attractions.  Of course, there are many different options cheaper - it all depends on the capabilities of tourists and their preferences. </p><p>  As a special bonus, which, undoubtedly, will be able to please any child, a joint dinner with your favorite characters can be made.  The cost of this service varies from 4 to 5 thousand rubles.  You can also order a special birthday cake - this service will sweeten any evening. </p><h2>  How to get to Disneyland? </h2><p>  The road to the fairy tale is open to all tourists arriving in France.  The easiest option to get to the amusement park is to use the services of commuter trains, called PER.  Trains run very often at intervals of 10 minutes and depart regularly from major Paris metro stations Charles de Gaulle, Gare de Lyon (near the train station) and Aubert. </p><p>  It is worth noting that a trip to Disneyland will take about an hour and a half, so you should carefully plan your time.  The cost of a train ticket for adults is 1000 rubles, for children - 500. </p><p>  For those who want to reduce travel time, it is better to use the TGV express train.  The train consists of two floors, so it can accommodate a large number of people.  Express should be with fewer stops, but the cost for it will be a little more expensive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.themeparkguide.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Disneyland Paris" class="if uuid-2354246" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2354246.jpg"></div><h2>  Disneyland Ticket Prices </h2><p>  The cost of tours always includes paid tickets, but each entry ticket has its own category, on which the prices of tours directly depend.  Let's understand in detail in this matter. </p><p>  If you travel on your own, the best way to purchase tickets is the official site of the amusement park.  With the help of online shopping, you can save up to 20% and save yourself from languid lines. </p><p>  Currently there are the following types of tickets: </p><ul><li>  MINI  This category belongs to the cheapest type of tickets.  Price for adults and children starts from 40 euros.  You cannot enter the park with a MINI ticket on weekends and holidays, as well as during the summer holidays. </li><li>  MAGIC.  Starting at 60 euros for adults.  They also have some restrictions on entry in August and on weekends in winter and autumn. </li><li>  SUPER MAGIC.  Practically apply to all days except Christmas holidays. </li><li>  SUPER MAGIC PLUS.  They have no restrictions, but are also the most expensive type of tickets.  Price range starts from 90 euros. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting the fact that Disneyland has a peculiar system.  Each category of tickets applies only to one of the parks.  If a tourist expresses a desire to visit several park zones at once, the ticket price doubles.  In addition, the ticket applies to all attractions in the selected area. </p><h2>  What you should know about Disneyland? </h2><p>  There are special children's tours to Disneyland.  They are designed for a different age category, since there are certain zones in the park that are suitable for certain interests.  There are many different attractions in the park; children will be interested here.  If you are in a neighboring country or another city located near Paris, you can purchase a bus tour to Disneyland.  It involves gathering tourists in a designated place, a round-trip transfer, as well as booking rooms in a hotel, if we are talking about a multi-day vacation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickriver.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Branded Buses at Disneyland" class="if uuid-2354259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2354259.jpg"></div><h2>  A trip to a fairy tale from Russia </h2><p>  Despite the fact that our country is far from France, rest on its territory is in great demand among Russians.  Many domestic companies organize full-fledged tours to Disneyland from Moscow.  Usually they are divided into two types: settling in the vicinity of the amusement park for the entire period or a tour in Paris with a stop at Disneyland.  As they say: ‚ÄúThere are no comrades for the taste and color!‚Äù </p><div class="photo" data-original="dedicatedtodlp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Disneyland Hotels" class="if uuid-2354255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2354255.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We hope that in our article you were able to understand in detail the main nuances regarding the organization of tours to Disneyland.  If you were in Paris, but did not stop at this amazing place on the planet, consider that your trip was not.  An amusement park in Paris deserves the attention of both children and adults.
