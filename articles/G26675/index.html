Montreal Attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many people ask this question: ‚ÄúWhere is Montreal?  In which country?".  Judging by the name, one might think that this place is somewhere in France, but this is not at all so.  To visit one of the most beautiful cities in the American mainland Montreal, you must cross the ocean, since the city is located in Canada.  Where Montreal is located, every resident of a large continent knows. </p><p>  Translated, the name of the settlement sounds like ‚ÄúRoyal Hill‚Äù.  The province is located on the site of a former Indian settlement.  The first inhabitants were French, so today Montreal is the second largest in the world after Paris in terms of the French-speaking population. </p>

    <h2>  "Royal hill" </h2><p>  Montreal is located at a latitude of 45 degrees, altitude is thirty-six meters, the difference with Moscow time is seven hours.  The city is located on the island.  It is impossible to compare it with other settlements, since it is too peculiar, original. </p><p>  Americans consider Montreal a European city, but tourists who have visited here once do not consider it as such, although it is difficult to call it American.  This is a kind of combination of two worlds, the old and the new - each guest will find here what he needs.  The first thing that tourists see when entering the city is <span>the St. Lawrence River,</span> and then the ‚ÄúRoyal Hill‚Äù itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Where Montreal is located, you already know.  It is worth noting that this city is recognized as one of the most comfortable in terms of living in the world. </p>
