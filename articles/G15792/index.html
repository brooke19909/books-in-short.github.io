In the reservoir there are 26 islands.  The largest of them and the only habitable is Olkhon.  <span>Baikal,</span> whose <span>sights are</span> known all over the world, "sheltered" the island with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã730 square kilometers (its length is 71.7 km, its width is 15 km).  The name of the island is associated with the word "oi-hon", which in the Buryat language means "small forest" or "a little wooded."  In fact, the forest grows only in the center of Olkhon.  Its southern and northern outskirts are mainly steppe.  <span>Olkhon Island, the</span> sights of which all Russia knows, attracts tourists precisely with them. </p><p>  There are no more than 1,500 inhabitants of the island.  The main population is housed in the village of Khuzhir, which is the largest settlement here. </p><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  The island is located next to that section of the lake where the greatest depth is recorded - 1642 meters.  Everyone who has been here speaks of Olkhon as the heart of Lake Baikal, because even its form resembles the main organ of man.  Surrounded by the waters of the lake, he retained his completely unique world and hospitality, which can be opened to each of its visitors.  It is impossible to describe his beauty in words, but it is worth seeing - and your indifference will completely disappear.  The incomprehensible and incredible sights of Olkhon will not only make an indelible impression on you, but will also help you in a better knowledge of the beauty of our Motherland.  An atmosphere unlike anything else will help you to travel provisionally in time to a world not damaged by civilization, where there is still the opportunity to rest with your soul, heart and, of course, your body.  Tours to Olkhon are very popular.  Usually they are ordered a few months before the trip.  Large groups of tourists come here to see the main attractions of Olkhon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This is the place where all the diversity of nature landscapes of the Baikal coast is concentrated.  The highest peak of the island is Mount Jima (Izhimey), whose elevation is 1274 meters. </p>

    <h2>  Climate Olkhon </h2><p>  The island has an unusual climate: summers are the hottest in the Baikal region, winters are cold;  there is less rainfall than anywhere else in the county.  Almost the entire summer period, warm and sunny weather is established here, the water in the bays warms up enough for swimming, and this makes it possible to attract a large number of tourists.  They all go to see the sights of the island, Olkhon, Baikal and nearby monuments, interesting excavations. </p><p>  July and August are considered the hottest months.  The most favorable time to visit Olkhon for tourists is summer, somewhere from mid-June to about the end of September.  Winter for this region is quite mild, with little snow and quite long.  Spring and summer come to the island later than to the mainland. </p><p>  Baikal is famous for very often blowing winds and strong hurricanes, especially in the autumn-spring period.  The furious wind of Sarma piles on the island, tearing off the soil and vegetation cover and causing many problems to local fishermen.  And despite this, most of the year is favorable for tourism.  Climatic and weather conditions provide excellent opportunities for guests of the island to spend a pleasant holiday here.  Olkhon also has opportunities for pedestrian, water, automobile wanderings, as well as for horseback riding and biking. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are no predators posing a danger to humans on Olkhon.  The same applies to mosquitoes. </p><p>  The island is a completely peculiar place, it is covered with ancient legends.  The island area is dotted with historical and cultural artifacts.  Their density per 1 square kilometer just rolls over.  There is no equivalent to this fact throughout the Baikal region: 143 archaeological sites have been discovered on the island.  These are necropolises, burial grounds, ancient remains of stone walls, ancient settlements.  Holidays in Olkhon are especially popular among history-lovers. </p><h2>  How to get to the island </h2><p>  In the summer, passengers can be delivered to the island by a ferry that runs between the village of Sakhyurta and Olkhon throughout the daylight hours.  However, you should know that you can wait up to three hours to wait for the opportunity to board the ferry.  The first carriers to service buses and cars of local residents.  <span>The Irkutsk bus station</span> sends minibuses to the island, which run all summer.  Estimated travel time can be up to 6 hours. </p>

    <p>  Another way to get to the island is by water.  There are several flights: Irkutsk - Olkhon - Severobaykalsk - Nizhneangarsk and Irkutsk - Olkhon-Ust-Barguzin.  In winter, you can use the ice road and enjoy the beauty of a frozen lake. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  During the off-season, there are two ways to get to the island: by plane or by hovercraft.  Of course, you can choose such methods either for maximum comfort, or if the others are not available to you, and you really want to quickly see the sights of Olkhon. </p><p>  In the summer, the holiday season begins, when a large number of tourists come here for various excursions.  Olkhon, like other places with a unique and rich history, is very interesting in this regard.  It is incredibly popular with travelers. </p><p>  So, we will begin to consider the main memorable places and sights of Olkhon. </p><h2>  Peninsula Mare's Head </h2><p>  The most recent peak of rock origin at Cape Khorin-Irgi is separated from the Kobylia Golova Peninsula by a steep crevice, the width of which reaches 4 meters.  The height of the walls reaching the surface of the water is 10 meters, so from afar it resembles a horse‚Äôs head.  Local rocks attract attention with their ice splashes (sokuyas), which form on the rocks during the freezing period of the island.  During a severe storm, from the edges blown by the wind, the rocks can be covered with ice, the height of which reaches 10‚Äì20 meters.  In this case, the cleft is effectively enveloped in an intricate frosty decoration. </p>

    <p>  By the magnificence and constancy of the annual formation of ice decorations on the rocks near the shore, you can find only one more such place - these are the rocks of Cape Sagan-Khushun in the north of Olkhon.  Near the Cape Kobylia Golova in the distant October 1901, a strong wind Sarma caused a shipwreck, resulting in the death of 176 people.  The sea sailing ship "Potapov" crashed on the rocks. </p><h2>  Zagli Bay </h2><p>  Where the name of the bay came from is not known for certain, perhaps it means "a place full of fish."  Words with a similar basis exist in the Buryat and <span>Mongolian languages</span> and mean raw, unprocessed fish.  Apparently, the name Zagatui appeared, which implies eating raw fish. </p>

    <p>  The bay is considered the sunniest place in the Irkutsk region.  The number of clear days is comparable to those in the resorts of the Caucasus.  What else can you compare the bay with is Kazakhstan, and in particular with its steppes, because the same amount of precipitation falls there as here.  You can see the bay perfectly from the highway.  Vegetation on the shore, according to tourists, is practically absent.  A narrow channel connects the bay with Lake Nursky.  In the summer, water gains an acceptable temperature in order to splash here. </p><h2>  Hanhui Lake </h2><p>  Due to the abundance of fish and very warm water, the lake is very popular among tourists, it is also called Elginsky.  It is located on the west coast almost in its center.  Approximate dimensions are 500 x 800 meters.  A steeply cliffing rock ridge of great power, then gently descending to the lake, separates it from the north from Lake Baikal.  A picturesque view of the Small Sea, the Primorsky ridge and the Malomorskie Islands opens from the ridge.  The lake is connected to Baikal by a narrow channel in a spit in the eastern part.  The width of the ducts is only 1-2 meters, and the width of the spit ranges from 30 to 50 meters.  The channel is very shallow, its depth is 15-30 cm, so any boat can be stretched along it only empty.  There are times when it is completely silted with sand.  And also the channel serves for the passage of fish in the spring. </p>

    <p>  There are no trees growing on the shores of the lake, and there are places where they are partially boggy.  Hanhui Lake is rich in huge numbers of fish, because nature created favorable conditions for its reproduction: almost the entire bottom is covered with algae, and the free water surface above them is no more than 20-30 sentiments.  The depths in the lake do not exceed 4 meters.  The water is pretty clear and warm, as travelers say.  In places where there is no algae, you can see the bottom of the lake. </p><p>  Fish species such as roach, perch and pike live here.  The latter is quite a lot, and it can gain more than 10 kilograms in weight.  This is a very good place for fishing.  To catch pike on spinning, you need to adapt yourself to a lure at the surface, so as not to confuse the gear in the algae.  Local fishermen hunt pike from the shore.  And next to the lake, near the rocks under the rocks (on Lake Baikal), you can try to catch happiness grayling. </p><p>  What other sights of Olkhon did we miss? </p><h2>  Cape Sagan-Khushun </h2><p>  Sagan-Khushun is a cape of the west coast of Olkhon.  It is part of a national park and endowed with the status of a natural monument.  From the language drilled "Sagan-Khushun" is translated as "White Cape".  He is also known by another name - ‚ÄúThree Brothers‚Äù.  The cape is an array of light marble cliffs, steeply going to Lake Baikal.  As you move away from the water, the size of the rocks decreases, but their numbers increase, which makes it difficult to access the water area.  The cape stretched for about a kilometer, red lichens grow on its rocks, which diversify the light tones of marble, make them more attractive. </p>

    <p>  At the level of the surf in the rocks you can find shining cavities - grottoes, the largest of which is located under the Middle Brother, a little north of the tight bay.  If you want to enjoy the beauties of the grotto, you will have to use a boat, however its most beautiful view is in winter, then you can take a walk inside on the ice.  Its internal volume is quite roomy: the length reaches eight meters, the width approaches four, and the height reaches three meters - you can even take a boat trip on it.  On Sagan-Khushun, you can find an ancient moat and rampart about 800 m long, dated about 5-10th centuries.  You can also find a cave with local inhabitants - seals - in this interesting attraction of the island.  Olkhon (Baikal - the place of his refuge) is famous for these various finds. </p><h2>  Cape Burhan </h2><p>  Burkhan is the first thing many of the tourists who visited Lake Baikal recall.  There is a cape in the middle of the west coast of Olkhon, near the settlement of Khuzhir.  It is a cliff of limestone and marble with a forked top, densely covered with red lichen.  Before the advent of Buddhism in these areas, the cape was called Shaman, and after it was named after the main deity of Lake Baikal.  The rock, which is located closer to the river flow, pierced through the cave, in the womb of which the shamans in the old days held their rites.  Previously, only a cult minister could enter it, so for a long time she remained banned, the passage was closed to everyone.  But even now, women and children are not allowed into it.  The cave is still considered sacred and is included in the seven shrines.  According to legend, the shaman seeped through the rock, which made a stunning impression on the population, who had no idea about the cave. </p>
