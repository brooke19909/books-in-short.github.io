  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do you know how much to fly to Mexico from Moscow?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The wonderful beaches of Cancun and Acapulco, the slopes of the Volcano Popocatepetl, Copper Canyon, Fort San Diego, the ancient city of Palenque, Sak-Aktun caves - all this is Mexico.  How much to fly from Moscow to this magnificent country?  This question interests many travelers.  Alas, a long journey awaits you.  After all, Mexico is located on another continent and in a different, Western hemisphere.  The duration of the trip is primarily affected by the fact that you will go by direct flight or connecting flights.  Here, not only the air route plays a role, but also the length of waiting at transit airports.  The time of year at which you intend to make the flight also matters.  Indeed, during the dominance of tropical cyclones, pilots prefer to make a detour than to get into the zone of large turbulence.  And finally, it‚Äôs important to know which airport you‚Äôre about to land at.  After all, Mexico is the fourteenth largest country in the world.  It is washed by two oceans - the Pacific and the Atlantic.  Therefore, you need to take into account the <span>coast of Mexico</span> you want to reach.  Below you will find information about the duration of travel by direct or connecting flights to various cities of this state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cheaptickets.com" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="How much to fly to Mexico from Moscow" class="if uuid-2231941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2231941.jpg"></div><h2>  We fly to the capital </h2><p>  The city of Mexico City lies in the heart of the country.  Mostly business people flock to this large metropolis.  But such travelers also want to know how much to fly to Mexico from Moscow.  Alas, there are no direct flights in this direction.  And here, passengers have to choose between connecting routes with one or two transfers.  The latter may be cheaper.  But in this case, you can also reach your destination in a day and a half.  Between the two capitals, Moscow and Mexico City, 10 730 kilometers lay.  Therefore, even with a direct flight, the travel time will be fourteen and a half hours.  Now we will consider at which airports you will least expect a connecting flight.  The most convenient route is via Washington.  There you will be delivered by the Aeroflot liner.  At the airport of the US capital, you need to wait a little less than two hours.  And then the US Airways will take you to Mexico City.  Everything about everything will take seventeen and a half hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.123travelusa.com" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Mexico: fly from Moscow" class="if uuid-2231952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2231952.jpg"></div><h2>  Destination - Cancun (Mexico) </h2><p>  It will be necessary to fly from Moscow a little less than to the capital of the country - ten thousand kilometers.  Therefore, the time spent on board will be shorter.  In addition, there is a direct air connection between the capital of the Russian Federation and the most popular resort in Mexico.  A direct flight is operated by the Russian company Aeroflot.  On her ship, you can reach Cancun in 13 hours and 20 minutes.  Well, for those for whom the price of a ticket of 25 thousand rubles seems excessive, the question remains: how long does it take to fly to Mexico from Moscow with transfers?  The fastest way to get to the Cancun resort is if you choose London Heathrow as the transit airport.  Eighteen and a half hours will be spent on the whole trip.  Making transfers in Paris and Atlanta, you will reach your destination in 21 hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="atik.briomotor.co" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Mexico: how much to fly from Moscow" class="if uuid-2231960" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2231960.jpg"></div><h2>  Acapulco </h2><p>  This fabulous resort with white beaches lies on the Pacific coast.  Therefore, even if there was a direct Moscow-Acapulco flight, it would last no less than thirteen hours.  After all, the liner would have to overcome a distance of eleven thousand kilometers.  But there is no direct flight to the resort.  How much fly to Mexico from Moscow with transfers?  They will have to do two.  After all, it‚Äôs most profitable to get to Acapulco from the capital, Mexico City.  In this case, it is better to choose the airline "Iberia".  It will take you only two hours to wait for a connecting flight in Madrid.  You can also make transfers in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, London or Paris.  Traveling to Acapulco, depending on the selected flights, will take from 19 to 25 hours.  But the beauty of the resort will shock you so much that you will forget all the hardships of a long journey. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.boiseweekly.com" data-author=": Frankie Roberto, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Time Mexico-Moscow" class="if uuid-2231961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2231961.jpg"></div><h2>  Mexico-Moscow time - what's the difference? </h2><p>  A huge country located between two oceans is divided into four time zones.  These are UTC - 5 (East), - 6 (Central), - 7 (Pacific) and - 8 (Northwest).  And Moscow is in the UTC +3 time zone.  In addition, despite being close to the equator, Mexico, with the exception of the extreme southern state of Sonora, is switching to daylight saving time.  We remind you that in Russia the clock hands on the first Sunday of April are not translated.  The country constantly lives in the "winter" time.  And the flight schedule always indicates the arrival and departure of the local timepieces.  Thus, it is extremely difficult to calculate how long it takes to fly to Mexico from Moscow using the airline tickets available. </p>
