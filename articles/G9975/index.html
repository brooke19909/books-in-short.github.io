This special tourist area was built in the 80s of the last century near the city of Sousse, especially for the Europeans to live without refusing anything and without embarrassing the chaste Muslim population.  Since then, Port El Kantaoui has turned into an elite village with a port for yachts, water parks and other entertainments.  It is completely built up with chic hotels, and we will talk about one of them in our article.  It is called Marhaba Palace 4 * (Tunisia, Sousse).  The rating of this hotel is 7.7 points out of 10 possible according to Bucking polls, and according to TripAdvisor estimates it is 4 out of 5. We have built a description of this hotel on recent reviews from vacationers.  What offers tourists Sousse, Port el Kantaoui and the hotel "Marhab Palace 4 *" in particular?  Let's look in order. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marhaba Palace 4 Tunisia" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2036703.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is Port El Kantaoui </h2><p>  In 1979, the then president of Tunisia, Habib Bourguiba, initiated the creation of a large ‚Äútourist reserve‚Äù north of Sousse.  Eight kilometers from the city center, an artificial port for yachts was built, a beautiful promenade was laid, emerald golf courses were broken and luxury hotels were built.  The project was brought to life by the famous architect Olivier Clement Kakub, the author of the Bourguiba Mausoleum in Monastir and the Presidential Palace in Carthage.  For the model for the new city, he took Port Grimaud to C√¥te d'Azur.  If you want to get acquainted with the exotic and sights of the country, then you obviously should not stay at the Marhaba Palace 4 * hotel (Tunisia).  Port El Kantaoui is designed for those who are only interested in the sun, sea, thalassotherapy and European-style entertainment.  But this resort has a number of advantages.  For example, beaches and the sea are much cleaner here.  There is very little algae (the main drawback of the Tunisian coast), and there is no wind.  And for historical sights, you can go to nearby Sousse. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resort specifics </h2><p>  What audience stops at the hotel Marhaba Palace 4 * (Tunisia)?  Port-el-Kantaoui is rightly considered the best resort for golfers.  The monument in the form of a ball on a pedestal at the entrance to the village eloquently speaks about this specificity.  Another feature is the unofficial closure of the resort to locals.  In the ‚Äúreservation for Europeans‚Äù beach vendors of glasses, pareos and other similar goods will not pester you.  But if you want to shop, go to ‚ÄúMarina‚Äù - the port for yachts.  There, among other things, you can eat delicious dishes of fish and seafood, because "scows full of mullet" come to this harbor.  For the entertainment of tourists, the Aqua Palace water park, the Hannibal amusement park, cafes and restaurants have been built.  And so that foreigners do not forget that they are nevertheless in Tunisia, an ‚Äúold‚Äù medina (Arab settlement) was erected, stylized as antique.  Traveling around Port el Kantaoui is possible with municipal accordion buses, private luge buses, taxis, tourist trains, horse-drawn carts and tuk-tuks. </p>

    <h2>  Location of the Marhaba Palace 4 * Hotel </h2><p>  Hotel Marhaba Palace 4 * (Tunisia) is located in the heart of the resort of Port El Kantaoui.  But the focus of nightlife does not interfere with a relaxing holiday.  Reviews say the hotel grounds are quiet.  Most golfers relax here.  After all, the field and the club are within reach.  Also close is the yacht port, which means a water park, an entertainment town and the epicenter of the nightlife of the resort area.  Just a few steps from the gates of the hotel there is a bus stop.  Easy to get to the city of Sousse, if you have such a desire.  And of course, the most important thing to say about the location of the hotel: it stands on the very shore of the sea and has its own beach of golden fine sand.  On the other side of the hotel there is a promenade where shops and shops work during the day, and in the evening multi-colored bulbs are lit, and everything is immersed in a soft flickering light.  Reviews give the location of the hotel in relation to the resort infrastructure the highest score. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marhaba Palace 4 (Tunisia, Sousse) reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2036709.jpg" width="600"></div>

The hotel we are describing is an eight-story building.  Its architecture is very original.  The building was built in the late eighties when high-tech style came into fashion.  From far away, the hull looks like a snow-white wave rising by a crest, and the windows look like sea foam.  Eight floors - only in the central part of the building, and on the sides it is reduced.  The building is designed so that most rooms have direct views of the Mediterranean Sea.  And since they are oriented north, coolness reigns in the rooms.  Between the sea and the hull there is a large swimming pool, stylized as a lagoon.  It is crossed by a bridge.

Also in the bedrooms there is a TV with cable channels, a minibar (it is chargeable), a telephone and a radio.
