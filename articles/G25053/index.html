Every day thousands of people come to them to admire the grandeur and beauty of nature.  Local travel agencies organize group excursions to the valley of the river of the same name, with visits to waterfalls and underground halls under the mysterious name ‚ÄúWitch's Cave‚Äù.  But, having studied the article, readers will be able to independently go to these beautiful places, without anyone else's help, to examine the flowing flows of cascades. </p><h2>  A bit about the Asha River </h2><p>  From the top of the Main <span>Caucasus Range</span> Grachev Venets, the river Ashe originates.  The stream flowing from the mountain slopes is still called Bekisha, and in the lower reaches, not far from the village of Kalezh, the river was named Ashe.  Locals believe that the name of the river is the name of the Circassian prince.  A noisy water stream, leaving the slopes of the Caucasus Mountains, spreads into the wide picturesque valley of the Ashe River, and then carries its waters to the Black Sea. </p>

    <p>  Anyone who visited this place in the spring will never forget it.  Due to the fact that the valley is full of evergreen trees, it was given the name "Emerald".  And the full-flowing streams of the river, collecting all the streams from melted snow along the road, are thrown down with a powerful roar from a 20-meter height.  This is the best time to visit Ashe Falls.  Indeed, in late spring and early summer they are the most full-flowing.  Then the flows are not so strong, although vivid impressions remain regardless of this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ashe Falls in Lazarevsky </h2><p>  Tourists from the cities of Sochi and Lazarevsky are brought to the valley.  The tour includes visits to equipped areas with wooden stairs and bridges, a trip to the cave and refreshments in Shapsug traditions.  You can swim in warm weather.  Ashe River Valley has a rocky bottom, which is better to move in special comfortable shoes with thick and non-slip soles. </p>

    <p>  Waterfalls flow down the flysch mountains.  This is a layered rock that shows all the age-old layers of stone that can crumble.  During a trip to such places, safety rules must be observed in order to return to the place of residence intact. </p><p>  From the village of Kalezh, you need to go upstream for about 2 km to see the two most famous and picturesque waterfalls - Psydakh and Shapsug.  Let's take a closer look at Ashe waterfalls separately. </p><h2>  Cascades Psydaha </h2><p>  The river flow from a great height down comes down in three cascades.  The upper one is considered the most beautiful, since it has a height of 30 meters.  Water, rushing down from such a height, breaks into stones, turning into water dust.  Below, from a constant drop of water, a depression, a small pool or lake at the foot of the cliff, has formed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  But this way the water flow does not stop.  The next second or middle cascade rushes down from a lower height, approximately 5 meters.  Water flows into it through a narrow canyon.  And the last cascade is the smallest, only 2.5 meters.  Since all water flows in different directions, Ashe waterfalls from one place would not be visible.  So that tourists can admire all the splendor at once, the locals organized the construction of wooden stairs and bridges, climbing on which you can immediately see all the bends in the rock created by the powerful force of water jets. </p><p>  The indigenous people, seeing this waterfall for the first time, called it Psyd, which means ‚Äúbeautiful water‚Äù in the language of Shapsugs. </p><h2>  Majestic Shapsug </h2><p>  To see the second famous waterfall, called Shapsug, you need to go upstream of the river for 600 meters from the cascading Psydakh.  If you turn towards the left tributary, you will see a tall 50-meter waterfall, which consists of four cascades.  To approach it, you need to use the long 30-meter wooden bridge over the river.  This is an attraction for the most daring.  Not only does the bridge lie above the stones that cover the bottom of a shallow river, it also sways great, especially when several people walk along it. </p>

    <p>  The highest cascade is the bottom.  The remaining three are 5, 8 and 10 meters high.  But, due to the fact that convenient stairs and platforms are laid along the sheer wall, which lead from the place where the water falls to the top of the waterfall, you can view all the cascades in detail.  The layered rock looks beautiful, it seems that it is built by someone from bricks. </p><h2>  Legends of the Ashe River </h2><p>  There is a huge stone near the lower Shapsug waterfall.  It is called the Wish Stone.  You need to touch it with your hand and make any desire.  According to legend, it will come true. </p><p>  Psydah Waterfalls are also called by the local ‚ÄúBrides Waterfall‚Äù.  According to legend, every single girl who bathes under the streams of a waterfall will soon get married. </p>

    <p>  In the Ashe Valley is the legendary rock of the Old Men.  According to legend, from the cliff residents threw into the abyss of feeble old people.  But one young man refused to perform this barbaric rite.  He hid his father in a cave nearby.  He often visited the old man, brought him food, and that son gave useful and wise advice.  Once the father‚Äôs words saved the villagers from death.  The young man admitted to people that the old man advised him.  Since then, people stopped throwing old people off a cliff, and began to respect them and listen to their advice. </p><h2>  Ashe Falls: how to get there? </h2><p>  Getting to the Ashe River yourself is a snap.  It is convenient to do this from several places. </p><ol><li>  If you go by car, then from the M-27 highway in a straight line to the village of Kalezh.  From this village you need to walk or off-road on the river bed for about 4 km. </li><li>  From Sochi you need to go along the highway "Sukhum - Novorossiysk" to the village of Ashe, there, after crossing the bridge, turn right to Shkhafit. </li><li>  If you are moving out of Gelendzhik, then turn before entering the Village. </li><li>  From Tuapse along the Novorossiysk-Sukhum highway to the village of Shkhafit (see the direction indicator). </li><li>  From Lazarevsky by bus number 159 to the village of Kalezh.  Flights run 4 times a day. </li></ol><p>  In villages to Ashe waterfalls, you can hire SUVs that will be taken along the rocky bottom of the river along the course.  But it's nice to walk and walk, only shoes need to be put on comfortable. </p>
