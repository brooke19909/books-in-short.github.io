And now the new creation of the company appeared on the territory of the Russian Federation in official sale.  This is the promised addition, defined in the middle price range. </p><h2>  Differences between models </h2><p>  If we pick up both phones, we won‚Äôt notice any special differences between them.  The design is pretty similar.  However, at the first <span>tactile contact</span> , it becomes clear that thinness and lightness are the main advantages of HTC Desire 626. Reviews of the smartphone only confirm this once again.  Yes, the model has become much lighter than its predecessor.  However, the hardware and the five-inch screen remained intact, without going anywhere.  The resolution was not affected, the picture is still displayed in HD (1280 by 720) pixels. </p><p>  The differences become a little more noticeable when using the HTC Desire 626 camera. Reviews of it can inform readers that the module is powerful enough, which allows you to take very, very high-quality pictures.  But what else could you expect from a camera with a resolution of 13 megapixels?  The model switched to using 16 gigabytes of long-term memory.  At the same time, the previous version had only 8 GB. </p><h2>  The main advantages of a smartphone </h2>

It is, of course, about Sense 7. The interface is based on the operating system of the Android family of version 5.1.  The advantage of Sense 7 is a large set of features that allow you to customize your phone as you really need.  This is a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãabilities and options for each individual user.  And now it's time to talk in more detail about the technical aspects of the smartphone. </p><h2>  Specifications.  Communication </h2>

    <p>  Smartphone HTC Desire 626, reviews of which we will try to make based on the listed parameters of the device, works in the GSM bands, as well as UMTS.  Access to the international network is ensured through the use of technologies such as 3G, EDGE and GPRS.  The device has a built-in modem that allows you to distribute Wi-Fi to third-party devices.  To do this, a SIM card with activated Internet must be inserted into the smartphone.  After creating the access point, setting the authentication type (open or password-protected), other devices will be able to connect to it.  It can be smartphones, tablet computers, as well as laptops. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  HTC Desire 626 G has no set of communications. Reviews say that the Wi-Fi module (supports b, g and n bands) works stably, without failures.  The coverage from the distributor is well captured.  For the wireless exchange of multimedia files with other smartphones, the Bluetooth function version 4.0 is provided.  If you constantly use e-mail to communicate with other subscribers, then you will certainly be delighted to have a built-in e-mail client.  You can synchronize with a personal computer.  To do this, you need to use a USB-MicroUSB standard wire. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The main module has a resolution of 13 megapixels.  This is enough "for the eyes" in order to take really high-quality pictures in various lighting conditions.  If there is not enough light around, or it is completely absent, do not be sad: the phone is equipped with a LED flash.  The module works with the function of automatic focusing on the subject.  The ability to record video in a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels is supported.  The additional camera will clearly appeal to people who like to take selfie pictures.  It is quite high quality.  However, no one is surprised at this, because the resolution of the front camera is as much as five megapixels. </p><h2>  CPU </h2>

    <p>  The best-selling model, according to official data, was the HTC Desire 626 LTE 16 GB.  Users leave reviews about this variation most willingly.  And, if you look, it immediately becomes clear why.  Firstly, the modification is equipped with an LTE module, which provides the smartphone in fourth-generation cellular networks.  In fact, this means exchanging packet data at an increased speed, so that the pages in the browser will load unmatched faster.  The same applies to downloading any multimedia data from web pages or playing them online. </p><p>  Secondly, the model is equipped with a large amount of flash memory.  In the market of mobile phones, in the salons of mobile communication, you can find various variations of this unit.  They will differ among themselves in several parameters, including the amount of internal memory.  Of course, the more it will be in the device, the higher will be its cost.  If you have already purchased a microSD card, say, 8 or more gigabytes, then there is no need to overpay for the variation.  By the way, the amount of internal RAM is 1 gigabyte. </p><h2>  Multimedia features </h2>

    <p>  Their list is quite averaged for the device.  There is an audio player, video player.  You can set your own ringtones and ringtones in MP3 format on a call.  The use of analogue FM radio is supported.  However, you will need a wired stereo headset to listen.  After connecting to the device, it will play the role of an antenna.  The headset is integrated into the 3.5 mm standard jack. </p><h2>  Operating system, navigation, SIM cards </h2><p>  On board the smartphone, the OS of the Android family of version 4.4 (the so-called KitKat) is installed.  Navigation capabilities are provided by satellites based on GPS technology.  They work accurately and efficiently, making it possible to turn the device into a navigator for a car.  The function of two SIM cards is supported.  However, they will need to be processed according to the NanoSIM standard before use. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  Power is supplied by a lithium polymer type battery.  It is designed for a capacity of two thousand milliamps per hour.  Not so much as we would like, but what can we do.  With skillful use, the device will be able to stretch without additional charge a full day. </p><h2>  Smartphone HTC Desire 626 LTE: reviews and conclusion </h2><p>  The cost of the device is currently about 25 thousand rubles.  For such money, the device offers acceptable functionality, performance.  However, he does not bypass his competitors, who, by the way, are even cheaper.  For example, the <span>Sony Xperia M4 Aqua</span> competes with the model (it costs 22 500 rubles).  As many users noted in their reviews, you should buy the device only if you are really a fan of the Taiwanese manufacturer and can suffer device flaws in exchange for the possibility of using the Sense 7 interface. Otherwise, many experts advise taking a closer look at similar models.  There are some smartphones even for 17 thousand rubles that look more attractive due to the increased performance. </p>
