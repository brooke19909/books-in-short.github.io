    <h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  The geography of the hotel's location (in the vicinity of the village of Tekirova, near the city of Kemer) determines the microclimate different from the rest of the province of Antalya: here in the summer months it is not as hot as on the rest of the Mediterranean coast. </p><p>  And, of course, the healing Mediterranean climate and the unique "wine color", as Socrates spoke of it, the Mediterranean Sea are the advantage of the Club Phaselis Hotel (Kemer). </p><p>  Reviews of ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù holiday-makers who bought a tour to this hotel complex tell about the pleasant transparency and cleanliness of the local water area.  The latter circumstance is explained by the fact that mountain rivers and streams flowing down the stone-sandy channels from the Taurus Mountains are crystal clear and do not stir up the sea waters, as the rivers in the Belek region do, flowing along unpaved channels.  Sea coast overgrown with greenery.  The picturesque sight is represented by valleys, mountain slopes, painted with the multicolor of hundreds of species of flowering plants.  Especially beautiful are the pink oleanders and emerald bells that adorn them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel territory, transport connection </h2><p>  It's nice to walk here.  From this simple occupation, holidaymakers seem to get aesthetic pleasure.  There are a lot of strollers.  The territory is equipped with terraces and alleys.  Royal palm trees, flowering plants, trimmed bushes in geometric shapes were planted neatly on well-groomed lawns along them.  And right on the alleys signs are displayed explaining the hotel guests where and what is located on its territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club phaselis 5 reviews" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/753924.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel complex is impressive - over 40,000 m <sup>2</sup> , and the number of rooms demonstrates the scale of tourist services: more than 550 suites and rooms.  With its vast territory and developed infrastructure, according to the current classification, it definitely refers to Club Phaselis club hotels.  The reviews of guests, surrounded by all kinds of entertainment and pleasures, narrate that the most outspoken holidaymakers - children - crying, do not want to leave here.  They just do not want to leave this seemingly fabulous world for themselves! </p><p>  In addition, the hotel complex, which is important for active tourists, is located in an area with perfect transport interchange: every 15 minutes minibuses leave from here to Antalya and Kemer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A description of the territory of the hotel in its most general form may look as follows. </p><p>  On one side of the hotel complex are located: </p><ul><li>  Its 2 main buildings are with reception; </li><li>  lobby area; </li><li>  the main restaurant that nourishes vacationers; </li><li>  restaurants by appointment; </li><li>  SPA complex; </li><li>  outdoor pool; </li><li>  fitness center; </li><li>  shopping center; </li><li>  Rose bar. </li></ul><p>  On the other hand is: </p><ul><li>  open pool; </li><li>  feeding the "bathers" bar; </li><li>  snack bar </li><li>  a tent where gozleme cakes are made; </li><li>  photographers ‚Äôplayground; </li><li>  building animators; </li><li>  shops and playgrounds. </li></ul><p>  In the middle of the hotel is a children's complex (pool and playground), then, closer to the residential area, an amphitheater. </p><h2>  More information about the infrastructure of outdoor activities </h2><p>  Of course, the resort's favorite vacation spot is a two-hundred-meter sandy hotel beach, located one and a half hundred meters from the two main buildings of the hotel complex.  It is comfortable, sufficiently equipped with comfortable and unworn sun loungers.  Awnings are stretched over the sun loungers, perfectly protecting from the sun.  What can I say, the Club Phaselis 5 * hotel has an excellent beach - bulk, with pebble entry into the water.  Guest reviews are grateful. </p><p>  Here, all-inclusive holiday-makers can have a snack and enjoy refreshing drinks in the constantly working bar. </p><p>  Hotel volleyball championships are organized on the beach. </p><p>  Hotel Club Phaselis reviews also mention a cozy landscaped relaxation area around an outdoor pool equipped with three water slides.  This is one of the most popular holiday destinations for holidaymakers.  Here in the mornings, animators arrange yoga, water aerobics classes for vacationers, there is the opportunity to play table tennis, darts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club hotel phaselis rose reviews" class="if" height="248" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/753927.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the daytime, outdoor enthusiasts play futsal. </p><p>  The hotel complex itself has an indoor pool, gym, sauna, Turkish bath (hammam). </p><p>  Of course, to get the most from your health and relaxation, you should not limit yourself to the above-mentioned hotel complex services provided as part of the all inclusive.  We also recommend that you include one of its paid services in your program: take a few lessons at a diving or windsurfing school, take a professional massage course, play billiards or tennis with friends. </p><p>  There is also the opportunity to join motorized water sports.  However, we recommend that beginners be careful: according to reviews, one ‚Äúlucky guy‚Äù managed to turn a <span>jet ski over.</span>  After that, he had to pay all the time until this vehicle was brought to the surface, suitable for further offers to holidaymakers. </p><h2>  When buying a tour, do not mix up two different hotels </h2><p>  Newly arrived holidaymakers are always surprised by the scale of <span>the Club Hotel</span> Phaselis Rose <span>hotel</span> .  Reviews of tourists who had the opportunity to relax in it, point to one delicate point: when buying a tour here, you should be careful. </p><p>  In the same area, closer to Kemer, there is a hotel complex with a consonant name.  It is one and a half times larger in the number of rooms, and twice as large as the hotel in its territory - the subject of this article.  The name of this other hotel sounds like a somewhat abbreviated name of ‚Äúours‚Äù - ‚ÄúClub Phaselis‚Äù. </p><p>  The reviews of vacationers in it testify that this even larger hotel complex than the hotel is the subject of this article, but less "party" than Phaselis Rose.  This circumstance may be critical for choosing a tour by young people.  Therefore, we note for readers that, reading this article, the similarities of the names of the two hotel complexes should not be focused on: to avoid confusion, we will talk exclusively about Club Hotel Phaselis Rose 5 *.  The reviews of its guests are the basis for our presentation, brought to your attention. </p><h2>  Attractive price and historical surroundings of the hotel </h2><p>  The competitive price of the tour in Club Phaselis 5 * is quite competitive.  Responses of holidaymakers who bought the tour show a good price-quality ratio of such an acquisition.  The current cost of the tour for two adults for 6 nights is $ 960.  Vacationers are served on an all-inclusive basis.  The staff of the hotel complex is friendly, trained, helpful and sufficiently communicative in three languages: Russian, English, German. </p>

    <p>  Also attractive for archeological excursion hikers is the Club Phaselis (Kemer) hotel's location.  Their feedback on visiting the relics of ancient Lycia (the so-called country that was here in antiquity) testifies to the wonderful impressions of getting acquainted with the traces of the activities of Alexander the Great and <span>Mark Anthony.</span> </p><p>  In the name of the hotel the word "Phaselis" is of non-commercial origin.  This was the name of the ancient Lycian city located on the Kemer - Tekirova highway, excavations of which are now available for sightseeing.  In addition, the presence of the word "rose" in the name of the hotel complex also has a historical explanation (Phaselis was famous for his roses and purple oil).  Here in such historically interesting places Turkey purposefully erects hotels.  Club Hotel Phaselis Rose reviews of excursions are called one of these objects.  Lycia, where it was built, was quite densely populated.  And this civilization has not left a trace, a certain continuity is felt.  For example, the ancient Idrios eventually became Kemer.  The name is dedicated to the Muslim <span>prophet Idris, an</span> esotericist and astrologer, who first wrote and stitched a 30-sheet book. </p><h2>  Children's mini club </h2><p>  For families with children, a mini club is provided for organizing children's activities.  Small holidaymakers (4-12 years old) are divided into two subgroups: the youngest (4-6 years old) and the oldest (7-12 years old).  For them, entertainers organize entertainment on the street (more precisely, on equipped playgrounds) and in the two-story building of the club itself. </p><h2>  Modern design and communications </h2><p>  Note that the hotel complex Phaselis Rose, in addition, has long been chosen by large corporations to organize their visiting seminars.  The hotel has six conference rooms.  Reliable and multi-channel conference calling with Club Phaselis.  Guest reviews show unanimity: almost all of them like its modern interior design - emphasized by a cozy lobby, expertly furnished with stylish sofas, armchairs.  It has a harmonious long reception desk, a department working with guests, a bar counter and a rent-a-car counter (car rental). </p><h2>  Rooms &amp; Suites </h2><p>  What conditions for resort accommodation does the hotel offer its guests?  The choice is wide enough.  Here in the main hotel building there are standard type rooms (267 units), and rooms in three-story bungalows (198 units) are also offered.  At the service of spa travelers, more demanding to comfort, are 12 senior suite suites (with a bedroom and a living room) and 20 junior suites (with a folding, using special furniture, sleeping place located directly in the living room).  The hotel also has the possibility of VIP service - a two-story villa with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, designed for 4 + 2. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club phaselis reviews photos" class="if" height="239" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/753975.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  The principle of functionality expresses the arrangement of rooms at the Club Hotel Phaselis Rose 5 * hotel.  Guest reviews are more likely to testify to stylish rather than expensive furniture, enough branded brands and decent functionality about household appliances.  The furniture is not worn out, in case of breakdowns it is quickly replaced.  the rooms of the hotel complex are bright and cozy, and the friendly staff promptly, in the current time mode, arranges minor repairs at the reception of the guest to the reception if, for example, the plumbing suddenly breaks down. </p><h2>  What is it - a standard hotel room? </h2><p>  What is a standard room that Club Phaselis 5 * (Kemer) provides its guests.  Reviews of residents mention its fairly compact area, two or three beds (the capacity of such rooms is ‚Äú2 + 1‚Äù), a table, an armchair, two nightstands.  The mirror on the wall with the built-in ‚Äúplasma‚Äù looks original.  If the floor in the room is ceramic, then guests will additionally receive a pair of slippers.  The small entrance hall is furnished with a <span>wardrobe</span> with a mirror. </p><p>  A peaceful evening relaxation is facilitated by a large balcony equipped for relaxation.  Comfortable and combined with a bathroom (they are separated by a special glass), a neat bathroom with a shower is provided by Club Hotel Phaselis Rose 5 *.  The reviews mention the proper set of accessories that are constantly present in the bathroom, if necessary, delicately and imperceptibly updated by staff (soap, shampoo, shower gel, hair conditioner, cotton buds, body gel, shower caps). </p><p>  Rooms are cleaned and towels are changed daily and carefully.  However, from the towels of "swans", "bunnies" and "fish" are not laid out here. </p><p>  The positive point is the availability of free and fairly ‚Äúfast‚Äù Wi-Fi throughout the hotel. </p><h2>  Interior design </h2><p>  Photos of client rooms and suites demonstrate a certain style in the design of rooms at Club Hotel Phaselis Rose 5 * hotel.  Reviews living in it comment on a calm and stylish range of colors.  There is no usual red dominance for Turkish hotels, the eyes are resting.  The hotel rooms are bright, with white walls and a white tulle with blackout curtains covering the windows and balcony. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club phaselis 5 kemer reviews" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/753980.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  Ceramic or carpet flooring.  The atmosphere is dominated by harmoniously selected shades of brown, which are present in all elements of the elegant interior. </p><p>  At the same time, guests for some conveniences in the rooms (safe and minibar) should pay extra, as evidenced by the reviews available on Club Phaselis.  Photos of client rooms and suites are attached to our article for clarity. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  An important aspect of the rest is the catering.  At the hotel complex, its customers are abundantly fed both the main restaurant and two restaurants by appointment and six buffets.  It's almost impossible to stay hungry at Club Phaselis.  Reviews of vacationers indicate really tasty and healthy food - the result of conscientious work of the team under the guidance of the local chef. </p><p>  Reviews of hotel guests who already had resort experience are unanimous: the menu may not be the richest among five-star hotels, but all the products are of exceptional freshness and the prepared dishes are of high quality.  The main fish dishes that are skillfully prepared from dorado, trout, tuna, and mackerel are delicious.  Also good in the lunch and evening menu are seafood dishes: mussels, shrimps, squids. </p><p>  In principle, the main restaurant - fish and meat dishes, salads, soups, pastries, sweets, fruits, soft drinks and low alcohol drinks - is enough.  However, there are gourmets among tourists Club Phaselis.  Their feedback on the ordered dishes and seafood in fish and national restaurants a la carte is positive. </p><p>  In the main restaurant, drinks are not brought by waiters to the tables of hotel guests, they take them by themselves from the bar counter.  From soft drinks packaged juices, ayran are available.  At the bartenders, vacationers can take: </p><ul><li>  soft drinks (cola, phantom, sprite); </li><li>  low alcohol drinks (beer and local wine); </li><li>  alcoholic (vodka, brandy, whiskey). </li></ul><h2>  Available tours "on their own" </h2><p>  Note to motorists: the hotel operates a car rental.  Therefore, having paid a minimum of money, you can visit the sights of Antalya (an aquarium tunnel, the architectural ensemble of the Kaleici district, Miniature Park, the Antalya Museum, Yivli Minaret, the Hydyrlyk Tower);  and also Kemer (the fiery mountain Yanartash, Yoruk ethnopark, Moonlight Park, the remains of the ancient city of Mira).  Note that all of the above tours do not require excessive spending from Club Phaselis 5 * guests.  The reviews indicate that the fee for such an excursion consists of a taxi and the viewing price paid already on the spot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club phaselis kemer reviews" class="if" height="248" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/753966.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In this case, you save the commission paid by the travel agency and tour operator.  However, the commissions of city travel agencies are not so high. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews left, many holidaymakers use their services. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Here, in this hotel complex, tourists often travel repeatedly, as evidenced by the reviews available about the Club Phaselis hotel.  Hotel rating, of course, consists of many components.  But one of them, of course, is the attitude of his staff to their work. </p><p>  In the reviews of vacationers at the hotel there is a thesis that its employees value their workplace, they are hardworking and helpful.  Disadvantages, indeed, sometimes do occur (someone scooped up a bunch of garbage from under the closet, someone didn‚Äôt like the oysters weren‚Äôt in the restaurant, someone didn‚Äôt like the forged handrails on the <span>staircase).</span>  However, we were convinced of this, similar infrequent reviews about the Hotel Club Phaselis 5 * reviews are trifles.  Most of the responses contain thanks to the staff.  The hotel can be recommended for relaxation. </p>
