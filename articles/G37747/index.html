They are not afraid of failures, therefore they experiment, try to combine different styles and even draw inspiration using ideas from other types of needlework.  For example, patchwork style knitting has appeared recently.  They came up with those who like cute little things from colorful pieces connected in one canvas.  This is quite painstaking work, but the result justifies all the many hours of work carried out in this lesson. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.malele44.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork technique" class="if uuid-3078850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/3078850.jpg"></div><h2>  It's all about flaps </h2><p>  There are only two main methods of knitting: on knitting needles and crochet.  And each of them has its own patchwork techniques, on the basis of which not only masterpieces for the interior are created, but also clothing items, bags and more.  In this case, two types of flap layout are used: </p><ol><li>  Separate parts are knotted, and then combined into one product using a needle or hook.  Often this method is used when crocheting. </li><li>  The flaps are brought together in the process of knitting.  Then the edge of one piece becomes the beginning of another - only the color of the thread changes - or the squares are also made with different patterns. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet in patchwork style" class="if uuid-3078878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/3078878.jpg"></div><p>  Many knitters taking the first steps in this type of needlework may find it difficult to use some patchwork techniques.  Moreover, finished products are sometimes struck by an abundance of small parts.  But in every type of creativity, it all starts with simple steps, and knitting in the style of patchwork is no exception.  Therefore, in this article, knitting workshops with the help of knitting needles and a hook are selected specifically for beginners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to learn the simple technique of knitting with rags using knitting needles? </h2><p>  The first thing to do is choose the right thread.  They should be approximately the same quality and thickness, at least four colors (maximum is not limited: it all depends on the author‚Äôs ideas and his skills).  Knitting needles should be selected half as thick (although there are exceptions if very loose knitting is needed). </p><p>  Knitting in the style of a patchwork according to the scheme of simple squares can be considered in this step-by-step example: </p><ol><li>  For a square with a side of twenty loops, you need to dial 40 + 1 (the last loop is the axial one, which will be in the middle of the square). </li><li>  Such a pattern is knitted with an ordinary shawl pattern, when all the loops on both sides (wrong side and front) are front. </li><li>  In each second row (for example, only on the front side of the product), an axial loop is made a decrease: out of three (axial + one on each side of it) one loop is knitted.  How to do it right: just remove the first loop, then tie one of the two from the two, and then simply stretch the removed one through the already knitted loop. </li></ol><p>  When all the rows have been completed, you will get a nice square with a diagonal line in the center.  The thread should be cut and properly fastened so that the finished product begins to unfold during use or washing.  The first patchwork knitting detail is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nataliti.name" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork knitting" class="if uuid-3078862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/3078862.jpg"></div><h2>  How to connect the squares during the knitting process? </h2><p>  It is possible by such a principle to impose the required number of pieces, and then connect together with a hook using a contrasting thread (or neutral).  And you can knit the next flap from the edge of the previous one, getting the finished fabric immediately.  This method of knitting in the patchwork style will be convenient for beginners - then they will have no problems with skewing the product or mismatch of its sides when stitching parts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To get the second patch, ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù from the first, you need to dial 20 stitches of a different color in the usual way, and then another 21 from the edge of the first square, again getting the necessary 41 in the end. Next, the knitting continues according to the usual pattern described above until then until the side of the square closes.  Attach a third to it, if necessary - a fourth, until the required width of the product is reached. </p><h2>  How to make a second row of flaps? </h2><p>  In fact, in knitting using the patchwork technique, everything is very simple, although, at first glance, it does not seem so.  A simple example is knitting a second strip of squares from multi-colored rags.  How is this done? </p><ol><li>  On the upper edge of the last square, dial 20 loops and add 21 more to them, dialed as at the beginning of knitting. </li><li>  From the obtained number of loops, knit a square according to the general principle. </li><li>  In order to get a second patch, in the second row the loops are dialed along the upper edges of the adjacent squares: the lower and upper lateral - 20 on each side.  In this case, the additional axial loop must be tied from the corner - where the intersection of the corners of the colored squares. </li></ol><p>  According to this principle of simple patchwork technique, a cloth of any size is knitted. </p><h2>  Crochet floral motifs. </h2><p>  Perhaps, for some people, patchwork knitting can seem too complicated and incomprehensible.  Then you should try crocheting, where you do not need to count the number of loops - because in this technique it is always one.  The only negative is that you need to clearly follow the pattern scheme if you want to get a beautiful product of the correct geometric shape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="carlitavintageshop.over-blog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting in a patchwork style" class="if uuid-3078851" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/3078851.jpg"></div><p>  Patchwork crochet in the form of floral patterns has many options that are created by combining variations from air loops with a crochet or without.  Double-crochet loops are less commonly used, but for beginners it is better not to use them so far so as not to get confused. </p><h2>  Afghan or "grandmother" square </h2><p>  This is the simplest knitting patchwork style for beginners who are not too strong in combinations of different types of loops.  Its base is single crocheted columns mixed with air loops - they give the pattern a delicacy.  Now about how to step-by-step connect the <span>Afghan square</span> : </p><ol><li>  Collect four air loops and connect them into a ring. </li><li>  Make three more air loops for lifting the row and knit three double crochets from each loop.  Between each three leave three air loops. </li><li>  When moving to the next row, knit four more air loops.  Then, from the first air loop of the previous row, knit three double crochets and then make three air loops.  Now, from the third loop of the previous row, there are three more double crochets.  Thus, the corner of the future square is formed.  Next, you need to make one air loop, and then repeat the pattern in mirror image: that is, three columns, three air, three more columns, one air, etc.  round. </li><li>  The fourth and subsequent rows are knitted according to the principle of the third: the corners are formed by a combination of columns with crochets and three air loops on each side.  And along the rest of the square between the triples of the columns, only one air loop is knitted. </li></ol><h2>  What then? </h2><p>  Typically, four to seven rows are used in this patchwork-style crochet technique.  It all depends on what size the finished product will be: for large rugs, large squares are needed, and small ones for smaller ones.  When the required number of squares is made, it remains to connect them together in one fabric, crocheting and contrasting thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="archzine.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="style patchwork scheme" class="if uuid-3078853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/3078853.jpg"></div><p>  It is important to qualitatively connect the corners of each square, making sure that there are no distortions, otherwise the product will be deformed when washing, and all the work will go to dust.  Very interesting plaids from such squares are obtained if you use different color combinations in each square, knitting a new row with a different color, but at the same time adhering to the general color composition. </p><h2>  Color spiral </h2><p>  Another crochet looks unusual in a circle, but using four threads of different colors simultaneously in a simple technique of knitting in a circle with single crochet posts.  In order to understand the principle, you should take four different threads, for example: yellow, blue, red and green.  Next step by step: </p><ol><li>  Knit 5-7 air loops from a yellow thread and connect them into a ring.  Start tying by making three single crochet stitches.  Leaving the elongated loop, add a blue thread and knit as many half-columns.  Next, continue knitting with other colors, each time leaving a loop of thread. </li><li>  Start forming the corners of the future square: continue to knit a row in blue color with a yellow thread, using columns with crochets (hereinafter in the whole pattern only they are) reaching its middle.  There will be five from the second column of the last row and one from the third.  Extend the loop, continue with a different color - and so on. </li><li>  The next row should be carried out according to the same principle, not forgetting that at each vertex of the corner of the square five double crochets are knitted. </li></ol><p>  In the process of knitting, the pattern and rows will be clearly identified, and it will become easy to navigate how much you need to knit to the corner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pattern" class="if uuid-3078881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/3078881.jpg"></div><p>  It is important to periodically tighten the loop thread so that the pattern looks holistic.  When the required size is knitted, the threads need to be fixed and cut. </p><h2>  A few ideas in the style of patchwork </h2><p>  Knitting is a creative process, and crocheting in a circle is especially.  Here you can create completely unique squares, circles, polyhedrons and other shapes from multi-colored threads, and then combining them together to get another masterpiece.  It is interesting to combine large parts with small ones, selecting them so that the overall geometry of the shape is not disturbed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingmatters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting" class="if uuid-3078880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/3078880.jpg"></div><p>  Colors at some point may lose importance if the product‚Äôs focus is on small details, and the thread acts as a common background, which combines them into one.  The remains of threads, small balls, loose old knitted things - everything can go into action and give life to a new thing that will decorate the house for a long time, pleasing to the eye. </p>
