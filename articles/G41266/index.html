    <h2>  Venter, mousetraps, nets, pits </h2><p>  Traps are called technical devices made of metal, ropes, branches, the use of natural features of the terrain to capture the victim or deprive her of life.  An object can be both an animal and a person.  And in order for the hunt to become successful, it is necessary to consider not only the size, but also the habits, lifestyle and nature of the alleged victim.  How to make a trap for a person?  Here is a short list of devices that can help in this undertaking: </p><ul><li>  Silks, nets, snares.  Although they are usually used to capture hares and birds, these traps may well delay a potential victim, in our case, a representative of the human race. </li><li>  A bucket of water, mounted above an ajar door, is one of the options for a home-made trap. </li><li>  A banana peel thrown under the legs of an attacker will cause him to fall to the floor. </li></ul>

Similar constructions were usually arranged during military operations by partisans in Vietnam.  And the hunters of the African tribes knew well how to make a trap for humans. </p><p>  Caution is always necessary in the forest, as an ordinary anthill can become a trap.  Moving logs, falling stones, unknown from where, and other ‚Äúwonders of engineering‚Äù are very colorfully demonstrated in many films, and so clearly that even instructions on how to make a trap for a person are not needed. </p><p>  However, we will leave these methods for the cinema, and in modern realities simple and safe methods are used.  Although ... Let us recall the well-known and beloved by many, the film "Home Alone."  Not all traps prepared by the hero of M. Calkin can be called safe for health.  And of course, they became an unpleasant surprise for the villains.  However, we will talk about thieves, or rather about the methods of their "elimination" a little later, but for now ... </p><h2>  Gaming and funny tenets </h2><p>  Of course, traps are not only scary and dangerous, but also game ones.  How to make a trap for a person in the house?  If you want to entertain the children and allow the floor space, you can arrange the game "Overcoming Laser Obstacles".  The following must be done: </p><ul><li>  arrange several chairs around the room at different distances from each other; </li><li>  take a ball of thick thread or a long rope; </li><li>  tie one end of the thread to the leg of one of the chairs; </li><li>  stretch a thread or rope from one piece of furniture to another, fixing at different heights in an arbitrary order; </li><li>  the second tip of the rope must also be attached. </li></ul><p>  As a result of such manipulations, a peculiar ‚Äúobstacle course‚Äù should appear, resembling a network of light rays. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a trap for a person in the house" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18967/1019017.jpg" width="300"></div>

Whoever gets out the fastest wins.  Is it worth mentioning that it is impossible to touch the "laser beams"? </p><h2>  Like an aunt of thieves scared </h2><p>  Of course, in peacetime, variations on the topic "How to make a trap for a person" are usually sought in order to protect their homes from the invasion of uninvited guests.  Our people are tricky to invent, such methods come up that you are simply amazed. </p><p>  For example, one of the townspeople made a large rag doll, dressed her in her old bathrobe, and put on a wig on her head.  Before leaving for the cottage, a woman hangs this mannequin in the corridor in front of the front door.  Any thief, climbing into the house and seeing such a picture, will forget about the purpose of his ‚Äúvisit‚Äù and retire.  Well, okay!  After all, the main thing is to protect your property, and not to catch the villain. </p><p>  Some of the craftsmen connect one of the fixtures with a timer, which from time to time turns the lamp on and off.  This gives the impression that the house has owners. </p>

    <h2>  Special means, or How to make a trap for a person </h2><p>  To protect apartments, garages and summer cottages, manufacturers produce fairly effective, but at the same time safe and inexpensive devices. </p><p>  Passive protection devices can be camouflaged for small objects or simply hidden in a room.  Chemical aerosol traps contain special indelible substances: </p><ul><li>  luminescent spots on a <span>robber‚Äôs</span> face or <span>clothes are</span> visible in the dark; </li><li>  painting powders cannot be washed within 5 days, which will allow you to quickly find an attacker (works great if an uninvited visitor is from a familiar environment); </li><li>  the smelling marks of a thief will easily find a service dog. </li></ul><p>  The magnetic siren, triggered when the doors are opened, will scare away the uninvited "guest".  An extension with <span>tear gas</span> mounted on the front door will disable an unlucky thief in a couple of seconds. </p>

    <p>  Some apartment owners, wanting to protect themselves from robbery, leave poisoned alcohol on the table, others put traps on people.  Particularly ‚Äúcaring‚Äù ones can connect an electric current to the door handle or lay boards with nails under the window sills. </p><p>  Such barbaric protective measures can lead to an attacker dying or seriously injuring.  Effective, of course, but ... It is important to remember that, in accordance with the law, such actions are considered intentional harm to health.  Even if the landlord resorts to them in order to protect him, he may be punished with a criminal offense. </p>

    <h2>  A trap on his native street, or On safety and carelessness </h2><p>  How to make a trap for a person on the street?  It is not always necessary to deliberately dig holes, insert stakes or arrange snares.  A deadly trap on the streets of a modern city can be an open <span>sewer hatch</span> and an unfenced trench, a construction pit and a well with boiling water from a heating main. </p><p>  If construction is underway near the house, you must definitely look after the children and adolescents.  After all, it is so interesting for them to be in the territory of the ‚Äúexcavation site‚Äù, and games in such a place often end in disrepair: spinal injuries, fractures and concussions. </p><p>  In order not to fall into an open well, you need to carefully look under your feet while moving along the sidewalks.  Of course, builders and repairmen should put up fencing and warning signs when working at <span>potentially dangerous facilities.</span>  However, in order to maintain their own health, they need to take care of themselves. </p>
