Travel to all corners of the country</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The famous <span>square of 3 stations in Moscow</span> is the place where people gather from different parts of the country, because there are three stations with different directions: south, east and north.  How and where to get, this will be described below. </p><h2>  How to get to three stations? </h2><p>  If you are traveling by subway, you need to get off at the Komsomolskaya station of the Koltsevaya or Sokolnicheskaya line.  We list these combined 3 stations in Moscow.  Which ones?  Currently, train informants in rolling stock announce that Leningradsky, Yaroslavsky and Kazan stations, as well as the Kalanchevskaya railway platform, are located on Komsomolskaya. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that it is advisable to get out of the metro at the appropriate station.  In what sense?  For example, it is better to go to the Leningradsky and Yaroslavsky stations, as well as to Kalanchevskaya from the Koltsevaya line.  There is only one exit from the metro station, do not get lost.  But it’s closer to go to the Kazan station only from Sokolnicheskaya, namely when leaving the first car from the north.  There is also a short way to the <span>Sokolnicheskaya line</span> if you take the last car from the side of Rokossovsky Boulevard. </p><h2>  Leningradsky </h2><p>  Leaving the subway, you will see the box office of the commuter trains, the yellow station building.  You can get to the commuter trains only from the right wing of the building at the end.  And the long-distance ticket offices and trains are located to the left.  You need to go to Komsomolskaya Square and move along the facade of the building of the Leningrad Station. </p><p>  The area of ​​3 stations in Moscow is quite conveniently located for passengers, so if you accidentally go the wrong way, you can always use the underpass. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="3 stations in Moscow which" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1180334.jpg" width="550"></div>

It is worth noting that it is on the Oktyabrskaya Railway (from the Leningrad Station) that the Sapsan trains run. </p><h2>  Yaroslavsky </h2><p>  Located near <span>Leningradsky.</span>  <span>A white</span> building with turrets and a gray roof (after all, all these 3 stations in Moscow on Komsomolskaya are different from each other).  Suburban traffic here is the most developed, as it has several directions: Sergiev-Posad (Alexandrov), Monino, Krasnoarmeysk and others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the area of ​​3 stations in Moscow" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1180335.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Initially, this station was called North, because from here trains went only to the north.  Trains currently run to the following cities: </p><ul><li>  Abakan; </li><li>  Arkhangelsk; </li><li>  Vologda; </li><li>  to the cities of Siberia and the Far East <span>(Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk,</span> Blagoveshchensk, Vladivostok); </li><li>  Beijing, China); </li><li>  Kirov </li><li>  Kostroma. </li></ul><p>  Only a small list of cities is listed.  Despite the fact that there are so many directions, the long-distance following of the Yaroslavl station is not considered to be in demand in comparison with Leningradsky and Kazan. </p><h2>  Kazan </h2><p>  It is in great demand, especially in the summer.  Those who like to travel to the Black and Azov Seas have many routes open: Anapa, Adler, Novorossiysk and Yeysk.  There are directions towards other republics and countries: Ufa, Kazan, Nazran, Kislovodsk, Astana, Cheboksary and Vladikavkaz.  It is not surprising that the area of ​​3 stations in Moscow is a place where you can meet people of different nationalities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="3 stations in Moscow" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1180333.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Ryazan can be reached both by train and by train.  Double-decker trains run to Voronezh, Adler. </p><h2>  Platform Kalanchevskaya </h2><p>  If you go past the Leningrad station, you can see the railway bridge.  It is there that the Kalanchevskaya platform, or, as it is simply called, the Kalanchevka platform, is located.  Diverse is not only the area of ​​3 stations in Moscow, but also this station.  Why?  Because from here you can leave by commuter train to different parts of the Moscow Region: south, west, north.  Amazing  But it is here that the trains go, for example, from Odintsovo (Belarusian passage) towards Tsaritsyno (Kursk passage).  There are other directions.  But it must be borne in mind that these trains follow only in Moscow and the near Moscow suburbs. </p>
