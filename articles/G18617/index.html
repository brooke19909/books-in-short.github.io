The pearl of these places is a town called Kolymbia.  Despite its modest size, it has its own attractions.  From the time of the First World War until the nineteen forty-eighth year, Rhodes belonged to Italy.  And the town was founded just at a time when the Duce ruled.  It was called at that time San Benedetto and was built as a resort for recreation of high command.  Before <span>Benito Mussolini‚Äôs</span> arrival, an alley of eucalyptus trees brought from Australia was planted in the town.  There are no more fascists, Rhodes began to belong to Greece ... But the eucalyptus alley remained.  Ten minutes from this main and famous street in Kolymbia is the Kolymbia Sky 4 * hotel.  He will be discussed in this article.  The information for the description of the hotel we took mainly from the reviews of tourists who had recently rested there (in the summer of two thousand and sixteen). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kolymbia sky 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1542049.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location and surroundings </h2><p>  We have already mentioned the distance between the hotel and the center of the town.  Hotel Kolymbia Sky 4 * is located one hundred eighty meters from the pebble beach of Kolymbia.  You can get there in three minutes.  Diagoras International Airport is thirty kilometers from the hotel.  It will be easy to go on an independent excursion to the island's capital - the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Rhodes,</span> as well as to the old Lindos.  To both settlements from Kolymbia - twenty-five kilometers.  Finding a hotel is not a problem.  Not far from the bus stop stands a two-story snow-white building with a note sign.  Under the entrance arcade there is a beautiful staircase, supplemented by a ramp.  One hundred and fifty meters away is a sand and pebble beach.  It is believed that the hotel is on the first line.  Nearby there is a promenade that will lead to the famous eucalyptus alley with numerous Greek taverns and shops.  Near the hotel there is a supermarket "Zeus". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kolymbia Sky 4 (Rhodes" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1542052.jpg" width="600"></div>

Since then, repairs have been repeatedly carried out.  The last reconstruction took place in the spring and summer of 2016. In July, the hotel again opened its doors to guests.  Many tourists write that, having read old reviews, they were pleasantly surprised and even amazed at the transformed Kolimbia Sky.  Firstly, the hotel has increased in status (previously it was three-star).  The large area is a well-kept Mediterranean garden.  Green lawns with lush bushes of lavender and two pools have a relaxing holiday.  And lovers of active pastime are offered tennis courts.  The hotel consists of several two-story buildings, placed so that from most of the rooms, though not frontally, but by the edge, you can see the Aegean Sea.  The hotel also has parking, a playground and a mini market. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kolymbia skye" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1542050.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel allows its guests to decide how many meals to pay.  The color of the bracelet that you put on your hand when you check depends on this.  There is an opportunity to order All Inclusive.  Then all three main meals will be included.  A poolside bar and snack bar will also be at your disposal for free.  But there is one thing.  It will be too insulting if you do not see Rhodes.  After all, excursions take time and often capture the whole day, from morning to evening.  And you don‚Äôt want to skip the paid lunch ... That's why most tourists choose the type of <span>food HB</span> (breakfast and dinner).  At evening meals they give soup (several of its types).  Tourists say that you can change dinner for lunch if you wish.  But to do so often is not advised.  For dinner, the restaurant often hosts "Greek evenings" with live music.  And then the range of dishes is much wider.  But with HB (half board) drinks at lunch and dinner, even if it is mineral water, are paid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Kolymbia Sky 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1542051.jpg" width="600"></div>
