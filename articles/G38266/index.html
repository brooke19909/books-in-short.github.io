It stands on the shores of the Gulf of Finland, surrounded by nature, but nevertheless technologically equipped with man.  What interesting things can you learn about this northern town? </p><h2>  General facts </h2><p>  As already mentioned, in fact, Espoo is a suburb of the capital adjacent to the west.  Belongs to the Uusimaa region.  Helsinki is approximately 17 kilometers away.  The population of Espoo, according to the latest data, is 256.8 thousand inhabitants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Espoo Finland" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65853/2170102.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The city is a center of high technology and industry of the country, therefore it hosts many congresses.  Here are the headquarters of the largest Finnish oil companies, international industrial centers.  The number of organizations and firms per capita is maximum; here programmers and "techies" come together in search of work and find it.  True, housing is quite expensive.  But local residents and workers have very high-quality social security. </p><h2>  Historical excursion </h2><p>  The town takes its beginning in the 14th century.  Then it was more like a fragmented settlement, in which about one and a half thousand people lived.  Swedish settlers and Finnish hunters broke into farms and hunted with their crafts.  When a small cathedral was built on the territory, the settlement was considered a city, the official foundation date was 1458. Later, in the middle of the 16th century, a royal residence was built, which gave Espoo a higher status. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the Swedes were the pioneers, they gave the name of the city in honor of the aspen - aspen translation.  And the double “o” at the end indicated the proximity of the Esponyoki River, which was just surrounded by trembling trees.  Until the beginning of the 20th century, the main population of the largest city in Finland still consisted of Swedes, and in total there were about 9,000 people. </p><p>  The intensive development of Espoo began in the middle of the 20th century, when local politicians saw the full benefits of the situation: the capital is nearby, good conditions for agriculture, oil fields.  Progress did not stop at the status of a rich suburb; now the city has the largest budget and the most wealthy population. </p><h2>  Landscape </h2><p>  Espoo has a very unusual structure.  It consists of the districts of the administrative center of the same name: Espoon Keskus, Kiltakallo, Kirkkoyjarvi, Saarnirivio, Suna, Suvela and Tuomarila.  They contain most of the buildings of various corporations.  Also, the city includes the areas of Leppävara, Tapiola, Otaniemi and Kailaniemi adjacent to the south, the coastal Esponlahti and Mantikul and so on.  Many names, easy to get confused, but this is just the tip of the iceberg.  All parts are scattered between forests, shallow rivers and lakes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ​​in finland" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65853/2170094.jpg"></div>

Box houses, neat offices and parks.  Just a few skyscrapers that seem to residents of megalopolises as little ones.  Nevertheless, the main interest lies in the fragmentation, so the guest is not easy to navigate. </p><h2>  Pristine value </h2><p>  Between the centers of world technology companies, forests are quietly swaying and sources are noisy.  This unity with nature is typical of Finns, so the locals protect and carefully use their rich resources: cycling along the equipped paths, fishing, hiking trails, canoeing.  All this is located inside the Nuuksio National Park, whose employees ensure that they are environmentally friendly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Espoo city" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65853/2170093.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Any visitor is amazed at the cleanliness of forested areas.  Here you can glorify your body for the glory - breathe fresh air, walk and go for a run.  Go swimming or rowing.  Near the reserve, several health centers are equipped. </p><h2>  Mysterious place </h2><p>  Espoo became famous throughout the world for the tragic story that happened in 1960.  The most famous mystery for investigators and forensics is the murder on Lake Bodom, located in the city itself.  During a camping trip with an overnight stay in a tent, four schoolchildren were killed here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bodom lake" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65853/2170092.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The crime has not yet been solved, so history has generated many chilling urban legends.  The cruel event became the plot for the horror film, which is called - "Lake Bodom."  But no wonder they say that fear attracts.  Thousands of tourists come to the same place in the hope of finding some clues or just feel the adrenaline rush.  And this means that such a bloody stain did not become the reason for the notoriety of the city of Espoo, but, on the contrary, attracted attention. </p><h2>  Cultural and educational rest </h2><p>  Combine the enjoyment of nature is with educational activities.  For this, among the attractions of Espoo there are several museums: </p><ol><li>  EMMA is a museum of modern art, where you can see the world-famous Scandinavian sculptures.  Who knew that lovers of conceptual minimalism could produce such strange creations?  Compositions of stretched threads, large palms made of papier-mâché, sculptures of different colored rubbish ... And the presented paintings have plots in the style of "everyone sees and understands in their own way." <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="espoo attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65853/2170090.jpg"></div></li><li>  A fragment of real farm life - Talomuseo Glims.  Old Finnish household items are stored here, represented in houses, which are about 10 in the territory. The oldest was built in the 18th century.  Goats and sheep walk on the lawns, chickens run.  Barns for grain and milk have been preserved.  The exhibits themselves are exhibited on the premises, many of which function - in the museum you can grind coffee and flour with your own hands. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Espoo population" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65853/2170091.jpg"></div></li><li>  Haltia is a natural exhibition center built according to all the canons of environmental friendliness.  The exposition demonstrates all the charm of the Finnish flora and fauna, you can learn a lot about the inhabitants of the Nuuksio park.  And often environmental conferences and scientific events are held here.  Espoo in Finland is also an environmental center. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Espoo city" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65853/2170103.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Finally, it is worth mentioning a large selection of entertainment centers in the city of Espoo.  For example, Serena Water Park - a large open-air water park, slides of all kinds, pools and cafes with a buffet.  Great place to stay with children. </p><p>  Oittaa Recreation Center Park is located on the shore of a large lake - a vast area with a beach, many sports fields and a camping for hiking enthusiasts.  Here you can have a picnic, play team games or soak up the sauna.

A town in which it is easy to get lost, but it is certainly worth it! </p>
