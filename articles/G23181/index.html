It is such a beautiful state that it is impossible to take your eyes off.  How to get to the blue city in Morocco?  Photos and descriptions are presented in the article below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.heartmybackpack.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blue city in morocco photo" class="if uuid-2957191" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111875/2957191.jpg"></div><h2>  What is Chefchaouen? </h2><p>  The state of Morocco is located in the north of Africa.  The Moroccan coast is washed by the Atlantic Ocean.  But the most interesting thing that can be seen in this country is the so-called blue city.  This place of heavenly color is called Chefchaouen.  It is located in the mountains in northwestern Morocco.  It is considered the bluest city in the whole world, since the main number of houses in the city are painted in different shades of blue and blue.  Also, these houses are distinguished by their architecture - there are no other such houses around the world.  Chefchaouen is considered the most beautiful city in Morocco. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="35.168796" data-lng="-5.268364099999985" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/5/5/0/11550.png"></div><p>  It is worth mentioning how to get to the blue city in Morocco.  If by plane, then first you need to get to one of the cities: Fes, Casablanca or Rabat.  The same applies to trains and buses.  By car from the city of Fez go 199 km. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.omegatour.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blue city in morocco how to get" class="if uuid-2957194" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111875/2957194.jpg"></div><h2>  Why is he blue? </h2><p>  Everything that is possible is painted in blue color.  For example, roofs, doors, window frames, walls and even roads.  Probably, among the local population this color has some special meaning or is ritual.  Perhaps the Moroccans simply adore this color, or so they wanted to be different from other countries.  But still this beautiful blue spectacle very lures tourists.  Arriving in Morocco, they certainly want to walk along these blue streets with houses the color of the sky. </p><h2>  Capital hashish </h2><p>  Centuries ago, the blue city in Morocco was declared sacred.  Chefchaouen retained its medieval appearance as much as possible.  This city is very distinguished by its cleanliness.  There are no mountains of garbage, dirt and waste.  But the city‚Äôs biggest problem is marijuana plantations.  Because of this flaw, Chefchaouen has been nicknamed the "capital of hashish." </p><p>  Moroccan hash is very much appreciated in world markets.  But despite all this, many lovers come to the city, who among these blue walls declare their love for each other.  This has become a tradition, and all because Chefchaouen looks like an aquamarine gem, which is considered the talisman of love and fidelity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.demilked.com" data-author=": Claude Renault, "><img itemprop="image" alt="blue city in morocco" class="if uuid-2957195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111875/2957195.jpg"></div><h2>  What to see and buy? </h2><p>  The blue city in Morocco was founded in 1471.  Chefchaouen has become a haven for many Jews and Muslims who were expelled from Spain.  They really liked the Moroccan town, which became their second home.  The Blue City was a kind of shelter, which is protected by a mountain range on one side and high walls on the other.  The exiled peoples who arrived here began the arrangement of the city.  For Jews, for example, the color blue is sacred and in every way recalls God and heaven.  That is why in many houses of Chefchaouen such a color prevails. </p><p>  Another interesting fact is associated with the name of the city.  The name Chefchaouen translates as "look at the horns."  This is because the city is surrounded by two mountains that look like horns.  Most residents speak Spanish, as it was previously part of the Spanish colony. </p><p>  The most popular tourist item is goat cheese.  They say that it is very tasty, because here it is made according to a special master recipe. </p><p>  This town is also famous for locally made fabrics and carpets.  They are painted with special drawings and ornaments that you will not find in any other corner of the world. </p><p>  Time flies quickly and imperceptibly when you walk along these blue and blue streets.  Here at every step there are restaurants and cafes that are ready at any time to please visitors with their signature delicacies. </p><p>  Also in the city there are many interesting sights and architectural monuments, the inspection of which will bring a lot of impressions and true pleasure that will remain in your memory for a long time. </p><p>  There is another feature in Chefchaouen - it's people.  Locals are very friendly and talkative.  They will be happy to tell you everything and even give you an excursion. </p><p>  In general, life in the town is quiet and calm.  Here you forget about all the problems and worries, get rid of the tiredness and hardships of city life.  Chefchaouen is a city that is able to give an unforgettable, excellent bright blue vacation! </p>
