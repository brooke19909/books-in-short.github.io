Admiral Ushakov: biography and interesting facts from life</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  F.F.Ushakov - Admiral, one of those with whose name the formation of the Russian fleet is associated.  He played the same role in the development of the naval forces of the country, which was performed by Suvorov for the ground forces. </p><h2>  The beginning of life </h2><p>  <span>The biography of Admiral Ushakov</span> begins on February 13 according to the old style (February 24) 1745 in the village of Burnakovo, belonging to the Yaroslavl province.  His parents were nobles belonging to an ancient but impoverished family. </p><p>  Since childhood, Fedor Ushakov strove for the sea, so he joined the Naval Cadet Corps.  After graduation, he served in the Baltic Fleet, and three years later, along with other best officers, he was transferred to Azov on the Black Sea. </p><p>  The biography of Admiral Ushakov contains many glorious events that left a significant mark in Russian history.  First, he became one of the youngest officers entrusted with the leadership of the frigate, and later - the captain of the battleship Victor.  Ushakov actively participated in the construction of Sevastopol as the main point where the newly created Black Sea Fleet was based. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="biography of Admiral Ushakov" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23410/699366.jpg" width="459"></div>

    <p>  In 1785, he supervised the construction of ships in Kherson.  Here Ushakov received his first award - the Order of St. Vladimir, IV degree.  But he was awarded it not for military feats, but for successes in the fight against the plague epidemic in the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ushakov during the Russian-Turkish war </h2><p>  Ushakov‚Äôs naval abilities were first noticed and appreciated during the Russo-Turkish war.  He was not afraid to break the already existing traditions of naval combat.  Previously, ships moved only parallel to each other and fired at the enemy from the side.  But Ushakov did not adhere to these orders, he preferred to disrupt the formation of enemy ships, to make the flagship the main target.  Having incapacitated him, Ushakov sowed panic at the enemy who remained without command.  As a result, ships rushing about to loose, unable to maintain battle order, were defeated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ushakov Admiral" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23410/699360.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Like everything new, this tactic of naval combat also met with strong resistance from the fleet command.  But Ushakov‚Äôs brilliant victories convinced even the most stubborn opponents of the correctness of his actions.  This played a significant role in his appointment as squadron commander. </p><h2>  Success on the Black Sea </h2><p>  At this post, Ushakov again proved himself to be a competent naval commander.  At the island of Fidonisi, he managed to suppress the enemy‚Äôs coastal batteries with cannon fire of the advanced squad of ships, which was of great importance in the outcome of the battle.  This battle was the baptism of fire of the Sevastopol squadron and the first naval battle of the Russian-Turkish war of 1787-1792.  A successful start of hostilities instilled confidence in Russian naval officers and sailors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the time Ushakov became commander of the Black Sea Fleet, the admiral had earned respect even from the Turks, who began to call him Ushak Pasha.  Victories in the Battle of Kerch and the Battle of Tendra added military glory to the Russian fleet.  And in the battle of Kaliakria, the Turkish fleet was so sandwiched between the ships of Ushakov that they could not shoot because of the risk of falling into their own. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Admiral Ushakov Boulevard" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23410/699365.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  War in the mediterranean </h2><p>  Even more impressive victories were won by Fedor Fedorovich Ushakov in the Mediterranean during the war with France.  The Russian squadron liberated the Greek Ionian Islands, adhering to the tactics of shelling coastal fortifications and the subsequent landing.  In 1798, finally, the island of Corfu, which was considered impregnable, was conquered from the French.  These battles can be considered the starting point for the emergence of Russian naval landing. </p><p>  The Russian victory at Corfu was so brilliant that it made the legendary Suvorov regret that he did not participate in this battle! </p><p>  After the liberation, the first independent Greek state, the Republic of the Seven Islands, was created on the Ionian Islands.  Ushakov also took an active part in his political arrangement.  The admiral drafted the Constitution of the new state and achieved the conclusion of a treaty favorable to both Russia and the Greek government. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the Italian coast captured by the French, the Russian squadron again won impressive victories.  After it was not possible to keep Naples, the coastal fortresses were surrendered by the French command in order to avoid large casualties. </p><p>  In 1800, Ushakov's squadron returned with triumph to Sevastopol. </p><h2>  Ushakov's innovation in naval affairs </h2><p>  During these actions, the scheme developed by Ushakov for the joint actions of naval and land forces proved to be excellent.  Subsequently, all tactics textbooks wrote about her.  Maneuvers during sea battle were also developed in detail by Ushakov, who distributed the shelling objects and the route of each ship. </p><p>  Under him, mining of enemy ships was first applied.  This made it possible to bring discord and confusion into the ranks of the enemy, especially when the flagship was disabled at the very beginning of the battle.  After that, the remaining vessels of the enemy were destroyed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Admiral Ushakov movie" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23410/699368.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <p>  Ushakov is an admiral who developed a new training system for ship crews.  For the first time, it included shooting training and ground combat techniques.  These principles of training naval officers and sailors were preserved even with the advent of steam vessels. </p><p>  All of Ushakov‚Äôs tactical moves during naval battles held by him were studied by naval commanders in the following years.  Their significance and innovation was noted, for example, by the English admiral Nelson crowned with laurels.  By his own admission, he owed Ushakov his victories in the battle of Abukir and in the Battle of Trafalgar. </p><h2>  Retired </h2><p>  Unfortunately, all the merits of the illustrious admiral to Russia were forgotten as soon as he resigned and left the capital.  Even the naval department did not recall him.  But it was Ushakov who invested the most efforts in the creation and establishment of the combat-ready Black Sea Fleet. </p><p>  Admiral F.F.  Ushakov ended his life in October 1817 on his estate.  He was buried in a monastery near Temnikov.  A modest grave by the end of the century was already almost invisible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Admiral f. f. ears" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23410/699370.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <p>  In the last years of his life, the great naval commander led a modest and secluded life in the village of Alekseevka, was engaged in charity work.  He did not like to draw attention to his person.  And this, coupled with the efforts of enemies, caused the name F.F.  Ushakova was almost forgotten. </p><p>  Only in 1983, an armadillo named after Admiral Ushakov appeared in the Russian Navy. </p><h2>  The return of a glorious name </h2><p>  There was not a single lifetime portrait of the admiral, according to which one could imagine his appearance.  Oddly enough, his appearance was restored only in the 40s of the XX century.  Then a special commission established the exact burial place of Ushakov.  And the famous sculptor-anthropologist M.M.  Gerasimov, using his technique, reconstructed the appearance of the admiral from the skull.  According to the documents and memoirs of contemporaries preserved in the archives, the biography of Admiral Ushakov was restored. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the name of the famous naval commander was a symbol of the selfless struggle against the enemy for sailors.  In 1944, admiral Ushakov Awards were established.  Distinguished naval officers were awarded the order, which has two degrees.  And sailors for personal courage and heroism were awarded <span>the Ushakov medal.</span> </p><p>  In 1953, the director Mikhail Romm shot the artwork "Admiral Ushakov".  The film received well-deserved recognition by moviegoers, becoming a powerful means of patriotic education.  The role of Ushakov was played by the famous <span>Ivan Pereverzev.</span>  A wonderful play of actors, vivid battle scenes, fascinating historical events, amazing combined shooting - all this became the key to the success of the film. </p><h2>  Named Admiral </h2><p>  After the film was released, many objects bearing the name of Admiral Ushakov appeared on the screen.  Metro, streets, educational institutions, ships of the military, merchant and fishing fleet began to be called his name. </p><p>  Most of these memorable places in Sevastopol, a city closely associated with the name of the great naval commander.  Ushakov Square with a monument near the Sailor's Club is always crowded.  Next to the headquarters of the <span>Black Sea Fleet of Russia</span> is another sculpture of the admiral, created at the expense of sailors. </p><p>  It is symbolic that the Naval Academy, the graduate of which was the famous naval commander, is located on the promenade of his name.  And for her excellent work on training personnel, she was awarded the Order of Ushakov, I degree.  One of the bridges across the Neva is also named after the admiral. </p><p>  In Moscow there is Admiral Ushakov Boulevard, next to it is the metro station of the same name. </p><p>  In different cities of our country there are monuments to Ushakov, including in Saransk, in his homeland.  But his memory is also revered in Greece and Bulgaria, obliged to him by their liberation from the Turkish yoke.  Monuments were erected on the island of Corfu, where the Russian Week is held annually, and on <span>Cape Kaliakria.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Admiral Ushakov metro" class="if" height="439" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23410/699362.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Russian Orthodox Church canonized Ushakov and ranked them as saints.  The righteous warrior Theodore Sanaksarsky has been the patron saint of the Russian Navy since 2000, and since 2005, the strategic air force. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Admiral Ushakov metro" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23410/699367.jpg" width="600"></div>
