These houses, consisting of 4 or 5 floors, with a rather uncomfortable layout and a small kitchen and bathroom.  However, do not forget at what times the construction of these houses began.  In the 60s it was real happiness to get such a separate apartment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brick Khrushchev" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/1854728.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Life time </h2><p>  In total, there are two types of Khrushchev - panel and brick.  <span>Panel houses</span> were mainly built as temporary structures and had a service life of 25 years.  However, many of them still stand to this day, as these houses are constantly adding to their useful life. </p><p>  Brick buildings are stronger and more reliable; according to design data, such a house can stand for at least 50 years.  At the same time, many Khrushchevs made of bricks extended the life of up to 150 years.  Therefore, in the small cities of the country, such houses will stand for more than a decade, there is no plan for the demolition of these structures. </p><h2>  Short story </h2><p>  It is worth noting that such houses began to be built under Stalin, but in much smaller quantities.  The mass erection of these structures began with the coming to power of Nikita Sergeyevich, it was in honor of him that these houses are called Khrushchev. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The author of such inexpensive and small-sized houses was not the Party‚Äôs chief secretary and people close to him.  The government of the USSR borrowed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãinexpensive houses from the Frenchman Le Corbusier; it was this man who proposed in France to begin the construction of such small houses.  After all, this country was almost completely destroyed after the Second World War, and there was no money for the construction of high-quality houses. </p><p>  This idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa French architect in the USSR was made even more rational, so the construction of the Khrushchev began throughout the country.  And sometimes not only entire areas, but also entire cities were built up with such houses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khrushchev in Moscow" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/1854730.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Series of brick Khrushchev </h2><p>  There were a fairly large number of varieties of these houses.  All of them had some differences among themselves.  In total there are more than 20 series of Khrushchevs built of bricks.  They were built depending on a specific region, of the most popular series in the USSR it is worth highlighting the following: </p><ul><li>  1-447; </li><li>  1-464 (this house is the most popular in the territory of the former USSR); </li><li>  II-07-19; </li><li>  1-511. </li></ul><h2>  House series 1-511 </h2><p>  Today Khrushchev‚Äôs in Moscow can be seen quite often, this series is the most common in the capital, so it is advisable to talk about it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  These five-story buildings are present in almost every district of Moscow, their development was carried out for 10 years.  There are two options for modifications: early and late, but they differ only in a slight difference in the height of the ceiling and the quality of the brick. </p><p>  It is worth noting that, if we compare other brick Khrushchevs with 1-511, then in this series we used a better brick.  After all, houses were being built in the capital of a great state.  As for the layout, everything here is the same as in the rest of the houses: <span>walk-through rooms, a</span> small kitchen and a bathroom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brick houses of Khrushchev" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/1854733.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Will the <span>Khrushchev demolish</span> in Moscow </h2><p>  Almost all Khrushchevs in the capital have a series of 1-511 and will not be demolished, since they are still in fairly good condition and can last for more than a decade.  There are only a few structures of this model that fall under demolition, but they are already in an emergency. </p><p>  Regarding the question of whether the brick Khrushchev will be demolished or not, it is quite difficult to unequivocally answer.  In April 2017, the mayor of the capital of Russia announced that they would not demolish strong houses.  Only those five-story buildings that are in unsatisfactory condition fall under demolition. </p><p>  Some buildings will remain as they are at the moment, and local authorities plan to reconstruct and add storeys to some of the houses.  The strongest structures will become taller; it is planned to build elevator assemblies in them.  Therefore, part of the brick buildings will become modern houses, with new and better apartments.  Residents of lower floors will be able to redevelop brick Khrushchev. </p><h2>  Redevelopment of a two-room apartment </h2><p>  Almost all brick Khrushchev have adjacent rooms.  One room is still not bad, but the second is very narrow, where even a large bed does not always fit.  In the vast majority of cases, such houses are suitable for redevelopment, since the apartment has practically no load-bearing walls.  However, before this procedure, you must always consult which walls can be destroyed and which cannot.  Otherwise, there can be very big problems with the construction. </p><p>  Usually in Khrushchev‚Äôs there is a sedentary bath, as the usual one does not fit.  Therefore, the owner of such an apartment is faced with the task of increasing the space so that it is convenient to live here.  The following photo shows the standard redevelopment of brick Khrushchev. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="redevelopment of the Khrushchev brick" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/1854757.jpg" width="588"></div>

    <p>  As you can see, the wall between the kitchen and the living room was demolished, due to which there was an extra area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe kitchen area, while the living room also became larger and more modern.  The living room with the help of sliding doors was separated, and a small working area was obtained.  In the bathroom, you can put a corner bathroom, which will take up a little less space, but at the same time it will be full, and not sitting.  As for the washing machine, it is often placed in brick Khrushchev under a washbasin.  Or you can purchase a built-in model and mount it in the kitchen. </p><p>  In the room where the bedroom is located, there is a small pantry.  After redevelopment, this space was increased, and the dressing room turned out.  The bedroom itself has lost some area, but now there is no need to place a closet, and the room has become more square, rather than long and narrow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brick Khrushchev will demolish" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/1854734.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Brick houses of Khrushchev in the capital of Russia are demolished, but only those that have an emergency or unsatisfactory condition.  Therefore, if you intend to purchase an apartment in such a structure, it should be understood that most of the five-story buildings are not planned for demolition in the near future. </p><p>  According to the policy of the city authorities, Khrushchev‚Äôs erected from panels that have already served their time are being massively demolished. </p>
