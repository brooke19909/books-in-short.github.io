Ruka (Finland) - prices and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Winter resort Ruka (Finland) - the most visited place by domestic tourists in Lapland.  It is located only a few tens of kilometers from the Arctic Circle and is most often referred to even by the Finns as the ‚ÄúGolden Gates of Lapland‚Äù.  For over 60 years, this ski resort has been gathering millions of tourists on its territory, many of whom are our countrymen.  About how to get there, how remarkable this place is, as well as many other nuances, read below in the article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hand finland" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/369478.jpg" width="410"></div>

    <h2>  Keep the path to the Arctic Circle </h2><p>  Most often, the departure is from <span>Moscow airport,</span> from where the plane flies to Helsinki.  Then change to a domestic flight in Finland, which will take you to the city of Kuusamo.  This is the nearest metropolis, so to speak, which is located not far from the resort we need.  The flight will take you less than an hour and a half, after which you can take a taxi or bus to the recreation area called Ruka.  Finland is a small country, so the flight from the capital to the Arctic Circle will take you less than an hour and a half.  There is also another way that lies through the Northern Capital.  A train starts from St. Petersburg, which moves through Kandalaksha (a town in the Murmansk region).  Buses to the city of Salla already regularly run from there, and from this point you need to change to public transport, which will take you to the right place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hand finland map" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/369477.jpg?1396934997542" width="600"></div>

For beginners and amateurs, eastern tracks are ideal.  In their structure, they are quite extensive, but at the same time not too steep and complex.  Nevertheless, in ski areas such as Pessary and Saarua, even professionals can practice.  As for the Western region, the routes for descents here are also very long, but at the same time they are quite steep and complex.  Most often, professionals ride here, and only aces of skiing can conquer some of the slopes.  Also, all the tourists who visited the western slopes note that their relief is too unusual and interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="resort in finland hand" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/369475.jpg?1396935018376" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of mountain slopes in Lapland </h2><p>  In addition to the unique natural relief, the recreation area Ruka (Finland) is also characterized by the most modern equipment.  For the attention of tourists there will be presented 16 tracks lit during the day, on which both beginners and professionals can ride.  Along with them slopes for children are equipped, as well as <span>cross-country skiing tracks.</span>  In the vastness of this resort, lovers of snowboarding will also find entertainment to their liking.  For them, there are always open rails, various jumps, a track for border cross-country and much more.  But the most outstanding attraction of Lapland in this area is the freestyle center, which is a 225-meter long mogul route.  The maximum height difference here is 106 meters, so you definitely will not have to lose heart due to a lack of adrenaline.  Of course, comfortable lifts work on all slopes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resort hand finland reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/369474.jpg?1396935039746" width="600"></div>

A map of this recreation area shows you in detail each path that leads to the hotel, shop, spa and other amenities of the resort.  It is worth noting that in this area contains a lot of sports clubs where you can play golf, tennis, volleyball, basketball.  There are also entertainment complexes with billiards, swimming pools, a sauna and a jacuzzi, as well as many other delights.  Especially for tourists who travel with children, a kindergarten was organized here.  The teachers, however, only speak Finnish, English or German, but the child will not be bored there for sure. </p><h2>  Climate and high season </h2><p>  Ski resort Ruka (Finland, reviews of which have already been left by millions of domestic tourists) receive tourists from October to June.  The largest influx here can be traced, of course, on New Year's Eve, as well as during the Christmas and Epiphany holidays.  After that, people begin to gather again in the Polar zone at the end of February and prefer to ride here until the end of April.  It is worth noting that in the summer and early autumn, the winter resort of Ruka (Finland) does not function, since the air temperature in this area rises above 15 degrees Celsius.  Snow does not come down from the peaks, but under such conditions any winter ammunition will be a burden and a hindrance for a full descent from the mountain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hand finland prices" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/369473.jpg?1396935059248" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of payment for holidays in the polar resort of Ruka </h2><p>  Finland, whose vacation prices have always pleased Russian tourists, nowadays does not cease to be replete with discounts and advantageous offers.  However, going there, remember that payment is primarily made for ski passes.  In fact, this is your subscription to the slopes from the mountain slopes, which can be purchased on the spot, or can be included in the price of the ticket.  The ski pass determines the time you can spend in total in the mountainous area.  It is issued both hourly and daily.  Therefore, most often ski passes cover the entire period of rest, and their cost in this case ranges from 200 Euros.  Prices for rental real estate here are also diverse.  You can rent a one-room junior suite for 300-400 euros per day, but most often people prefer to relax in cottages, the cost of which starts from 1000 Euro and ends with 5000 and above. </p><h2>  Short afterword </h2><p>  In the vastness of Lapland, vacation will be a huge pleasure for both kids and adults.  Walking on a sleigh harnessed by huskies or real reindeers, ‚Äúpokatushki‚Äù on snowmobiles and snowmobiles, visits to ice mini-museums, as well as many other winter and truly fabulous entertainments await you in the resort of Ruka.  Finland is a country of winter colors, which is certainly worth seeing you with at least one eye and at least a couple of days. </p>
