    <h2>  What is a medical policy? </h2><p>  The first step is to figure out what kind of document is in question.  Yes, compulsory health insurance is a paper that everyone is hearing.  But what is it for?  And what is it? </p><p>  Honey.  policy is a small document issued by an insurance company.  It allows you to receive free medical care in various institutions.  It indicates the citizen's account number, which is assigned to him when contacting the insurance company, as well as the initials of the owner.  Here you can see when the paper expires.  But now the medical policy has several interpretations.  You can use an old-style document, or you can use a new one.  What is the difference between these two options? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  New sample </h2><p>  You are interested in honey.  a new model policy?  Where to get it, are you also trying to find out?  Want to figure out how it differs from a regular document that allows you to get free medical care in various institutions?  Understanding all this is not as difficult as it seems. </p><p>  The fact is that a new medical policy is an electronic representation of this document.  Previously, as already mentioned, it was a small paper carrier.  But progress does not stand still.  And now the compulsory health insurance policy is an electronic card.  It is somewhat reminiscent of bank plastic.  The card will contain information about the owner.  It works the same way as paper.  Only a similar document is more convenient to carry with you.  This policy has its pros and cons.  Which ones? </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Begin with the positive aspects.  After all, for something, a new model of medical policy was invented!  Of course, for the convenience of patients.  Paper media are slowly becoming obsolete.  Instead of passports, universal personal cards come.  Insurance companies act in a similar way - they develop and issue an electronic form of documents that would be convenient for customers.  Among the advantages are: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Durability.  Now a compulsory medical policy will not be damaged.  To bring the card into disrepair, you should try hard. </li><li>  Compactness.  It has already been said that the document in appearance resembles an ordinary bank card.  So, wearing it will be convenient.  You can always take a policy with you. </li><li>  Information processing speed is another plus.  With the transition to electronic medical documents, the processing time of information received from papers is reduced. </li></ol><p>  These are far from all the advantages of the document under study.  But the main positive points are now known.  What disadvantages should I look for before agreeing to a card? </p>

    <h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  The downside of this medical policy is only one.  Not everywhere and not always can it be obtained.  This also includes the fact that not every medical institution is ready to serve a client with this card.  According to the law, they cannot refuse a citizen, but in practice things are different.  For this reason, many still do not want to draw up such documents.  Nothing wrong with that.  I want to take honey.  a new model policy?  Where to get it?  The answer to this question is simple and simple.  Citizens themselves have the right to choose where to apply for this document. </p><h2>  Where to get? </h2><p>  But what scenarios will they be offered?  Now you can change or initially get a medical policy (both new and old) in several ways: by contacting an insurance company or the IFC.  Citizens themselves have the right to choose.  Typically, multifunctional centers are used solely to replace documents.  But the initial receipt remains with insurance companies.  Who is entitled to the document? </p>

    <h2>  To whom are they issuing? </h2><p>  Replacing honey.  a policy or its primary receipt is a process that is familiar to many.  But who is entitled to this document?  Now they can apply for it: </p><ol><li>  All able-bodied and disabled adult citizens of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Children. </li><li>  Foreign citizens who permanently reside in Russia. </li><li>  Stateless people living in the Russian Federation. </li></ol><p>  All of the above categories of people can optionally receive a new type of medical policies.  Or order the old type.  Now, as practice shows, along with the latter type of issue electronic cards.  Therefore, intentionally it is not necessary to ask the insurance company to draw up a document of this type. </p><h2>  How to apply for an adult? </h2><p>  It took me honey.  policy?  Moscow or any other city - it does not matter where the citizen lives.  It is necessary to know not only where to apply for the document being studied, but also to figure out what exactly they need to present when applying.  Adults can exchange or receive the primary policy by submitting the following documents to the MFC or insurance company: passports of a citizen of the Russian Federation, applications for issuing a policy, SNILS.  If we are talking about foreign citizens, then they must bring almost the same papers to the relevant authorities.  We are talking about a passport, an application (usually completed on the spot), SNILS, a document that indicates a residence permit. </p>
