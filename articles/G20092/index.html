In the city on the Yenisei, there are many attractions known throughout the country and abroad: the Paraskeva Pyatnitsa Chapel and the Communal Bridge depicted on a ten-ruble note, the Tsar Fish monument from the work of Viktor Petrovich Astafiev, the unique Pillars Nature Reserve, the Botanical Garden, and the Museum- the estate of the artist V. I. Surikov ... The new building of the railway station, built relatively recently - in 2004, also belongs to local beauties.  And how did the Krasnoyarsk railway appear? </p><h2>  From the history </h2><p>  The history of the Krasnoyarsk railway is very exciting.  Despite the fact that it has been functioning as a separate unit since 1979, the path through the city arose more than a hundred years ago - at the end of the nineteenth century.  In 2017, he celebrates his 118th birthday. </p>

    <p>  The Krasnoyarsk Railway is the center of the Trans-Siberian Railway, passing through almost the entire country.  At first, communication appeared only with Novosibirsk (then it was Novonikolaevsky), since in Krasnoyarsk a bridge was still being built across the Yenisei, which would connect the left and right banks.  In 1899, trains began to run to Irkutsk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Unfortunately, the old photos of the Krasnoyarsk railway have not survived to this day, however, there are pictures of the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway - and this is practically the same thing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnoyarsk railway" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/1942646.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This route was then called the Middle Siberian and passed no more than six trains per day.  However, at the end of the same year it was united with the West Siberian route.  Throughput increased, and the road was called simply Siberian. </p><p>  In 1915, several independent roads were allocated from its structure, in particular, Tomsk (the current Krasnoyarsk route belonged there).  After almost twenty years, a separate East Siberian Railway was formed from the Tomsk Railway, from which the Krasnoyarsk Railway left in 1936. </p>

    <p>  But what about in 1936, if at the beginning of the article it is spoken of its autonomous existence since 1979?  Nevertheless, all is true.  For the first time, it began to function separately in that period - and lasted until 1961.  During this time, plots connecting Novokuznetsk and Abakan, Achinsk and Lesosibirsk were built, a connection with Abaza appeared.  But in 1961, the Krasnoyarsk Railway was again included in the East Siberian Railway for 18 years.  When, finally, the Krasnoyarsk railway regained its independence, the quantity of goods immediately increased.  Organization of transportation has also improved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today, the Krasnoyarsk railway consists of three branches - Krasnoyarsk, Achinsky and Abakansky, and its head has been Vladimir Reingardt for more than ten years.  Since the end of 2004, the new station building has been operating, which is recognized as one of the best and most convenient in the Trans-Urals.  Each year, the Krasnoyarsk Railway increases transportation rates. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The Krasnoyarsk railway has 179 stations, large and small, on its way.  The largest is Krasnoyarsk, the sorting one is Krasnoyarsk-Vostochny in the Berezovsky district of the region.  She is one of the main sorting stations in the country.  Interestingly, according to its principle, other sorting stations in Russia were later created. </p><p>  The length of the entire Krasnoyarsk railway is more than three thousand kilometers.  17 tunnels of various lengths, a thousand-odd bridges and viaducts were built along the entire route of its passage, and the number of its employees is striking in its number - 28 thousand 950 people! </p><h2>  What's so special? </h2><p>  Although the Krasnoyarsk railway is not one of the largest in length, it is quite unique in its kind.  To begin with, the road is called Krasnoyarsk, and, in addition to its own, passes through as many as three Russian regions - the Republic of Khakassia, Irkutsk and Kemerovo!  The scheme of the Krasnoyarsk railway looks like a florid scattering of branches passing through tiny stations of the region and looking into neighboring areas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scheme of the Krasnoyarsk railway" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47310/1944821.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Since Krasnoyarsk lies in the very center of the country, the railway of this region connects the West Siberian Railway with the East Siberian Railway, covering territories with vast forest, metallurgical or energy reserves.  The Krasnoyarsk Territory is rich in various resources, minerals, a rather large number of various products are produced here, and all the cargo is delivered through the Krasnoyarsk Railway.  In terms of transportation, it is among the leading. </p><h2>  In the war years </h2><p>  In the difficult years of World War II, everyone had a hard time.  The Krasnoyarsk railway released 16-18 thousand of its employees to the front.  Women began to work instead.  Together with the remaining men, they performed a huge amount of work - for example, the evacuation of plants and factories from the west.  Non-lifting multi-ton machines were removed from the platforms manually.  Mines and shells were created, as well as special trains - "Sergo Ordzhonikidze": sanitary or tank repair.  One such locomotive stands today on the forecourt of Krasnoyarsk. </p><h2>  You can be proud of it </h2><p>  It is not enough to be already built a network with a debugged mode of operation.  Even on the railway, there is always room for development.  For example, for the purpose of economic development of the rich northern territories of Siberia, it is planned to build the North-Siberian Railway, which will pass through Lesosibirsk - a small town near Krasnoyarsk. </p><p>  For five years now, the City Electric Train project has been operating in Krasnoyarsk - an extra opportunity for residents to conveniently and without traffic jams get to their business.  It provides not only the movement of electric trains in Krasnoyarsk, but also the repair of passenger platforms.  By the <span>Winter Universiade of</span> 2019, it is also planned to build new platforms, so that everyone can safely get to the place of the Games.  And residents can follow the arrival of trains online. </p><p>  That is what is not on the Krasnoyarsk railway, is a direct train to St. Petersburg.  However, this oversight is slowly being eliminated - for example, a children's train was launched to the Northern capital.  And for adults (well, of course, for children too) now there is a tourist route to Divnogorsk - a small town 20 kilometers from Krasnoyarsk.  He is interesting because he stops in the village of Ovsyanka - the birthplace of the great writer Viktor Petrovich Astafyev.  Having come down on this platform, everyone can go to his house-museum and learn more about the life and work of the famous countryman. </p>

    <h2>  Museum is interesting! </h2><p>  For all who care about the Krasnoyarsk Railway, there is a museum of its history, where you can hear various facts, see unusual exhibits and exclusive documents.  It has been operating since 1987.  There is even an office of the chief of the station of the nineteenth century!  There are six halls in the museum.  It is located in the city center, not far from the Krasnoyarsk Railway Administration, at 101 Mira Avenue. </p><p>  This railway is unique in its own way, it can also be considered a landmark of the region, and the Krasnoyarsk people, at least, must know about it, the more, the better! </p>
