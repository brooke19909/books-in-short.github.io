They are ideal tools for quick cooking.  Due to the wide range of predefined user modes, these machines require minimal supervision, or do without it at all, which makes them ideal multifunctional kitchen equipment for both beginners and professional chefs. </p><p>  Most kitchens have different tools and fixtures that perform highly specialized tasks, but an egg machine will only cook eggs, a yogurt maker only yogurt and a juicer only juice.  It is here that the genius and beauty of the multicooker is manifested.  This <span>kitchen appliance is</span> designed to perform various culinary tasks, and is often able to perform them simultaneously. </p><p>  This review presents the most high-performance, efficient and durable models available on the market today, as well as useful tips on how to choose a multicooker. </p><h2>  Benefits of Owning </h2><p>  Slow cookers are extremely useful both for crowded parties, and for quickly preparing meals for one person.  Below are the key benefits of using these versatile kitchen processors: </p><ul><li>  The timer virtually eliminates food spoilage during cooking. </li><li>  Slow cookers do not require oil, making food more healthy. </li><li>  Food stores more minerals and vitamins, which are easily destroyed by traditional cooking methods. </li><li>  Special dishes cook 5 times faster than traditional dishes. </li><li>  <span>Multifunctional kitchen processors</span> save space.  If you choose the multicooker correctly, then it will replace several single-purpose blocks. </li><li>  These devices prepare fresh and healthy dishes. </li><li>  Ideal for busy people who need to simultaneously perform several tasks, as well as those who live in small apartments with limited space for storing dishes and cooking. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Redmond RMC-M4502" class="if uuid-2295896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2295896.jpg"></div><p>  What to choose a crock-pot for home?  Expert advice recommends taking into account the following characteristics: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The power required for efficient operation, heating and cooking. </li><li>  Volume.  To choose the multicooker correctly, you need to make sure that its capacity is sufficient to cook 2-3 dishes at a time. </li><li>  Strength of materials.  The materials used in the construction should provide greater resistance to physical damage. </li><li>  The presence of cooking modes (programs) and additional functions that satisfy the preferences of the user. </li><li>  Pressure.  Changing this parameter affects the cooking time. </li></ul><h2>  Slow Cooker Basics </h2><p>  The power of the device determines the capabilities and, most importantly, the speed of cooking.  Typically, 450‚Äì1600-watt models are available.  The higher the power consumption, the more productive the machine. </p><p>  To select a multicooker according to the power parameter, it is necessary to find out the estimated frequency of its use.  For example, those who use this kitchen appliance daily need at least 900 watts of power, and those who rarely cook need 500 watts or less. </p><h2>  Tank size </h2><p>  The amount of food that can be cooked at a time depends on the volume of the multicooker.  This indicator usually varies from 2 to 6 liters. </p><p>  Before choosing a multicooker for the home, you need to decide on the volume of the prepared food.  For average needs, a 4.5-liter capacity is enough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thespruce.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="T-fal RK705851" class="if uuid-2295850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2295850.jpg"></div><h2>  Multifunctionality </h2><p>  Since devices of this type perform more than one function, it is recommended to choose a multicooker model with a large number of operating modes or programs.  Each of them is designed for a specific cooking method, from steaming and baking to such specific tasks as cutting, kneading and whipping. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most devices support at least 3 modes of operation, while more complex devices support 12 or more.  This amount directly corresponds to the number of cooking options available. </p><h2>  How to choose a multicooker: useful tips </h2><p>  If necessary, you can find a model that supports the following functionality: </p><ul><li>  Timer.  Provides functions such as setting the cooking time or delayed start.  The latter allows you to set the time when the device starts working and turns off. </li><li>  Steam removal.  Some multicookers are equipped with steam valves designed to gently release steam during and after cooking, providing greater safety when working with the device. </li><li>  The mode of heating and reheating already cooked dishes. </li></ul><p>  Typically, additional features are: </p><ul><li>  Support for various modes, including steaming, boiling, frying, stewing, chopping, etc. </li><li>  Accessories needed for weighing, kneading, whipping, steaming, grinding, etc. </li><li>  Different cooking speeds for different cooking methods. </li></ul><h2>  Operating modes </h2><p>  In addition to price, design and other important features, another important consideration is the number of culinary functions offered by the multicooker.  How to choose a model for this criterion?  Below are the most popular cooking methods that are implemented in most multicookers. </p><h2>  Slow cooking </h2><p>  For users who are not sure which multicooker to choose for their home, expert advice recommends that you have a slow cooker mode.  This function allows you to cook at the touch of a button and does not require constant monitoring.  For example, to cook meat, just place it in a slow cooker with the right amount of liquid and seasoning and set a timer.  In the same way, you can cook vegetables and other products that require two or more hours of heat treatment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.polaru.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Polaris PMC 0507d kitchen" class="if uuid-2296668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2296668.jpg"></div><h2>  Pressure cooker </h2><p>  This type of cookware has always been popular for the amenities it offers, especially among busy people and large families.  In the pressure cooker mode, dishes are cooked faster than with traditional methods.  In this case, there is no need to have a separate pan.  The low pressure setting should be used for light vegetable dishes, and high - for dense foods such as meat. </p><h2>  Rice cooking </h2><p>  Many models include this feature as automatic.  Before choosing a multicooker for the home, you need to make sure that it supports this mode of operation, so that the purchased device can best meet the needs of the user.  Rice cooker saves time and energy, as it allows you to cook rice at the same time as cooking another 1-2 dishes. </p><h2>  Double boiler </h2><p>  Steaming is advisable for almost any dish, and some prefer this method because of its obvious health benefits.  Unlike traditional boiling and frying, steaming saves more nutrients, and also does not require oil.  In this mode, along with cooking rice or other products, you can cook healthy dishes for the whole family.  That is why, before choosing a multicooker, user tips recommend making sure that this mode of operation exists. </p><h2>  Passing </h2><p>  Many owners find this mode very convenient.
