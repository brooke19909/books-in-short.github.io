    <p>  In 1861, in the United States, as a result of increasing political and economic differences between the South, where the slave system reigned, and the North, where capitalist society developed, a <span>civil war broke out.</span> </p><p>  The US Civil War takes its prerequisites back in the fifties of the nineteenth century, when a <span>revolutionary situation</span> began to arise in the country <span>.</span>  It was then that it became apparent that an armed clash between the two systems was inevitable, since slavery greatly impeded the development of capitalism in the United States, so it was necessary to eradicate it.  Thus, the conflict in Kansas (1854-1856), the uprising of J. Brown (1859), the anti-slavery movement were evidence of the approaching military conflict.  Thus, the <span>causes of the American Civil War</span> <strong> </strong>  were explicit. </p><p>  Already in 1860, A. Lincoln became president of the country, which meant the loss of power for the democratic party, which was influenced by slave owners.  That is why they announced the withdrawal of the southern states from the Union and began to prepare for war. </p><p>  In the winter of 1861, a Confederation was created <span>in Alabama</span> , which included eleven out of thirty-four states.  In the spring of the same year, the Confederation raised a riot and seized all the arsenals located in the South, where almost the entire arsenal of weapons and ammunition was located. </p><p>  The American Civil War was centered on a vast territory.  So, in the North and West it was limited to rivers, in the East to the Atlantic Ocean and in the South to the Gulf of Mexico. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The north of the country had a population of twenty-two million people and had on its territory metallurgical, weapons and textile plants.  Whereas the South totaled nine million people, four of whom were slaves.  At the same time, most of the population did not support the rebels, and there was no necessary economic base for conducting military operations.  Almost all actions took place in the areas of railways and rivers. </p><p>  US Civil War, in particular its plan <strong> </strong>  from the South, was counted on the support from France and Great Britain.  So, it was planned to seize the <span>states of Virginia,</span> Tennessee and Missouri, after which it was Washington itself, and force the government to accept their conditions.  The plans of the North were defensive in nature, and only then it was planned to launch an offensive. </p><p>  The first stage of hostilities (1861-1862 gg.).  The north of the states has known many defeats.  The fighting took place in one direction - Washington-Richmond.  In the north, the Anaconda plan was developed, according to which an army and navy were created around the states of the South, which were supposed to crush the uprising.  During this period, the northerners managed to block the southern ports, this deprived the rebels of communication with France and Great Britain. </p><p>  The second period of hostilities (1863-1865 gg.).  In the spring, the North was defeated in the battle of Chancellorsville.  But after that, a turning point came in the war.  In the summer, the <span>southern army</span> suffered a rather severe defeat, the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Confederation was divided into two parts. </p><p>  US Civil War <strong> </strong>  acquired maneuverable character from the North (1864-1865 gg.).  The offensive of the northern troops began in the spring.  The revolutionary actions of the North contributed to the complete defeat of the enemy.  Thus, A. Lincoln was able to gain respect and authority among the American population, and when he was killed four years later, it was a huge loss for the country. </p><p>  It should be said that the US Civil War <strong> </strong>  unfolded due to the intentions of the South to extend the slave system to all states and to <span>South America.</span>  It was an expensive and bloody war, but it went down in history as an event that had great revolutionary significance for the country.  In addition, she contributed to the development of the military industry and the armored fleet. </p>
