The official date of its foundation is 1795.  Initially, the settlement had the status of an outpost, and later turned into a center of cultural and economic life in the northwestern part of the country.  Two years ago, it was included in the list of the most interesting megacities, which are recommended to be visited in the summer. </p><p>  At the same time, Edmonton (Canada) can not be called a tourist mecca of the country.  But on its territory there are a huge number of museums and art galleries, some of them are known far beyond the region.  Unlimited opportunities for profitable and enjoyable shopping are offered by shopping alleys and the West Edmonton Mall. </p>

    <p>  The local air terminal accepts passenger aircraft arriving from Europe and North America.  Its runways are ten kilometers away from the city.  The airport is not served by public transport.  Instead, a special transfer operates, the route of which ends in the heart of the city.  The cost of a trip to Edmonton (Canada) is 15 CAD.  Taxi services are four times more expensive. </p><p>  You can get to these parts by bus.  The local bus station receives flights from Calgary, McMurray, Red Deer and other towns in the province. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Traveling to Alberta by long-distance train is not a cheap pleasure.  However, the high quality service, traditional for the local railway, more than pays for all the additional costs. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  Edmonton (Canada) occupies a territory that is dominated by a continental climate.  Winter and summer in these places are as pronounced as in other parts of the country, but milder.  The first warm spring days come to the region in May.  Moreover, right up to the middle of June, meteorologists do not rule out a sharp cooling.  Hot summer comes to naught in the second half of September. </p><p>  Weather in Edmonton (Canada) pampers citizens with sultry July nights.  During this period, the readings of the daily air temperature sometimes exceed 30 ¬∞ .  As in the north of the continent, the humidity level in Alberta is relatively low.  In October, the thermometer bars drop below 10 ¬∞ C.  January and February are the windiest months, but not as cold as in other provinces. </p><h2>  Museums and Attractions </h2><p>  Immerse yourself in the history of the region and find out how Edmonton (Canada) developed by visiting the local museum.  It is called Fort Edmonton Park.  In addition to traditional exhibitions, guests can watch costumes and theatrical performances.  It takes several hours to hike at the Royal Alberta Museum.  In addition, it is worth visiting exhibitions on oil production and telephone sets. </p>

    <p>  Elk Island National Park invites you to look into the world of flora and fauna of the Arctic latitudes.  Just an hour away by car - and you are there.  Visitors can not only enjoy plenty of bears, wolves and deer, but also with a breeze ride a ski, play a game of golf or go canoeing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Events </h2><p>  The city of Edmonton (Canada) has become home to many music festivals.  Alberta hosts about thirty different competitions throughout the year.  Fringe is the largest of them.  Every year he attracts about 500 thousand music lovers to the region. </p><p>  Organizers of Culture Days and Taste of Edmonton offer to participate in open-air tastings.  Owners of forty eateries and restaurants of the administrative center take their culinary masterpieces to the audience. </p><p>  Symphony Under the Sky Symphony Song Festival is held at the height of the summer season.  It is followed by another musical event, Edmonton Folk Music.  It is dedicated to the work of folk song performers. </p><h2>  City's legends </h2><p>  The calling card of the capital of Alberta is the building that houses the Provincial Legislature today.  It occupies the place on which the fort was located until the beginning of the 20th century.  Open and free, traditional and at the same time modern - this is the current Edmonton (Canada).  Photos are the best proof of this. </p>

    <p>  The ancient Saskatchewan River divides the city into two parts, which are connected by a multi-level bridge.  The water in its channel never heats up, so they do not bathe in it even in the hottest summer hours.  It originates high in the mountains and is of glacial origin. </p><p>  Another tourist attraction and a reason for pride of the locals is the old tram, which was brought to Edmonton from distant Australia.  His age has long exceeded the fifty-year milestone.  The train follows Jasper Avenue, winding through the streets of Down Town.  Throughout his journey, information signs are constantly being seen that tell the history of the city. </p>

    <h2>  Chinatown </h2><p>  Edmonton also has its own Chinatown.  It is a few minutes leisurely walk from the main highway.  Its main attraction is Harbin Gate.  The skeletons of the buildings are guarded by giant stone lions.  One curious belief is connected with them: if you stroke the ball that is in the mouth of the animal, the most cherished desire will come true. </p>
