    <p>  Very close to the Playa de Oro Park 3 * hotel (Costa Dorada) there is a small secluded beach where guests can relax.  The advantage of this place, of course, is the isolation and absence of a large number of vacationers.  But here it is not too convenient, since the descent into the sea is steep, rocky. </p><p>  That is why guests prefer to go down to the public beach, which is completely covered with golden soft sand.  A convenient staircase leads to it.  You can relax and swim here for free, but you will have to fork out for umbrellas, sunbeds and towels.  By the way, on the beach there are changing cabins and showers, which is very convenient. </p><p>  As on any other coast, tourists are offered a lot of ways to have fun.  Starting from beach volleyball and catamarans and ending with a boat trip or water skiing. </p><h2>  Conditions for staying with children </h2>
