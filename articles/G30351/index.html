    <p>  It so happened that in St. Petersburg a huge number of parks and other works of art received the names of wealthy merchants or wealthy landowners.  Shuvalovsky park is no exception.  He acquired a name from Ivan Shuvalov, who received such a large land allotment during the distribution of titles. </p><p>  Despite such a generous gift at that time (an excellent forest-park zone of more than a hundred hectares in size), the Count was not particularly concerned with his newly made possessions.  He did not have children, but only for himself he did not want to try. </p><p>  Only after a certain time (after the death of the Earl of the land passed to his nephew, who also did not show special initiative in relation to the gift), the park eventually became the property of an enterprising Frenchman.  He became the first owner of these lands not only on paper. </p><p>  But Polje (that was the name of this active Frenchman) also did not live very long, although from his filing the woman, widowed a second time, took up sketches of this park and decided to order the construction of a memorial crypt.  The project was handled by the brother of the famous architect Bryullov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Petersburg shuvalovsky park" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/210894.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the erection of the memorial, a church near the church grew; later it was consecrated, having received a name in honor of Ap.  Peter and Paul. </p><p>  But besides the aforementioned crypt, there are other unique sights.  Shuvalovsky park is very rich in them.  Take at least the famous Vorontsov-Dashkov Palace.  It so happened that to evaluate all the splendor of this building did not work due to the collapse of work.  They did not have time to organize the interior decoration of the premises, since the revolution prevented. </p><p>  At the moment, the room is not empty.  It works quite successfully for the benefit of Russian science.  At the present moment, the building of the Institute of High Frequency Currents is located here.  Thus, it was proved that the majestic buildings erected in the last century do not submit much time, continuing to adorn the modern world, while perfectly fitting into today's Petersburg.  Shuvalovsky Park is not limited to this palace, so let's move on. </p><p>  If you went here not only to take pictures against the backdrop of beautiful old houses and explore the surroundings, then you will certainly walk along the paths with centenary oak sorcerers, gain energy, breathe this air of history, stock up on positive emotions, after which you can safely begin the next work week.  At the same time, do not forget to return to Shuvalovsky Park next time in order to get a new share of positive, pleasant memories, as well as gain strength. </p>

    <p>  In addition to fluffy firs and sprawling oaks, you will be able to observe the transformation of this park for the better, because in the near future the authorities of St. Petersburg plan to convert the site into a comfortable full-fledged recreation area.  The Shuvalovsky park is planned to be equipped with areas for children's entertainment, as well as sports grounds, attractions will be brought here, and a new cinema will be built. </p>
