Kaluga City: Attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Museum of Local Lore (Kaluga) has a rich collection of exhibits, many of which date back to the 17th century.  The total number of storage units has long exceeded 100 thousand objects.  At its beginning, the museum gathered ten branches and, by a decision taken in 2016, transferred to the status of a united museum-reserve. </p><h2>  The oldest museum of local lore </h2><p>  Museum of Local Lore (Kaluga) was established in 1897.  To house it, one of the oldest buildings of the city was taken away - the chambers that once belonged to the merchants Korobov (17th century).  The first exposition consisted of five shop windows where archaeological finds, ancient coins, household items of past times were exhibited.  The museum worked only twice a week, the number of visitors per year was very small - only 500 people. </p><p>  By 1904, the museum of local lore (Kaluga) kept about 1000 objects in the collections, among which were letters from A.S. Pushkin, a pen of N.V. Gogol, and in 1915 the collection consisted of 1,200 items. </p><p>  After 1918, the institution was transformed into the ‚ÄúProvincial History Museum‚Äù.  Funds and expositions moved to the building, which now houses the Kaluga Regional Museum of Local Lore, in 1922.  The first branches were merged in 1924, and the Museum ‚ÄúFor Good Deed‚Äù, an art museum, was transferred to the balance.  The latter in 1925 as part of several branches came under the jurisdiction of Glavnauka. </p><p>  The main replenishment of funds took place in the 30s, when the museum of local lore (Kaluga) began to replenish the property of abolished churches and nationalized estates.  By 1939, the collection consisted of 10 thousand items. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  From war to the present day </h2><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the halls of the museum did not work for only 10 months, the rest of the time the exposition was open to the public.  During the occupation, for 78 days, the museum was closed.  It was not possible to evacuate the historical heritage and throughout the year (1942-43), employees calculated the extent of the damage.  The final document stated that 10% of museum funds dating back to the 18th century classicism were looted. </p><p>  In 1944, the museum became regional, by 1945, the funds consisted of 7,712 exhibits, of which 2,143 units were opened for general access.  During this period, employees of the institution collected materials, documents and memoirs about the Great Patriotic War, which became the basis for the formation of several folk museums in the region in the 50s and 60s.  Subsequently, six of them became branches and entered the museum of local lore (Kaluga).  Today, the institution invites visitors to 10 branches. </p>
