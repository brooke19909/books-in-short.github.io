Ideas</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Thinking of beautiful wedding glasses?  It‚Äôs very easy to make them yourself.  Glass can be decorated in various ways.  Use ribbons, beads, rhinestones, threads and lace.  Everything that is at hand will do.  You can also make funny and non-trivial glasses that cannot be found in the store.  Look for ideas and tips for making below. </p><h2>  Picture </h2><p>  How to make original glasses for a wedding with your own hands?  Today it is fashionable to be photographed.  And at the wedding, the photographer does not let the bride and groom out of his lens.  Therefore, the main characters of the day should constantly look photogenic and come up with interesting shots.  Champagne glasses can help. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wedding glass" class="if uuid-2268221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2268221.jpg"></div><p>  It will be enough to draw sponges and mustaches on the glass with acrylic paints.  You can also make a funny inscription, for example, the bride and groom, or in the English manner, Mr. and Mrs.  Such glasses will become an interesting props for photography.  And from them it is even optional to drink, you can just bring it to your mouth. </p><h2>  Thread decor </h2><p>  To make glasses for the wedding with your own hands in this way will not require any special skills.  Even if you are very far from needlework, but celebrate your wedding in eco-style, you still have the opportunity to save on additional decor.  Indeed, designer glasses are not cheap.  But there is nothing easier to do them yourself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wedding glass" class="if uuid-2268228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2268228.jpg"></div><p>  We take a glass and coat its leg with glue from a hot gun.  Now you should wrap it with a coarse thread.  If you don‚Äôt have a hot gun, it doesn‚Äôt matter.  Take a tube of PVA glue, pierce it with a needle through which a thread is stretched.  Thus, drag the rope through the glue and wrap the leg around it.  As an additional decor, you can tie metal hearts or any other detail of the decoration. </p><h2>  Lace decor </h2><p>  This way of decorating glasses for a wedding with your own hands is very similar to the previous one.  Only in this case you need to wind the rope not on the leg, but on the glass itself.  Use the same methods for attaching it: a hot gun or PVA glue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wedding glass" class="if uuid-2268232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2268232.jpg"></div><p>  In this decor method, you will also need a piece of lace.  It should be glued just below the rope.  In order to keep the two layers tighter, lace should be tied with a coarse thread, the ends of which can be tied in a bow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now it remains to glue an additional decor.  It can be beads, both plastic and wooden.  They, by the way, can be worn on the ends of the strings. </p><h2>  Bead Decor </h2><p>  Above you can see a photo of glasses for a wedding.  With your own hands, just repeat this decor technique.  For decoration, you will need beads of various sizes, colors and shapes, as well as a hot gun. </p><p>  First draw a picture.  A pencil does not draw well on glass, but a wax pencil does an excellent job.  Outline the overall shape of the decor.  Maybe you want to lay it out in an oval, or maybe a heart or a triangle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wedding glass" class="if uuid-2268235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2268235.jpg"></div><p>  When the form is ready, you can start filling it out.  Apply a white or beige backing with acrylic.  This is convenient to do with a small sponge, as well as with a sponge.  When the paint dries, you will need to draw an ornament or any curls along the contour of the spot. </p><p>  Now you can start filling.  In a chaotic manner we glue the beads.  See that monochromatic and similar elements are not nearby.  Use rhinestones as decorative elements.  You can decorate not only the ‚Äúbody‚Äù of the glass, but also its leg.  You can decorate a bottle of champagne in the same style. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Beautiful lining </h2><p>  How to decorate your wedding glasses with your own hands?  One of the easiest ways is to make overlays.  And in the form of what should they be? </p><p>  A butterfly can decorate a glass of a groom, but a bouquet is a glass of a bride.  To make a miniature tie, you need a leather strip.  Fold it with a ring, and in the middle, fix it with another leather strip a little smaller.  You can attach a butterfly to a glass with a hot gun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wedding glass" class="if uuid-2268240" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2268240.jpg"></div><p>  Now go to the bride‚Äôs bouquet.  It should be made from a thin, but form-holding fabric.  We cut it into strips and on one edge we sew the needles seam forward.  Now we are tightening the result.  The same should be done with a piece of fabric of a different color.  Then mix the frills of fabric with each other.  The bottom of the mini-bouquet is fixed with a glue gun.  As a decor, you can use small beads, beads or rhinestones. </p><h2>  Floral decor </h2><p>  What could be more beautiful than fresh flowers?  Yes, probably nothing.  That is why the decoration of glasses for a wedding with their own hands is very often made from plants.  Tables, rooms, arches and cars are decorated with flowers.  So you can make a small bouquet, which should be tied with a coarse thread to the stem of the glass. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wedding glass" class="if uuid-2268250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2268250.jpg"></div><p>  If you like something tender, then choose small light flowers.  And if you want to add more splendor, attach a small rose to each glass.  By the way, girls can insert these flowers in their hair, and men - in the pockets of their jackets.  And, in general, such miniature bouquets can be given to guests as a keepsake. </p><h2>  Polymer clay figurines </h2><p>  If the bride is a needlewoman, then it will not be a problem for her to make glasses for the wedding with her own hands.  We will hold a master class on their manufacture. </p><p>  The first thing to do is prepare the glasses.  We draw on them the beautiful initials of the bride and groom, and frame them with hearts.  Now paint over with acrylic paint.  Black will be the most readable, and if you use something with sparkles, then be sure that guests will not be able to make out the labels. </p><p>  When the glass is ready, you can proceed to sculpting the figures.  They are made of polymer clay.  We sculpt the bride first.  A ball of bodily material is rolling - it will be the head.  From thin sausages we create a hairstyle, as well as fashion eyes, nose and mouth.  Now we make three sausages.  One is thicker, the other two are thinner.  We fasten them together and attach the head on top.  Now we make two more body balls and glue them to the sleeves.  To make a skirt it is necessary to roll out a white layer.  Cut it into equal strips.  Now you should pick up each of them, and twist into a ring.  The skirt will consist of three such segments.  We glue all the details and the figure of the bride is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wedding glass" class="if uuid-2268255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2268255.jpg"></div><p>  Now you should make the groom.  We create the head by analogy with the previous one, only you should make a short, not a long hairstyle.  Now we sculpt a rectangle and four sausages of black color.  Two of them are thinner - these will be hands, and two thicker - these will be legs.  Now we connect the parts of the groom.  From a white material we cut a triangle and glue it under the neck.  It will be a shirt.  On it you need to stick a bow tie, assembled from triangles.  Roll body and black balls.  The corporeal are the arms, and the black are the legs.  We collect the figure and send them to the oven for half an hour.  Then they can be attached to the glasses. </p><h2>  Painting + application </h2><p>  Such glasses look very gentle and romantic.  They will be able to go absolutely to any wedding.  It is only necessary to choose the right color scheme and accessories.  How to make your own wedding glasses for your wedding?  Walkthrough is. </p><p>  Degrease the glass.  We tint the leg in white and the base of the glass in gold.  It is most convenient to do this with a sponge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wedding glass" class="if uuid-2268259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2268259.jpg"></div><p>  Now you should apply the picture with acrylic paint.  We take a thin brush and depict waves and drops.  But they should not be located in a chaotic manner, but along a clearly defined path for them.  It can be a wave or a spiral. </p><p>  Now you should make plastic flowers.  It is necessary to individually mold each petal, and then connect the spare parts.  In order not to tint the blanks in the future, they should immediately be made from the material of the desired color.  We create flowers and bake them in the oven.  Using a hot gun we attach them to the glasses.  As the core, you can use both beads and metal fittings. </p><h2>  Rhinestones Decor </h2><p>  Making glasses for a wedding with your own hands will look very impressive if you use something shiny.  For example, rhinestones and beads.  That it did not look gone, it is necessary to think over a drawing.  There is no need to decorate the glass from all sides.  Only one face can be made.  Do not worry that guests will not see your work.  From bright light, rhinestones will shine even through the festive champagne. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wedding glass" class="if uuid-2268265" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2268265.jpg"></div><p>  How to create decor from rhinestones?  We draw a sketch on paper, and then transfer it to glass.  Now we glue the rhinestones alternately with the help of a hot gun.  We start not from below and not from the side.  First of all we glue the biggest details.  In our case, this is the central vertical line.  When it sits firmly in place, you can move on to the fine decor.  We spread waves, flowers or any other pattern according to your drawing. </p><p>  Such work does not need additional coverage.  It makes no sense to varnish it, as in this case the rhinestones will become worse to shine. </p><h2>  Painting </h2><p>  Thinking of making your own wedding glasses for your wedding?  The master class below will help you with this. </p><p>  The first thing to do is draw a sketch on paper.  Nowhere without it.  What should be the subject?  It can be flowers or just beautiful patterns as in our case.  Here's the idea.  If you put two glasses together, you get a heart.  When the sketch is ready, it must be transferred to glass. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wedding glass" class="if uuid-2268274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2268274.jpg"></div><p>  The image on the glass should be applied with a wax pencil.  When the sketch is ready, you can start painting.  Take the contour - this is a paint for glass.  It is translucent, silver, gold, with and without sparkles.  And now you need to draw a pencil line.  An interesting effect is obtained when two types of paint supplement the work.  One of them is a convex contour, and the other is flat acrylic.  With a regular brush, you can paint over leaves or petals. </p><p>  When the work is ready, it should be supplemented with decorative details.  It can be rhinestones or small beads.  The main thing is not to overdo it.  The emphasis should remain on the painting, and not on the placer of shiny pebbles. </p>
