So, tourists who rented rooms here will have to get here for a relatively long time.  Usually, Russian vacationers are delivered to the hotel by the operators who sold them the vouchers.  But if necessary, a transfer can be ordered at this hotel itself.  However, it is, of course, necessary to agree on it in advance. </p><h2>  What is a hotel </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The <span>Club Selen Hotel Icmeler</span> 3 * <span>hotel was</span> built (Turkey, Marmaris) was</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">in 1988.

    <h2>  What is offered on the territory </h2><p>  In addition to the pool and parking, there is a small plunge pool in the courtyard of this hotel.  It is rarely used by guests, but it is still there.  There is also a playground and a room for children at the hotel.  Quite often, on the territory of the Club Selen Hotel Icmeler 3 * complex, funny programs are also held.
