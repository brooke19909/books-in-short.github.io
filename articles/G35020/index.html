Although many new products in the market of household appliances and electronics are really able to transform the device and the quality of life, most of them are fundamentally no different from the more familiar and traditional counterparts.  In this regard, the TV segment is considered the most established.  Significant technological improvements do not appear so often, and manufacturers are looking for alternative concepts and tools that will allow to raise the function of broadcasting a TV signal to a new level.  Among the latest developments of this scale, one can distinguish Samsung curved TVs, which are still little known to the consumer, but have already attracted the attention of specialists.  The Korean manufacturer, in turn, demonstrates perseverance in the use of marketing tools.  So, in 2015, a whole line of high- <span>resolution</span> curved SUHD models came out under the Samsung brand <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Features of Curved TVs </h2>

    <p>  Speaking of revolutionary technologies, it will not be out of place to mention 3D screens, which only a few years ago were also actively promoted by marketers.  Today, the appeal to a three-dimensional ‚Äúpicture‚Äù with high resolution is especially symbolic, since the curved screens in TVs already work with 4K technology, which provides the highest resolution to date - in UltraHD format.  The <span>curved screen of</span> the Samsung TV itself is rather concave.  This design is in some ways similar to the operation of projectors in movie theaters, which allow you to expand the angle of view and generally improve the image. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, on TVs, there is no need to talk about such effects.  The curved shape undoubtedly gives advantages in the form of optimizing the projection area in terms of improving the quality of perception by the viewer.  But the main benefit in improving the characteristics of the ‚Äúimage‚Äù is still being brought in by the 4K format itself, on which curved Samsung TVs with different diagonal work for the most part.  In addition, like all new products, such models are equipped with a wide range of additional options.  But first things first. </p><h2>  Deep immersion effect </h2><p>  Despite the serious difference with the tasks set for developers of non-standard screens in cinemas, Korean televisions also give a certain immersion effect, which ‚Äúflat‚Äù models cannot boast of.  However, in order to feel the advantages that the curved screen of the Samsung TV is capable of providing during viewing, two conditions must be met.  Firstly, you should use a large screen, not less than 40 inches, and secondly, its surface should cover at least 40% of the field of view.  For example, if a 55-inch model is used, then this value will be 170 cm. </p>

    <p>  But there is one caveat.  This calculation is relevant for models with UltraHD resolution.  If the TV uses standard HD or FullHD, then the distance increases to 323 and 218 cm, respectively.  Therefore, it is better to focus on the 4K model in advance, otherwise there is simply no sense in a non-standard design.  Unfortunately, Samsung curved TVs are currently ahead of the development of high-resolution technologies.  UltraHD video content with the 3840x2160 format is still not so much, and it is not always possible to fully feel its dignity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Contrast and viewing angles </h2><p>  Another important feature of concave screens is the increased viewing angle and contrast.  I must say that Samsung rivals from LG maximally realized these advantages through the use of OLED technology, which allows you to create ideal viewing angles.  Samsung curved TVs, in turn, are equipped with LCD matrices that compensate for the loss of lateral contrast.  Otherwise, the viewing angle provides the same discomfort as conventional models with flat screens.  The fact is that one person in the viewing process can only feel the benefits of increased angles.  However, if the whole family is located in front of the screen, then the extreme viewers will feel the imperfection of the image in the corners. </p><h2>  Reflections and Optical Distortion </h2>

    <p>  The non-standard surface of the screen with curvature changes the angle of reflection of light rays, which reduces glare.  Consequently, the concavity forms a focal point at a distance of half the radius of curvature from the center of the screen.  Reflections will blur if the viewer sits farther than that focal point.  In addition, Samsung TV with a curved screen is able to reduce optical distortion.  But in this case, the opinions of experts are not so clear.  The minimization of distortion is explained by the fact that the human eye does not have a flat surface, but when interacting with the same screen, harmonious perception is ensured.  However, critics of this theory still note that such an approach distorts the director‚Äôs intent.  The fact is that when shooting from the camera, a sensor matrix with a flat shape is used, and the TV, when processing and submitting the ‚Äúpicture,‚Äù makes additional adjustments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Visual area of ‚Äã‚Äãscreens </h2><p>  Compared to flat screens, curved counterparts provide a wider viewing area - and this subject to the same diagonals.  True, to use this advantage will succeed only if the correctly selected distance at which the viewer is located.  For example, if you take Samsung TVs 55 inches, the curved screen of which is optimal in terms of projection width, then the visual increase will be a 3 percent increase in area.  At a distance of three meters from the equipment, the increase will be 9%, since the angle will be expanded to almost 25 degrees.  But such calculations are valid only under the condition that one viewer watches TV.  In general, visual expansion is only effective under optimal conditions for the location of a person in the center relative to the screen. </p>

    <h2>  Intellectual filling </h2><p>  The new generation of Samsung TVs is distinguished not only by curved screens, but also by their reinforcement with a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù filling called the Smart Hub.  In this part, Korean craftsmen concentrated all the advanced TV applications and functional "chips".  The structure of this interface involves several sections, which contain games, proprietary applications from Samsung, multimedia, etc. It is worth noting the presence of a browser, which also supports Samsung TV with a curved screen when you enter the corresponding mode.  The device allows not only to use content via the Network, but also to download movies with TV shows on a hard drive or USB-drive, and then through them to view materials regardless of the Internet connection.  It is worth noting the functions of automatic image quality settings.  Televisions provide optimal color reproduction by broadcasting natural tones, midtones and tonal transitions.  With regard to sharpness and contrast, there are also no complaints.  Provided in such televisions is the function of zone auto-contrast, which allows you to change the brightness on individual parts of the screen. </p><h2>  Model Description UE65HU9000T </h2><p>  This is the flagship model in the advanced line of the Korean manufacturer, which can be considered not just a leader in its class, but one of the most technologically advanced developments in the entire segment.  This is evidenced by the characteristics of the model: </p><ul><li>  The diagonal of the concave screen is 65 inches. </li><li>  The type of matrix coating is gloss. </li><li>  The aspect ratio is 16: 9. </li><li>  The type of matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãS-PVA. </li><li>  Resolution - 4K standard. </li><li>  The radius of curvature is 420 cm. </li><li>  3D support - present. </li></ul><p>  Along with support for UltraHD and a decent 65-inch diagonal, there is also a Clear Motion Rate function, which also got a new Samsung TV.  Thanks to this addition, the curved screen of the model provides an update with a frequency that is comfortable for the eyes.  Since the combination with three-dimensional technologies inhibits this indicator, the creators used the TV backlight, which increased the flicker intensity. </p>

    <h2>  Model Description UE55HU9000 </h2><p>  This model can be attributed to the middle category.  It optimally combines high resolution and additional functionality.  The developers used a 55-inch LCD with a 16: 9 aspect ratio.  I must say that this option does not lose at all to larger sizes in terms of providing projection advantages of a concave screen.  True, the curved Samsung 40-inch TV is also capable of transmitting the same effects of image depth and contrast, but still the screen with reduced dimensions is not so impressive with the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù.  But the model can please the functionality that accessories represent in the form of 3D glasses, a touch control panel, a built-in web camera, an eco-sensor, a slip timer, etc. </p><h2>  Model Description UE40JU6610U </h2><p>  This is the youngest and one of the first models with a concave screen.  She is the most affordable.  As for the resolution, it is presented in the same UltraHD format, which is 4 times higher than the FullHD specifications.  Thanks to this technology, the Samsung TV with a curved screen of 40 inches is able to provide excellent detail.  Also, the features of this version include natural color reproduction, which is implemented using PurColour technology.  The viewer gets a wide palette of bright and clear colors, as close as possible to real ones.  ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù filling of the latest models of the Korean brand has already been noted.  The junior representative was no exception and received a convenient Smart-menu, which, among other things, provides Internet access. </p><h2>  Positive feedback on curved models </h2>

    <p>  Most of the accolades are rightly addressed to models with 4K-resolution, the advantages of which are obvious.  In other indicators, the situation is not so clear.  Owners note a cleaner ‚Äúpicture‚Äù without distortion and reflection, an increase in visual width and contrast advantages.  There are also individual reviews of Samsung curved TVs, which are used to view 3D images.  As in the case of the 4K format, 3D technology is optimally implemented precisely in broadcasting through a concave screen.  Another thing is that to achieve the best result is possible only with a single viewing and conducting experiments with the position relative to the screen. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Before turning to negative reviews, I must say <span>that such models</span> practically do not lose anything to traditional devices.  The only negative is the price.  As for negative reviews in relation to the screen itself, they note a deterioration in viewing angles for viewers who are not sitting in the center.  Also, the experienced eye will also notice the optical distortions that Samsung TV with a curved screen sins.  Reviews regarding image quality in the other parameters are generally condescending, but, again, a lot depends on the implementation of presets and the choice of position for viewing. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  The main question facing TV manufacturers today: how promising are concave screens and how to use UltraHD format most rationally?  If the situation is clear regarding the second, then the advantages of a non-standard screen are less obvious.  Perhaps this explains the efforts of marketers who advertise the curved Samsung TV with all their might.  At the same time, the reviews of consumers themselves do not mark any revolutionary achievements.  If you strictly approach the assessment of a new design with all physical and geometric calculations, then there will certainly be advantages.  This is an extension of the viewing angle, and an increase in contrast, as well as a deeper visual perception of the "picture".  Another thing is that only a TV with support for 4K format and a decent diagonal can fully reveal these advantages.  And these characteristics directly affect the cost of such models, which averages 50-70 thousand rubles. </p>
