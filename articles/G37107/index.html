I want to look in a special way and feel in a new way, fun, bright, mischievous and relaxed.  Summer mood, of course, will help to create a bright, free and open outfit.  But how to supplement it?  Go to the store and buy bijoux?  There are, of course, beautiful things, but exclusive and stylish are expensive, and you do not want to buy cheap consumer goods.  Let's try to create cute original accessories with our own hands, for example, from polymer clay, very fashionable this season.  We will become artists and create something that will delight and delight us and others.  Let it be earrings. </p><p>  <span>How to make</span> polymer clay <span>earrings</span> ? </p><p>  We go to the store for artists.  They sell clay in large quantities in packs of various weights and different colors.  For women's jewelry, as a rule, clay is used for baking (Cernit firm), but you can get by with the usual set for children's art, Plastic.  Choose four colors.  We will also need: earring hooks, 6 small beads, fishing line, sewing needle, old cutting board. </p><p>  To mold <span>polymer clay</span> earrings is a pleasure.  In her hands she becomes tender and plastic, resembling children's plasticine.  For two earrings, we take three lumps of different colors a little less than a centimeter in size.  To make it convenient to work, and clay does not stick to your hands, we will lubricate our hands with any protective cream.  We ‚Äúslap‚Äù three balls into one large, three-colored one, then we take clay of another color, better than dark or black, make a sausage and roll it on the board to a flat state.  We wrap the ball with this tape, place it on the board and roll it into a flat pancake.  Then we divide this pancake into two even parts, separate a small piece from each and roll up two small bead balls (we pierce a through hole in the center).  From the remaining material we sculpt the figures, whichever they want, a full flight of creative imagination (we turn them with a spiral, stretch the ends, like with a star, turn them with a small box, etc.).  Then we determine the top of the product, pierce from the very edge of the hole, then to insert the hook. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Next, polymer clay earrings will be cooked or baked (in accordance with the instructions on the package).  When the product dries and cools, attach the hooks.  To do this, take the fishing line, cut two pieces of 20 cm from it. We put a bead on one segment, fold the fishing line in half with a loop, a bead in the center.  We pass both ends of the loop from below into the hole in the earring, extend it, put on them another bead, then a polymer ball, then again a bead.  In the loop of the hook we pass the ends of the fishing line towards each other, again combine them and do the whole process in the reverse order.  In the last bead at the base of the earring we pass the ends of the fishing line towards each other and fix each with a double knot.  In the same way, we do everything on a different earring. </p><p>  How to make polymer clay earrings in a different shape?  You can experiment and fashion various other figures.  For example, small balls of different colors, first wrap a narrow flat dark ribbon of clay, then put everything together in a small square, roll it out to become flat, fold it in light folds, as if it were made of fabric, make a hole in one of the corners and bake it.  The result is original large diamond-shaped earrings made of polymer clay in ethnic style. </p><p>  Very beautiful earrings are obtained that imitate fruit slices or fashioned in the form of flower heads.  Take a live flower, carefully look at its individual details.  Try making something similar out of polymer clay.  This material is able to perfectly convey all the beauty and tenderness of a real flower.  Feel free to combine the clay of one color with another, mix, achieving uniform beautiful shades or leave ‚Äúnedomesy‚Äù in the form of bright multi-colored stains, interspersed.  Experiment and fantasize, and the material will ‚Äúanswer‚Äù you with amazing forms and combinations. </p>
