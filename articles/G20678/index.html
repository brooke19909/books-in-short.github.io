But if the bearing fails, then it is not so scary.  After all, it can be replaced.  And its cost will not be particularly high.  And if the user has ever repaired something at least once in his life, then he will be able to replace it himself.  But only if he has a washing machine with a collapsible drum.  What kind of drum is this and what kind of machines is it in?  We will try to answer these questions and provide a list of the most popular cars with such drums. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hitech-online.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="collapsible drum washing machines" class="if uuid-3240426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240426.jpg"></div><h2>  Bit of theory </h2><p>  At the moment, manufacturers produce two types of washing machines.  With and without collapsible drum.  What does it mean?  To answer this question, consider the design of a conventional washing machine.  Inside it is a well-known drum for us, in which we put things for washing.  But he himself is covered by a special casing, which can be made of both plastic and stainless steel.  Moreover, the choice of material is based on the speed of rotation of the drum during the spin cycle.  The higher it is, the stronger the material.  So here.  A collapsible drum of a washing machine (Indesit, for example, old models) is assembled in two parts and bolted together.  Among them are those that are responsible for the tightness of the structure.  In the rear part of this casing there is a bearing, which often fails and which needs to be changed from time to time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But in washers with a non-separable drum, everything is much worse.  There it has an integral structure and consists of a single piece of plastic or metal.  Such a drum cannot be disassembled.  And it is not the bearing itself that will have to be changed, but the entire casing along with the drum.  And this is completely different money.  Currently, washing machines with a collapsible drum are still found among the new models.  And if you have an apparatus at least five years old, then we can safely say that with a probability a collapsible drum is installed there.  And there will be no problems with the repair. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stiralnihremont.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="collapsible washing machines list" class="if uuid-3240428" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240428.jpg"></div><h2>  Why cars with a single casing are produced </h2><p>  Collapsible drum washing machines have become rare for two reasons.  Firstly, it is easier and cheaper for manufacturers to cast a one-piece casing than to create two halves separately, produce bolts for them and check the finished casing for leaks.  It takes a lot of time and a considerable amount of money.  Secondly, manufacturers are interested in increasing profits.  And it is much more profitable to sell the entire drum along with the casing and all the stuffing than individual components (including bearings).  However, leading brands are by no means fools.  They motivate this by the fact that in general, repairs will be easier and cheaper.  However, no one believes this.  And rightly so.  Since repairs are only more expensive.  But simpler.  This cannot be taken away. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="buffalo-club.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="collapsible washing machine brand" class="if uuid-3240429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240429.jpg"></div><h2>  Modern machines with collapsible drum.  Manufacturers </h2><p>  Now let's see which of the manufacturers still produces washing machines with a collapsible drum.  The list is not very long, since most of the brands have switched to new technology.  And they do not care deeply that the owners of these washers will spend more money on repairs.  They care only about profit.  So, here are the brands that still produce collapsible drum washing machines. </p><ul><li>  Atlant.  The Belarusian manufacturer still remains true to its principles.  All machines that go off the assembly line have a collapsible casing design. </li><li>  LG.  Here the drums are also collapsible.  But the bearing cannot be changed separately.  Only with the entire back.  But this is not bad either.  Still cheaper than changing the casing along with the drum. </li><li>  Samsung  The Korean manufacturer has both one and other models.  So when choosing a specific washing machine, you need to be very careful. </li><li>  Electrolux  The same situation as the Samsung.  Only a few models have a collapsible drum. </li><li>  AEG.  All the same.  Only some models. </li><li>  Gorenije.  Also only some models. </li><li>  Siemens and Bosch.  The Germans are there too.  Only some models.  The rest with non-separable drums. </li></ul><p>  This is the situation on the market of washing machines.  Of course, everything is not so scary, and if you want, you can find the right machine.  We will even tell you how to do it.  But first, consider brands that have completely abandoned collapsible drums and produce exclusively models with a single-piece casing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="56master.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="collapsible drum washing machine indesit" class="if uuid-3240430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240430.jpg"></div><h2>  Modern machines with a non-separable drum.  Manufacturers </h2><p>  In the previous chapter, we looked at washing machines with a collapsible drum.  There were not so few stamps.  Now let's talk about those manufacturers who deliberately simplified production and began to shamelessly pull money from customers.  The list will have approximately the same number of companies.  Here.  Take a look for yourself. </p><ul><li>  Indesit. </li><li>  Ariston </li><li>  Candy </li><li>  Whirpool. </li><li>  ARDO. </li><li>  BEKO. </li></ul><p>  Well, with ‚ÄúIndesit‚Äù and ‚ÄúAriston‚Äù everything is clear.  But why did ‚ÄúCandy‚Äù go the same way?  Or "VEK"?  We will never know the answers to these questions.  So if you were planning to find a Kandy washing machine with a collapsible drum on the market, you can forget about it.  The manufacturer began to work exclusively with solid casings.  And such machines may already come across exclusively old models.  Regrettably. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cosmo-frost.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kandy washing machine drum collapsible" class="if uuid-3240431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240431.jpg"></div><h2>  How to identify a collapsible drum machine? </h2><p>  This is a very interesting question that almost all those who want to buy a new washing machine ask themselves.  There are several ways.  But one hundred percent only.  However, we will consider them all so that users can choose the appropriate one.  The fact is that the instruction manual for the washing machine or its data sheet does not indicate what type of drum there is.  And the only option to find out is a visual inspection.  There are several ways. </p><ol><li>  Ask the seller at the store to remove the top cover of the washing machine.  The material of the drum and its construction can be considered without problems.  Only the seller is likely to respond politely with a refusal.  And asking him does not make sense.  He himself does not know anything about what he is selling. </li><li>  Second option: tilt the machine slightly to the side.  Its bottom is usually not closed by anything.  And so you can consider the design features of the casing and the drum. </li><li>  Consult a washing machine repair technician.  By the nature of his activity, he knows which brands still have collapsible drums. </li></ol><p>  These simple ways will help you choose the right washing machine, so that in the future you do not really spend money on repairs. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we tried to answer the question of what washing machines with a folding drum are.  Now you all know about these devices and are able to make the right choice. </p>
