    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The foundation time of this settlement is considered to be 1727.  It was then that <span>Akinfy Demidov</span> built a plant for the smelting of copper and silver in the northwestern foothills of the ridges on the Belaya River.  This production was included in the vast complex of Altai metal manufacturing.  And the main control point of the organization was Kolyvan.  Altai Territory was the backbone of the country's metallurgy. </p><h2>  Stone carving art </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, metal mining ceased, and stone began to be processed in the walls of the plant.  The products of the new masters became so popular that product samples were sent to different parts of the world and decorated the palaces of the ruling persons.  The most famous exhibit - ‚ÄúTsaritsa VAZ‚Äù - glorified Kolyvan, Altai Krai and the Russian school of stone-cutting.  About 30 years have passed since the discovery of the monolithic section of jasper to the departure of the finished item to the capital.  Thanks to the hard work of the architect, craftsmen, apprentices and simple workers, this work of art was completed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The stone processing plant has been operating for two centuries.  The company survived the difficult years after the collapse of the USSR, making tiles for paving sidewalks.  Now its products are jewelry, art products, elements for technical equipment.  A small museum in the village is dedicated to the extraction and processing of stone.  There are collected natural samples and products that reflect the development of the industry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kolyvan Altai Territory" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/900700.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Places to visit </h2><p>  As a reference point for the study of beauties untouched by man, Kolyvan is well suited.  Altai Territory has many points for a relaxing pastime and outdoor activities.  All this is in relative proximity to each other. </p><p>  Mount Sinokha is a place for pilgrims and lovers of hiking.  On the slopes beat sources that are considered holy.  From a height of 1210 m above the sea surface, panoramas of Zmeinogorsk and other elevations and reservoirs open.  Paragliders found that it is very convenient to fly from an elevated position, which is why the place has become a favorite extreme point. </p><p>  Jealous - one of the peaks of the ridge.  It was in it in the 19th century that huge deposits of green jasper were discovered, from which columns were made in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior.  Taiga vegetation, spaciousness and extraordinary views will appear for those who go to conquer the heights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kolyvan Altai Territory Lake White" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/900703.jpg" width="520"></div>

The Altai Territory here offers not only ascetic walks along the plains and hills, but also beach activities and relaxation.  The banks of the reservoir are covered with coarse sand, the water is transparent, there are no drops in depth.  Tourists rent special houses, stop in camping areas or set up a tent separately and live in "savages."  The water saucer is surrounded by rocky formations, along the perimeter an ancient <span>chilli nut</span> grows <span>.</span>  All this for those who do not like to bask in the sun or ride a "banana". </p><p>  One of the favorite tourist routes is Kolyvan (Altai Territory) - Lake Beloe.  To stay, they stop at a camp site, which is located nearby.  It is also possible to put up a tent in a campsite or in a public parking lot.  In the pond you can swim and fish. </p><p>  For various reasons, many people travel without personal transportation.  And from this point you can walk to many interesting places.  So you can visit the stone processing plant, climb Sinokha, see the unusual Moss Lake in a <span>stone bowl,</span> visit the ‚Äúmouth‚Äù of the monster of the Enchanting Rock. </p><p>  Those interested in historical events are advised to visit the mines.  There you can see quarries and placers, in which miners worked half a century ago.  These places can only be reached by four-wheel drive all-terrain vehicle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kolyvan Altai Territory recreation" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/900701.jpg" width="600"></div>
