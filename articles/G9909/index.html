  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Foreign policy of Peter 1</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Relations between Russia and other countries in the early 18th century were particularly active.  <span>The foreign policy of</span> Peter 1 was conducted in two directions: Asian and European.  It was of a peaceful nature and was resolved through diplomatic means, and military. </p><p>  The foreign policy of Peter 1 in the Asian direction primarily concerned the opening of an exit through the Black Sea.  To this end, <span>Azov campaigns were</span> organized <span>, the</span> result of which was the capture of the Ottoman stronghold - the Azov fortress.  In the south, Russia's borders have become safer thanks to the opportunity to attack the Crimea from the sea.  Active construction of the port of Taganrog began.  However, the <span>Kerch Strait</span> was in the power of the Ottoman Empire <span>,</span> which meant that the exit through it to the Black Sea remained closed.  Russia had neither a fleet, nor finance for its creation, to enter the war with Turkey.  Then <span>Peter 1</span> introduced a new lodge: each kumpanism (10,000 yards united into it) had to build a ship for the state with its own money.  On one of these ships, the Russian ambassador went to Constantinople to negotiate.  The Sultan was supportive and concluded a peace treaty in 1700, for which Azov remained with Russia. </p><p>  The domestic and foreign policy of Peter 1 was also manifested in his desire to use the achievements of the West.  During the construction of the fleet and the formation of the army, he could not do without the knowledge of European specialists.  But also Peter 1 could not allow his country to remain completely ignorant of these issues.  Therefore, promising nobles were sent to study sciences abroad.  And the tsar himself soon made his first trip to the West. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  He sent the Great Embassy to Europe in order to gain allies in the fight against Turkey.  The king himself was among the members of the embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãhiding under a false name.  He not only participated in the negotiations, but also studied military art, shipbuilding, worked at the shipyards as a carpenter, and visited many famous places in England. </p><p>  The Western powers at that time were busy preparing for the war for the legacy of Spain and could not help Russia in the war with Turkey.  For this reason, the foreign policy of Peter 1 reoriented from the Asian to the European direction. </p><p>  To enter a new war, Russia entered into an armistice with the <span>Ottoman Empire</span> for 30 years.  This was the main condition of the Northern Union, which also included Denmark and Saxony.  Most of all in this war was August II, King of Poland.  He sought to capture Livonia, and promised for Russia to return the once selected Karelia and Ingermanland for support.  The pretext for declaring war by Russia was the offense inflicted on Peter the Great in Riga earlier. </p><p>  Although Charles XII and Augustus II were defeated, the <span>Russian Tsar</span> still managed to capture several fortresses and pave the way to the Baltic. </p><p>  In 1710, Turkey, despite the armistice, intervenes in the war.  As a result of hostilities with the Ottoman Empire, Russia had to return the Azov fortress to it and destroy Taganrog.  But, thanks to these actions, a truce was again concluded with the Turks, and the king could only deal with the Swedes.  The Russian fleet continued to strengthen in the Baltic.  This was very worrying for Sweden.  The resumption of negotiations between the two countries led to the conclusion of peace.  According to its conditions, Russia received additional territories and an open access to the sea.  She became a great power in Europe, as a sign of which the Russian Tsar was proclaimed emperor. </p><p>  After such luck, the foreign policy of Peter 1 was now aimed at organizing the Caspian expedition to strengthen the empire‚Äôs position in the Caucasus. </p><p>  After the political actions undertaken by the emperor, radical changes took place in Russia.  The results of the foreign policy of Peter 1 is not only a free access to the sea.  The patriarchal country suddenly forever became a European power, taking part in all international processes. </p>
