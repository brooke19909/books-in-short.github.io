    <h2>  Dessole Sea Lion Beach Resort Spa 4 *: traveler reviews from Russia </h2><p>  Today, many tourists, when planning a trip, try very carefully to study the reviews of people who have already visited a particular place.  This helps to make a picture more complete and closer to the real state of things.  But hardly anyone would want to experience disappointment upon arriving on a long-awaited vacation.  So we decided to save you time and energy and to offer generalized comments from Russian tourists staying at this hotel.  Immediately, we note that almost all guests in the comments note that they were not disappointed in their choice.  But we will understand everything in more detail. </p><h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  Almost all tourists in their reviews note that they were very pleased with the rooms they provided in this hotel.  So, according to our compatriots, all the apartments here are quite spacious, stylishly decorated, clean, bright, with a new renovation, excellent furniture and plumbing.  In the bathrooms there are stocks of body gel, shampoo, soap, toothbrush.  Cleaning was carried out daily, and they did it in a quality manner, unlike many other hotels.  Towels were renewed several times a week, and bed linen once a few days.  Maids also replenished drinks in the minibar and soap products in the bathroom as needed.  A small minus was considered by some guests the fact that many balconies have outdoor air conditioning units from neighboring rooms, which creates some noise.  However, as many tourists note in their reviews, nothing is heard in the apartments.  The only thing that may not be very comfortable is sitting on the balcony, but you can do without it.  In addition, a number of guests note that due to the warm air leaving the unit, the laundry dries very quickly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Location, Territory </h2><p>  As for the own territory of <span>Dessole Sea Lion Beach Resort</span> Spa 4 * (Vietnam), then, according to our compatriots, it is quite large and very well-groomed.  Here you can take a pleasant walk and find great places for a photo shoot. </p><p>  Many tourists also liked the location of the hotel.  According to them, despite the fact that the hotel is located outside the city and there is nothing interesting nearby, the sea and the beach here are much better than in Nha Trang.  In addition, the surrounding area is much cleaner.  If you want to go to Nha Trang, you can do this using the shuttle service provided by the hotel.  So, the bus goes to the city three times a day.  On the road, according to the guests, it takes 30-40 minutes. </p>
