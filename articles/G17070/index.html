    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  But for starters, it‚Äôs worth adding a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe tariff from Megafon - ‚ÄúGo to Zero‚Äù.  Description (full) will be given a little later.  In the meantime, it is worth considering the general features of this proposal.  After all, it should be of interest to customers. </p><p>  The thing is that our "anti-crisis" tariff plan is aimed primarily at communicating with Megafon subscribers.  That is, they will have the main advantages.  For example, a free conversation within the home region.  This is what attracts customers. </p><p>  Plus, the operator "MegaFon" tariff "Go to zero", a description of which we will learn a little later, implies the absence of a monthly fee.  This allows customers to easily control the money spent, as well as replenish the account on time.  And this cannot but rejoice. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Roaming <span>"Go to zero" ("Megaphone") is</span> also quite gentle.  In the same way as calls within Russia and abroad.  This tariff plan, in other words, suits very sociable customers.  And even to travelers.  Why?  Let's figure it out. </p><h2>  Home Region Calls </h2><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is the cost of calls within your home region.  What can be said in this regard about the tariff in question from the Megafon operator?  ‚ÄúGo to zero‚Äù collects positive reviews thanks to this particular point.  More precisely, they begin with this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone go to zero reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874506.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The thing is that if you decide to chat with other Megafon subscribers, the first 20 minutes of the conversation will be absolutely free.  And after this time, in a minute you have to give only 60 cents.  In fact, it is not as expensive as it might seem. </p><p>  Megafon has a ‚ÄúGo to Zero‚Äù tariff, the description of which we will learn on the sly, is also quite beneficial for conversations with subscribers of other mobile operators.  But here, as clients note, there are several scenarios.  The first is if you have the All Calls package connected.  In this case, a minute of conversation will cost you 60 kopecks.  If there is no such package, then the cost doubles.  1 ruble 20 kopecks is also the cost of any calls to the city numbers of your region.  Compared with other operators, the tariff "Go to zero" from "Megaphone" is a truly anti-crisis solution.  But do not dwell on this.  After all, this plan has a number of advantages that we have to learn. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  In Russia </h2><p>  Well, the "Go to zero" tariff is also suitable for those who like to communicate outside the home region.  For example, throughout Russia. </p><p>  The fact is that this tariff plan will allow you to call Megafon numbers across the country rather cheaply - at 3 rubles per minute.  But with the rest of the operators, as well as city numbers, things are worse.  You will pay 12.5 rubles per minute.  In principle, if you compare with other mobile operators, then TP "Megaphone" - "Go to zero" - this is just one of the most profitable options. </p><p>  For example, the same Beeline asks for 10 rubles for a conversation with its subscribers in Russia, as well as 15 rubles per minute when choosing a dialogue with another mobile operator.  If you count the benefits, you can make sure that it will be quite large.  Thus, the company "MegaFon" "Go to zero" receives positive reviews in the field of conversations within Russia.  But there are also a couple of points that simply cannot be ignored.  Which ones?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff go to zero" class="if" height="271" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874507.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  For travelers </h2><p>  Before you think about whether to turn off "Go to zero" ("Megaphone") or connect it, it is important to know one more thing that we did not touch on.  This is nothing but talk outside of Russia.  After all, now subscribers have a lot of friends around the world.  And that is why it is important to know what the dialogue with a friend or family will result in at this rate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  So, for example, in the <span>Baltic countries</span> and the CIS, in South Ossetia and Georgia, in Abkhazia and Ukraine, you can call, paying only 35 rubles per minute.  Calls to Europe cost a little more - 55 rubles.  And if you want to call any other, most distant points of the Earth, you will have to pay 97 rubles.  In fact, this is not so much. </p><p>  Many customers note that the same Beeline for any conversation outside of Russia asks from 100 rubles per minute.  And these are unprofitable, significant expenses.  As you can see, the benefits of our today's tariff are visible to the naked eye.  Nevertheless, here all the positive aspects do not end there.  After all, the "Go to zero" tariff also implies very favorable prices for Internet and messages. </p><h2>  SMS + MMS </h2><p>  In general, messages are now used very often.  Therefore, it is important to come up with a proposal that will certainly affect this area of ‚Äã‚Äãcommunication between people.  The fact is that customers, choosing one or another tariff plan, quite often pay attention to this item. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone go to zero description" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874508.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Fortunately, the operator "Megafon" tariff "Go to zero", the description of which is coming to an end, there is a very favorable offer.  But here, there were some surprises.  After all, customers have 2 alternatives that leave their mark on the cost of messages. </p><p>  In cases when you have a special SMS XXS service package connected, all outgoing ‚Äúletters‚Äù will cost you ... nothing.  They will be free.  But only within your home region.  If there are no additional service packages, then you will have to pay 1.5 rubles for 1 message within your region, as well as 3 rubles for ‚Äúletters‚Äù to any operators throughout Russia.  This is a very advantageous offer that no one else has. </p><p>  But with MMS, everything is much simpler.  As many clients note (and exactly the same information is reported by the official Megafon website), the cost of an outgoing message is only 7 rubles.  Unlike other mobile operators, this is a very advantageous offer.  So, for example, MTS and Beeline for 1 such message request from 10 to 20 rubles.  It seems to be not such a big difference, but it will become noticeable over time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="roaming go to zero megaphone" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874514.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  About the Internet </h2><p>  In truth, it‚Äôs pretty hard to imagine a client without the Internet right now.  And precisely for this reason, Megafon has an interesting proposal.  It applies to the "Go to zero" tariff. </p><p>  When you connect a special package of services "Internet XS" (monthly fee is 150 rubles), you will not pay for the downloaded data.  That is, for 150 rubles you will have <span>unlimited Internet on</span> favorable terms and with good speed. </p><p>  The second scenario is the absence of connected service packages.  In this case, you will be charged 9.9 rubles for 1 megabyte of data.  In reality, this is not so much as it might seem at first glance. </p><h2>  How to go </h2><p>  Well, if you decided to connect to the Megafon company "Go to zero", then you will be provided with a wide variety of options for action.  The first is a visit to the nearest office of a mobile operator.  There you can buy a new SIM card with a tariff, as well as change it on your own.  To do this, inform the office worker about the idea. </p>

      <p></p>
    <p>  In addition, you can use the Internet and the official page of the mobile operator.  There you will have to log in and go to the "My Account".  Next, select "Tariffs", find there "Go to 0", and then click on the "Connect" button.  And all the problems have been resolved. </p><p>  Plus, you can call the operator and ask directly during the conversation to change the tariff plan.  Dial 0500, and then wait for an answer.  Talk about your intentions and expect a notification about the successful processing of the request. </p><p>  You can also send an SMS message with the text "2" to the number 000146. This function is implemented for free.  Within 10-15 minutes you will receive a notification about a successful change of tariff plan. </p><h2>  What do customers think </h2><p>  Well, <span>Megafon‚Äôs ‚ÄúGo to Zero‚Äù tariff plan, the</span> description of which is presented above, is considered anti-crisis and very profitable.  But what do customers think of him? </p><p>  In general, the reviews are really positive.  Here and SMS, and MMS, and calls to Russia ... The only thing that is not very happy is the Internet.  More precisely, its cost without additional options connected.  But those customers who have already connected themselves to the Internet XS service package, note that their hopes are fully justified. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disable go to zero megaphone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874510.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In general, if you are in doubt whether it is worth changing the tariff, then buy yourself a separate SIM card for a month and see if "Go to zero" suits you.  If the answer is yes, then simply select the appropriate method for changing the tariff, and then implement it. </p>
