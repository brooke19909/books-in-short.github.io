    <p>  So, in general, <span>virtual cards</span> of the Visa or Master Card payment system are special types of cards intended for making payments for purchases or making other payments via the Internet.  Typically, such cards do not have tangible media, respectively, with their help you can not pay in a regular store or get money at an ATM. </p><p>  Why is Yandex.Money virtual bank card best suited for online payments?  Its main advantage is an increased level of security when making payments, as well as an additional guarantee that your main card will not suffer from the disappearance of money in an unknown direction. </p><p>  You've probably already heard about phishing, which is a separate type of plastic card fraud when making payments via the Internet.  What dangers may lie in wait for a simple card holder?  For example, you have decided to purchase goods through an online store and are going to pay for the purchase with a simple card.  To confirm the payment, you will have to indicate the card number in full, and in most situations also a special three-digit security code.  It is understandable that, theoretically, the store can use the information received for its own purposes, and an attacker who intercepts the data will be able to make a payment for a purchase in another online store. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  If you use Yandex.Money, a virtual MasterCard or Visa card, the risks are minimized.  First of all, most of these cards have a limit and a limited duration.  Some cards in general can be used only once, due to which, even with the knowledge of the number and secret code, they cannot be reused.  Other virtual cards with the possibility of reusable use can last for several months, but they have a limited cash limit, that is, attackers, even if they wish, will not cause you significant damage. </p><p>  Yandex.Money is a <span>virtual card (Visa</span> or MasterCard), which can be used only once.  For example, you need to pay something - created a card, set a certain limit for payments, paid for the purchase. </p><p>  When issuing virtual cards, the financial aspect is also important, that is, they are not issued for free, so for each specific case, it should be compared what will be more profitable and safe, to constantly purchase a new card or buy a reusable one. </p><h2>  How to pay with a virtual card? </h2>

    <p>  It is very difficult to challenge the fact that using <span>bank cards is</span> very convenient.  They allow you to pay for purchases in stores, even if there is no cash in your pocket.  But in order to get a card, you should contact the bank branch.  But if you need it only for payments via the Internet, then it is best to arrange a virtual card.  For example, a Yandex.Money bank card (virtual) will allow you to pay via the Internet without any problems.  In addition, with its help you can pay bills for utilities, mobile communications and other payments directly from the couch. </p><h2>  How can I arrange a Yandex.Money virtual card? </h2><p>  Everything is very simple here.  To do this, it‚Äôs not necessary to go somewhere to the office, it will be enough to go to the Yandex website and register an electronic mailbox.  Next, you need to enter your personal account, where you can order a card issue.  To do this, go to the "Money" section and start an electronic wallet.  A card on the Yandex.Money resource is automatically automatically issued to him immediately.  You can create a virtual card yourself.  The site also has a corresponding section.  After the release, the card should be activated, and it can be used. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is much easier to make such a card if you are already a Yandex Mail user.  You can pay with it only purchases made on the Internet. </p><h2>  Card replenishment methods </h2>

    <p>  Before you start using the card you have received, you must top up your account.  There are several ways to carry out this operation and they are divided into three groups: </p><p>  1. Replenishment of the wallet from an existing card. </p><p>  2. Cash replenishment. </p><p>  3. Transferring money from another resource to the Yandex card. </p><p>  If you are a holder of a Visa or Master Card, then go to the recharge section in your account and select the appropriate line from the list.  Then a window will appear in which you must enter the requested details and confirm the transfer to the Yandex.Money card. </p><p>  In addition, the Yandex.Money bank card can also be replenished through an ATM.  This can be done in the following banks: </p><p>  - Sberbank - when replenishing a card account, a commission is not charged even when paying with a card of another bank. </p><p>  - MTS Bank - a replenishment fee is also not charged, but funds can only be credited from cards issued by this bank. </p><p>  - ‚ÄúNeryungribank‚Äù, NOMOS-Bank, RPS ‚ÄúZolotaya Korona‚Äù, <span>‚ÄúUral Bank for Reconstruction</span> and Development‚Äù, ‚ÄúKholmskbank‚Äù, ‚ÄúEnergotransbank‚Äù - these banks also do not charge fees for transfers, but replenishment is carried out only from the card of the corresponding bank. </p><p>  - VTB-24 - a commission is charged for the transfer in the amount of one percent, but not less than fifty and not more than two thousand rubles.  Admission is made only with VTB-24 cards. </p><p>  ‚ÄúGazprombank takes three percent of the commission for such a service, and the transfer is made only from its cards. </p><p>  - Uraltransbank charges a commission of three percent.  Transfer can be made from the card of any bank. </p><p>  - Chelyabinvestbank (City system) - the commission is also three percent.  You can transfer funds only from cards of this bank. </p><p>  In order for the Yandex.Money virtual card to be successfully replenished through an ATM, you need to have a card of the corresponding bank.  The only exception is Sberbank, as through its terminals you can pay even in cash.  In addition, you must know <span>the account number</span> in Yandex.Money.  If you replenish your account through an ATM, the payment amount will have a limit of fifteen thousand rubles.  As for the commission, it is better to specify it in advance at the payment acceptance point. </p>

    <p>  If there is no card available, then there is a great opportunity to replenish your account in cash: </p><p>  - Through self-service terminals.  Using this method, you should carefully look at the amount of the commission charged.  Some terminals do not take it at all, while in others it can reach ten percent. </p><p>  - Make payment at the partner offices of this payment system.  Here, also, the commission can reach seven percent.  Before payment, this point must be clarified. </p><p>  - Use a translation system, for example, Contact, Unistream or Russian Post. </p><p>  When replenishing the <span>Yandex.Money</span> wallet <span>in cash,</span> the same restrictions are set as when paying with a bank card.  You just need to name your account number and the amount of up to fifteen thousand rubles.  You can also make a transfer from your Web Money wallet.  The commission for such a transfer is about five percent. </p><h2>  Yandex.Money virtual card - how to pay for purchases? </h2>

    <p>  After the card is issued and replenished its account, you can proceed to pay for purchases.  The scheme is very simple and general for all stores on the Internet.  Due to the fact that the Yandex.Money virtual card has a MasterCard payment system, during payment it will be necessary to indicate the card details and confirm the payment. </p><p>  When choosing a payment method, you must be careful and make sure that you choose the online payment with a MasterCard card.  In another situation, you will have to pay for the goods upon receipt and not with a virtual, but with a regular card. </p><h2>  Tariffs, limits and commissions </h2><p>  When paying for purchases via the Internet, one should remember about the fees charged, which have not only regular cards, but also a Yandex.Money virtual card.  User reviews on this issue indicate that the amount of commissions is not so great, so using the card is very convenient.  Accordingly, the costs will be slightly higher than expected. </p><h2>  What is the commission for? </h2><p>  Additional payment will be charged during the following operations: </p><p>  1. Top-up of Yandex.Money account.  Depending on which method is used for this operation, the commission can vary from 0 to 10 percent.  This question must be clarified when translating. </p><p>  2. If you withdraw funds from the card account, then a commission of three percent will be charged + another 15 rubles.  If you use a payment system, for example, Contact, to withdraw, then an additional commission may also be charged, but by the system itself. </p><p>  3. Issue of a finished Yandex card will be free, but if necessary, delivery by mail will have to pay 149 rubles (if delivery is within the country) or 199 rubles (if delivery is necessary abroad). </p><p>  4. When transferring funds to a virtual card account, there is a one-time payment limit, which is fifteen thousand rubles. </p><h2>  What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Yandex.Money card? </h2><p>  The card is issued very quickly and easily.  This requires only a computer with the Internet.  Among the advantages of this card are the following: </p><p>  1. It is convenient to pay for purchases in online stores. </p><p>  2. The ability to pay for purchases through the Google Play or App Store. </p><p>  3. Payment of cellular communication without commission. </p><p>  4. Payment of various bills automatically. </p><p>  Be sure to remember about a possible commission for payments, so you should calculate your costs in advance.  In addition, you should definitely take care of security.  Never and under no circumstances tell your username and password to anyone in order not to get into the situation of unauthorized use of funds by third parties. </p>
