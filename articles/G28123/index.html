    <p>  Hotel Sea <span>Sun Hotel 4 * (on the</span> map it is clearly visible) is located in the Gulf of Aqaba, separating Arabia and ancient Sinai. </p><h2>  Dahab </h2><p>  The town is located in the desert, at the foot of the Sinai Mountains, next to the resorts of Egyptian Sharm El Sheikh (just 100 km) and Israeli Eilat (150 km), so Sea Sun Hotel 4 * Dahab is located in a vibrant tourist area. </p><p>  In ancient times, Dahab was an important trading port, which is mentioned in the Bible, in the Book of Moses, as the settlement of Dizahab.  The ruins of a sea fortress and a lighthouse have survived to our times. </p><p>  Dizahab is translated from Hebrew as ‚Äúplace of gold‚Äù, and Dahab in Arabic means ‚Äúgold‚Äù.  The origin of this name has traditionally been associated with the color of sand, which fills the entire valley to the Red Sea. </p><p>  But recently, geologists have indeed found gold in the vicinity of Dahab.  And now, tourists, vacationing at Sea <span>Sun Hotel 4 *,</span> can say that they live in a real "golden city". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Despite the fact that the local population in Dahab is only 10 thousand people, this town is a center of diving, windsurfing and kitesurfing due to its climate, location and structure of the seabed. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Most of the year on the coast, where the Hotel Sea Sun 4 * <span>(Egypt, Dahab) is located, is</span> dry and warm.  Rains are rare, as constant winds simply blow away the moisture evaporating from the sea and prevent rain clouds from forming. </p><p>  Winds are born in the Sinai mountains, which rise on the coast of the Gulf of Aqaba, they blow away not only the clouds, but also the heat, so the Sea Sun Hotel 4 * is not as stuffy as in Sharm.  To the delight of numerous surfers, a "tailwind" blows in Dahab 270 days a year. </p><p>  It is warm in winter (+ 20-25 <sup>o</sup> ), and in summer + 35-40 <sup>o</sup> .  Water (even at depth) - +21 degrees in the winter and +28 degrees in the summer. </p><h2>  Sea and diving </h2><p>  The width of the Gulf of Aqaba is about 25 km, so on the beaches around the Sea Sun Hotel 4 * there is no strong surf and high waves. </p><p>  There are many coral reefs located close to the coast, so you can dive not from a boat, but from pontoons off the coast.  Due to this, sea diving in Dahab are cheaper than in other Egyptian resorts. </p><p>  The beauty of Dahab's coral reefs is recognized around the world, and many guests from different countries come here to see the real world of the sea. </p>

    <p>  Not far from the Sea Sun Hotel 4 * is a famous natural monument - the Blue Hole, which attracts divers from all over the world.  This is an underwater cave with a diameter of 50 meters, extending 130 meters vertically down.  If you dive to a depth of about 55 meters, you can find a passage that connects this "lost world" with the sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But for ordinary tourists an easier route has been developed, and they can penetrate the Blue Hole through the isthmus, descending only 7 meters under the water.  Inexperienced divers are advised to dive into the Blue Hole only with professional instructors. </p>

    <p>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãbeaches adjacent to the Sea Sun Hotel 4 *, there are many other underwater grottoes and coral reefs, where you can see interesting animals and fish. </p><p>  Dahab seems to have been created for diving, as the reefs are located close to the shore, there are no big waves on the surface, and there are no strong currents under water. </p><p>  More than 60 dive centers and 30 dive sites operate for tourists, where you can dive to a depth of 200 meters. </p><h2>  Windsurfing, Kitesurfing and Snorkeling </h2><p>  Tourists from different countries come to Dahab year-round to ride the sea on the boards with a sail or a kite. </p><p>  Not far from Sea Sun Hotel 4 * Dahab is the famous lagoon.  This is a coastal bay, separated from the sea by a sand spit, which protects and protects surfers.

    <p>  Meals also correspond to the price of the voucher.  The food is simple and satisfying, although a bit monotonous.  The menu includes meat, vegetables, fish, sweets and fruits. </p><p>  Often in positive reviews there is a small size and compactness of the hotel and infrastructure, when everything is nearby and there is no need to spend extra time and effort walking on long halls, stairs and passages, as in many other hotels. </p><p>  The hotel has excellent massage therapists.  According to tourists, massage sessions in Sea San are much better than in other hotels. </p><p>  True, there are also not quite positive reviews about the hotel Sea Sun Hotel 4 * (Dahab).  They include a description of some of the disadvantages. </p><p>  Many tourists talk about salt water from a faucet in the room, faulty plumbing and air conditioning, which are often difficult to turn off. </p><p>  The presence of flies in rooms and restaurants is noted (it is interesting that hotel employees use a kind of stun gun against them - an electric fly swatter).  Also, the hotel is often dusty (affects the proximity of the desert). </p><p>  The reviews also mention old bedding and battered hotel furniture, and there are broken sun loungers and <span>beach umbrellas.</span> </p><p>  On the forums you can find a lot of various reviews about the hotel "Sea Sun" (that is how the name "Sea Sun" is translated).  Quite often, if the Sea Sun Hotel 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh) is mentioned somewhere, these reviews usually refer to the Sea Sun Hotel in Dahab, just sometimes the name of the nearest big resort city is included in the name of the hotel. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Staying at the hotel, you can: </p><ul><li>  to make an excursion to the Monastery of St. Catherine on the site of the biblical Burning Dome, which is famous for ancient frescoes;  it was founded next to a church built at the beginning of our era; </li><li>  make a dawn climb to <span>Mount Sinai,</span> where pilgrims from all over the world gather to atone for sins and repeat the path of Moses, who received the tablets of the covenant from the Lord here; </li><li>  look at an interesting natural monument - the Colorful Canyon, which was formed as a result of an earthquake centuries ago and is a gorge with sandstone cliffs with amazing patterns of different colors; </li><li>  go to the marine conservation area of ‚Äã‚ÄãRas Muhammad (Head of Muhammad), which in ancient times was called the Poseidon Cape, where rare species of fish and species of coral live, and in the Magic Lake water is twice as salty than in the sea; </li><li>  take an excursion to the Pharaonic island with an ancient crusader fortress. </li></ul><p>  The most popular excursions related to the subjects of the Bible are a trip to the monastery, surrounded by sand, and climbing to Sinai. </p>

    <p>  Also, many tourists go to sea on a boat with a bottom made of transparent material, when you can watch life on coral reefs without immersion in water. </p><p>  If time permits, you can make longer trips and visit Sharm el-Sheikh, Cairo, Luxor and other cities and historical monuments of Egypt, go on a camel trip in the <span>Arabian desert,</span> stay in Bedouin villages and so on. </p><h2>  Tips for travelers at Sea Sun Hotel 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh) </h2><p>  In connection with shallow water, it is better to enter the sea not from the coast, but from pontoons. </p><p>  You should not go barefoot on the beach, as the coastal area is covered with corals, stones and sea urchins.  You need to use special slippers, they can be bought right on the spot for $ 5-7 or brought with you. </p><p>  The hotel does not accept Russian-language television channels, but there is Internet access.  In this regard, many tourists bring laptops so as not to miss in the evenings. </p><p>  The hotel staff only speaks Arabic or English, so you should bring along a dictionary or phrasebook. </p><p>  It is best to bring instant tea and coffee bags (boiling water can be taken at the bar), and fruits, soft drinks and spirits to buy in Dahab (the cheapest is in the Assala area). </p><p>  Diving and snorkeling equipment can be rented, but it is better to bring your mask and snorkel. </p><p>  No need to take tours for excursions at the hotel or the Pegasus agency, it is much cheaper to buy tickets in Dahab. </p><p>  The staff will be very friendly with tourists, if tourists are friendly themselves.  The smile returns to those who smile. </p><p>  On vacation it is always more fun to be in a big company, so you should try to make friends with other tourists. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Arriving at Sea Sun Hotel, tourists get the opportunity to spend their holidays economically and in a relaxed atmosphere, as well as get great impressions from sea bathing, windsurfing or kitesurfing, colorful pictures of the underwater world and interesting excursions. </p>
