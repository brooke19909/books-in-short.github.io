    <h2>  Oysters T102 MS 3G </h2><p>  Is this brand famous?  Not.  Perhaps this is why tablets are cheaper, and the functionality is almost the same as in other budget devices.  In addition to the advantages, there is one drawback: reading books on it is inconvenient.  Naturally, books are best read on tablets that are close in size to real books.  A gadget with a screen of 10.1 inches is suitable for other tasks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most budget tablet" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1042204.jpg" width="485"></div>

    <p>  It‚Äôs good to show presentations to a small audience, go to various sites.  Still convenient to print.  If you enable the virtual keyboard, you can write books and articles.  Fingers will fall on the desired letters. </p><p>  Owners of Oysters T102 MS 3G are happy with this device.  Most people buy it, because they are not afraid that children can break it or break it.  Almost at the present time it is the most budget tablet with such a large screen. </p><h2>  BB-Mobile Techno 10.1 3G TM056Z </h2><p>  This is another budget tablet, 10 inches <strong> </strong>  - diagonal of its screen.  It should be noted right away that the processor is dual-core.  Fans of computer games such a device will not work, because the application will slow down.  As for the other functions, everything is there.  The tablet has two slots for SIM cards. </p><p>  The whole family can watch movies, listen to music and surf the Internet.  Communication is good enough, fast data transfer.  Such a tablet, unfortunately, will not fit in a small bag; more space needs to be provided for it.  But on it it is convenient to type text using the virtual keyboard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the best budget tablet" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/1042579.jpg" width="503"></div><strong></strong>

    <p>  The rear camera has a resolution of 5 megapixels, which is commendable for such cheap equipment.  Not every budget tablet can boast of this.  But at the same time, the front camera has only 0.3 megapixels.  When communicating via Skype, it can cause discomfort to the interlocutor. </p><h2>  What can I advise in conclusion </h2><p>  The article lists the most rated tablets from the budget line, whose prices as of the second half of 2015 are no more than 10,000 rubles in many online stores.  Which is the best budget tablet among the above, it's up to the owners only.  Each person has their own opinions and preferences.  Some may praise technology, while others scold.  No one is safe from defective products. </p><p>  When searching for the right tablet, it is recommended to focus on what size the screen should be and what the purpose is.  Inexpensive tablets, as a rule, are equipped with processors with a number of cores of 2 or 4. It must be said right away that a dual-core processor is not suitable for heavy games, therefore it should not be taken for such purposes.  And 4 cores are enough for virtual entertainment. </p><p>  As for the screen size, it also has important factors: what is a tablet for?  How will it be exploited?  Indeed, for example, a large screen is not suitable for reading, your eyes will get tired.  On the contrary, in order to fully spend time on the Internet, it is desirable to have a large screen.  And if both?  Then the golden mean will do.  Indeed, many cheap tablets have a screen diagonal of 7 to 10 inches approximately.  So, you should choose a device with a screen of 8-9 inches. </p><h2>  Important Acquisition Guidelines </h2><p>  Currently, many manufacturers make the equipment short-lived.  If you want the tablet to last for many years, and not a couple of seasons, then it is better to take the one on which it will be possible to replace the battery.  Indeed, most often the problem arises precisely in it.  There is no replacement, it is impossible to work.  Even if a battery lives only with a charger or a USB cable, you won‚Äôt be able to use it especially. </p><p>  Do you need to choose a budget tablet?  A review of any device will help to understand the necessity or uselessness of a thing.  A cautious person will buy proven equipment.  Most often, a large number of reviews have accumulated not a couple of months after the publication of a particular model, but several years later they are already being removed from sale.  Everything changes very quickly, so it is better for a conservative user to have a durable equipment. </p>
