However, over time, any technique can fail, which is very frustrating.  Especially when there is no substantial amount of money to purchase a replacement.  The reasons for the breakdown of such household appliances can be many. </p><p>  Experts say that one of the most common problems is the breakdown of the water level sensor in the washing machine.  It is called a pressure switch.  It is this part that is responsible for ensuring that the required amount of water enters the tank of the machine. </p><p>  What information do users need to know about the level switch when there are problems with the amount of water in the tank, as a result of which the washing machine stops working?  How to check the water level sensor and is there a chance that you can fix the breakdown yourself?  We‚Äôll talk about this. </p>

    <h2>  What is a pressure switch and what does it look like? </h2><p>  Visually, it might seem that such an important function simply cannot be performed due to such a small round object.  Two wires are connected to it, which communicate with the tank of the washing machine.  It is in this way that liquid is replenished in the main tank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When water enters the tank through the wires, pressure is applied to the pressure switch in proportion to the water level.  When the required volume is gained, a certain signal is automatically transmitted, with the help of which the fence stops.  Modern models of washing machines are capable of collecting liquid according to the amount of loaded laundry.  This important function significantly saves the consumption of cold water and the energy that is spent on its heating. </p>

    <h2>  How to understand that the pressure switch is faulty? </h2><p>  As already noted, any modern model of the washing machine is equipped with a pressure switch.  Thanks to this mechanism, depending on the choice of the washing mode and the weight of the loaded things, the required amount of liquid is calculated.  In the event that <span>the</span> water <span>level sensor</span> in the washing machine becomes unusable, then the operation of the unit itself is disrupted. </p><p>  It is no secret that for each mode used a different volume of liquid is needed.  To understand that <span>the water level sensor</span> in the washing machine is out of order is not always easy.  The main symptoms that may indicate that repair or replacement of the pressure switch is required are as follows: </p><ol><li>  The amount of water needed is no longer monitored by the sensor.  That is, too much liquid can enter the tank or, conversely, extremely little. </li><li>  If after full execution of the program, which includes the spin cycle, or after using the "Spin" mode, the laundry remains very damp.  Of course, this state of things can be explained by the number of revolutions that are set by the program.  But if water flows from the laundry after spinning, this is the first sign that the water level sensor in the washing machine did not work. </li><li>  After washing, the water does not go to the end. </li><li>  Even if the rinse function is turned on, the washing machine does not perform it. </li></ol>

As a rule, all settings for specific washing modes are made when the product is assembled by specialists at the factory.  In addition, the position of the screws must be marked with a bright marker or paint. </p><p>  It is highly recommended not to change the adjustment on your own, because if you make a mistake, this can lead to disruption of the entire device.  Certain washing modes may stop working.  In addition, the filling level of the tank will be incorrect. </p><h2>  Is it possible to repair the pressure switch by myself? </h2><p>  As for the repair work of the water sensor itself, it is unlikely that you can do without the help of specialists.  First of all, you should find out if it makes sense to repair it.  Indeed, most often the purchase of a new pressostat is much cheaper than the repair of an old part. </p><p>  But any predictions can be made only after establishing how serious the failure is.  If a person does not have technical knowledge in this matter, then it is best not to try to repair the water level sensor of the washing machine yourself. </p>

    <h2>  How to replace the water sensor? </h2><p>  Before going to the store where component parts for household appliances are sold, it is worth rewriting the name and model of the washing machine.  The safest option is to purchase a pressostat in specialized stores.  Or you can contact the manufacturer‚Äôs service center directly, which will give more guarantees of the right choice. </p><p>  Replacing the water level sensor in the washing machine itself does not require special skills or knowledge.  Therefore, it can be implemented independently.  If the "master" first performs such repairs of his equipment, it is worth pre-photographing how the part is connected. </p><p>  To begin with, it is worth disconnecting the old water level sensor in the washing machine from all wires and contacts.  Then put the new pressure switch in the place of the old model.  After that, we begin to gradually attach it to the hose, then to the contacts.  After the successful completion of the whole process, we return the case to its place, try to turn the washing machine on idle. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The pressure switch is an indispensable part in the washing machine, because without it, the equipment simply cannot perform a number of the functions that are prescribed to it.  In this case, the hostess will add trouble.  She will also have to return to the old method of drying clothes. </p><p>  Finally, it is worth noting that each manufacturer has its own system of screws, valves and wires.  Therefore, when replacing the pressure switch, you should not purchase it from other manufacturers, since it may not only not be suitable for the existing model, but also cause further disruptions in the operation of the washing machine. </p><p>  For example, if the manufacturer is the well-known company Bosh, then you should contact the service center of this particular company.  When specifying the model of the washing machine, consultants will be able to choose the appropriate water sensor on their own.  The only thing is, if the warranty period has already expired, the new pressure switch will have to be paid separately. </p>
