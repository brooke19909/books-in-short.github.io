    <p>  The pioneer for the brand in this segment was the Sho-Me Combo 1 model. Moreover, the situation at that time was such a state of things that many were able to make radar detectors, but there was a problem with high-quality performance.  The first model came out more or less successful, both in the opinion of the owners of the gadget and in the opinion of critics.  The only thing that seriously affected the popularity of the new device was a sudden jump in the dollar exchange rate, as a result of which the reasonable price for this gadget increased sharply, and at the same time, demand fell. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  The brand, which was accustomed to rely on the mass segment, kept the price of the device as low as possible, and by the fall of last year, it launched the next generation hybrid - the Sho-Me Combo 3 DVR-radar detector. The task for the new gadget was quite simple: not so much to replace the first model is how much to make it more accessible to the masses.  And this, in principle, turned out for the company: having almost the same parameters as the first model, the new ‚ÄúCombo 3‚Äù began to cost 1-2 thousand rubles cheaper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  <span>The Sho-Me</span> Combo 3 <span>video recorder-radar is</span> made according to the classical scheme for such gadgets, when the main antenna of the radar detector is placed above the main structure. </p>

    <p>  In its usual position, a relatively large screen looks at the driver, under which you can see four functional buttons that serve to navigate the menu and control the gadget.  The keys of the quick control unit are located on the left side of the device.  At about the same place as the control unit, there is a slot for a micro SD standard memory card (up to 32 GB), a video output with an HDMI connector, a memory reset button and a USB interface for connecting to a computer.  Power is located on the back of the case, so it does not interfere with the rest of the keys or access to the memory card. </p><p>  The most remarkable and interesting part of the Sho-Me Combo 3 is the lens, which is stylized as a similar camera.  On it you can see all kinds of notches, buttons made of plastic, which are often asked by non-discerning Internet users.  All these buttons on the lens are needed exclusively for beauty - and that‚Äôs it.  Of course, I would really like to have functional control, as on a real lens, but alas, the Sho-Me Combo 3 is a video recorder with a radar detector, and not a camera. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the package you can see a pretty strong bracket that easily attaches to the top of the gadget, and there is also a <span>power adapter</span> for the cigarette lighter socket.  Moreover, it is worth noting that the adapter is made in a brand-specific doll-style: inside there is another interface for another adapter. </p><h2>  Stuffing Sho-Me Combo 3 </h2><p>  The overview of the terrain and the video image are broadcast due to the Ambarella A2S60 processor.  This is a time-tested chip that does not have enough stars from the sky, but it adequately copes with the video stream.  After the six-layer glass lens, the sensible OmniVision sensor from the 2710 series is installed, which allows you to get a good viewing angle (about 135 degrees horizontally and vertically). </p>

    <p>  The sensor itself has good photosensitivity, while the dynamic range is noticeably underestimated.  The gadget is equipped with one gigabyte of internal memory, which for the most part is occupied by radar databases, as well as a relatively good rechargeable battery (built-in type) at 280 mAh. </p><h2>  Functional </h2><p>  Radar detector Sho-Me Combo 3 is designed for video recording of traffic conditions, alerts the owner about the location of radars that control the high-speed mode, and cameras for monitoring the movement of vehicles. </p><p>  The gadget uses a proven combined way of assessing the situation: a database of static cameras that control speed, a base of traffic police posts and a microwave receiver in the gigahertz range.  This comprehensive solution allows you to quickly and correctly assess the traffic situation and the operation of static control cameras. </p>

    <p>  All communication with the databases is carried out through the built-in GPS-receiver.  All information is stored in the internal memory of Sho-Me Combo 3 and, if desired, can be updated by the user.  Owner reviews also note one interesting point that many analogues lack: the satellite data is used in the video stream fixation system for the device, which is indispensable in some situations. </p><h2>  Device setup </h2><p>  The functionality of Sho-Me Combo 3 is built in such a way that the menus of the DVR and the radar detector are on different buttons.  Radar settings are called up by keys on the left side of the gadget.  The DVR control is located under the display. </p><h2>  DVR </h2><p>  At the time of the first power-up, you must check or uncheck the box that allows recording, and at the same time set the resolution of the video stream (up to 1920 x 1080 pixels).  Next, you need to set the duration of the video recording (from one to five minutes).  There is no need to set the clock, just specify your GMT time zone, after which the automation will set the correct time (full synchronization with the satellite). </p>

    <p>  Judging by the reviews of the owners, setting the sensitivity value above the average is not worth it, as there is a risk of double clicking.  It will be useful to check whether the option to print a stamp is included in the video and whether the vehicle number is entered.  Some complain about such a dreary and long first start in Sho-Me Combo 3, but all these procedures will need to be done only once. </p><h2>  Radar detector </h2><p>  First you need to determine the mode of the radar detector, for which the main points will be set up: ‚Äúhighway‚Äù, ‚Äúcity 1‚Äù and ‚Äúcity 2‚Äù.  All items are configured individually and depend on many external factors. </p>

    <p>  Next, you can set the <span>volume</span> limit for the <span>notification</span> and select the greeting style.  As additional audio settings, it is possible to change the sound ping for each mode and type of triggered range.  Many users in their reviews recommend leaving the hazard warning distance set to ‚Äúautomatically‚Äù.  Then the range will vary depending on the current speed of the vehicle: over 71 km / h - 1 km, less than 69 km / h - 800 m and up to 29 km / h - 600 m. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  Of the advantages of the model, one can note the presence of an up-to-date base of speed cameras and stationary radars of the road service.  Also, many owners liked the sensitivity of the radar detector.  It should be noted convenient filtering alerts, which can be configured according to the speed of your car. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings, the low dynamic range of filming is clearly evident.  This is probably the only fly in the ointment.  Otherwise, for its segment, the gadget was a success and showed a very good value for money. </p><p>  It can be recommended to almost any car enthusiast: a nice design, simple and, most importantly, separate hybrid control, as well as a relatively low price.  On popular Internet resources, the price tag varies from 7.5 to 8.5 thousand rubles, which is quite acceptable for the average car owner, especially since a device of this kind pays off very quickly on our roads.  The verdict is unambiguous - it is recommended for purchase (relevant for middle-class cars). </p>
