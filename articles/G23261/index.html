  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Basic concepts of legal understanding and modern consciousness</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The attitude to law as legislative norms that must be respected, its understanding in many respects depends on the national specifics of society, the social conditions in which it lives, on the legal education of at least most of its members.  Basic legal concepts reflect this. </p><p>  It is no secret that respect for law and law obedience is greater in those countries whose cultural, historical, ethical and ethnic traditions are based on the establishment of the rule of law as the basis for ensuring the external and internal stability of life.  The standard of living in such countries is quite high, the economic situation is stable, and society itself has a good command of legal and legal literacy, is well aware of its rights and obligations, is able to uphold the former and abides by the latter. </p><p>  The basic concepts of legal understanding are based on such areas as regulatory law, moral law and sociological law. </p><p>  <strong>Classification</strong> </p><ol><li>  Regulatory Law.  This is a system of legal norms that are published by the state.  It also protects these norms, controls that they are respected by citizens, and punishes them if they are violated.  In fact, in this case, you can put an equal sign between law and law.  Those.  the legal framework states that law and legislation are one and the same.  In this case, law as some kind of system of norms and law as a legal form differ not in their essence, not in essence, but only formally. </li><li>  <span>Sociological law.</span>  The defining concept for this direction is the thesis ‚Äúlaw in action‚Äù.  Those.  law is equal to a certain order in society.  The legislative system acts as part of the law.  But the current law in itself is correlated with the system of social relations.  And legal norms only reinforce or condemn those intra-family relations, the citizen‚Äôs relations with state power, the legal relation to property that already exists, has developed historically and is undergoing some changes under the influence of time and new living conditions. </li><li>  Moral law.  Modern concepts of legal understanding note that justice should be based not only on legal principles, but also on moral ones.  It is then that justice will be ensured in relation to citizens.  Therefore, law and morality must be in solid unity.  Thus, in this concept, law is associated with justice, legislation.  Moreover, if justice is not connected with the law, ceases to meet legal norms and requirements, it will turn into its exact opposite.  <span>Moral norms</span> and ideas of justice must underlie <span>law.</span>  The basic concepts of legal understanding are considered an example of such a merger of moral and legislative law by the Constitutions existing in almost every state, as well as the Declaration of Human Rights, which reflects the basic universal human rights and moral values.  The Declaration is supplemented and concretized by another document - the International Covenant on Civil and <span>Political Rights.</span>  These documents and various amendments to them provide virtually any citizen of any country with protection of personal freedom and observance of generally recognized <span>moral values.</span> </li></ol><p>  The basic concepts of legal understanding have a materialistic foundation.  It was Marx, Engels and Lenin who explained the formation of statehood through socio-economic reasons.  <span>The materialist theory of</span> law is based on the fact that the state has replaced tribal relations and organizations.  And the law has changed the customs prevailing there.  The political system is a new natural <span>stage in the development of society.</span>  And the law is called upon to ensure order in it. </p>
