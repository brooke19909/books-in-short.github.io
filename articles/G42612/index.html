Some come to see Moscow beauties, others - for business, and for others, the city is a transit point, from where they will go further.  In order for all tourists to stay comfortably during their vacation in Moscow, there are many hotels, hostels and five-star hotels.

The cons noted by the guests are not significant shortcomings and can be attributed to the personal perception of the guest.  For example, some tourists thought that the owners of Courtyard Marriott could have updated the furniture in their rooms, while others thought that breakfast prices were unreasonably high. Some reviews also noted plumbing in the bathrooms. These situations are usually resolved within a few hours. </p><p>  The most obvious minus of the hotel accommodation is the location of the rooms relative to the conference room.  The fact is that some apartments are designed in such a way that their windows overlook the conference room.  Noise comes from there, light interferes with sleeping in the evenings and there is no possibility to open a window. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="number fund" class="if uuid-2538731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2538731.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the listed disadvantages, guests still find more advantages.  They invariably mention the friendly staff, literally guessing all the wishes of customers.  Also, reviews are not complete without mentioning the location of the hotel complex.  Many say that they enjoyed walking day and night in the memorable places of the capital.  In addition, there are a lot of shops and cafes nearby, which they are tempted to look into. </p><p>  Hotel guests recommend it for short visits and long stays. </p>
