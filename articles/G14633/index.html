    <p>  Over the course of its life, the Royal Palace (Brussels) has undergone several reconstructions: it was slightly expanded and rebuilt in some places. </p><p>  The place for the future palace was chosen by Count Luvensky.  He was attracted by some remoteness from the dirty, noisy city center and the hill with which the whole province was visible.  This place as a symbol of royal power was used not only by the monarchs of Belgium, but also by the Netherlands and Flanders.  It was here that Charles V ruled the empire, and here he was abdicated. </p><p>  Radically, both the Royal Palace (Brussels) and the surrounding area changed at the beginning of the 19th century.  The construction, turned into ashes, was restored by King <span>William I.</span> He also laid down a gorgeous park with flower beds and a large garden.  And in 1831, the coronation of Leopold I took place on the square in front of the palace. He ascended the throne thanks to a popular uprising that began near the theater located near the residence.  Therefore, historians say that the kingdom of Belgium began from this palace, where the rule of the Oran family was proclaimed: William and Napoleon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance and amazing noble chic inside </h2><p>  The facade of the palace is quite ascetic: the decor is classic, the color is gray, not a single extra detail.  But how amazing the Royal Palace (Brussels) is inside! </p><p>  For tourists, the residence is open for a little less than two months: from July 21 to the first of September.  The royal chambers are incredibly beautiful. </p><p>  Each ruler contributed to the interior and history of the building. </p><p>  For example, tourists are told that the main staircase appeared under Leopold II.  He decided that such a passage should lead to the Royal Palace (Brussels): alternating green and white marble steps with a railing of the same material, elegant forging and a sculpture of Minerva, symbolizing well-being and peace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Palace, Brussels, photo" class="if" height="490" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1680284.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The official reception hall was decorated by William I, the ruler of the Netherlands.  The highlight is the image of the Dutch lion, the only one in the entire Royal Palace (Brussels).  Photos posted in the article do not convey all the grandeur and solemnity felt inside. </p><p>  Stunning imagination The large white salon owes its beauty to Queen Louise.  For the design of the room, she chose a neoclassical style and visually increased the space with many mirrors with gold decorative inserts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The most amazing places </h2><ol><li>  Halls with collections of arts and crafts, collected in different parts of the world.
