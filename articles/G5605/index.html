    <p>  However, silver is a metal with a wide scope.  Cinema and medicine, photography and the engineering field are not without it.  Silver is also used as a means of investment.  In this regard, it is not inferior to gold.  On the contrary, silver is often used by investors to diversify risks. </p><h2>  Silver as a chemical element </h2><p>  Silver - metal or non-metal?  Of course, metal.  And this can be confirmed by the periodic system drawn up by Mendeleev.  You can find this metal in her first group.  The atomic number of silver is 47. Its atomic mass is 107.8682. </p>

    <p>  Silver is a noble metal that consists of two isotopes.  These are 107Ag and 109Ag.  In addition, more than thirty-five radioactive silver isomers and isotopes have been discovered by science, the mass numbers of which are from 99 to 123. The longest-lived of them - 109Ag - has a half-life of 130 years. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Name origin history </h2><p>  Silver is a metal that attracted the attention of people in ancient times.  The name silver comes from the Sanskrit word argent.  It means "bright."  The Latin "argentum" (silver) has the same roots.  But in this language it means "white." </p><p>  Silver is a noble metal, and it was not ignored by alchemists.  In ancient times, they developed a method for stopping this natural element. </p>

    <p>  In Russian, the metal in question is called ‚Äúsilver‚Äù, in English it sounds like ‚Äúsilver‚Äù, in German - ‚Äúzilber‚Äù.  All these words came from the ancient Indian "sarpa," meaning the moon.  The explanation for this is quite simple.  The sparkle of silver reminded people of the light of a mysterious heavenly body. </p><h2>  History of noble metal </h2><p>  Silver has been familiar to mankind since time immemorial.  The exact date of its discovery is unknown.  However, written sources indicate that jewelry from this metal was made by the ancient Egyptians.  At that time, silver was less common than gold, and therefore valued much higher. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The first mines for the extraction of this <span>natural element</span> were founded by the Phoenicians before our era.  Development was carried out in Cyprus and Corsica, as well as in Spain. </p><p>  As <span>jewelry</span> at that time, silver was fabulously valued.  For example, in Ancient Rome, a salt cell from this beautiful metal was the pinnacle of luxury.  Why is such an element widespread in nature so appreciated by people?  The fact is that mankind knew only native metal.  It was very difficult to find him.  This was prevented by sulfide, which covers all the nuggets with a dark coating. </p><p>  The turning point in the history of silver was the experiments conducted by medieval alchemists.  The purpose of their experiments was to obtain gold from any other metal.  Thus, Europeans managed to extract silver from its compounds with various chemical elements (arsenic, chlorine, etc.). </p><p>  In the history of silver, such personalities as Scheele, Paracelsus and others played a significant role. These scientists studied silver (metal), the properties of its compounds.  As a result, interesting conclusions were made.  So, the fact that this natural element has disinfecting qualities, which were noticed back in ancient times, was confirmed.  For example, the healers of Egypt used silver plates to treat wounds to avoid the formation of pus in them.  The high antibacterial properties of this metal were also appreciated by the aristocracy.  So, for many centuries, silver was a synonym for high-quality and expensive dishes.  By that time, mankind had improved the methods of mining the metal described, which allowed it to be significantly cheaper. </p><p>  Silver was also used as a means of settlement.  For this, coins were made from it.  It is silver that the Russians owe the name of the state currency.  For calculations in Russia, the right amount was cut off from <span>silver ingots.</span>  This is how the word "ruble" came into use. </p><h2>  Physical properties </h2><p>  Silver is a metal relatively plastic and soft.  The thinnest wire, the length of which will be almost two kilometers, can be drawn from one gram of it. </p><p>  Silver is a heavy metal having a density of 10.5 grams per cubic centimeter.  According to this indicator, this element is only slightly inferior to lead. </p><p>  Silver is a metal that has no equal in electrical and thermal conductivity.  That is why a spoon made of this substance is heated so quickly in a glass of hot water. </p><p>  What other properties does silver have?  What metal is most often used by jewelers?  Silver is a material that is relatively easy to work with.  This is due to its ability to melt at a temperature of 962 degrees.  This value is relatively low.  In addition, silver is easy to alloy with many other metals to change its characteristics.  So, copper can increase the hardness of this plastic natural element.  When it is added, silver becomes suitable for the manufacture of a variety of products. </p><p>  This amazing element was described in detail by D.I.  Mendeleev.  He also pointed out how to determine metal silver among others.  First of all, the noble component stands out for its whiter and cleaner color.  In addition, silver is so soft that it is easily erased. </p><h2><br>  Chemical properties </h2><p>  How to distinguish silver from metal in finished products?  Rings, chains, spoons, forks, cup holders and old coins begin to fade over time and even turn black.  The reason for this is the effect of hydrogen sulfide on them.  The source of the latter is not only rotten eggs.  Hydrogen sulfide releases rubber and some polymers.  A chemical reaction occurs when there is some moisture.  At the same time, the thinnest sulfide film is formed on the surface of the products.  At first, thanks to the play of light, it seems rosy.  However, the sulfide film gradually thickens.  It darkens, changes its color to brown, and then to black. </p><p>  Silver sulfide cannot be destroyed with strong heating, dissolved in alkalis and acids.  If the film is not very thick, then it is removed mechanically.  It is enough to polish the product with powder or toothpaste with soapy water to restore its shine. </p>

    <p>  How to distinguish silver from metal in other ways?  To do this, observe chemical reactions.  The noble element can be easily dissolved in some acids.  This is nitric and concentrated hot sulfuric, as well as iodine and <span>hydrobromic acids.</span>  If the chemical reaction between silver and hydrochloric acid took place in the presence of oxygen, then its result will be complex noble metal halides. </p><p>  Silver will not interact with nitrogen and hydrogen.  It does not react with carbon.  As for phosphorus, it can act on silver only when it reaches the red-hot temperature at which phosphides are formed.  But noble metal interacts with sulfur quite easily.  When these elements are heated, sulfide is formed.  The same substance can be obtained in the case of exposure to gaseous sulfur on a heated metal. </p><p>  Of interest is the chemical reaction of a noble metal with oxygen.  Silver does not react with it, but it can still dissolve a significant amount of this gas.  This property of the metal when it is heated contributes to the appearance of a very dangerous, but at the same time beautiful phenomenon.  This is a spray of silver.  This phenomenon was known in ancient times. </p><p>  Silver is a metal whose properties allow it, like gold, to easily interact with <span>aqua regia,</span> as well as with hydrochloric acid saturated with chlorine.  As a result of such a reaction, it precipitates into an insoluble precipitate, since poorly soluble chloride is formed.  These differences in the behavior of silver and gold are often used to separate them. </p><p>  The lunar metal is also capable of dissolving in dilute sulfuric acid.  However, for this, silver must be finely dispersed and in contact with oxygen. </p><p>  The noble metal can be dissolved in aqueous solutions of alkaline earth and alkali metals, cyanides, if they are sufficiently saturated with air.  The same reaction occurs when silver comes in contact with an aqueous solution of thiourea, in which there are iron salts. </p><p>  Lunar metal compounds, as a rule, have a positive first oxidation state.  In some elements, this indicator reaches a value of two or three.  However, such silver compounds are not practical. </p><h2>  Biological properties </h2><p>  Silver is a metal (see photo below), which is six times less in living substances than in soils.  In other words, this element is not considered biological. </p>

    <p>  However, a small number of positive silver ions is quite enough for many processes to occur.  For example, since ancient times, the ability of low concentrations of this metal to have a bactericidal effect on drinking water has been known.  Even such a small amount of ions as 0.05 milligrams per liter provides sufficient antimicrobial activity.  Such water can be consumed without fear for your health.  Interestingly, her taste remains unchanged. </p><p>  If there are 0.1 milligrams of silver ions in a liter of liquid, then it can be preserved for one year.  But do not expose the water to boiling.  High temperatures cause silver ions to become inactive. <br>  The bactericidal property of the noble element allows its wide use with the aim of sterilizing drinking water.  So, in some household filters there is activated silver-plated carbon.  This component releases negligible doses of healing ions into the water. </p><p>  The antimicrobial ability of silver finds its application in the disinfection of pools.  In them, water is saturated with bromide of this metal.  A low concentration of AgBr (0.08 mg / L) is harmless to humans and harmful to algae and pathogens. </p><p>  What can explain the bactericidal effect of silver ions?  The fact is that they affect the life of various microbes, interfering with the work of their <span>biological catalysts.</span>  That's exactly what silver does.  What metal is still capable of this?  Such substances include, for example, mercury.  Like silver, it is a heavy metal, but much more toxic.  <span>Mercury chlorides</span> easily dissolve in water, they are dangerous to human health.  Copper has similar properties. </p><h2>  The negative effect of silver </h2><p>  It often happens that a substance that is beneficial to humans in small doses becomes fatal in large quantities.  These elements include silver.  It has been experimentally proved that significant amounts of ions of this metal can reduce immunity in experimental animals, make negative changes in the nerve and vascular tissues of the brain.  Even larger doses damage the liver, thyroid and kidneys.  In practice, cases have been recorded when a person received poisoning from silver preparations, which was accompanied by severe mental disorders.  Fortunately, this element is easily excreted by the body. </p><h2>  Pathological condition caused by lunar metal </h2><p>  In medical practice, an unusual disease occurs, which is called argyria.  It appears in a person if, for many years of his life, he works with silver or its salts.  These substances enter the body in small doses, deposited in the connective tissues, as well as in the walls of the capillaries of the kidneys, bone marrow and spleen.  The external symptoms of this pathology are convincingly indicated by the pictures below. </p><p>  Silver is a metal that gradually accumulates in the mucous membranes and in the skin, giving them a bluish or gray-green color.  At the same time, it becomes especially bright in those parts of the body that are exposed to light.  Sometimes the skin color changes so much that a person becomes like an African. </p>

    <p>  The development of argyria is very slow.  Its first symptoms become noticeable after two to four years of constant work with silver.  The strongest darkening is observed after decades.  First of all, the color of the lips, temples, conjunctiva of the eyes changes.  Then the eyelids darken.  Sometimes the gums and mucous membranes of the oral cavity are stained, as well as the nail holes.  Sometimes argyria manifests itself in the form of small green-blue spots. </p><p>  It is impossible to get rid of this pathology and restore the skin to its former color.  However, in addition to external cosmetic inconveniences, the patient does not complain about anything.  That is why argyria can only conditionally be considered a disease.  This pathology has its own positive side.  A person literally soaked in silver never suffers from infectious ailments.  Healing ions kill all pathogens that enter the body. </p><h2>  Similar metals </h2><p>  Silver is a non-ferrous metal, which is sometimes difficult to distinguish from similar in appearance.  This is not easy to do, but quite real. </p><p>  Silver-like metal can be white gold, cupronickel or aluminum.  How to distinguish them?  Only professionals familiar with the specifics of these metals can determine whether a product is made of silver or white gold.  Doing it yourself at home is not recommended. </p><p>  Externally, these two metals are very similar to each other.  The fact is that in the alloy of white gold is a large percentage of silver.  Only a jeweler is able to distinguish products from these materials, which will calculate the original by density. </p><p>  Silver is a non-ferrous metal that is often confused with cupronickel.  The latter is an alloy of nickel, lead and copper.  Often cupronickel is a production component of silver of various technical samples.  How to distinguish "metal under silver"?  First of all, you must carefully consider the existing product.  On cupronickel there will be no test.  On such products they put only the ‚ÄúMSC‚Äù stamp, which indicates the composition of the alloy (copper, nickel and lead).  Silver differs from alloy in density and weight.  However, only a specialist can establish these characteristics.  At home, you can drip on the product with a solution of iodine.  After that, a stain will remain on silver, but not on cupronickel. </p><p>  Often, aluminum is tried to pass off a noble metal.  However, the latter has significant differences from silver in density, gloss, hardness and color.  They try to sell fake products only in the doorways and various shops.  Such a decoration after a short wear begins to oxidize.  Silver can be distinguished from aluminum with a magnet.  Noble metal will not attract him.  In addition, any physical or chemical effect on aluminum causes a change in its color, appearance and deformation of dimensions. </p><h2>  Silver and jewelry fashion </h2><p>  Due to the availability of this material, a large number of different decorations are made.  Silver - precious metal or not?  Yes, it is in the same group with gold and platinum.  These are noble metals that do not undergo oxidation and corrosion.  They are called precious not only because of their unique properties, but also because of the small reserves contained in the earth's crust. </p><p>  Silver is a universal material.  It equally suits both women and men with different social status and age.  Silver is perfectly combined with enamel, with gold.
