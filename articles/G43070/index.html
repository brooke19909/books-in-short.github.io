    <h2>  Azov coast in the Krasnodar Territory </h2><p>  Perhaps people have heard about the rest in September on the Sea of ​​Azov, located in the Krasnodar Territory.  Some were here and were unhappy.  In these places in the water there are a lot of algae, which are beaten by the current to the shore.  Looking at such a picture, people conclude that the water is muddy and full of dirt. </p><p>  There are so many tourists on the beach that finding a free place is simply unrealistic.  A large concentration of holidaymakers prevents you from fully enjoying the sun and the sea.  However, the situation on the Azov coast of Crimea is completely different. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays on the Sea of ​​Azov in September" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40836/2129280.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Azov coast in Crimea </h2><p>  On the coastline along the Sea of ​​Azov there are many resort villages.  This is a whole strip, which begins with Kerch and ends at the Arab arrow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Vacationers in these places are so few that even in high season it’s not a problem to get comfortable.  The greatest demand on the Sea of ​​Azov in September is enjoyed only by some of the villages: Kerch, Mysovoe and Shchelkino. </p><p>  The beaches are stretched along the coast so that everyone can find a place near the water.  Striking the imagination and their width, which reaches tens of meters.  On the shore there is no feeling of excessive crowding of vacationers and crowding. </p><p>  You get so used to the resulting space that even those who are located ten meters from you begin to get nervous.  Although on some Black Sea beaches people almost closely lie on the sand. </p><p>  Holidays on the Sea of ​​Azov in September in Crimea are much more pleasant, since there are much less algae.  They are, but come across only in some areas.  Enjoying the sea and the sun, tourists simply do not focus on them. <br>  The fact that after a storm along the coast there are a lot of algae brought from the depths cannot be denied.  A completely different situation in Yurkino.  The wide beach is hidden from sea unrest in the bay.  Despite this, the water is almost always full of algae and other debris from the open sea.  Only in full calm, vacationers can enjoy the sea surface. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather on the Sea of ​​Azov in September" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40836/2129281.jpg"></div>

Thanks to its shallower depth, it is warmer and more comfortable for the whole family to relax.  The depth grows very slowly, which allows you to swim quite far.  Many shallows where you can relax away from the coast. </p><p>  Water is heated to the optimum temperature several weeks earlier than in the Black Sea.  If the weather corresponds to the climatic norm, then by May it is already possible to swim in it. </p><p>  Lower salinity provides another advantage.  Going to the beach, the vacationer does not feel the desire to immediately take a shower and wash off the salt from the skin.  The sensations are like swimming in a freshwater reservoir.  This is convenient for those tourists who like to swim along the road and go further along the shore of the Sea of ​​Azov. </p><p>  The Crimean coast is rich in beautiful cliffs, grottoes and bays.  This makes it possible not only to enjoy a beach holiday, but also to admire the picturesque landscapes of these places. </p><p>  Fishing in Azov is a separate issue.  Fans of sitting with a fishing rod take tackle with them on vacation and enjoy a good catch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the sea of ​​azov in september reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40836/2129282.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cons of relaxation on the Sea of ​​Azov </h2><p>  The Sea of ​​Azov in September and other months is not without flaws.  Its beaches are mainly composed of sand and shells.  There are practically no rocky places and reefs.  This means that divers will not find anything interesting here. </p><p>  Another point is the infrastructure.  Settlements located along the coast are practically devoid of it.  To avoid disappointment, you should prepare yourself in advance for the fact that here you will find only relaxation areas, a room for housing, a market, a cafe and a couple of shops.  Fans of night discos, clubs, attractions and other delights of southern relaxation here will not find their usual entertainment. </p><h2>  Weather on the Sea of ​​Azov in September </h2><p>  At this time of the year the water has not cooled yet, but a drop in temperature is already being felt.  Pleased vacationers and reduced prices for apartments.  In the velvet season you can have a good time. </p><p>  Reviews about the Sea of ​​Azov in September are mostly positive, which indicates good weather at this time.  Water temperature is about 18-19 degrees, and air temperature is about 23. </p><p>  In October, it will become cold on the coast, and you won’t want to go into the water.  Therefore, you should not hope that until the last days of September, rest on the Sea of ​​Azov in Crimea will be pleasant in summer. </p><p>  During this period, the revelry of winds begins, which can ruin the rest of tourists: </p><ul><li>  bathing in windy weather is unpleasant in itself; </li><li>  sand in the air; </li><li>  high cloudiness, chance of precipitation. </li></ul><p>  Due to the lack of summer heat, people who can not tolerate high temperatures can relax on the beach.  There are few tourists on the beach, so they do not interfere with each other sunbathing, swimming and playing with children. </p>
