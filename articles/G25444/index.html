    <h2>  History </h2><p>  A desert-native, a native of the Pskov land, Nikandr spent more than 50 years ascetic in an uninhabited area, obeying a command from the temple‚Äôs altar during prayer.  Later this place was called by the name of a saint who healed many sick here.  Before his death, Nikander promised protection to the inhabitants of the hermit desert, and in 1584 a monastery was founded there.  The temple was built by a man who recovered during a prayer to a saint. </p><h2>  Description of the desert during its heyday </h2><p>  The monastery ensemble consisted of: </p><ul><li>  from the five-domed Cathedral of the Annunciation of the Virgin; </li><li>  a stone bell tower with a military clock located above the Holy Gate; </li><li>  abbot's two-story cells; </li><li>  stone oval church, consecrated in the name of St. Gennady. </li></ul><p>  The monastery courtyard was a hexagonal square, and the fence consisted of cells, and 4 towers were erected above it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Near the monastery walls was a hotel for the common people, and nearby wooden fair shops.  In addition, a monastery mill and a farmyard operated on the Lyubovets river. </p>

    <h2>  Destruction </h2><p>  Nikandrov deserts (Pskov region) was devastated by the Bolsheviks.  They also destroyed the temple, built more than three centuries.  The monastery ceased to exist for a long time.  Attempts to revive the monastery in the postwar years were thwarted by the then authorities.  Over time, the territory of the former Nikandra desert is completely overgrown with forest.  Partially preserved only alleys, the remains of the fence, holy wells, the ruins and foundations of the temples, as well as the monastery cemetery. </p><h2>  Rebirth </h2><p>  The Nikandrov deserts (Pskov region) began to revive only at the beginning of the new millennium.  Monks who settled in memorable places began to work with prayers.  Local residents and paratroopers who were stationed near the military unit, as well as foresters and Cossacks, helped them.  Five-year efforts were crowned with success, and pilgrims again reached the shrines. </p><p>  Today, the newly born monastery continues to develop.  The Annunciation Cathedral, residential and utility buildings, join the two consecrated churches.  The adjacent territory is being arranged, the road to the temple. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the monastery daily services are performed;  most solemnly they take place on the day of remembrance of the saint, in commemoration of the cessation of the cholera epidemic and in celebration of the memory of the Royal Martyrs. </p><h2>  Temples </h2><p>  If you have a map of the Pskov region with attractions, then you will surely find the Nikandrov Deserts on it.  There are several temples, which are copies of ancient churches destroyed during the years of the atheism: </p><ul><li>  Annunciation Cathedral, consecrated in 2010; </li><li>  wooden church of the icon "Recovery of the dead"; </li><li>  Temple of the <span>Royal Martyrs.</span> </li></ul>

    <h2>  Sources of the Nikandra Desert </h2><p>  On the territory of the monastery are located <span>holy sources.</span>  Their waters heal the body and heal souls. </p><p>  At the entrance to the monastery is a source of peat water.  It is not very drinkable, but helps in curing eye diseases. </p><p>  Nearby is the holy spring of the Monk Alexander Svirsky with a font with blue radon water.  Dipping into it puts thoughts in order, highlighting the main thing in them.  The water is dense and pushes swimmers out. </p><p>  There is also a source of the Monk Nikander, which, according to legend, the saint himself used for domestic needs. </p><p>  People suffering from alcohol and drug addiction, infertility go to the monastery for help.  To recover, they are advised to take water from the healing spring of the apostles Peter and Paul. </p><h2>  Holy stones </h2><p>  The ‚ÄúHeadmaster‚Äù stone was in the monastery church for a long time and was an object of veneration by local residents and pilgrims.  It was used along with the icons in the procession.  Traditions say that Nikander bowed his head on this stone instead of a pillow when resting.  The church fathers took the subject of pagan worship to Petrograd, where its traces were lost.  There were only legends about him, and people unaware of the export continued the search for the relic for a long time. </p><p>  The stone ‚ÄúGod's trace‚Äù, similar to the footprint of a person, was considered holy because of the alleged belonging of the imprint of the Virgin Mary.  His veneration increased after the loss of the ‚ÄúLeader‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Holy oak </h2><p>  This huge tree in the Middle Ages was the object of worship of the Pskovites.  Indeed, under this tree Nikander predicted the future and healed the sick, where he was buried after his death. </p><p>  Time did not spare the old oak, and it perished in a fire.  Only legends have survived to this day, and the chapel built on this site has not survived. </p><h2>  Nikandrova Deserts: how to get there </h2><p>  Getting to the monastery by car is quite simple, for example, using a satellite navigator.  You can get from Moscow along the route following through Tver, Valdai and Luga, and from St. Petersburg through Luga.  Further, the path runs through the villages of Ludoni, Pava, Dubrovo to Zagosok.  From there, the desert will have to drive 10 km.  There is parking nearby.  There are no hotels in the district yet, but you can arrange an overnight stay in the nearest villages or plan a one-day visit. </p><p>  The Nikandrova Deserts (a map of the sights with the attached settlements is presented below) is visited by thousands of pilgrims.  Many of them come by public transport.  To do this, you need to get to Pskov, and then transfer to one of the buses running to the city of Porkhov and the settlements of Dedovichi and Dno.  You can either go on foot or use the services of a private carriage. </p>
