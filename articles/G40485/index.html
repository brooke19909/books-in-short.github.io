This colorful corner of Turkey is located less than forty kilometers from Antalya.  Tourists will appreciate the warm waters of the bay, the majestic Taurus Mountains and the friendliness of the locals.  Homer also mentioned Kemer in his Iliad. </p><p>  Although this resort is considered relatively young, it can easily be described as a modern marine recreation center with luxury hotels, excellent restaurants and cozy local cafes.  Even the most famous resorts can envy the dynamics of Kemer‚Äôs nightlife. </p><p>  A mild Mediterranean climate with high humidity, mountains that protect from cold winds, picturesque beaches, endless groves of orange and olive trees, pine forests - why not a paradise? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Larissa Park Akman Kemer" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/528460.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis part of the <span>Antalya coast</span> includes several cities.  In addition to Kemer, here are located: Tekirova - convenient for families with small children;  Camyuva, in which there are many upscale hotels;  Kirish, Goynuk, as well as the urban village Beldibi. </p><p>  The latter is preferred by lovers of a relaxing holiday, as well as those who combine swimming in the sea with visiting local attractions.  And this is not surprising, because seven kilometers from a small town are the ancient ruins of the famous Phaselis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Holidays in Beldibi </h2><p>  The resort is very compact.  It has only a few parallel long streets.  Such a layout of Beldibi is explained by the fact that on the one hand it is washed by the sea, and on the other it is limited by the slopes of the Taurus. </p><p>  The resort, like Kemer, boasts a developed infrastructure designed for a comfortable rest of tourists, modern restaurants and bars and a huge number of inexpensive shops. </p><p>  Hotels in Beldibi are built along the coast, along Ataturk Caddesi Street.  Modern hotel complexes with high quality service will make your vacation unforgettable.  There are hotels for every taste and prosperity, ranging from five-star hotels with a full range of services corresponding to such a high category, to economy-class establishments.  The latter, with their infrastructure, despite fairly affordable prices, are in no way inferior to similar European hotels.  But they win by the ratio of "stardom" and cost.  That is why Turkey, Kemer attracts many. </p>

    <h2>  Larissa park </h2><p>  The hotel was built in Beldibi, fifteen kilometers from the center of Kemer.  It is always full of tourists.  The coast on which the hotel is located is known for its magnificent nature.  After all, the mountain air here is literally saturated with the healing aroma of pine forests.  The Mediterranean Sea, on the shore of which the hotel was built, has always been especially popular among tourists.  That is why there are all year round full of vacationers coming from all over the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  General information, prices </h2><p>  Larissa Park Hotel was built in 2004.  The owners carried out the last major renovation only three years ago.  The plumbing has been completely replaced, the rooms are furnished with new furniture, the territory and the building are landscaped. </p><p>  The hotel is part of the Larissa Hotels hotel chain, which is quite widely represented on the Turkish coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Larissa Park Hotel 3" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/528467.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The four-story building is built in a classic style.  The prices for hotel accommodation are low.  For seven days of rest in a room of the "standard" category (with departure from Moscow airport), Russians must pay about twenty-eight thousand rubles.  Sometimes this amount changes - it all depends on the occupancy of the hotel and airlines operating charter flights from the capital. </p><p>  In addition to this hotel, on the coast we are considering is Larissa Park Akman (Kemer).  He has a higher category - four stars, and, accordingly, higher prices for accommodation.  For example, for the same seven nights you need to pay about thirty-five thousand rubles.  Larissa Akman Park 4 * is one of eight hotels included in the hotel chain mentioned above and located on the Mediterranean coast of the Turkish Riviera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The hotel area is more than seven thousand square meters.
