    <p>  Why are users so fond of this model of mobile phone?  Most likely, one of the most striking advantages was the build quality.  Yes, Lenovo knows a lot about this.  And we are talking not only about mobile phones, but also about laptops.  But since the topic of our article was precisely the Lenovo A398T review, the price of which is currently about seven thousand rubles, then let's get down to it. </p><h2>  Introduction to Review </h2>

    <p>  It should be noted right away that Lenovo, as they say, starts to incline the buyer to its side right from the doorway.  And in this regard, many users of the Internet audience may have a logical question.  "With what?"  - you ask.  But in fact, everything is very simple.  Lenovo offers potential buyers at least a quality product at a lower price.  We will not go deep into the past, but just note that in our time the price of a phone plays an important role.  Sometimes, one might even say decisive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  More specifically, when citing certain numbers, it is easy to notice that the devices of the company cost several tens of percent less than devices of another brand equipped with completely identical filling.  In general, fans of the company have long noticed that it is constantly striving to replenish and expand the range of its mobile phones.  The lineup is growing rapidly in recent years.  And it‚Äôs impossible to guess where this might lead.  By the way, not so long ago, the really expected replenishment of that model range was the Lenovo A398T smartphone. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  The delivery set of Lenovo A398T is quite modest.  It includes only the phone itself, a USB 2.0 cable, a charger and instructions written in Chinese.  We won‚Äôt see anything else here: neither a wireless stereo headset, nor anything else. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2>

    <p>  So, you have purchased a telephone.  Let's look at his appearance and give him an assessment.  Well, what can we say, guided by the first thoughts and sensations?  And here is what.  Before us is nothing more than an ordinary brick telephone.  A bit rude, but it really is.  There is clearly no reason to talk about any design research. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The device is made not only in black, but also in white colors.  For a wide audience using Lenovo‚Äôs mobile devices, the dark color has long fed up.  And the developers of the company heard their ‚Äúfans‚Äù, if they can be called that.  The white, which gives glossy plastic, partially overlaps only with a silver border drawn along the ends of the device.  This combination does not look just interesting - it looks quite organically and beautifully.  Here the designers of the company did not fail. </p><p>  If we talk about how the Lenovo device lies in the palm of our hands, we immediately note that the sensations, although not ideal, are very close to them.  Most likely, this is due to the size of the device. </p>

    <p>  The front panel of the phone looks clumsy.  The reason for this is the large grille that covers the earpiece located above the device‚Äôs touch screen.  But if you throw this flaw out of your head and not pay attention to it, then there‚Äôs no reason to chide the device anymore.  At least if you disassemble its front panel.  In the ‚ÄúLenovo A398T‚Äù model, everything else looks like it should be according to tradition: the official logo of the manufacturing company is located on top.  And under the touch screen there are three control buttons that are typical for the Android operating system. </p>

    <p>  At the top end of the device are connectors that allow you to connect wired headphones to the phone, as well as a MicroUSB cable for synchronization with a laptop or personal computer. </p><p>  Many users spoke out negatively about the presence of a power button located on the upper edge.  And the manufacturer heard fans of Lenovo smartphones.  On the A398T, the power and lock button has been moved to the right side. </p><p>  Since the power button was on the side of the device, I had to sacrifice something.  And in the role of the victim, we have a volume rocker.  In this phone model, this button is moved to the left side.  Although, maybe there is a place for her.  This option for the location of the controls is often used in similar models of other brands. </p><p>  The back cover of the Lenovo A398T phone is made of the same material as the device‚Äôs body itself, namely glossy plastic.  You may notice that the back cover and the camera of the device are not in the same plane.  The camera protrudes a little.  By the way, since I started talking about her, we immediately note that there is no flash at all.  Therefore, the phone is clearly not suitable for night shooting.  What else can be found on the back of the device?  Is that an external speaker, which is modestly located in the corner. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2><p>  There are no complaints to him.  Despite the fact that this is a Chinese smartphone.  Still, the company's engineers did a good job this time too.  To find fault with something in terms of assembly will not only be difficult, but very, very difficult.  Nothing creaks in the phone, no backlashes are observed.  The back cover is also ideally fitted to the case. </p><h2>  Phone Lenovo A398T.  Display specifications </h2><p>  The screen of the Lenovo A398T smartphone has a built-in IPS matrix that reduces eye strain.  A very useful technology that allows you to read texts and watch movies from your phone screen for a long time without much damage to your eyesight.  The screen size is 4.5 inches.  Resolution, of course, is not the best - 854 by 480 pixels. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the viewing angles are quite good.  Color rendering is also not particularly lame.  Of course, in natural light, the picture will be clearly not the same, but this was to be expected.  At the same time, the problem of reading in sunlight is solvable.  To do this, you just need to add the brightness of the screen, and its supply in the device is impressive, which can not be said.  And finally, we note that the device‚Äôs display supports a feature called ‚Äúmulti-touch,‚Äù that is, scaling the image with your fingers. </p><h2>  Lenovo A398T.  Owner reviews </h2><p>  The model of the device is quite new.  So far, the phone is sold only in the domestic market.  That is why finding reviews about the device is quite difficult.  There are not as many of them in the international network as it might seem at first glance.  But it was still possible to isolate the support points. </p><p>  So, what can people tell us about the reviews of people who have already purchased a phone?  From them you can learn that the device has two main advantages and two main disadvantages.  Among the advantages - excellent assembly, without squeaks and backlashes, as well as a good screen.  Among the shortcomings are a small amount of RAM and a weak camera, which gives pictures of very mediocre quality. </p><h2>  Conclusion and Conclusions </h2><p>  What does the person who purchased the Lenovo A398T mobile phone get?  It will be more like an ordinary, boring work phone.  The filling of the device is not at all gaming and copes exclusively with the most trivial tasks.  The main reasons for this are a weak processor and a small amount of RAM.  However, the phone justifies its money in full, giving the user a great opportunity to spend almost the whole day on the Internet, read articles, books and watch movies. </p>
