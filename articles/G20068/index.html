The truth is that this process is not as complicated as most people see it.  Just these types of work require some discipline. </p><div class="photo" data-original="madailylife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="learn to make money" class="if uuid-2662112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2662112.jpg"></div><p>  If you are looking for realistic ways to learn how to make money on the Internet, this process comes down to several types of activities that you can perform to make a profit one-time or continuously.  Some of them will give you results right away, helping you meet your basic daily needs (for example, buying groceries and paying for utilities), while the latter can transform your whole life, improving your financial situation in the long run. </p><h2>  What type of income is best to choose? </h2><p>  How to learn how to make good money with a long term?  Regardless of what kind of activity you choose to receive your online income, there is one very important fact that you need to understand.  In the modern world there are two main resources that try to get everything.  People want to have either more time or more money.  In fact, time is much more valuable than money.  No one is able to recreate it.  If it is spent, it happens forever. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Unlike him, money can be earned several times, it can be saved and invested or wasted.  What does this mean?  When you do not have enough free time (even a little), making money on the Internet (or in another remote way) may seem like an impossible task.  But this is not so.  How should you do this when you work on a permanent job from eight hours a day?  How to learn to earn correctly?  Although stable full-time employment can allow most to sleep peacefully at night, this does not allow your thoughts to seek new income strategies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bloggerspath.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to learn how to make money on bets" class="if uuid-2662116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2662116.jpg"></div><p>  The above example is not about quick enrichment methods.  If you want to get rich quick, you can forget about trying to do it online.  Of course, advertisements on social networks are a common modern hobby, but without a serious understanding of the mechanics of sales and optimization (which appear only after several years of continuous activity in the field of Internet marketing), you spend a lot of time trying to understand how to learn how to make money quickly. </p><h2>  How to make money online </h2><p>  Regardless of what type of work you will be applying to generate income on the Web, you need to restructure your thinking in such a way as to help yourself expand your opportunities, and not completely turn away from it.  Attempts to learn how to make money on the Internet for a beginner can be fraught with preventable traps.  Today on the Web there is no shortage of offers from dishonest Internet marketers who want to find ways to rob you of hard-earned money.  Therefore, to begin with, you should understand the theory well. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where to start? </h2><p>  How to learn to earn from scratch to achieve success?  To accomplish this, you should follow a number of fundamental principles.  If you are serious about earning real income from online activity, you will need to focus on passive income, not active.  Of course, the latter will help you survive soon.  This focuses too much attention, and this can be called a lack of majority views.  It should be remembered that the implemented <span>principles of passive income</span> will help you thrive in the future. </p><p>  Given the fact that you have a limited amount of time, it is the passive form of income that should be the most significant part of your activity.  If you seriously decide to learn how to make money on the Internet, then it should be put as your main goals and ambitions.  It is better to do a certain job once and get exhaust from it many times, and not rely on your time to get a linear income. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.centrinity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to learn how to make money on the Internet" class="if uuid-2662114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2662114.jpg"></div><p>  Since time is the most valuable product, invest it so that you can take advantage in the future.  This means that you invest some effort and get rewarded later.  And you will receive money in the future, regardless of whether you continue to build this passive income stream or stop.  Obviously, this is the preferred route, but it may seem very difficult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Anyone who is interested in learning how to make money on the Internet should strive for passive income, as well as work on active ones.  There are many ways to do this on the network, and most of them start with creating a blog, promoting it, and forming a permanent audience. </p><p>  But this does not mean that you definitely need to start blogging right now to make money on the Internet.  You can choose a route that is not related to creating your resources.  But if you are looking for a more reliable investment, you will have to come to this. </p><h2>  Why is creating a blog a step towards success? </h2><p>  If you are serious about learning how to make money online, start a blog.  This is one of the simplest and most sustainable sources of profit.  As long as the blog is properly executed, created in an actual niche, filled with the right content, tuned to the right audience, and the advertising proposal complements the existing content, you have a high chance of getting a lot of passive income from it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="futurepowerworld.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to learn to earn from scratch" class="if uuid-2662129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2662129.jpg"></div><p>  Some may think that creating a blog is a hard effort, but when you understand all the principles that you need to follow, it becomes much easier.  It all starts with the decision to choose a profitable niche and the right domain name.  From there you need to build your proposals.  You can easily sell things like paid subscriptions via email, full-time trainings, e-books, etc. </p><h2>  If you decide to create a blog </h2><p>  Of course, blogs do not give you easy money.  Not every blogger makes millions of dollars.  How to learn to earn a newbie in the blogosphere?  To make a profit, you must be able to write quality articles and have sufficient knowledge about SEO. </p><p>  In addition, when you blog, you need to be very patient.  You cannot start earning from the first day.  You may need several months to get your first dollar. </p><p>  But as soon as your resource becomes popular, you can start making enough money to support yourself. </p><p>  To create a blog, all you need is a good topic, popular among the masses.  Needless to say, you must be an expert on this topic so that you can write regular articles on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.account-money.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to learn how to make good money" class="if uuid-2662128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2662128.jpg"></div><p>  You can also team up with someone and create a blog with several topics, with each companion specializing in a specific niche. </p><h2>  How to work with your own blog? </h2><p>  The reason blogs are most recommended to those who are looking for ways to learn how to make money on the Internet without investing is because you can start it on a free platform.  Nevertheless, this is not recommended by specialists, since it is very difficult to manage SEO on free sites. </p><p>  Running a stand-alone WordPress blog doesn't cost much.  You will have to spend about 10 dollars on a domain and hosting.  You can then install WordPress with free themes from the repository and get started. </p><p>  To improve the functionality of WordPress, you can install free plugins.  From this moment, all preliminary steps can be considered completed. </p><p>  You can make a profit on your blog through any of the following monetization methods: </p><ul><li>  Display ads from Google Adsense or other ad networks.  You get paid for displaying ads (CPI) or for clicking on a link (CPC). </li><li>  Affiliate marketing in which you advertise a product or company service.  Whenever someone uses your purchase link, the advertiser pays you a commission. </li><li>  Paid articles. </li><li>  Selling ad space on a blog. </li></ul><p>  You can also use any of the above methods of monetization on free sites.  However, this is not recommended. </p><h2>  Monetize YouTube videos </h2><p>  Blogging requires you to be able to write interesting content and SEO.  However, most people who are looking to learn how to make money just have basic Internet skills. </p><p>  Watching and uploading videos to YouTube can be an interesting solution.  But did you know that you can also make money on videos that you upload yourself? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ticotimes.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to learn how to earn a lot" class="if uuid-2662119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2662119.jpg"></div><p>  Yes, it is very possible.  However, in order to monetize a video from YouTube, it must be free from other people's copyrights.  Therefore, you need to create your own videos for this site. </p><p>  Like the blogosphere, YouTube has great potential for making money.  Today there are many bloggers who earn big money. </p><p>  If you are capable of creating good videos that can become popular, YouTube will be the best option for you.  How to learn how to make money at home on your videos? </p><p>  There are many ways to monetize your videos on this site.  However, most bloggers use the YouTube Partner program, where you can earn revenue by showing ads to your viewers.  You can also make profits through affiliate marketing and paid reviews. </p><h2>  Paid Subscriptions </h2><p>  How to learn how to make money on the Internet through sales?  If you are generally interested in online marketing, set up email software and create a product that you can use in your regular sales. </p><p>  Then decide, for example, that you can expect to earn about $ 1 per user per month.  If you have 10,000 subscribers, this means that you can earn a considerable amount per month.  You will need to deliver a certain resource, and not send it to each e-mail address, but this is an achievable goal in a short period. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thesavvycouple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to learn to make money on the Internet for a beginner" class="if uuid-2662124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2662124.jpg"></div><p>  There are many methods to attract people to paid subscriptions.  For example, you can create e-books, unique content and cheat sheets.  In addition, you can make such original content updates as PDF versions of articles with additional resources in them, bonus parts of video training, and more.  Decide what you can offer the audience to better interest it, and then maintain this interest, and you will eventually get a long-term result. </p><h2>  Webinar Training </h2><p>  How to learn to earn a lot on the web?  Webinars or webinars may be one of the strongest ways you can get a lot of money online.  Experts say that if you conduct a webinar weekly for a year, you will be a wealthy person at the end.  You need a mature audience to train with you, and you need to know well what you're talking about.  As a rule, this requires the presence of your own website and a certain online presence. </p><p>  However, you can do webinars without all of this.  For example, you may have well-developed pages on social networks, and you can learn from them in a live broadcast every week.  But at the same time you will need a product for implementation and sale at a certain point.  Do not worry about this at the beginning of the journey.  And by far the best webinar platform is GoToWebinar. </p><h2>  Content Writing Fee </h2><p>  As discussed earlier, blogging is an excellent way to make money online.  However, this requires SEO knowledge and the ability to properly deliver content in order to reach as many audiences as possible. </p><p>  On the other hand, some bloggers either cannot write compelling material on a single topic, or are unable to manage multiple blogs, and therefore they do not have enough time to create content on a regular basis. </p><p>  So, if you have exceptional writing skills and do not want to delve into technical issues related to maintaining your resource, you can provide article writing services.  And if you also have copywriting skills, you can work with website development agencies and write content for your clients.  This is a completely working idea, thanks to which you can learn to earn without investing your money. </p><p>  In the case of the provision of materials for the blog, some webmasters will allow you to use your name with articles, while other bloggers prefer anonymous writers.  You can easily find such content writing projects. </p><p>  Pay rates for articles vary greatly depending on your skills.  But remember that this income is active and linear.  With it, you can earn now, and not in the long run. </p><h2>  Make money online through micro-tasks </h2><p>  There are many ways of active income.  So, some sites pay for a number of simple tasks, such as registering on websites, commenting on blogs, joining groups in social networks, reposting and voting, searching for information on the Internet, classifying products, etc. </p><p>  Payment for such tasks is small, but you can easily complete them all day and get a good amount in the end. </p><p>  Since such work does not require any skills other than basic knowledge on the Internet, it is ideal for students and housewives, helping them to effectively use their free time.  This is a good idea how to learn how to earn money from home if you do not plan to increase your income or do this main job. </p><h2>  Freelance exchanges </h2><p>  Freelance exchanges are websites that enable everyone to make money on the Internet.  You can create an ad in which you will tell people what you are ready to do and for what amount. </p><p>  Types of activities can be absolutely anything: from professional services (such as technical writing, SEO, online marketing) to unprofessional things, such as a painted balloon for an anniversary, crafts or all kinds of unique but creative things. </p><h2>  Content Managers </h2><p>  If you like to use social networks, they can be another option for making money on the Internet.  Modern social networks are a great way to increase brand awareness and increase audience.  For this reason, almost all celebrities, politicians and companies that access their target audience have such pages. </p><p>  Nevertheless, most of these people and organizations are usually busy with their work and do not personally spend time on social networks.  Therefore, they hire freelancers to manage their social official accounts on their behalf. </p><p>  If you have been using social networks for a long time, and at the same time you have the skills to publish the right content, you can manage corporate social network accounts. </p><p>  However, such an activity may not be as simple as it seems.  This is due to the fact that you will directly represent the company whose social network account you manage.  Any mistakes you make will affect the public image of this organization. </p><h2>  How to learn to earn on bets? </h2><p>  Sports betting is another well-known way to make money online.  On the Internet, this activity is completely similar to the work of online bookmakers.  How to learn to earn on sports betting?  First of all, you need to choose the sport in which you are well versed.  Secondly, it is necessary to analyze the possible forecasts and outcomes of each game.  It is not necessary to bet on the victory of a team: it is enough to dwell on the small details of the game.  For example, who will score the first goal and so on.  Also be sure to pay attention to the rate odds.  If the site promises too big wins, this should be alarming.  And in any case, this cannot be regarded as a serious source of income.  Even if you learn all the basics of how to learn to earn money on bets, you should understand that this is like playing in a casino. </p><h2>  Final word </h2><p>    ,         , ,       ,         .      ,      . ,    ,  .      ,    ,           ,   .        . ,          . </p>
