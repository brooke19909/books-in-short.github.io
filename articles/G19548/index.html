After all, the country is huge and full of wonderful sights.  The topic of this article will be Dolzhanskaya Spit.  The Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, into which it extends, has long been considered a place of inexpensive family vacations.  But the coastal towns of the Kuban in the summer are crowded.  In addition, the development of infrastructure for recreation, they are significantly inferior to the Black Sea resorts of the Caucasus. </p><p>  The Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov abounds with braids.  What kind of natural education is this?  Rivers carry silt and sand into the sea.  Gradually, <span>this alluvium</span> accumulates at the bottom - first in the form of underwater dunes, and then begins to rise above the surface.  Such natural formations, when viewed from a height, resemble girl‚Äôs braids.  Where they connect to the mainland, they are wide, and gradually taper to the tip.  Sometimes the sea erodes the thin diameter of the spit, and islands form.  Water from two sides is the main bonus that this natural formation gives vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolzhanskaya Spit" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1291204.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is it?  How to get to Dolzhanskaya Spit </h2><p>  The Krasnodar Territory in the summer receives many guests from all over Russia.  On the east coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov is the Yeisk Peninsula, which outlines the Bay of Taganrog from the south.  Officially (on the maps), the natural formation of interest to us is called the Long Spit.  But due to the fact that at the base there is a small resort <span>village "Dolzhanskaya",</span> it bears the name of this settlement. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Long Spit separates the <span>Taganrog Bay</span> from the open sea.  It is composed mainly of shell rock.  To get to its base, you first need to come to Yeysk.  Spit Dolzhanskaya is located from this city forty kilometers.  From the district center to the village go minibuses and buses.  Well, then on its own.  Suitable housing can be found in the village itself.  Private sector offers a lot - from family-type hotels with a pool to modest rooms.  Motorists can drive closer to the end of the spit and become a camp at the campsite. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolzhanskaya Spit Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1291194.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Climate and ecology </h2><p>  Dolzhanskaya spit is far from the sea.  Due to its geographical location, the climate there is temperate continental.  The sea heated during the summer softens the winter cold, and in summer the heat is not so much felt here.  The sea breeze refreshes the heat.  There are no large industrial enterprises in the entire okrug, so the ecological situation on Dolzhanskaya Spit is the most favorable.  This natural formation almost closes the Taganrog Bay. </p><p>  Between Dolzhanskaya (Russian Federation) and Belosarayskaya (Ukraine) braids - only forty kilometers.  The water off the coast of the natural embankment is very clean, especially from the open sea.  A thick coniferous forest is planted between the village of Dolzhanskaya and the scythe itself.  Volatile, exuded by sun-heated pine trees, have a healthy effect on the respiratory system.  Another valuable factor is healing mud.  However, the anthropogenic factor still affects the state of Dolzhanskaya Spit.  In the fifties of the last century, its length was seventeen kilometers, and now it is less than ten.  Such a decrease in the territory of the Russian Federation is due to the fault of those who take the shell rock for the needs of construction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolzhanskaya Spit" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1291243.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  When to go to the Long Spit </h2><p>  Dolzhanskaya village was founded in 1848 by immigrants from the banks of the Dnieper.  Ukrainian Cossacks built a cozy village at the base of the spit, engaged in gardening and fishing.  And now the population of the village is only incomplete eight thousand people.  Therefore, in the peak season, the village may seem too crowded.  But Dolzhanskaya Spit always pleases vacationers with open spaces. </p><p>  You can swim in the shallow warming shallow Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov already in the second half of May.  The beach season closes in early October.  Since 2011, in the early days of September, the Dolzhansky Marathon windsurfer festival has been held in the village.  It involves lovers to ride on a board under a sail, and kiters.  A concert with the participation of music groups is organized on the promenade.  During the festival, housing in the village of Dolzhanskaya will be difficult to find.  The most interesting period for a holiday on the spit is August.  Temperature - that of air, that of water - is approaching +25 degrees.  And the abundance of fruits will be an additional bonus to relaxation. </p><h2>  Dolzhanskaya Spit beaches </h2><p>  The natural dune, which gradually rose above the surface of the water, was formed not only by the removal of alluvium into the sea by the mighty Don River.  Tidal phenomena threw many broken shells onto the sandy shore.  Dolzhanskaya Spit stretches for nine and a half kilometers.  Its beaches are becoming deserted as they move to the edge.  When you reach a place where the braid becomes very narrow, you can see a strange phenomenon.  If on the one hand the sea rolls high waves ashore, on the other hand there is complete calm.  Therefore, the Long Spit is so popular with windsurfers.  Here you can always find the right wind and the right wave. </p><p>  The beaches of the spit are composed of small shell rock mixed with river sand.  Such a mineral composition makes staying on the shore not only enjoyable, but also beneficial for health.  At sea, people sometimes find cures for healing mud.  Therefore, you can often meet vacationers, smeared from head to toe in black and blue mass. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolzhanskaya Spit beaches" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1291231.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure facilities </h2><p>  As already mentioned above, the village of Dolzhanskaya is located at the very beginning of the spit, on the mainland.  It is a triangle with a pointed end.  Therefore, in the village all housing, one way or another, is located close to the sea.  But if you want to hear the sound of waves, and from two sides, you only have one place to look for housing - Dolzhanskaya Spit. </p><p>  Rest in the village, as we see, is very diverse.  Those who cannot live without modern amenities find housing in the village.  There is a market (food and clothing), shops, cafes and restaurants, a pharmacy, ATMs, entertainment for children and adults, a nightclub, and a tennis court.  And those who want to retire from the noisy crowds of vacationers will find nature untouched by civilization on the Long Spit.  On the dune, made of shell rock, there are at least ten campsites.  At the very edge of the spit, as its continuation with a dotted line, there are several islands.  They live only seabirds.  Great place for a romantic beach holiday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolzhanskaya Spit Base" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1291249.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  The main thing that attracts tourists to Dolzhanskaya Spit is the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  What could be better than the expanses of water spread out on both sides of deserted shell beaches?  But you need to remember that the <span>Long Spit is</span> declared a landscape <span>monument of nature of the Krasnodar Territory.</span>  So foresters and tents in an unspecified place, foresters are very strict.  In the village of Dolzhanskaya founded by Ukrainian immigrants there is a museum of Cossack life.  In the nearby city of Yeisk, a nostalgic for city entertainment vacationers will find everything they want.  But the village itself is able to satisfy information hunger.  In the spring there are Dolzhansky Races, at the end of July - the A-ZOV dance music festival, and in September - surfer competitions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolzhanskaya Spit prices" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1291223.jpg" width="600"></div>
