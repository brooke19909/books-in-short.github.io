    <h2>  Gadauta </h2><p>  Gadauta is a rather young and less well-known resort than other cities of Abkhazia.  It began to develop only in Soviet times.  Today, local residents are happy to turn their homes into guest houses, which in most cases are located right by the sea.  It creates ideal conditions for enjoying peace, tranquility and a free beach.  The urban infrastructure has not yet received much development, but the resort is small, so all the necessary entertainment is within walking distance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Pitsunda </h2><p>  A house in Abkhazia on <span>the seashore</span> in the summer was the dream of a Soviet man.  But to get a ticket to the <span>resort of Pitsunda</span> in those days was almost impossible, so many tourists went to the savage Abkhazia. </p>

    <p>  Today, little has changed.  Pitsunda is still the same small town with a protected pine grove along the sea, clear transparent waters and a sandy beach.  Most of the houses in the city are private.  Pitsunda is still loved by many tourists.  During their stay at the resort, families rent a separate room, and large companies rent a guest house.  The accommodation is quite comfortable, as the necessary amenities have been created. </p><h2>  Gagra </h2><p>  Today, the twenty-kilometer sea coast of Gagra is the most popular place in Abkhazia.  Here guests are offered motels, <span>pensions, mini-hotels, hotels</span> and holiday homes.  There are good options in the private sector.  Abkhazia, Gagra, guest houses on the seashore will dream of you many more days after returning home.  You will remember beautiful parks, clean air and hospitable hosts.  In Gagra, it is gradually becoming a tradition to offer tourists for rent not only a room with amenities, but also housing with a European-style renovation and additional services (for example, meals, cleaning and sightseeing). </p>

    <p>  Fans of a comfortable stay can find a park hotel in Abkhazia on the seashore with a swimming pool and book a room there. </p><h2>  The benefits of relaxing in guest houses </h2><p>  The private sector is a lot of housing options on various conditions.  The main advantage of renting from the owner is the ability to choose the remoteness of the apartment from the sea coast.  With a child, you can rent a guest house in Abkhazia on the seashore, then you will not have to go to the beach far.  Having bought a ticket to a boarding house or sanatorium, a vacationer receives regular meals in the dining room, visits his beach, can participate in events organized by cultural workers and adheres to the regime established by the institution. </p><p>  At the same time, in the private sector, a person is free to set his daily routine without depriving himself of late evening walks along the seashore or early water procedures.  He can determine the place and time of eating, independently organize his leisure.  Many guest houses have a cozy home environment with all the necessary, pleasant little things: internet, dishes, appliances and household appliances.  In addition, a guest house in Abkhazia on the seashore will cost a tourist much cheaper in comparison with the offer in a boarding house of similar comfort. </p>

    <h2>  When is the best time to book? </h2><p>  The most reliable and convenient option for both the guest and the owner is earlier booking.  Tourists like to stay in the private sector of Abkhazia, so in the season upon arrival to find suitable comfortable accommodation by the sea is quite difficult.  You should start browsing through the various options a few months before the start of the trip.  In this case, tourists are given more choice of accommodation, among which the optimal number will be much easier to find. </p><p>  If you have a reservation, then, having arrived in a city on the coast, you can do without the services of an agent for the selection of housing and not look for a free room on your own, looking into all guest houses with heavy suitcases.  As a rule, in order to reserve the option you like in advance, the tourist must make an advance payment (10-20 percent of the total cost of renting a house).  This is a common practice that provides some guarantees to the lessee and lessor. </p><h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  The cost of rental housing in Abkhazia is affected by: </p><ul><li>  Seasonality  At the height of summer, you will have to pay a little more for accommodation.  In October, the cost of housing is the lowest. </li><li>  Comfort  The more amenities tourists are offered, the higher the room rate will be. </li><li>  The distance to the Russian border.  The closer to the Federation, the more expensive housing. </li><li>  Remoteness from the sea.  The smaller the distance to the sea, the higher the cost of living. </li></ul><p>  Thus, it turns out that the most expensive for rent in the midst of the holiday season will be comfortable guest houses in Abkhazia on the seashore near the border with the Russian Federation.  It is better to rent a house without intermediaries, using the recommendations of acquaintances or reliable information in the form of reviews of vacationers on tourist portals on the Internet.  In the private sector, you can find options with amenities from 300 rubles per person to 1000. There are elite offers - from 2000-3000 rubles per day. </p><h2>  Guest houses in Abkhazia on the seashore.  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Conflicting reviews can be read about holidays in this country: some tourists will forever fall in love with the country at first sight, while others complain about spoiled vacations, giving unflattering characteristics to local residents.  Negative memories of vacationers are associated with such circumstances: </p><ul><li>  unsanitary conditions in some public places and the spread of infections; </li><li>  sewer waste flowing directly into the sea; </li><li>  disrespectful attitude of local residents to vacationers, their desire to deceive tourists; </li><li>  cases of theft; </li><li>  interruptions in water supply and power supply. </li></ul><p>  When reading reviews, you need to understand that most of them are subjective.  All people are different.  Some of them need only the sea and the sun for a good rest, and as a place to sleep, there is enough room with common amenities.  Other, more demanding tourists, it is not enough to rent for the night even the whole guest house.  Comfort-rest in Abkhazia for them is not only picturesque nature, but compliance with the standards of high-class service in the hotel and beyond. </p>
