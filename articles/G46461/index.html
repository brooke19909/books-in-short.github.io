    <p>  El Gouna is a fairly closed city, clean, without garbage dumps.  No passersby are visible here.  Among the local population of the resort there are many Arabs - Christians.  They can be distinguished by tattooed crosses on their wrists.  Wonderfully equipped promenade.  The city is green.  There are plenty of local shops where shopping enthusiasts have a place to turn around.  There are no cops here.  Their functions are performed by hotel security services. </p><p>  The mentioned hotel is the most economical in this paradise.  Holidays in it are well organized and fully consistent with its category.  Of the tourists, the hotel complex is most often visited by residents of Germany.  The cost of the tour for a couple of adults with accommodation in the Standard room of the Panorama Bungalow Resort El Gouna 4 * hotel (Egypt) at the current time is 1150 US dollars plus $ 40 <span>fuel surcharge.</span> </p><h2>  About Venice in the Sands ... </h2><p>  Where did such a romantic name come from?  There is something in common in the architecture created by the Egyptians with Venice, although the climate here is tropical, deserted - there is practically no rain in the summer, but there is a lot of sand.  Therefore, the resort, the construction of which, at the request of the Egyptian billionaire Sami Saviris, many venerable architects had a hand in, is called "Venice in the Sands."  Many Arab and European billionaires built their villas here.  This place has long been chosen by artists, photographers and people of other creative professions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Some of the resort's hotels are located on islets that connect canals and bridges.  Shuttle ships cruise between these islands.  Water communication from the hotel Panorama Bungalow Resort El Gouna 4 * (Egypt, El Gouna) is systematic, constant and regular.  Minibuses are transported to the infrastructure of tourists on the islets themselves.  Since the entire resort is the property of Orascom Development, owned by Sami Saviris, all regular transport links for tourists are free.  To the delight of guests throughout the resort, the Dinner Round service is available.  Its meaning is that if during dinner the tourist is not in his hotel, then he can dine in the restaurant of any other El Gouna hotel closest to him. </p><p>  Numerous passenger motor scooters equipped with cabins serve as an alternative to regular flights.  The fare to any corner of El Gouna is 5 pounds (35 rubles). </p><p>  There are two marinas, a brewery.  Wine is also bottled in El Gouna.  We recommend that you take a walk in the Abutik Marina port - this is the place where luxury yachts moor.  There is something to see here, sitting down at a table in a restaurant on the promenade with a cup of coffee.  On the island of Zeytuna there is a free aquarium, a golf club, a go-kart track, an El Arena disco, restaurants. </p><h2>  Hotel near Hurghada </h2><p>  The Panorama Bungalow Resort El Gouna hotel complex itself, thirty kilometers away from the bustling resort of Hurghada, has a reputation as a place for an inexpensive and solid relaxing family vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="panorama bungalow resort el gouna 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/727481.jpg" width="600"></div>  At the same time, economical accommodation and transport links with relatively expensive hotels in Hurghada (the center of the Red Sea province) makes the hotel in El-Gouna considered by us attractive for young people.

In fact, he is in El Gouna. </p><h2>  About the hotel complex </h2><p>  It has been working since 2004.  The hotel was built on the shore of a picturesque lagoon on the first line, from it to the water's edge of the beach - less than two hundred meters.  Not far from the hotel is the center of El Gouna - Down Town.  For eleven years of tourist service, the hotel has earned a good and stable reputation.  Among the guests, the hotel complex is famous as an updated first-generation hotel, which provides cost-effective leisure services.  This is a complex consisting of the main one-story building, where the reception is located exclusively, as well as buildings for guests: five- and three-story buildings, one-story comfortable bungalows.  Overhaul was carried out in 2012, in subsequent years, individual buildings and cases were selectively repaired. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews Panorama Bungalow Resort El Gouna </h2><p>  The guests appreciate the comfort and tranquility, and the staff treats this with understanding.  Vacationers here are not bothered by a noisy and intrusive animation.  However, the staff in every possible way contributes to the wishes of the guests, willingly organizes entertainment, provides equipment for playing volleyball and water polo.  In addition, an evening show is organized every other day, turning into a disco. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="panorama bungalow resort el gouna 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/727484.jpg" width="600"></div>

Guest reviews often contain thanks to the administration and staff, many rate their stay ‚Äúgood‚Äù.  However, there are those who speak out negatively and talk about the shortcomings in the hotel organization of leisure.  True, in fact, there are not so many minuses.  Just some visitors want a five-star service by paying for a four-star hotel. </p><p>  Guests mention a remarkably furnished area, good organization of leisure on the beach and by the pools, interesting for the beach goers of the Red Sea, the responsiveness of the staff.  These are undoubted advantages of the Panorama Bungalow Resort El Gouna 4 * hotel.  Negative reviews are often left by guests who lived in building number 1.  According to them, some rooms were not overhauled.  Furniture with a noticeable degree of wear is not replaced ... However, the rooms are adequately serviced, household appliances are serviceable, and if any problems arise, then when contacting the administration, the malfunctions are resolved promptly.  We hope that the hotel administration will respond to the comments of the guests and will modernize building No. 1. </p><h2>  Hotel Room Features </h2><p>  In total, the Panorama Bungalow Resort El Gouna hotel complex has 166 comfortable guest rooms.

    <p>  The main dishes are prepared from chicken, fish, less often from beef.  An impressive assortment of vegetable, hot dishes, as well as desserts. </p><p>  Guests of the Panorama Bungalow Resort El Gouna 4 * hotel have breakfast from 7-00 to 10-00, lunch from 13-00 to 17-00 and have dinner from 19-00 to 22-00. </p><p>  The menu of the hotel meets dishes of Oriental, Egyptian, European, Italian cuisine.

Eating through the buffet, ie the all-inclusive system, hotel guests receive local (Egyptian) wine and beer from 10 in the morning.  The wine is natural, white and red.  According to reviews, these drinks are not bad.  Note that on the beach of Zeytun, beer and wine are paid, and the prices are not cheap.  Buying a can of beer in a minibar will cost guests 125 rubles.  It is much more profitable to purchase the same drink in a small shop located a hundred meters from the Sultan Bay Hotel.

Moreover, none of the staff does not say anything about this store. </p><h2>  Resort nightlife </h2><p>  Where in the resort of El Gouna can a tourist have fun after a day on the beach?  Experienced holidaymakers recommend spending the evening on the central island of this artificial archipelago - on Kafra.  Its architecture is attractive, stylized as traditional Egyptian.  Low neat buildings with domed arches and courtyards are built along wide straight alleys. </p><p>  Tourists willingly visit the Italian restaurant and artistic cafe, which are popular in Kafra.  Buy souvenirs in the shopping arcade Khayamia.  Bargaining, of course, is necessary.  However, the prices in the local shops (there are no shops in El Gouna) are not the most affordable, because the majority of vacationers in the resort are from <span>Western Europe.</span> </p><p>  Kafra boasts resort life around the clock.  El Gouna's nightlife takes place at local nightclubs, discos and bars.  Guests of the Panorama Bungalow Resort El Gouna 4 * hotel in their reviews mention the Cin-Cin bar, Arena disco. </p><h2>  Pools, sports infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel complex has two outdoor pools.  One is for adults, the other is heated for children.  To the delight of swimmers, two <span>water slides work.</span>  There is a playground near the children's pool.
