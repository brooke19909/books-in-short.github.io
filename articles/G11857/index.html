The need for the application of this method appears in those cases when it is necessary to solve the problem by orderly explanation and description of many objects of diverse composition. </p><p>  The typology of culture is a qualitatively meaningful characteristic of the existence of culture.  This is expressed in concrete historical forms: religious, ethno-national, regional-territorial and others. </p><p>  The typology of culture is considered one of the urgent and debatable issues in modern theory.  The determination of status, semantic content is predetermined by the main principle, in accordance with which the analysis of the context of spiritual values ‚Äã‚Äãis carried out and the most general qualities are determined. </p><p>  The historical typology of culture has various foundations and directions.  The authors of the concepts were sociologists, philosophers, field ethnographers, artists, practitioners and theorists.  In the study, the typology of culture began to be widely used in the 18-19 centuries.  Then scientists were passionate about finding a single plan. </p><p>  As a result of the development of a complex theoretical structure, by the end of the 19th century, a view of the type was established.  In accordance with it, a Marxist system was formed.  Weber has developed a method for determining ideal types.  And in American sociology, the design method began to spread. </p><p>  The typology of culture, as a scientific method, is based on determining the differences and similarities of the studied objects.  The goal is to display the patterns of structuring and development of the simulated system.  At the base, a typological principle is applied that sets the direction of theoretical research. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The basic principles include: formational, conceptual, civilized, religious, regional-territorial, demographic and others.  They are distinguished in accordance with the <span>spiritual and value orientation,</span> religious conviction, the nature of relations with nature, classical patterns, systematic values ‚Äã‚Äãand others. </p><p>  The most common in domestic science is considered a <span>formation approach.</span>  This principle indicates a connection with the dominant production method.  In other words, what is the mode of production, such is the culture: capitalist, slaveholding, primitive communal, etc. </p><p>  <span>The civilization approach is</span> used by many authors.  Its interpretation depends on the understanding of the term "civilization".  Analyzing culture in accordance with this principle, many authors come to the conclusion about the negative impact of civilization processes. </p><p>  <span>The conceptual principle</span> allows conducting research in accordance with the prevailing worldview in society. </p><p>  In accordance with the religious principle, culture is divided into ancient and one in which one of the world's religions (Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, and others) rules the state.  In other words, the classification is carried out in accordance with two areas of belief: monotheism and polytheism. </p><p>  In accordance with the regional-territorial principle, an analysis of the culture is carried out according to the characteristic common features that are inherent in a particular region. </p><p>  According to the demographic principle, features and commonality of gender and age characteristics are revealed.  In addition, <span>population density,</span> composition, size, and employment are also taken into account. </p><p>  The most well-established and widespread is the cultural-historical principle.  In accordance with it, the forms of the most common, essential spiritual values ‚Äã‚Äãare determined.  Today, there are several historical types of European culture.  The oldest include natural symbolic values. </p><p>  The typology of <span>political culture is</span> carried out in accordance with the established state regime, methods of exercising power, the views of society on the structure of power, and so on. </p>
