We check gross weight, net weight and quantity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What new can you say about receiving goods at a retail store?  Virtually nothing for those who have long been working in the trade.  But entrepreneurs who decide to open their own small business may find this information useful. </p><p>  Before you sell something, you need to buy something, while in the process of acquiring a product, the moment of its adoption is a very important stage.  It is at this stage that the buyer, checking the names, number of commodity units, <span>net</span> and gross <span>weights</span> and other indicators, can (and should) identify any possible inconsistency of the goods received indicated in the supplier's accompanying document. </p><p>  Calculations with suppliers and settlement of disagreements, as well as some points of further sale of the goods, depend on how carefully and correctly the work on acceptance of the products is carried out. </p><p>  The goods acceptance procedure is the cornerstone in the relationship between the buyer and the supplier.  The duty of each supplier is to deliver the goods to the buyer in the proper quality and quantity, and this duty is regulated by the Civil Code of the Russian Federation.  But there are no single standards governing the acceptance of products in all situations that arise and for all business entities, as well as a single mechanism for this procedure.  This means that the acceptance rules may vary depending on the terms of the contract, delivery method, <span>type of product</span> and even its packaging.  Consider some of the situations that arise in this. </p><p>  Unsold goods </p><p>  In this case, the number of tare places and gross weight are checked immediately after they are delivered to the store in the presence of accompanying persons <span>(drivers, forwarders</span> , etc.), while <span>marketable products are</span> counted, weighed, measured in the same measuring units that are indicated on the invoices. invoices or invoices. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If there are no differences, the materially responsible person of the receiving party puts a stamp and his signature on invoices or other accompanying documents.  From this moment, the responsibility for the goods passes to the buyer. </p><p>  Sometimes during acceptance it turns out that either the gross weight or the quantity does not match the data indicated in the documents.  In this case, an act of shortage or surplus is drawn up and a note is made in the invoice or invoice.  The act is signed by the store employees and the person accompanying the goods.  Responsibility for shortages or surpluses rests with the deliverers. </p><p>  It happens that the packaged goods enter the store with signs of hacking, breakage, attempted tampering.  In this case, there may be a shortage, and this often shows the gross weight when weighing.  Goods with broken packaging are equated to unpacked and are accepted with a check of each tare place for absolutely all indicators. </p><p>  Packaged goods </p><p>  Goods in undisturbed, serviceable containers are usually accepted in two terms.  Immediately upon receipt, the gross weight and the number of seats are checked, in the <span>accompanying documents it</span> is noted that the goods were accepted without opening the container. </p><p>  Further acceptance is carried out by members of the store commission during the opening of tare places, but no later than 10 days from the date of receipt. </p><p>  The number of units of goods and the net weight inside each tare place are checked, and upon detection of any inconsistency with the accompanying documents, an act is drawn up on which the commission members sign. </p><p>  In this situation, the supplier should be called to resolve the issue within 24 hours.  Further, in the presence of a representative of the supplier, and in case of his failure to appear in the presence of a representative of a third-party organization, a full check is done (gross and net weights, number of units) and the revealed shortage or surplus is drawn up in a bilateral act. </p><p>  <span>The acts are drawn up</span> in triplicate and, together with the accompanying documents, as well as the certificate and power of attorney of the representatives, are transferred to the legal adviser, who must submit a complaint to the suppliers within 10 days. </p><p>  Thus, the timely and correct acceptance of goods with the execution of appropriate documents is very important and can save from financial losses. </p>
