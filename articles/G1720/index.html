  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is it possible to knit socks overnight?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you want to make something nice for your loved one by showing him how much you value and care about him, then tie him socks.  Yes, yes, simple socks!  Moreover, this will not take a lot of time - after all, you can <span>knit socks</span> overnight.  Do not believe?  And you check! </p><p>  To do this, take about 150 grams of thread.  It is best to use natural wool for this - from it the socks will be soft, warm and light.  In addition, you will need five thin knitting needles designed specifically for circular knitting. </p><p>  Many do not need to tell how to knit socks.  The technology is quite simple and straightforward.  But for those who for the first time decided to tie this necessary wardrobe item with their own hands, we will tell you how to do it right and most importantly quickly. </p><p>  Measure the owner's ankle for future socks.  Then tie a small piece of 10 stitches into 10 rows.  Measure it and calculate how many loops are in one centimeter.  Now calculate how many loops you need, but keep in mind that the number of loops should be a multiple of four, that is, all loops should have an equal number of loops. </p><p>  Well, the first step to knitting socks over night has been taken.  Now the process itself.  On the typed loops, we knit a 2x2 elastic band - alternately 2 front and 2 wrong.  In order for the sock to grip the leg well and not slide off it, the elastic should be 6-8 cm high. </p><p>  Having knitted an elastic band, we begin to make a heel.  Threads from only two knitting needles participate in this process - the third and fourth.  In order for the heel to last longer, add <span>kapron thread</span> to the knitting <span>.</span>  We knit a fabric equal to the height of the heel of the future sock.  You can determine the required number of rows in a very simple way.  To do this, it is enough to count the <span>edge loops:</span> their number should equal the number of loops on one spoke.  For example, if there are 15 loops on one spoke, then 30 rows need to be knitted.  In this place, the elastic is replaced by stocking, that is, it is knitted with only facial loops. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you continue to follow our tips, then knitting socks overnight is very easy.  A sock that appears on the eyes is a clear confirmation of this. </p><p>  Now round the heel.  To do this, divide the number of loops on two working knitting needles by three and reduce the loops inside the resulting fabric using shortened loops.  Thus, the first and third parts will be reduced and only the middle loops will remain. </p><p>  The next step - all loops are introduced into the work.  To do this, additional loops from each edge loop are gathered on the sides of the heel.  We knit a foot equal to the length of the leg of the person to whom the socks are intended.  Knit should be up to the little finger, and so that the little finger was closed. </p><p>  Once you have reached the desired length - you can close the sock.  You need to do this correctly, carefully calculating the loops and their reduction.  Only in this case the sock will turn out beautiful and accurate.  It is best to use this technique: all loops are divided into 5 parts, and in each part 2, the last loops are knitted together.  Thus, it fits until 2 loops remain on each spoke.  Now through all 8 loops we stretch the thread and fix them. </p><p>  Hooray, one sock is ready.  How long did it take you?  Surely, no more than 2-3 hours.  So half the battle has been done, and if you have a little more patience, then you will see from your own experience that you can knit socks overnight. </p><p>  Now we repeat the knitting process again: elastic, heel, base, toe.  By the way, so that the toe was stronger, it can be strengthened with an additional nylon thread, just like the heel. </p><p>  Well, now you know how to knit socks.  But we gave only general recommendations, it depends on you which socks you will get.  They can be made multi-colored or striped, the elastic can be different in height.  You can add inserts connected by some kind of pattern, for example, bundles, or even some kind of lace. </p>
