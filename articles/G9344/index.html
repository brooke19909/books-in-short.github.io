    <p>  This small fishing village is located on the very shore of the Black Sea and is part of the State Dendrological and Marine <span>Reserve Utrish.</span>  The distance to Anapa is only 20 kilometers, and to Novorossiysk - 30. </p><p>  It is worth noting that getting to a secluded village is by no means easy: it can be done either by sea or by a not-so-convenient dirt road.  Nevertheless, rest here is worth all the efforts and difficulties.  After all, relict trees provide clean, fresh air, and the mountains protect the area from cold winds.  By the way, the tourist season lasts from May to October.  During this period, the temperature does not fall below 20 degrees. </p><p>  In the village there are only two small bases for tourists.  In addition, travelers can find accommodation in the private sector.  There is also a tent camp. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The recreation center "Small Utrish" </h2>
