And this means that now the channels will be broadcast in digital format, that is, in a more advanced quality.  But just for viewing, you will have to buy the necessary equipment and configure the television channels.  Of course, you can always call the wizard and make the necessary settings for payment.  But why overpay when you can do everything yourself?  Moreover, setting up television channels in a TV is not such a difficult task. </p><h2>  What are the types of broadcasting </h2><p>  Depending on the method of receiving the signal, three types of broadcasting are distinguished.  The setting of television channels, the quality and number of broadcast channels will depend on the particular type. </p><ol><li><p>  Broadcasting.  Usually in this case, the channels are broadcast from the nearest tower.  It is enough for city residents to install the indoor antenna. </p></li><li><p>  Cable TV.  There is a certain distribution center, from which signals are sent to subscribers via cable connection. </p></li><li><p>  Satellite  The signal from the satellite enters a special antenna (dish), and then it is converted using the receiver and transmitted to the TV. </p></li></ol><p>  In turn, broadcasting is divided into analog and digital.  As we already wrote, analogue is no longer available for residents of Russia, so from now on you will have to purchase a special device or a suitable TV to watch TV channels in any way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tr.eyeni.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="setting up television channels in a TV" class="if uuid-3112225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44778/3112225.jpg"></div><h2>  The easiest way </h2><p>  Perhaps the most affordable and easy way to get a vivid picture and about two dozen channels in digital quality is to connect to broadcasting.  If your goal is to configure digital channels through a conventional television antenna, you will have to buy a TV with a built-in receiver. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Be sure to check with your consultant before buying whether the TV supports the dvb t2 format.  The fact is that even in modern LCD TVs, such a function may not be available. </p><p>  All you need to do next: </p><ul><li><p>  connect a regular television antenna to the antenna output; </p></li><li><p>  use the remote control to enter the settings menu; </p></li><li><p>  select ‚ÄúScan‚Äù or ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù depending on the TV model; </p></li><li><p>  confirm the storage of the found channels. </p></li></ul><p>  On this, the setup of television channels and their installation is considered complete.  But what to do for those who do not have a modern TV with a built-in receiver, and purchase of such is not currently planned? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sellcell.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="setting up television channels" class="if uuid-3112276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44778/3112276.jpg"></div><h2>  How to catch digital channels? </h2><p>  So, in order for even the most ordinary TV to show digital channels, you have to purchase a receiver.  The average cost of such receivers varies from 800 to 3,000 rubles.  In fact, receivers, or they are also called receivers, are not much different from each other.  Some are equipped with buttons on the panel, while others have a more elegant appearance, but in general they catch the signal approximately the same, and whether or not to overpay for additional functions is up to you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Installing television channels and setting up the <span>dvb t2 receiver</span> is as simple as that.  First you need to connect all the components together: we connect the antenna to the receiver, and the receiver itself to the TV using an HDMI cable. </p><p>  First, on the TV remote control, find the audio / video output, usually it is indicated as AV.  Then it remains to search for channels, which is done using the remote control of the receiver.  Naturally, the names of the menu sections and the design of the windows may vary depending on the model of the receiver, but the essence of the search is always the same.  And, of course, it doesn't matter which model your TV is.  The setting of television channels on Samsung, for example, will be exactly the same as on other models. </p><p>  After the menu language, region, mode and image format are selected, it remains only to select the automatic search menu. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iptvuruguay.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tuning digital channels through a conventional television antenna" class="if uuid-3112528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3112528.jpg"></div><h2>  Cable TV </h2><p>  If you decide to enjoy the benefits of cable television, then to view you will need to adhere to the following plan: </p><ol><li><p>  First you need to conclude an appropriate contract with the provider. </p></li><li><p>  Then turn on the TV, and if the message ‚ÄúChannels are not tuned‚Äù is displayed on the screen, go to the next item. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div></li><li><p>  On the control panel, find the "Menu" button, and then the button - "Auto-tuning" and click "OK." </p></li><li><p>  You wait until the automatic tuning of the TV channels ends.  This may take several minutes, depending on the number of broadcast pictures. </p></li><li><p>  If duplicates of some channels appear, they are deleted. </p></li></ol><p>  Naturally, channels can also be tuned manually.  But then you have to search and enter the appropriate frequency for a long time, which is not very convenient. </p><div class="photo" data-original="adview.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="setting up television channels in a samsung tv" class="if uuid-3112192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44778/3112192.jpg"></div><h2>  Channels from Rostelecom </h2><p>  The Rostelecom company is a leader in the Russian market in the field of communication services (Internet, telephony and television).  The subscriber may get a little confused at the initial stage at the sight of numerous packages and various special offers.  But with a great desire, you can do without the services of a wizard and configure Rostelecom-TV yourself. </p><p>  After signing the contract for the provision of services, the specialist will give you everything you need to watch TV.  What is included: </p><ul><li><p>  in fact, the prefix itself; </p></li><li><p>  Remote Control; </p></li><li><p>  power cable; </p></li><li><p>  HDMI cable </p></li><li><p>  book. </p></li></ul><p>  To begin with, as usual, all the components are connected to each other.  Make sure that the device is connected to the Rostelecom network and that the source is selected on the TV - Source. </p><p>  Fortunately, the setup of TV channels at Rostelecom is fully automated, and it is enough for the subscriber to follow a few points: </p><ol><li><p>  Pick up the console from the console and press the "Menu" button. </p></li><li><p>  Next, select the "Settings" or Settings, and then - "Connections". </p></li><li><p>  It remains only to click on "Automatic tuning", and the channels will be found within a few minutes. </p></li></ol><p>  Remember: modern models of consoles can perform automatic tuning and additional channel search.  If the client has a satellite dish (dish) installed, you may need to manually configure it, but this matter is best left to a specialist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="comuedu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV setup Rostelecom" class="if uuid-3112247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44778/3112247.jpg"></div><h2>  Set up Tricolor TV </h2><p>  Any of the above equipment may fail, and as a result, channels may disappear.  Tricolor TV is no exception.  Suppose, for some reason, the channels have disappeared, let's find out what the subscriber should do. </p><p>  Check if all channels are missing.  If you notice that some channels still show (Tricolor-TV info channels), this suggests that everything is in order with the equipment and signal.  The problem is that the package has expired.  That is, you need to replenish your balance in the client‚Äôs personal account or directly pay for the subscription.  After you make the necessary amount, you must leave the receiver on (the TV can be turned off) for 8 hours, the channels should appear automatically. </p><p>  If all the channels are missing, check the stability of the external antenna (dish), the integrity of the cable and check with the operator whether everything is in order with the signal.  In the case of an affirmative answer, automatically search for TV channels using the remote control from the receiver.  Thanks to an intuitive interface, a search is not difficult. </p><h2>  Reset to factory settings "Tricolor-TV" </h2><p>  There are times when a Tricolor subscriber suddenly disappears all channels except one, on which a video with instructions is broadcast.  In this case, only resetting the settings to the factory settings will help restore the list of channels.  What should be done?  Here is a step-by-step instruction: </p><ol><li><p>  First you need to press the "Menu" button on the control panel and then enter the "Settings" or "Applications" subsection (depending on the receiver model). </p></li><li><p>  Then select "Factory settings", press and confirm your action. </p></li><li><p>  After the reset command, the prefix will automatically reboot.  You must press the STANBY button (red button at the top). </p></li><li><p>  Next, select the menu language audio 1 - Russian, audio 2 - unchanged. </p></li><li><p>  In the "Operator" section, select - "Tricolor". </p></li><li><p>  The time zone (UTC shift) is selected in accordance with your time zone. </p></li><li><p>  Update from satellite - ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. </p></li><li><p>  By the result of the auto search, you will be asked to save the channels found.  Confirm the save in the dialog box. </p></li></ol><p>  Important: three options are proposed as the main region: primary, MSC + 0 and MSC + 2.  If you select the first option, the channels will be unavailable, the second and third options imply broadcasts according to Moscow time and with a two-hour shift. </p><div class="photo" data-original="millitv.az" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="setting up television channels with fiber" class="if uuid-3112543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3112543.jpg"></div><h2>  Tuning channels on an old TV </h2><p>  Above, we described the procedure for searching for channels of modern formats.  Fortunately, most of the current models of TVs and set-top boxes support automatic tuning, so the user only needs to click on the desired pop-ups a couple of times, and the channels themselves are installed in the correct order. </p><p>  But what about those who still use older TVs?  Automatically do something here will not succeed, you will have to configure everything manually.  Let's see how to do this using the example of setting up television channels on Goldstar. </p><p>  To enable the search, press the S button. When the TV tunes to a channel (the setting should stop), press the M button - the STORE_ _ symbol appears in red on the screen.  Then, within 5-10 seconds from the remote control (or from the front panel using the P + or P- buttons), enter the channel number and press the M button again, and the STORE 01 symbol will change its color from red to green.  Everything, the channel in memory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fortune.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tuning television channels to goldstar" class="if uuid-3112270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44778/3112270.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you want to enjoy watching TV programs and at the same time do not pay the wizard for the installation, you can always do the search yourself.  Fortunately, now almost all models of TVs and receivers are equipped with automatic search.  Therefore, it does not matter whether the television channels are tuned with fiber or through a conventional antenna, everyone can do this procedure. </p>
