    <h2>  Boy dreaming about the sky </h2><p>  The famous German pilot was born in Germany in 1912.  The boy's parents were German Adolf Felix Galland and Frenchwoman Anna Schipper.  The head of the Galland family, continuing the family tradition, held two honorable posts in the county of Westerholt - the treasurer and the manager, so the future fate of the boy was most likely predetermined. </p><p>  However, little Adolf dreamed about aviation from a very young age.  When the boy saw a glider soaring in the sky, he lost his peace.  Adolf Galland saw himself only as a pilot, he literally raved about the sky. </p><p>  Family upbringing was very strict.  Adolf was the second child of four, and each of the children gave his father a certain nickname, which he was supposed to respond to.  The hero of our story was called Keffer.  Adolf‚Äôs two brothers will also later become pilots. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since in Germany there was a ban on their own air forces, many people who wanted to learn flying began with the development of gliders that were allowed.  Immediately after graduation, the young pilot enrolled in flight courses, after which he completed his first flight.  Such a significant event occurred in 1928.  The father supported his son‚Äôs enthusiasm, and after his first flight gave him a new glider. </p><p>  So Adolf Galland (see photo in the article) became a pilot-instructor in gliding.  In 1932 there was a new round in his career - he began working at the commercial airline Lufthansa. </p><h2>  Threat to a successful career </h2><p>  January 1934 was marked by the fact that Adolf Galland was in the Luftwaffe, where after 9 months he received the rank of lieutenant.  Having agreed to serve there, the young pilot signed an agreement on participation in a secret military program. </p><p>  It was at this time that Adolf met Hermann Goering, the commander of the German Air Force. </p>

    <p>  The young pilot loved to take risks, and often practiced <span>aerobatics</span> during flights <span>.</span>  In October 1934, a misfortune happened to him - during one of the flights, while performing a complex figure, he lost control and his biplane crashed into the ground at speed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The pilot received such serious injuries that doctors issued a verdict on the end of his career.  Adolf's left eye was very badly damaged, his nose and skull were broken, and these injuries were incompatible with his profession. </p><p>  The desire to fly with Adolf Galland turned out to be so great that, despite the disappointing forecasts of the doctors, he was able to recover and return to his beloved business. </p><h2>  First downed plane </h2><p>  In 1937, Adolf Galland, of his own free will, transferred to the Condor legion, which was involved during the Spanish Civil War.  As part of this legion, he made many sorties. </p><p>  It was at this time that the pilot's ‚Äúcalling card‚Äù appeared.  On all his planes, he painted Mickey Mouse with a cigar in his mouth.  Adolf has repeatedly admitted that he really likes this cartoon character, and he is also a passionate admirer of cigars. </p>

Black sunglasses, a frayed helmet, an invariable cigar in his mouth - that was Adolf Galland, the ace of German aviation.  Height, weight of the pilot, too, were suitable for all parameters of this profession.

    <p>  In May 1940, the beginning of his military victories was laid.  Performing one of the combat missions in Belgium, he shot down his first enemy aircraft. </p><h2>  Air victories </h2><p>  Galland at the beginning of World War II was an instructor for pilots.  Later retrained in fighter jets. </p><p>  During the war years, pilot Adolf Galland went to battle on almost all fronts.  He shot down more than 103 enemy aircraft, for which he was repeatedly awarded high awards. </p><p>  In December 1942 he was awarded the title of Major General, and Adolf became the youngest military man to have such a high rank.  Having been promoted, Galland was suspended from participation in battles, but despite the ban, he sometimes allowed himself sorties. </p><p>  After 2 years, the pilot was expecting another increase, on December 1, 1944 he was awarded the rank of lieutenant general. </p><h2>  Battle rewards </h2><p>  The first award, which was awarded to the pilot, is the Iron Cross II class.  Continuing to fight and shoot down enemy planes, he receives the same award, but already in the first class. </p>

    <p>  When the battle for England began, Galland was awarded the Knight's Cross.  Over time, for the victory, the pilot was awarded <span>Knight's Crosses</span> with oak leaves, swords and diamonds. </p><p>  Bringing his account of victories to the number 56, he began to be considered the best Luftwaffe pilot. </p><h2>  Galland and Goering </h2><p>  The first meeting of these two military was friendly, Goering really liked Adolf.  However, increasingly, their views on the use of aircraft in the course of hostilities varied. </p><p>  The situation worsened markedly when intensified bombing of Germany by Allied aircraft began.  After the destruction of the country's cities in 1945, Goering put all responsibility on Galland, and soon, having removed him from his post, he was arrested. </p><p>  Only the intercession of Hitler helped the pilot avoid the danger looming over him. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="adolph galland personal life" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40750/1280811.jpg" width="600"></div>  Life after the war </h2><p>  Until April 28, 1947, Galland was captured by the Allies.  Having freed himself, the pilot chose Argentina for his place of residence.  Here he lived until 1955, successfully fulfilling the duties of adviser to the commander of the Argentine Air Force. </p><p>  Adolf Galland, whose personal life was always stormy, married three times.  The first time, while still living in Argentina, he was married with Countess von Donhoff.  This significant event took place in 1954. </p><p>  Returning to Germany in 1955, the pilot became the owner of his own company.  And in 1963 he married a second time.  His wife, Hanneliz, gave him two children - a boy (b. 1966) and a girl (b. 1969). </p><p>  For the third time, As married at a respectable age.  When he was 72 years old, he was married in 1984 with Heidi Horn. </p><p>  Galland successfully engaged in his own business, and was also president of the German Fighter Pilot Association. </p><p>  Adolf died in 1996 in the city of Oberwinterer in his own house. </p><h2>  Memoirs </h2><p>  In addition to his victories in memory of himself, the pilot left his memoirs.  By examining the materials written by Galland, you can recreate the full picture of all the hostilities that took place on the Western Front during World War II.  The author made a complete analysis of the state of aviation of all the warring parties, and also assessed strategic errors during the military campaign. </p>
