Girls like to receive such presents much more than men.  How to make a DIY wedding card for the bride?  You can capture a gentle image on paper.  If you are well acquainted with the bride and have already seen her dress and have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hairstyle that the girl will do, it will not be difficult for you to transfer the imaginary image to paper.  Reliably drawing everything is not necessary.  Exaggerate an imaginary picture.  You need to make something like a stylish fashion illustration.  The dress and hairstyle in the picture can be duplicated with fabric.  Glue the pieces of tulle so that they become a harmonious addition to the skirt and hairstyle.  By the way, the hairstyle can also be made voluminous.  For example, make it out of thread.  In the hands of the bride you can insert a natural flower or use a plastic blank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Postcard with stamp. </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ohsobeautifulpaper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card with stamp" class="if uuid-2439863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2439863.jpg"></div><p>  Newlyweds love the old days?  Then you can make a wedding anniversary card with your own hands in the style of the last century.  How to create such a present?  Take thick paper and burn it around the edges of the candle.  Now with strong tea leaves and a cotton pad, paint over the workpieces.  The edges of the sheets can be tinted with watercolors.  Dilute the paint with water and use a slightly damp brush to walk along the edges.  On one of the sheets write a wish.  You should write with ink or a black gel pen.  It is advisable to practice writing the text.  It should be a beautiful picture.  You can complement such a card with a light watercolor drawing.  On the first sheet, write the names of those who are going to give the present.  Now tie the two leaves with a ribbon, melt the wax and pour it on the knot.  On wax you need to make a print with any seal. </p><h2>  Applique </h2><div class="photo" data-original="decorisme.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper applique" class="if uuid-2439865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2439865.jpg"></div><p>  For the manufacture you will need colored paper.  How to make such a greeting card with your own wedding day?  As a basis, you need to use dense embossed cardboard.  Take a paper with a print of hearts or any circles.  Bend the blank in half and decorate the edges of the cardboard with paper ribbons.  It can be something like lace or filigree.  Just above the center you need to create the main image.  From red paper, you can use velvet, cut out the heart.  Glue it to the card.  We cut birds out of gold paper.  Their figures will consist of two parts.  Separately, we first glue the birds, and then their wings.  We place the birds on a branch, and then decorate it with leaves.  In order for the card to be visually balanced, in the lower part you need to glue a ribbon tied to a bow.  The wish inside the postcard can be issued in the style of the front part of the product.  Draw a frame and glue hearts and birds around its perimeter. </p><h2>  Graphic design </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.splitcoaststampers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="graphic design" class="if uuid-2439869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2439869.jpg"></div><p>  Do-it-yourself greeting card for parents on their wedding anniversary can be made of paper and fabric.  If your relatives prefer the classics, then you can stand your product in this style.  Do not think that the black and white version of the design of the postcard looks stern, on the contrary, a laconic form is emphasized by a complex print.  We proceed to the manufacture of such a product.  Before you begin the manufacturing process, you need to find the right fabric.  It is advisable to select material that is the same in composition, but different in its stylistic decision.  Cut the fabric into strips and glue to the base.  Cut out the heart from the workpiece.  Take thick paper, which will become the basis of the postcard.  Fold the sheet in half and draw a thick black line around its perimeter.  In the upper part, you need to cut a slightly smaller heart than a cut blank.  At the bottom of the postcard we glue the bow.  If you wish, you can write something in the lower corner of the product. </p><h2>  Dress and suit </h2><div class="photo" data-original="marsouille.canalblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card with dress and suit" class="if uuid-2439873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2439873.jpg"></div><p>  Not sure how to make a wedding card with your own hands?  A very effective option is presented above.  To make such a card, you need a sheet of black thick cardboard.  Fold it in half and take a pencil.  In the upper right corner, draw a v-neck.  Make a cut in the middle of the pencil lines.  Unscrew the edges of the resulting shirt in accordance with the sketch.  Complete the gate with two triangular cutouts.  We fold the sheet of white paper in half and insert it with a second layer inside the black card.  In this position, we fix the workpiece.  Glue a black bow tie on the front side or make a tie.  We detail the costume: draw the buttons and make a patch pocket.  It's time to create a bride's dress.  From the <span>textured paper we</span> cut out the silhouette of the dress.  Glue a piece of lace or tulle to the upper edge.  We make a necklace from small beads, and glue the ribbon on the waist in the form of a belt.  It remains to place the bride's dress on a postcard. </p><h2>  Greeting card with flowers. </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blog-scraptherapy.blogspot.com.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card with flowers" class="if uuid-2439877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2439877.jpg"></div><p>  Such a present looks very impressive.  A photo of a DIY wedding card is presented above.  To create such a product does not take much time.  The difficulty will only lie in the selection of materials.  To make a postcard, you will need several types of paper, artificial flowers, beads, metal and plastic fittings, as well as ribbons.  Making scrapbooking cards with your own hands for a wedding will not cause any special problems.  First, the base is made.  On white paper you need to apply a craft sheet, and then, paper with floral print.  Just above the center, you need to cut a window in the upper layer.  Around the paper cutout, create a frame.  It can be something vegetable, baroque or ornamental.  In the left part we fasten the flowers.  You can also stick tapes, chiffon cuts and stripes of lace here.  You can sign a card manually, or you can print it on a computer.  If you decide to use the printout, then add the elements of manual labor into it by highlighting some of the letter elements with a colored or shiny pen. </p><h2>  Thread card </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thread card" class="if uuid-2439881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2439881.jpg"></div><p>  How to make a DIY wedding card?  In order to make something beautiful, you need an original idea.  You can decorate a thick sheet of paper with the help of a complex design of threads.  How to create it?  Take a solid base, such as a small piece of wood or a sheet of foam.  Drive the cloves into the base.  Arrange them in the shape of a heart.  Take the red threads and start winding them in a chaotic manner, but so that the form fills uniformly.  When you manage to create a uniform openwork heart, fill it with strong fixation hairspray and wait.  Now take out the cloves and remove the heart.  You will need to duplicate the edge of the resulting form with wire or a thick tourniquet.  Glue the heart to the center of the card, and then create a cardiogram.  To do this, you will again need cloves and a base.  According to a previously drawn sketch, make zigzags, fix them with varnish and remove.  Complete with double lines the formed heart.  To make the composition look finished, you can make a postcard a frame.  But to supplement the product with ribbons and overhead parts is not worth it.  The main focus should remain the heart.  It is also advisable to decorate the inside of the card with threads.  Then the spread will harmoniously complement the front. </p>
