In general, this question is extremely simple.  Only the process has a variety of features and alternatives that you need to know.  For example, how reporting is completed.  Or, who should, and how often, report to the state for profits and accrued losses.  If you thoroughly understand all this, no tax report will be scary to you.  Let's get started as soon as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deadline for income tax return" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1211264.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Income tax </h2><p>  But first, find out what we should be accountable for?  It has already turned out that we will be interested in the deadline for submitting income tax returns.  What kind of payment is this? </p><p>  It is easy to guess that we are talking about income.  The tax is levied on individuals and legal entities and organizations.  That is, from everyone who only has some kind of official income.  There are exceptions to the rules, but not always.  More often than not, they are simply exempt from paying tax, and not from reporting.  In any case, it is necessary to report on your profit.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter if it is taxed or not. </p><p>  Income tax is a contribution that is calculated regularly.  Reporting in different cases is diverse.  It all depends on how exactly the income was received, as well as what tax system takes place in a particular case. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Quarterly </h2><p>  For example, a fairly common case is a quarterly report.  Valid for certain organizations.  In this case, you have to constantly prepare reports.  Once a quarter, half a year, as well as 9 months.  And, of course, by the end of the tax <span>reporting period</span> - by April 30 of each year. </p><p>  There is one limitation.  <span>A tax return</span> (income tax) in one case or another must be submitted to the appropriate service no later than 28 days after the end of the <span>tax period.</span>  In practice, they try to make all manipulations with reports much faster. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fill out income tax return" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1211265.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Year </h2><p>  There is also one very interesting rule.  It applies, as in the previous case, to legal entities, as well as organizations.  As we have already found out, the deadline for submitting <span>income tax returns</span> varies.  It can be a quarter, 9 months, half a year.  And you need to provide a report no later than after 28 days following the end of the period.  There is nothing difficult about this. </p><p>  But the mandatory (and, as many believe, the most important) report is an annual one.  As you might guess, it is compiled once a year.  The quarterly report is valid for a given period, but the annual report for the previous year.  That is, in 2016 you report for 2015 and so on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He also has his own specific deadlines.  You must <span>fill out a declaration (income tax</span> ), as well as submit it to the tax authorities by March 28 of each year.  Moreover, as already mentioned, information is reported for the previous period.  There is nothing difficult or special about this.  Such rules are established in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accounting reporting forms" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1211267.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Simplified system </h2><p>  Forms of financial statements include not only standard cases, but also special taxation regimes.  The thing is that some companies (and individuals) choose some special form of reporting to the state.  For example, by "simplification".  This is the most common case for individuals. </p><p>  If you have an LLC open, then the deadline for submitting income tax return with the simplified tax system will be annual.  Once a year, you must report to the state about your income.  In this case, the period is set for LLC until March 31. </p><p>  Nevertheless, such a form of activity as IP is most often used.  This is especially true not of companies and organizations, but of individuals.  They also have an annual report.  No quarterly, semi-annual, and so on.  Once a year, it will be necessary to provide tax authorities with information about their income and expenses (in some cases).  At the same time, it can report to the STS IP until April 30 of each year.  This period is considered the tax reporting period for all. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  "Impregnation" </h2><p>  Also, special forms of financial statements include the UTII system.  She is also called "imputation."  Not the most common phenomenon, but it does occur.  At the same time, keep in mind that you will often have to report on your income.  Once a quarter. </p><p>  The quarterly report in this case will be submitted no later than the 20th day of the month following the end of the reporting period.  Otherwise, if you don‚Äôt meet the deadlines, problems may begin.  So keep this fact in mind. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quarterly report" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1211266.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In principle, these are all basic rules that can only relate to our topic today.  We found out the deadlines for submitting income tax returns.  What's next?  What features does this moment have? </p><h2>  For individuals </h2><p>  But do not rush.  Individuals, as we have already found out, also have to pay income tax.  Even if they are not registered as individual entrepreneurs.  For example, income tax is levied on you when you rent a property.  Or when selling it.  For all this, it is necessary to report to the state. </p><p>  But in what terms should be kept within?  You do not need to immediately run and try to fill out a declaration (income tax).  The thing is that individuals have every right to report on their profits once a year.  Moreover, this is the option used by taxpayers. </p><p>  Moreover, the deadline is set quite humane.  It is exactly the same as for the IP.  That is, you must report on the income received in the previous year until April 30.  But with the payment of taxes, everything is much easier.  But more on that later.  The main thing to remember: individuals report for their profits once a year, until April 30.  It is important. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="income tax declaration filling" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1211269.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Tax payment </h2><p>  But <span>up to what date do you need to pay taxes</span> in one case or another?  Suppose, for profit reporting prepared and filed with the tax service.  What's next?  Is it necessary to pay right away or not? </p><p>  Not.  Both for organizations and individuals have their own rules in this matter.  In general, it all depends on the form of your reporting.  And the period in which you submit documents to the tax authorities. </p><p>  So, for organizations, payment of taxes is possible no more than 28 days after the submission of a profit declaration (quarterly).  And at the same time, if the annual report is used, you will have to pay until March 28 of each year.  Not later.  Previously, it will be an advance payment.  Very convenient and common among companies. </p><p>  But for individuals and individual entrepreneurs (LLC) with the simplified tax system, not everything is so severely limited.  They have the right to pay income taxes, as a rule, before July 15 of each year.  And advance payments are set on April 30th.  By the way, it is the advance that is chosen most often.  Practice shows that reporting on profits and immediately getting rid of debts - this is what will save individual entrepreneurs and individuals from unnecessary problems in the future.  Paid and forgot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="income tax return" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1211268.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About filling </h2><p>  We need to produce a profit tax report.  The declaration, the completion of which many consider difficult, as we have already found out, is submitted to the tax authorities in different periods.  Nevertheless, the principle of compiling the report does not change.  Now you can fill in the relevant documents both manually and in electronic format using special applications.  It is the second option that is in great demand among citizens. </p><p>  What is needed for reporting?  Of course, information about the taxpayer.  Which ones, depends on who the payer is.  If an individual or individual - enough passport data and TIN.  But organizations should have their own details.  And they will be indicated in special fields in reports. </p><p>  Also, information about sources of income will not interfere.  They are required.  And about the costs, if any, do not forget about this either.  So all the information will have to not only be documented, but also to be entered in the declaration. </p><p>  Basically, nothing else is needed.  It is enough to open a special program, select the 3-NDFL form there and fill in all the relevant fields.  If you have the documents listed above, there will be no problems with this.  After all, all areas are signed extremely simply for understanding.  At the end of the process, click on "Form" - you get a ready-made declaration.  It remains to sign it and submit it to the tax authorities. </p><h2>  Interest on taxes </h2><p>  And now the most important thing: how much does one have to pay for one profit or another?  What is the tax in Russia for the funds received?  Reporting on time is only half the story.  An important point is the direct payment of income tax. </p><p>  It all depends on who is the payer of taxes.  And on what tax system it works.  Organizations in the Russian Federation pay 20% of profits, foreign companies - 30%, individuals - 13%, and for "simplification" you need to give either 6% or 15. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax report" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1211270.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There will be nothing difficult in the calculations.  The tax base (income-expenses) is multiplied by the interest received - it turns out the amount payable.  Next, reporting is compiled (if you have not done it before), submitted to the tax authorities, and then payment is made. </p>
