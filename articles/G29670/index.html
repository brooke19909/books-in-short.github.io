Rating on reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In this article, we compiled a <span>rating of hotels in</span> Sousse (Tunisia), based on reviews from tourists.  Immediately, it should be noted that in this African country the starryness of hotels does not always coincide with the generally accepted one.  Sometimes the ‚Äúfive‚Äù is exactly the same in terms of services and content as the ‚Äúfour‚Äù.  There are very worthy "treshki", which for some reason are undeservedly relegated to the category.  On their territory there are swimming pools, and animation, and a varied all-inclusive meal plan.  Tourists give these hotels a solid "four."  In general, 4 * hotels are the best option for both spoiled customers and unpretentious youth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia Sousse 4 star hotels" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/680271.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <h2>  What is interesting in Sousse (Tunisia)? </h2><p>  The hotels of this ancient city are located in the so-called tourist zone.  Sousse as a resort began to develop since the sixties of the last century.  Medina is the old part of the city.  It was founded by the Phoenicians in the XI century BC.  e.  In ancient times, it was an important port.  The Romans captured the city in 202  e.  and they called him Gadrumet.  In the <span>Byzantine Empire,</span> he bore the name Justinianpolis.  When the Arabs recaptured the Barbary coast in the seventh century, they reduced this long name to Sousse.  Many historical events left traces in the city.  It was captured either by the Spaniards, then by the Venetians and the French, and during World War II, Sousse was badly damaged by the bombing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now it is the third largest <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Tunisia.</span>  Its population is 100 thousand people.  The city itself should be visited in Medina.  Also, do not neglect excursions to Carthage, Kairouan, Duggu and El Jem.  An unforgettable experience leaves a trip to <span>the Sahara desert.</span> </p><h2>  Specificity of Sousse as a resort </h2><p>  Here the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãintegrated zones for tourism was first tested.  Away from the city, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, there are satellite villages, consisting entirely of hotels.  This is famous for Tunisia (Sousse).  <span>4</span> star <span>hotels</span> are present in each similar zone.  Any such tourist satellite has its own specifics.  Closer to Medina, young people love to settle.  There are many attractions, although the hotels themselves are old.  Ribat will appeal to fans of a quiet and budget holiday. </p><p>  Most hotels, and 4-star in particular, are concentrated in the tourist area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPort El Kantaoui.  A respectable audience rests there, many hotels have their own thalasso centers and golf clubs.  All 4 star hotels in Sousse have beaches.  They often, in addition to standard services (umbrellas, deck chairs), tourists are offered additional accessories, such as air mattresses.  There are also usual for all resorts water activities: ‚Äúbananas‚Äù, scooters, skis, boat trips on a boat with a transparent bottom, diving.  But what is the specificity of Sousse as a resort is the presence of a large number of hotels of different categories with almost the same name.  On one and the same territory two or even three hotels can be placed: 3 *, 4 * and 5 *. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rating of hotels in susa tunisia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/680279.jpg"></div>

Five-star hotels sometimes have a range of services, and prices attracting a solid "four".  These include the hotel "Melia Muradi Palace".  A beautiful horseshoe-shaped five-story building frames a large pool.  The rooms are spacious with balconies.  The room has a refrigerator and a safe.  What is noteworthy, the bathroom is separate.  It was probably because of him that the hotel received an additional star, because otherwise it provides the range of services that are available in the four-star hotels in the neighborhood.  There is also an indoor pool with a jacuzzi and a children's pool.  Reviews of tourists abound with laudatory odes to food: a lot of greens and fruits, delicious desserts, in the evenings the chef surprises with the ability to create masterpieces of national cuisines.  There are tennis courts, a mini-golf course.
