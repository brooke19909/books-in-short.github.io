    <p>  The advantage of this house is in good layouts, developed infrastructure around and a lot of public transport to the city.  The developer offers for sale one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments with a variety of layouts at different stages of construction. </p><p>  The price per square meter of housing in a panel house starts at 60 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  "Colway", residential district "Front Pushkin" </h2><p>  The project for the development of the territory in the quarter was highly praised at PRO Estate.  In addition to the development of three- and five-story houses with the author's architecture, the residential complex includes: </p><ul><li>  Sports complex - construction of an ice arena. </li><li>  Water park construction. </li><li>  Year-round entertainment center for tourists with outdoor and indoor areas, thematic pavilions in the spirit of fairy tales by A.S.  Pushkin, public garden, playgrounds. </li><li>  Multifunctional ultramodern clinic with a cardiology department. </li><li>  Equestrian Sports Club </li><li>  Shopping and entertainment center. </li><li>  Cinema. </li><li>  Recreation area near the water - beach, cafe, equipment rental. </li><li>  School rowing. </li></ul><p>  Apartments are not yet being sold, the start of development and the start of sales of apartments from the developer is planned in the near future. </p><h2>  "House on the street Gummolosarovskaya" from "PavlovskStroyInvest" </h2><p>  The developer has already commissioned a house built from time-tested and reliable building materials: reinforced concrete, aerated concrete and brick.  To provide heat and hot water, gas boilers were installed in the apartments - a technology that allows saving on utility bills, regulating the temperature in the apartment, and does not depend on the general heating system and interruptions in the city’s hot water. </p><p>  In each apartment, the developer installed a media converter, which ensures the uninterrupted operation of high-quality television, high-speed Internet and telephony, as well as a modern fire alarm system. </p><p>  The walking distance of the city’s park areas, its own landscaped area and the very location of the house at the intersection of quiet green streets provide residents with comfortable living and a positive environmental situation. </p><p>  Those who want to become owners of excellent housing should hurry up - the developer has only a few available apartments on Gummolosarovskaya Street. </p>
