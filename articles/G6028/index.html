It will warm your baby, make long walks and sleep in the fresh air more comfortable.  If you are a beginner and not too good at knitting, this article is for you.  In it, we will present three excellent models of bonnets for newborns crocheted knitted.  And also give the most understandable and detailed descriptions.  With our recommendations, you will definitely be able to connect an excellent headdress for the baby. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tanyahoveyphoto.com" data-author=": Tanya Hovey, "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet cap for newborn 3" class="if uuid-2936922" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2936922.jpg"></div><h2>  Model No. 1. A warm hat for a boy </h2><p>  We present to your attention a good crochet cap for a newborn.  It is designed for beginner needlewomen, simple and understandable.  Let's knit!  A warm hat will come in handy in autumn weather for long walks.  Your baby will sleep sweetly in a stroller, warmed by his mother's care. </p><p>  We will perform a warm crochet cap for a newborn using yarn of two colors - blue (for the main fabric) and yellow (for tying the edge) with a density of about 100 m per 100 g. Also, hook No. 3.5, a needle with a fairly wide eye, will be required for work scissors. </p><p>  We recommend choosing high-quality hypoallergenic threads for children's things, warm and pleasant to the touch.  For example, you can purchase such yarn: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Alize Baby Wool - in addition to acrylic, it contains 40% wool, 20% bamboo, which makes it ideal for demi-season items.  She is warm, soft and not prickly. </li><li>  Yarnart Bianca baby lux - consists of 55% acrylic and 45% wool.  Very soft, smooth and beautiful yarn. </li><li>  BBB Filati Alpaca Baby Mix is ‚Äã‚Äãa premium yarn made from alpaca wool and microfiber.  The threads are incredibly tender, warm and do not cause irritation on the sensitive skin of babies.  Ideal not only for autumn, but also for winter products. </li></ul><p>  It is undesirable to use exclusively synthetic, cheaper threads for the manufacture of children's things.  Acrylic, although it does not cause allergies, has low hygroscopicity and is electrified, and this can cause discomfort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet cap for newborn" class="if uuid-2932782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2932782.jpg"></div><h2>  Technology for knitting a warm bonnet for fall </h2><p>  Having prepared the necessary, get to work.  We make an amigurumi ring and 2 air loops (VP).  In a circle we knit 11 columns with one crochet (abbreviated C1H).  Close the connecting loop (SP) in the first column of the row. </p><p>  At the beginning of the second row, we perform 2 VPs and begin to make increases.  In the next loop and in all the rest we knit 2 1.  We close the joint venture. </p><p>  Row number 3 start with 2 lifting loops.  After we knit 2 C1H and in the next chain - 1 C1H.  We use the alternation of two C1H and one C1H to the end of the row.  Close the joint venture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the beginning of row number 4 we make 2 VP.  Next, we work according to the scheme: 2 1 - 1 1 - 11 to the end of the row.  We close knitting SP. </p><p>  In the fifth row, we again perform 2 VP.  We knit one C1H (in each loop of the base), close the joint venture.  Check yourself, with all the increases you should count 44 loops. </p><p>  From the sixth to the eighth rows we use the fifth scheme. </p><p>  We begin the creation of row number 9 with 2 VP.  We perform 1 convex (embossed) double crochet.  We knit 1 C1H in the next chain.  Again we carry out 1 convex column.  We continue to work on this scheme until the end of the row, alternating between relief and ordinary double crochet.  We close the row, as usual, with the joint venture at the top of the first convex column. </p><h2>  Finishing work on a hat for a boy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="traversebaycrochet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cap for a newborn crochet description 3" class="if uuid-2938250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2938250.jpg"></div><p>  Our warm bonnet for a newborn is almost crocheted.  It remains to make the edge trim.  We attach the thread of yellow color to the canvas.  We collect 1 VP and in the base loops we perform one single crochet column (RLS).  Cut the thread.  Using a needle with a wide eye, we hide it in the canvas and fix the remaining ends.  Congratulations, our warm crocheted bonnet for the newborn is ready.  For beginner needlewomen, our description is a great opportunity to learn how to create beautiful children's things with your own hands.  Good luck and enjoy your work! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Model No. 2. Cute autumn bonnet for a girl </h2><p>  We bring to your attention another good model of a gentle bonnet for a newborn baby.  Novice masters will be able to complete the product, the main thing is to clearly follow the instructions and be guided by the description. </p><p>  How to crochet a cap for a newborn?  Let's start with the preparation of materials.  You will need: children's yarn in three colors - white, light pink and dark pink (density per 100 g 200 m), hook No. 4, pink button 15 mm, needle, scissors.  Knitting density of the sample: 18 RLS * 9 rows = 10 cm. The size of the product is designed for a baby aged 0-3 months. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crochetkingdom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cap for newborn crochet description" class="if uuid-2935174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2935174.jpg"></div><h2>  Detailed description of work on model No. 2 </h2><p>  Crocheting a bonnet for a newborn begins with a white thread.  We collect 56 VP.  In the first row we make in the third from the hook a loop 1 half-crochet with a crochet (PPSN).  In each loop of the base to the end of the row we draw up 1 PPSN.  We get 54 elements. </p><p>  We begin the creation of the second row with 2 VP.  We knit 1 PPSN in each loop.  The third row is performed by analogy with the second.  We change the thread to light pink.  In the fourth row, create 1 VP and knit 1 sc in all the columns of the previous row.  Rows from the fifth to the seventh we knit according to the scheme of the fourth.  We change the thread to dark pink. </p><p>  The eighth row is performed as follows.  We create 3 VP, in each loop of the base (to the end) we do 1 1.  We knit the ninth row by analogy with the eighth.  Rows from the tenth to the eighteenth are performed using the schemes of rows from the first to the ninth.  We change the thread to white. </p><p>  We knit the rows from the nineteenth to the twenty-first so: 2 VP at the beginning and 1 PPSN in each loop of the base.  Change the thread to light pink.  We work with single crochet columns until the canvas reaches the desired dimensions 6 * 15 cm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet cap for newborn 0 3 months" class="if uuid-2938251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2938251.jpg"></div><h2>  We are finishing work on a cap for a girl </h2><p>  In order for the product to take the correct forms, we fold the workpiece in half and stitch it.  We get an almost finished cap with a seam in the back of the head.  We proceed to tying the edges and making the fastener.  With dark pink yarn, we carry out a chain of 20 VP and attach it to the lower corner of the cap.  The front part of the product is decorated with crochets.  In the second "corner" we do 3 sc.  We continue to tie the product around the edge where the baby‚Äôs neck will be.  We return in a circle to the beginning of the row and close the joint venture in the first column. </p><p>  In the second row we tie a bonnet strap.  In each loop of a chain of 20 VPs, we create 1 RLS, except for the last one.  We perform 3 sc in it.  We turn the workpiece 180 ¬∞ C and knit the bars on the other side of the chain.  In the front part of the bonnet, we again knit one sc each, and in the occipital we make decreases.  To do this, we use the alternation of 2 single crochet with a common top and 1 sc.  Having decorated the occipital part, we return to the strap and once again tie it with crochets.  In the last loop we do 3 sc and 3 VP.  We turn the workpiece and skip 1 loop of the base.  On the other side of the strap we complete the strapping.  We cut the thread, fix the ends and hide.  Sew the button on the side opposite to the strap.  That's all, a cute hat for the girl for the fall is ready! </p><h2>  Model No. 3. Delicate openwork cap for crumbs. </h2><p>  To create this beautiful headdress, you will need soft yarn (with a density of 170 g by 288 m), hook No. 5, scissors.  The finished product is sized for an age of up to 3 months.  If you take hook number 4.25 for work, you will get a bonnet for the baby just born. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jessica-jensen.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheting a bonnet for a newborn" class="if uuid-2935195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2935195.jpg"></div><p>  We start knitting a bonnet with a magic ring and 1 VP.  In row number 1, we knit 12 single crochet.  Do it in the ring.  We connect the columns, the first and last, using the joint venture.  In the second row we use the scheme: a magnificent column - 2 VP.  We use it to the end of the row.  We complete the row with a connecting loop by introducing a hook into the second lifting VP.  As a result, we count 12 magnificent columns. </p><p>  In row number 3, we make 1 sc in the top of each lush column and 2 sc in the arches of 2 VP.  We join in the circle of the joint venture in the first single crochet.  We get 36 loops.  In row number 4, we knit a chain of 5 VP.  In the same loop we do 1 1.  After we use the pattern: * Skip the following 2 RLS bases, 1 1, 2 VP, 1  in one loop *.  Using this scheme, we form a V-pattern.  A row completes the joint venture in the third VP of the initial chain.  We count 12 V-elements. </p><p>  We do 3 VP at the beginning of the fifth row.  In each arch from 2 VP we knit 4 1.  Please note that the initial chain of 3 VPs counts as the first C1H.  Repeat until the end of the row.  We knit a connecting loop to the top of the initial chain.  We get 12 elements from 4 C1H. </p><p>  In the sixth row we do 3 VP.  We knit one C1H in the next 36 loops.  The remaining 11 loops are not knit, we turn the workpiece.  In the seventh row, we perform 4 VP and 1 C1H in the same loop.  Until the end we work according to the scheme: * pass 2 1 bases, 5 1 to the next loop, pass 2 loops, to the next - 1 1, 2 VP, 1 1 *.  We turn the product. </p><h2>  We continue to crochet an openwork cap for a newborn </h2><p>  The description of the eighth row is as follows.  First, create 3 VP and 2 C1H.  Next we use the pattern.  * We skip 2 1 of the previous row, in the next loop we knit 1 1, 2 VP, 1 1.  We skip the following 3 1, 5 1 into the arch of 2 VP *.  Repeat * - * to the end.  We carry out in the last loop 3 C1H.  We turn the product. </p><p>  In the ninth row, we knit 4 VP and 1 C1H in the same chain.  To the end we use the pattern: * skip the next 3  of the previous row, 5 1 to the arch of 2 VP, skip the next 2  of the base, 1 1, 2 VP, 1 1 to the next loop (in the middle of the ‚Äúshell‚Äù of the previous row) *.  We turn the workpiece.  If you wish, you can repeat the patterns of the eighth and ninth rows, so our baby caps for children, crocheted, will have great depth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jessica-jensen.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted caps for newborns" class="if uuid-2935208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2935208.jpg"></div><p>  In row number 10, we make 3 VP, 2 1 - in the arch.  Next, we use the scheme: * skip 3 loops, 1 sc in the next (middle of the ‚Äúshell‚Äù), skip 3 loops, 5 1 in the arch of 2 VP *, until we reach the last one.  We carry out 3 1 in it.  We collect a chain of 50 VP.  We turn. </p><p>  In the eleventh row, we knit from the hook into the first loop 1 RLS and in all the others too, until we reach the opposite side of the bonnet.  Again, we collect 50 VP.  We turn.  In the twelfth row, we again knit the single crochet into all the loops of the base.  We cut the thread, we fix the ends.  Congratulations, now you know how to crochet an openwork bonnet for a newborn (0-3 months).  This is not difficult at all, the process gives pleasure, and the result will warm your baby! </p>
