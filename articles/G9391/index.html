    <h2>  How it works? </h2><p>  Do not think that creating a wish card is to build some kind of magic thing.  The effectiveness of this method is explained even by psychologists.  The fact is that when a person clearly understands what he is dreaming of, he has a clear image of his desire.  For example, it can be a house where you want to live, a child, applauding fans and much more.  If you think about it constantly, the image will go into the subconscious. </p><p>  After some time, a person, without even realizing it, will take the necessary actions that will lead him to fulfill his dreams.  This effect has its name, namely - visualization of desires.  You can strengthen it when setting out life goals on paper in the form of text or in the form of images.  And if all this is also beautifully designed, and the person begins to consider the fruits of his labors every day, then the desired will come soon.  Psychologists call this technique <span>a visualization board.</span>  At its core, this is the wish card we are considering. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An explanation of her work can be found in Feng Shui.  This is an ancient art that helps to plan the fate of man, says that people's thoughts have a strong connection with the universe.  And whoever sends clearly articulated signals is already on the path to success.  The universe will certainly help their implementation. </p><h2>  Creation technique </h2><p>  A do-it-yourself wish map is made according to certain rules.  First of all, a person should clearly and clearly articulate his concept of what he most wants.  After this, it is necessary to imagine that this has already come true, that is, to visualize your desires. </p>

    <p>  Various methods are suitable for this.  Most people are helped by a relaxing and calm atmosphere at the moment when a wish card is made.  The rules for composing a collage dictate to start presenting your dreams to a pleasant melody, comfortably sitting in an armchair or on the couch.  For example, if a person‚Äôs cherished dream is a large and beautiful house, then it is worth collecting his image in the imagination.  It is necessary to mentally imagine the facade of the building, walk through all the rooms, light a fireplace, sit in a comfortable armchair, etc. After that, it is necessary to remember those pleasant sensations that were experienced at that moment.  After a clear statement of all desires, they need to be written on a piece of paper.  This will be needed in the future in order to create a map of desires. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The rules for compiling a collage warn against the use of a ‚Äúnot‚Äù particle.  All cherished dreams should be described in the present tense and as specifically as possible.  These may be phrases such as ‚ÄúI am rich,‚Äù ‚ÄúI am thin,‚Äù ‚ÄúI am the mistress of a red Mercedes,‚Äù etc. Only after all this has been stated on paper can we start compiling a wish card. </p><p>  But do not think that everything that you dream of can be formulated in just ten minutes.  In this case, the wish card will most likely upset than please its owner.  After all, this collage will not reflect those dreams that are really important.  So how should the wish card be planned?  The compilation rules require a person to devote at least an hour to formulate his goals, during which one could calmly think about what he really wants.  However, this process should not end there.  After preliminary consideration, several days should pass to double-check your desires.  Are they really the most important in life?  Only after that a person can confidently say that he wants to have exactly what he wanted. </p><h2>  Practical steps </h2><p>  How is a wish card created?  The rules for compiling such a collage require you to do this work yourself.  You cannot involve relatives or friends, acquaintances or even strangers in this process.  In addition, the production of such a collage should begin only with a positive mood. </p>

    <p>  A wish fulfillment card is applied on a piece of paper.  In addition, at hand should be: </p><p>  - old magazines; </p><p>  - ruler; </p><p>  - glue; </p><p>  - paint or colored paper; </p><p>  - scissors. </p><p>  <span>How to make a wish card?</span>  According to Feng Shui (if you follow the instructions of this practice), you will need to fill in nine sectors that correspond to the main areas of human life.  Ancient art correlates each of them with the cardinal points.  In addition, each sector must have a specific tone.  Thus, the first step in solving the question is "How to make a wish card?"  (see photo below) consists in dividing the Whatman paper into 9 equal parts. </p>

    <p>  Further, each of the obtained sectors is painted over or sealed with a color that corresponds to a certain side of the world. </p><h2>  The importance of sectors </h2><p>  So, your Whatman is divided into nine equal parts.  What does each of these mean when compiling a wish map?  We consider each of the sectors individually, following the same rule that is followed when reading books, that is, from left to right and from top to bottom.  Inside each of these parts you will need to place your photo, combined with the most <span>cherished desires.</span>  In other words, these should not be separate texts or pictures.  Filling each part should be a collage. </p><h2>  Wealth sector </h2><p>  Let's start with the first top of the wish card.  It represents a sector of wealth.  This area is painted with light green or light green color.  The wealth sector on our treasure map will be responsible for everything that connects a person with money and wealth.  Dreams about a summer house or an apartment, a car or a motorcycle, a cottage in the mountains or on the Black Sea coast, etc. are placed here. However, in this case too, the rules dictate their wish card.  All dreams must be expressed in the wealth sector in a specific amount.  The desire "I want a lot of money" just does not work.  This sector can be strengthened.  To do this, you will need to place a red pyramid with the LAM mantra in it. </p><h2>  Sector of fame </h2><p>  It is located in the central part of the top row of the wish card.  This sector is painted red.  This site is responsible for the recognition and fame of the person who made the collage.  And it‚Äôs not necessary for this to shine on TV or become the owner of an Oscar.  Here we are talking about the recognition of merit, skills, knowledge and experience of a person in the family, at work or in the company of friends and acquaintances.  Maybe others will appreciate your culinary masterpieces or playing a musical instrument?  Or maybe you dream of standing on the first step of the podium or on the huge stage of a popular theater?  Reflect these desires in the sector of glory.  To enhance this section of the wish card, it is worth placing images of cups, letters and medals here. </p><h2>  Love sector </h2><p>  Making a wish map for Feng Shui will require filling in the upper right section located on your Whatman paper.  This is a sector of love, which will need to be painted in dark brown.  This site is responsible for the sphere of human relations and for love.  Anyone who is married must post a photograph in this zone where he is taken with his spouse.  Those who dream of a wedding in this sector will need to put their picture in a wedding attire. </p><p>  The rules for compiling a wish card warn that those who are not legally married should not categorically use photographs of any particular person with whom they would like to connect their lives.  The universe will regard this as a love spell, which is a prohibited action.  How, then, does the wish card begin to work?  Reviews violating her rules confirm that she just stops working. </p>

    <p>  How to strengthen this zone?  To do this, you need to place affirmations.  For example: "I choose a man for a serious relationship." </p><h2>  Health sector </h2><p>  Consider the central row of the wish card.  In its left side there is a site that will need to be painted in dark green.  This is the health sector, which is also responsible for family relations.  Specific dreams about the state of the human body are placed here.  These may be desires for normal blood pressure, good sugar and cholesterol levels, etc. The rules for compiling a treasure map allow such simple and concise inscriptions as ‚ÄúI am healthy‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am healthy‚Äù. </p><p>  As for family relations, in this sector it is enough to put pictures indicating excellent relations between children and parents, love between husband and wife, as well as mutual understanding with other family members.  The amplifier for this sector will be the image of delicate and beautiful peach fruits. </p><h2>  Central sector </h2><p>  What should the correct wish card include?  Reviews who work with this unusual visualization are advised to pay attention to the central section of whatman paper.  This sector should contain the most cherished and main dream!  The rules for creating a treasure map allow you to place several wishes, if it is difficult to choose only one of them.  On this site you can write down that dream, which, in your opinion, is not suitable for any other sector.  To enhance the effect of the card here you need to place the image of butterflies or hearts. </p><p>  Filling the central sector is a very important and crucial moment for those who seek to ensure that his creation gives the maximum return.  The fact is that on this site the health and personality of the cardholder are displayed.  His photograph is also placed here.  It is very important that the person in the picture is in a good mood.  That is why your image in the photo should reflect the happiest moment in life.  The rules allow the placement of several mounted images on this central site.  For example, it can be an image of someone slender and beautiful figure, to which your face is exposed. </p><h2>  Children and Creativity Sector </h2><p>  The zone located in the right corner of the central row of the wish card is responsible for the birth of babies and the creative growth of a person.  Anyone who wants to replenish the family should place in this sector an image of a pregnant woman or mother with a baby.  If the birth of children is not included in your plans, in no case do not decorate this area with such pictures.  The fact is that the Universe will certainly begin to fulfill this desire.  Testimonials testify to precedents. </p><p>  For those who dream of creative development, it is necessary to place in this sector an image of the Muse or some creative person.  It also contains the relevant desires.  This may be a dream of writing a bestseller, cross-stitching an epoch-making pattern, etc. Images of balloons are used as amplifiers for this sector. </p><h2>  Knowledge sector </h2><p>  We pass to the bottom row of our treasure map.  Here in the left corner should be located a plot painted in beige or light brown.  This is a sector of knowledge and skills that gives its owner the power to learn, not to stop halfway, to become wiser and constantly improve.  On this site you should put your desires regarding the acquisition of new skills.  This may be a dream of entering a university or getting a second higher education, learning Chinese, or success in baking delicious cakes.  A wonderful amplifier for this sector will be the images of textbooks and books. </p><h2>  Career sector </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the design of the zone, which is located in the center of the bottom row.  This is a career sector that should be painted blue.  How should the wish card be drawn up in this case?  Reviews of who this visualization board works for, confirm that desires regarding work should be placed on this site.  This may be the development of a new profession or climbing the career ladder, creating your own company or increasing the income from its activities.  The picture with the image of money will enhance the effect of the work of the wish card in this sector.  You can put here a drawing with the god of wealth Hotei. </p><h2>  Travel and Helper Sector </h2><p>  Well, here we come to the last zone of our wish card, which is located in the lower right corner of the Whatman paper.  Before filling it should be painted over this area in gray. </p>
