  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Origami machine with your child‚Äôs hands.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Let's say you wondered <span>how to make an origami</span> car.  To do this, we need to take a square sheet of paper.  The size and color of our square can be absolutely any.  Let's start by adding a square sheet diagonally.  We straighten the inflection and make the same bend diagonally from another angle.  Again, we unbend and turn the square so that the folds from the produced bends are on top.  Now fold the square sheet in the form of a book and straighten it again.  Again, turn the sheet over and again fold the book, but on the other side.  Unbend again.  Thus, we have not yet got an origami machine, but its partial harvest. </p><p>  Then we need to make the basic shape, which is called the ‚Äúdouble square‚Äù.  Fold the resulting square in half diagonally, bend the fold and bend the upper corner to the central fold band.  Bend the fold again.  We bend the same upper corner, but already to the strip obtained earlier. <br>  Now you need to turn the workpiece and bend the upper end line to the line below.  As a result, our corner seems to ‚Äúpop up‚Äù. </p><p>  Next, the entire folded figure must be fully expanded and folded along the third line from above.  We need to insert the top corner inward.  After adding the angle, you should push the corner up with your fingers.  We will get a figure, somewhat reminiscent of a volcano with a peak. </p><p>  Then we need to raise one layer from bottom to top.  Turn the workpiece over and raise another layer up.  Turn over the page of our workpiece and raise the remaining two corners up, as described above.  As a result, all four large angles should rise up. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now we need to pull one of the upper layers to the nearest corner and cover it from above with the same angle.  We get three corners hidden inside a triangle.  Turn the blank over and repeat the bending procedure, but on the other side. </p><p>  Before us is a triangle, at two angles of which three corners are hidden.  We need to bend each side to the center.  During the folding, a small pocket is formed, in which it is necessary to smooth only one, the far side.  Then we will do the same, but on the other hand.  Turn the blank completely and on the other hand do the same on each of the two sides.  Much has been done, but this is not an origami machine.  You will get a figure resembling a penguin with wings sticking out to the sides, where the lower body is represented by a small angle, and the top by a high and acute angle. </p><p>  At the next stage, it is important to remove sharp corners, getting a ‚Äúpenguin‚Äù, but the upper body ends with a tailcoat collar.  To do this, open the top of the workpiece from one side and remove the sharp corner, bending it to the lower small corner, return the side of the workpiece to its original position.  Turn the workpiece over and do the same with the second sharp angle. </p><p>  We bend the lower corners, the ‚Äúpenguin's legs‚Äù to its ‚Äútailcoat‚Äù on each side of the workpiece, and bend them again.  We take a finger into the formed "pocket" and lay in the form of a rhombus.  This procedure needs to be done with each ‚Äúleg‚Äù. </p><p>  Now we need to remove the last two corners from the bottom of our workpiece.  In order to make this easier, we will straighten out our model.  Now, the future origami machine looks like a rocket.  First, straighten two side sharp corners.  To do this, turn the model over and straighten, stretching, each of the corners on the sides.  Now we remove two large angles inside the model.  To make the bend more accurate and even on the sides, it‚Äôs worth removing small corners inside.  This will facilitate accurate bending into large angles. </p><p>  We turn over the model, which has found the outline of a typewriter, upside down.  And we see that our origami machine is still standing on square wheels.  Give them a round shape.  To do this, we will bend the sidewalls to which the wheels are ‚Äúattached‚Äù, bend a thin strip on them inward and return everything to its place.  We will do the same with all four sides.  Next, we bend the side corners, and the upper and lower corners on both sides need to be inserted inside. </p><p>  We almost answered your question how to make an origami machine.  We turn to the manufacture of the hood.  Smooth out all the corners and bend them back.  The lower corner must be raised up, but not completely.  Then we bend a small strip up, lower the bent corner down and tilt it back. </p><p>  Now you need to make the trunk.  To do this, it is necessary to bend the edges of the triangle on the side, and raise the resulting angle up and hide inward.  We align the bends with your fingers and enjoy the result.  A little harder than <span>origami modular.</span>  A machine made in this technique is made longer, but it may well become an original handmade gift. </p>
