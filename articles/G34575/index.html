Syanas are partially formed by karst cavities and funnels formed under the influence of natural phenomena. </p><p>  The main caves arose due to the extraction of snow-white limestone.  White stone was extracted from here from the 17th to the 20th century.  The stone, shining with whiteness, was used for the construction of Moscow.  From this limestone, runways were built at Domodedovo Airport.  By the 40s of the last century, the Syanovsky quarries were closed. </p><h2>  Historical facts </h2><p>  The interest of tourists in <span>abandoned mines</span> erupted in the 70s of the last century.  The activity of researchers, their powerful pilgrimage to the caves worried the authorities.  By their order in 1974, the entrance to the caves was bricked up with concrete. </p>

    <p>  A group of old cavers - the pioneers of Xiang - discovered the caves 14 years later, in 1988.  The names of the daredevils are inscribed on the wall in one of the grottoes.  Currently, these quarries are a popular excursion site near Moscow.  Up to a hundred people enter the caves on weekends. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  It is believed that the Syanovsky quarries, photos of which are made by tourists who descended into them, reach a length of approximately 70 kilometers.  Cavers currently studied tunnels with a length of about 30 kilometers.  Their height varies, reaching 0.4-3.5 meters.  Moreover, the total depth of calcareous rocks is 25-30 meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The entrance to the caves is uncomfortable, it is narrow and constantly in wet mud due to the rains that flood it.  Rains do not penetrate deep into the catacombs; there is no such slimy dirt as at the entrance.  The miniature grotto, which is located next to the entrance - the place of the general meeting of cavers. </p><p>  It contains the cave Journal, reminiscent of a ship.  Catacomb researchers, before being sent to the caves and after returning from them, enter their names (logins) in a huge notebook, accompanying them with witty inscriptions and funny drawings. </p><p>  The journal reflects the statistics of visits.  Thanks to him, it is always known how many tourists explore the Syanovsky quarries.  The speleologists' reviews confirm that by opening the Journal, at any time you can find out if any group is being delayed beyond measure in the cave labyrinth.  Perhaps she should already be contacted, to find out the situation in which people are, and if necessary, to help. </p>

    <p>  The intersection where the main tunnels converge is a gathering center for tourists who intend to explore the caves.  Here, at the ‚Äústop of the first carriage‚Äù, the largest number of researchers flock.  Here they learn from experienced cavers about the second exit from the quarries, located on the other side of Pakhra, get acquainted with the myths, legends and fables of Xiang. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The cleared grottoes in the quarry are numbered, in addition, arbitrary names were invented for them.  Some grottoes were called romantic and fabulous, others by strange and indecent names.  Named drifts are mapped. </p><h2>  Excursions in Syan </h2><p>  The caves bring joy to their visitors, giving them the opportunity to seek adventure among countless karst formations.  Tourists wander through multiple fusses in the ‚ÄúGromov-Sklif-Mlechnik‚Äù system, the ‚ÄúKarst‚Äù grotto, squeeze through the narrow ‚ÄúSchuchka‚Äù laz-skin-skater, visiting the Syanovsky quarries. </p>

    <p>  Tours often take place in the renowned tunnel "Gromov-Sklif-Mlechnik" - a unique line of Xiang.  Its far part, the Gromov Grotto, is incredibly popular; curious researchers most often climb into it. </p><p>  Cave "attractions" are widely known here.  Tunnel "Smoking-room" became famous for a narrow hole, consisting of several knees, bent at right angles.  It‚Äôs easy to get into the small Karman cave, and getting out is very difficult.  The tunnel is a steep descent running along the karst course. </p><p>  Visitors to the quarry must mention the "keeper of the caves" - the grotto "Aristarchus".  The cave "keeper" is a kind of "mummy" made from an old overalls filled with clay, and a real human skull crowned with a <span>German helmet.</span>  Here superstitious visitors leave all sorts of things: from cigarettes to money, believing that "donations" will not allow them to get lost in Syan. </p><h2>  Attractions Xiang </h2><p>  The Syanovsky quarries are dotted with natural funnels, legendary grottoes, tunnels into which each visitor penetrates, little-known drifts, caves that are under excavation, and those passages that are still tightly blocked up.  Some of them have become popular attractions. </p><h2>  Grotto of Gromov </h2><p>  Passages from the natural karst - the famous grotto of Gromov - lead to the caves "Smoking-room" and "Bottle".  Laz is named after the speleologist Gromov.  A legend goes about his dexterity, claiming that it cost him nothing to get out of this tunnel with a sheer descent upside down, spending no more than 15 seconds. </p><p>  A narrow manhole leads into a narrow karst cleft.  They squeeze through it, with their legs forward, their faces up, and their arms above their heads.  A rite of passage for beginners is held here. </p><h2>  Laz "Bottle" </h2><p>  It‚Äôs easy to get into the ‚ÄúBottle‚Äù, but getting out of it is problematic.  Climbing out of this hole is simply a ‚Äúsong‚Äù (in any case, this is what the reviews of tourists who managed to squeeze through the cleft in the opposite direction claim).  Difficulties arise when removing the hips from an excessively narrowed gap.  Until you turn them in a certain way, you cannot crawl out. </p><p>  In this case, the elbows must cope with two functions at the same time - to keep the body in the crevice and to help crawl along its passage.  If you lean against the walls with your feet, your hips are stuck in an excessively narrow tunnel. </p>

    <h2>  Tunnel "Pocket" </h2><p>  "Pocket" is a cleft that all cavers "love".  The tourists' comment about the grotto is this: the passage through the <span>tunnel is a dream</span> at night.  Memories of him excite the imagination, causing an involuntary laugh.  A gaping hole is terrifying even when viewed.  Down the tunnel, all the daredevils fly with a whistle, and when climbing they have to make incredible efforts.  <span>This grotto</span> must be passed to everyone who falls into the Syanovsky quarries. </p><h2>  Grotto "Master and Margarita" </h2><p>  The cave arch, shining with a moire glow, is decorated with a fresco "Margarita on a broomstick" and a cross hollowed out in the wall.  Here, under the cross, a tiny <span>candlelight is lit,</span> when the fire goes out, a shadow slowly creeps onto the cross, creating an infernal picture. </p><h2>  Eyes Xiang </h2><p>  Venus Grotto (Eyes of the Caves) is a narrow vertical cleft located between two tunnels.  The floor level here varies from different sides.  On the one hand, the floor is about 1.5 meters higher.  It is believed that only girls with a very slender figure are able to penetrate into the narrow gap. </p><h2>  How to get to Xian </h2>

    <p>  From the Domodedovskaya metro station, bus number 439. leaves every half an hour. Many people come to the Sianovsky quarries.  How to get to Xian by train?  They take the electric train at the Paveletsky railway station, the Lower Boilers station (Nagatinskaya metro station) and the Biryulyovo-passenger station.  They come out at the Leninskaya station. </p>
