  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Types of Questions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An interrogative sentence is a grammatical expression of a question.  This proposal contains an idea aimed either at supplementing or at clarifying the basic (basic) or initial knowledge (information). </p><p>  Q &amp; A logic </p><p>  <span>Cognitive activity</span> assumes the presence of basic knowledge.  In the process of cognition, the question (any) is based on this knowledge, which, in turn, is a prerequisite for the expression of refinement (or addition).  The realization of the cognitive function of thought is carried out in the form of an answer. </p><p>  There are basic <span>types of questions.</span>  Their classification is determined taking into account semantics, structure, functions, as well as their relationship to the topic of discussion. </p><p>  In accordance with semantics, there are types of questions that are implicitly or explicitly based or include a certain basic, initial knowledge, which acts as their premises.  Moreover, the quality of basic information determines the incorrectness or correctness of their statement. </p><p>  An incorrect question is an expression of thought with a contradictory or false basis.  For example: "What <span>type of energy</span> do UFOs use?"  A prerequisite for this issue is far from certain information about the existence of <span>unidentified flying objects.</span>  In other words, one should establish the fact of the actual existence of UFOs before being interested in the type of energy that they can use there. </p><p>  The correct (correctly posed) question is the expression of a thought having a premise with consistent <span>(true) knowledge.</span> </p><p>  In accordance with the cognitive function, there are two types of expression of thoughts.  So, questions can be complementary ("what-questions") or clarifying ("whether-questions"). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Refiners include expressions of thoughts that are aimed at determining the truth of a judgment.  For example: "Is it true that <span>Columbus discovered America?"</span>  or "Does Switzerland join NATO?" </p><p>  Replenishing include such questions that are aimed at determining new characteristics of the subject (object).  For example: "By whom was America discovered?"  or "What article punishes this crime?" </p><p>  In accordance with the structure, the following types of questions are classified: complex and simple. </p><p>  In simple queries of thought there are no components.  In a simple ‚Äúli-question‚Äù one proposition is applied, in a ‚Äúwhat-question‚Äù - a question word that refers to one proposition that needs to be clarified (or supplemented).  All of the above questions are simple. </p><p>  Complex requests of thoughts are distinguished by a special structure.  In such matters other questions are present in the form of components, which are united by logical connectives.  Given the type of ligament, connective (conjunctive), mixed (connective-dividing) and dividing (disjunctive) structures are determined. </p><p>  In connection matters, the union "and" is used for communication.  The expression scheme can be represented in various forms.  For example: "Is it true that an expulsion and a link can be simultaneously applied to the accused?"  In one structure, different interrogative words can be combined.  For example: "When and where was the act of surrender signed?". </p><p>  Separators are those structures in which two or more simple expressions of thoughts are used that are connected using the ‚Äúor‚Äù union.  For example: "Is it true that there was a suicide, or was it a murder?" </p><p>  In accordance with the attitude to the topic of discussion, there are types of questions on the merits and not merits. </p><p>  The first type includes the request for thought, connected indirectly or directly with the subject under discussion.  The answer involves clarifying or supplementing the initial (basic) knowledge. </p><p>  The request for thought is not essentially related directly to the subject under discussion. </p>
