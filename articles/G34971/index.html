This huge, one of the most saline reservoirs of the planet, is 400 m below the line of the World Ocean, which makes it the lowest coast and forms a special atmospheric environment.  Its waters contain a natural accumulation of mineral substances, the bottom is covered with a thick layer of life-giving silty sediments, and on the banks there are numerous thermal springs and natural pools of healing mud.  These natural factors, combined with special climatic conditions, are able to <span>restore strength</span> and heal many diseases, which created the shores of the Dead Sea world-wide fame of an unsurpassed resort. </p><h2>  Therapeutic effect </h2><p>  This giant salt lake is not visited for ordinary relaxation.

Saturated with salt and minerals, the lake water has a viscous, slightly oily, high-density consistency, and thanks to this property, a person can freely lie on the water surface, read a newspaper or play chess with a neighbor.  The solid precipitate obtained in the process of evaporation of the Dead Sea water is a pure composition of salt, minerals and trace elements. </p><p>  Doctors recommend limiting the time of each swimming in the lake to 20 minutes and repeating the procedure no more than three to four times during the day.  Acceptance of Dead Sea water procedures has its contraindications.  They should refrain from people with Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, prone to epileptic seizures, suffering from AIDS, pulmonary tuberculosis, cirrhosis of the liver, those who recently suffered a heart attack or stroke. </p><div class="photo" data-original="feel-planet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dead Sea Salt" class="if uuid-2372270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2372270.jpg"></div><h2>  Micro and macro elements </h2><p>  Lake water is rich in ions of substances, as well as simple and complex elements of almost the entire periodic table, which are indispensable for the work of the human body: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Sodium (sodium chloride) effectively normalizes blood pressure, has an antiseptic effect on the skin and anesthetize the joints. </li><li>  Magnesium is necessary for the full functioning of the heart, muscle contraction, regulates the transmission of nerve impulses, has an antispasmodic and antiallergic property, and acts as an antidepressant. </li><li>  Bromine has an antibacterial effect, is part of antidepressants.  The substance itself and its vapor cause a relaxing effect on the muscles and nervous system. </li><li>  Calcium is needed to strengthen soft, connective, bone tissues, accelerates the healing process of wounds, participates in the stabilization of metabolic processes, and has high antibacterial properties. </li><li>  Sodium chloride is necessary for cellular optimization of energy processes and the speed of passage of nerve impulses, in tandem with chlorine it controls the water-salt balance in the human body. </li><li>  Potassium contributes to the high diffusion of nutrients, providing cells of the body for its full work.  The Dead Sea contains about 20 times more potassium salt than ordinary sea water. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.lovethesepics.com" data-author=": Sahdi Samawi, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dead Sea Sunset" class="if uuid-2372346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2372346.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to salts, there is a huge amount of magnesium, lithium, iodine, sulfur, iron, copper, cobalt, manganese, selenium, fluorine, a large number of bromine, silicon, sulfuric and sulfuric acid ions, many other organic and inorganic substances in the waters.  Some elements and compounds are in sufficient quantities only here.  And the content of potassium and magnesium compounds is several tens of times higher than their amount in the Atlantic Ocean. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The ionic composition, amount and percentage of mineral elements of lake water are quite close to lymph and human blood plasma.  Even ordinary bathing in its waters can significantly improve overall health, and the temperature of water and air favors this all year round.  Therefore, for tours to the Dead Sea there is no seasonality, numerous establishments on the Israeli side of the reservoir are filled monthly with vacationers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ultthrillinglife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dead Sea Water" class="if uuid-2372323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2372323.jpg"></div><h2>  Mineral composition </h2><p>  To date, the presence of at least 21 minerals in the waters of the Dead Sea has been confirmed.  Most of them are of inorganic origin, do not contain oxygen, carbon and hydrogen in their structure.  Such substances are protected from oxidation, while maintaining beneficial properties for centuries.  Many of the minerals have lipophilic properties that allow you to detoxify the epidermis, removing toxins and other substances harmful to the human body through the pores of the skin.  This procedure makes the skin supple, supple and fresh.  Multiple studies conducted using state-of-the-art equipment and clinical trial monitoring have confirmed the beneficial properties of Dead Sea minerals. </p><h2>  Air environment </h2><p>  Dry (humidity 25%), calcined by the surrounding desert, the air around the lake is saturated with the healing components of the Dead Sea.  It is very clean, because, in the radius of many hundreds of kilometers, there is not a single large technical production.  It contains the minimum amount of pollen.  Filled with ions of salts and minerals, the air creates the effect of natural inhalation, having a healing effect on patients suffering from diseases of the upper respiratory tract. </p><p>  In summer, at elevated temperatures of water and air, under the influence of evaporation, a milky mist forms above the surface of the reservoir.  It is clearly distinguishable even in the Dead Sea photo.  This shroud is an excellent natural filter that significantly reduces hard ultraviolet radiation and makes tanning safe. </p><h2>  Unique mud pond </h2><p>  Sludge deposits obtained from the seabed have a powerful therapeutic effect.  They can be called a mineral-microelement bomb.  Such dirt is an excellent soothing and anti-inflammatory agent that acts on a hormonal level. </p><p>  Over the thousands of years of the existence of the reservoir, more than a hundred meters of alluvial sedimentary rocks have accumulated at its bottom.  Such a silt substance, as well as a simpler mud, has no less healing properties than water, since the mud is enriched with the same minerals and trace elements, biologically active substances, organic and inorganic compounds, micro and macro elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sugihara.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mud therapy" class="if uuid-2372319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2372319.jpg"></div><h2>  Mud therapy for the musculoskeletal system </h2><p>  In Israeli sanatoriums near the Dead Sea, mud baths and applications are successfully used for a very popular therapeutic area: traumatic and inflammatory pathologies of the musculoskeletal system, as well as any diseases of the joints.

The special structure of the finely divided fraction enhances the positive cosmetic and therapeutic effect of the mud. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bollychees.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dead Sea beaches" class="if uuid-2372331" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2372331.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels and motels </h2><p>  Hotels on the Dead Sea in Israel and Jordan are represented mainly by the class of three, four and five stars.
