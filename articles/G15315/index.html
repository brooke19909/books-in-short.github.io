  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Turkey. Hotel Adonis Hotel Kemer</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The resorts of the Mediterranean are numerous and diverse.  Each in its own way is unique and attractive to tourists.  This article is devoted to <span>relaxation in Kemer</span> and a description of one of the hotels in this resort - Adonis Hotel Kemer 3 *.  The first feature that I want to say about is the length of the resort.  Its territory stretched seventy kilometers between the sea coast and the Taurus Mountains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="adonis hotel kemer" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12445/160230.jpg" width="500"></div>  The second - a wide price range and a huge number of hotels (including Adonis Hotel Kemer).  The development of infrastructure, excellent natural conditions, as well as a large number of attractions cannot be ignored.  All this makes vacation in Kemer especially attractive for travelers from all over the world.  The hottest summer months are an ideal time to relax, since the hills located near the resort protect against intense heat.  It is fair to say that each resort center of Kemer has its own beach, which can be both sandy and pebble.  The <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãbottom is also different.</span>  The attractiveness of this resort is that everyone can find the most suitable option for themselves.  A few words should be said about the sights.  Firstly, it is ‚ÄúMoonlight‚Äù - a large park complex, a feature of which is the presence of one of the best water parks in the country. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="adonis hotel kemer 3 reviews" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12445/160232.jpg" width="456"></div>  Here you can also visit the dolphinarium and a huge number of shops, cafes and beaches.  Secondly, I want to note the ruins of the ancient cities of Olympos and Phaselis.  No less interesting is <span>Mount Takhtaly,</span> in which, according to the Homeric "Illiad", Chimera lived.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Adonis hotel kemer </p><p>  You can talk about the sights and features of the resort for a very long time, but in the framework of this article it is also necessary to note a few words about one of its hotels.  Such is the Adonis Hotel Kemer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="adonis hotel kemer 3" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12445/160231.jpg" width="550"></div>  It is located 150 meters from the sea.  Near the hotel there is a picturesque harbor, forest, as well as mountains.  The hotel consists of two buildings in a classic style.  The hotel was built in 1985, and in 1996 was completely renovated.  On the territory of this hotel, tourists can visit the open-air restaurant.  There is also a bar.  It is important to have your own outdoor pool, in which there is a place specially reserved for children.  Near it there are changing cabins, comfortable sunbeds, as well as umbrellas.  All this is provided for free.  Now about nutrition.  Adonis Hotel Kemer offers buffet-style Italian and local cuisine.  The price of the permit, as a rule, includes only breakfast and dinner, but lunch is provided for a fee.  The hotel has a separate territory on the city beach, its length is about four hundred meters.  Here sun loungers, umbrellas and other attributes necessary for relaxation are provided for rent.  It should be noted that this beach is pebble.  In general, Adonis Hotel Kemer 3 (hotel reviews can be found in the global network) is more suitable for young people who prefer a vacation with city infrastructure.  The convenient location of the hotel allows you to fully enjoy the beauties of the eastern country.
