During these hundred years, several emperors were replaced in the state.  If at the beginning of the 19th century Paul I ruled, then at the end - already Nicholas II.  Serfdom was abolished during this period, and the monarchy weakened so much that Communist ideals became increasingly popular, which allowed the Bolsheviks to take power at the beginning of the next century.  In many ways, the 19th century wars in Russia also contributed to the decline in the authority of the ruling dynasty.  In some of them, the state managed to win, in others - had to be defeated.  However, in most of them it suffered significant human and material losses. </p>

    <h2>  19th Century Wars in Russia: Background </h2><p>  The century in question was characterized by many intrigues and conflicts on the world stage.  The relations of the Russian Empire with Turkey were the most tense during this period.  Each of the states strove to expand its land and sea borders.  Over this century, Russia has managed to become one of the leaders in the international arena.  European states have begun to more closely monitor its rise. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The reasons for the confrontation </h2><p>  Consideration of the wars of the 19th century in Russia allows you to understand the foreign policy of the country of that period.  During this time, the country managed to participate in many international conflicts.  We can distinguish 15 wars of the 19th century in Russia.  Of the three, she was defeated.  This is the war of the Third and Fourth Coalition.  The first occurred in 1805, the second - in 1806-1807.  The third defeat is the Crimean War.  It lasted from 1853 to 1856.  A draw happened in the Anglo-Russian war.  Thus, the 19th century was quite successful for Russia. </p>

The reason for it was the violation by the Ottoman Empire of agreements on movements in government in Wallachia and Moldova.  In addition, there was a threat of invasion by the Napoleonic army.  All this led to the fact that Russia needed to quickly resolve the issue with the southern lands.  In 1806, Russia occupied several Turkish fortresses without a fight and defeated the fleet.  In 1809, the first attempt was made to conclude peace.  However, the conditions did not please Alexander I. Therefore, the war continued.  Kutuzov managed to win her victory.  The Russo-Turkish war of 1806-1812 ended with the signing of the Bucharest Peace Treaty with the Ottoman Empire.  However, he was short-lived. </p><p>  Already in 1828, the Great Porta announced that it no longer depended on Russia.  Moreover, she emphasized that forbids the latter to enter the Bosphorus.  Since Russian troops at that time were in Bessarabia, the first hostilities began there.  And again the Russians won.  But this did not stop the Ottoman Empire from new conflicts with them. </p>
