Here, residents can not only get to know Alyosha Popovich himself and his girlfriend - the Russian beauty Lyubava, played by professional actors, but also learn how to create real amulets and try magic treats from the Russian hero.  Participation in a performance lasting about thirty minutes is free for hotel guests. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  On the territory of the Alesha Popovich Hotel there are many amenities for young guests: a children's playroom, a mini club, highchairs in restaurants.  Children under the age of five are allowed to stay at the hotel with their parents free of charge, subject to the use of beds in the room.  Children under the age of twelve are provided with an extra bed for 600 rubles per night.  Older children can get a berth in the form of a folding chair for 1000 rubles. </p><h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  Check-in time at the Alesha Popovich Dvor Hotel is 14:00, and the check-out time is set at noon.  If you leave the room beyond the checkout time, an additional fee will be charged from the client.  From twelve days to six in the evening - hourly, from eighteen hours to midnight - half the fee per day, and beyond this time - for the whole day.  For stays of no more than twenty-four hours, the full price of the room is taken from the client, regardless of the time of arrival. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Most of the Russians who happened to stay at the Alesha Popovich Hotel were pleased with their stay.  The hotel has one important advantage: it is located in the very center of Yaroslavl, so any local attraction is within walking distance from it.  It is very convenient for those who come here to combine work with visiting historical monuments. </p><p>  A single original style, beautiful design of a hotel room, regardless of category, quality services, helpful staff, satisfactory cleanliness, delicious breakfast - this is how most guests recall their stay in this hotel.  A lot of good words were said to the staff. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the wonderful work of the maids, the responsive receptionists who quickly solve all the problems that arise are another reason why I would like to return here more than once.  The rooms are all amazingly beautiful and original.  Plumbing works fine, the bed and towels are snow-white. </p><p>  Immediately from the threshold one feels the spirit of ancient Russian epics, and in expensive suites, a person feels like a representative of some princely family.  ‚ÄúThe Russian spirit is here ...‚Äù the poet wrote, and this, judging by the reviews, is felt by foreigners. </p><p>  The hotel complex "Alyosha Popovich" includes several restaurants at once.  As the guests say, everyone cooks very tasty. </p><p>  Those who came to the hotel for any official event separately noted its excellent location.  After the conference, you can safely walk around the historical center of Yaroslavl, since all the attractions are within walking distance. </p><p> As for the flaws that are repeated in the reviews.  Firstly, many note the lack of an elevator.  "Alyosha Popovich" is a three-story building, and it has only one staircase, so sometimes it causes some inconvenience.  The breakfasts are pretty decent, although there are virtually no dairy products in the buffet.  And another drawback that tourists mention quite often is the poor soundproofing of the rooms. </p><p>  In general, the hotel is fully consistent with the stated pricing policy.  The hotel is especially suitable for families with children, who will definitely like the museum-theater. </p>
