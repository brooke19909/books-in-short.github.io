Digital mobile devices ‚Äî Supra tablets ‚Äî are also manufactured.  Reviews of gadgets, decent features offered by developers, and affordable prices have made the company's products quite popular.  The range of tablets is not very large, but even so there are models that deserve the attention of buyers. </p><p>  By purchasing the device, users will not be able to enjoy the latest technologies, but all the basic options that are necessary for everyday work are available in full.  Low prices make the Supra tablets (reviews confirm this information) affordable even for people with incomes below the average.  However, this in no way indicates poor quality.  All models are characterized by a high level of reliability.  So, let's look at several representatives of the Supra tablet lineup. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Supra M722: Feature</span> Overview </h2><p>  If there is a need to choose an inexpensive, but high-quality gadget, it is recommended to pay attention to the Supra M722 tablet.  Reviews about the ergonomics of the device are laudatory.  Its dimensions are 184 √ó 110 √ó 10.7 mm, so that the device lies perfectly in the hand.  It operates on the processor RK3026.  The chipset is based on two computing modules.  With a heavy load, each of them accelerates to 1200 MHz. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The amount of RAM is somewhat small, but 512 MB is quite enough to perform simple tasks.  For downloading various applications, games, pictures and other things there is an integrated storage of 4 GB.  The developers took into account that the files of the operating system reduce this volume by about half, so a memory card slot was provided.  This tablet model works with external drives with a capacity of no more than 32 GB. </p><p>  Screen specifications are consistent with the cost, which varies within 3000 rubles.  The diagonal was 7 ∫.  It optimally corresponds to a resolution of 800 √ó 480 px.  The display is made using TFT technology, which cannot guarantee wide viewing angles and high quality image reproduction.  The tablet is equipped with a battery of 2100 milliamps per hour.  It works on the basis of Android version 4.4. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet supra 10 inch reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1765146.jpg" width="418"></div>

    <h2>  SUPRA M742: reviews </h2><p>  Both Supra tablets have advantages and disadvantages.  Customer reviews of the M742 are a prime example.

    <h2>  SUPRA M74AG: Key Features </h2><p>  In 2017, new Supra tablets appeared on sale.  Reviews about the characteristics of the M74AG model are quite different.  Why?  Because gadgets are practically no different from their predecessors.  The tablet runs on the same fourth version of Android.  Performance is provided by the processor SC7731G of the famous Spreadtrum brand.  It works on four cores, the clock frequency of which is 1200 MHz.  The 7-inch screen is capable of reproducing graphics thanks to the Mali-400 MP2 graphics card.  Its characteristics are enough to display a picture whose resolution is 1024 √ó 600 pixels.  The amount of memory no longer meets modern requirements.  "RAM" has not increased at all, remaining at 512 MB.  Native memory is also very small - only 4 GB.  Expand storage with a 32 GB flash drive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet supra m722 reviews" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/1766937.jpg" width="600"></div>

This is a Supra tablet (10 inches).  Owner reviews about it will help to make a real assessment.  Unfortunately for users, the gadget does not support working with mobile operators.  There were a lot of complaints about this, because for 6,500 rubles the buyer wants to have a universal device.  But the tablet‚Äôs performance level is much higher than previous models.  One gigabyte of RAM provides decent functionality.  The device is based on the MediaTek processor on four cores.  The MT8127 chip is capable of operating at a frequency of 1300 MHz.  Counting on a large amount of native memory is not necessary.  8-gigabyte storage can be expanded up to 32 GB with a microSDHC card. </p><p>  The screen diagonal is large - 10.1 ∫.  But the developers did not increase the resolution, leaving it the same as with 7-inch tablets (1024 √ó 600).  Most users have noticed battery capacity.  It is 5500 mAh.  The term of autonomy under heavy load will be no more than 5 hours. </p>
