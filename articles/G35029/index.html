So, a sintepon blanket is lighter in weight, it is much more convenient to wash than, for example, a downy one, and besides, it dries quickly enough.  It is also important that the synthetic winterizer is hypoallergenic, it does not take up much space, because you can even take it with you on a hike.  Today we offer to talk about how to sew a blanket on a synthetic winterizer with your own hands, how to choose high-quality material, how to care for the finished product, so that it lasts as long as possible without losing its positive properties.  But first things first! </p><h2>  What is a synthetic winterizer? </h2><p>  For many years, synthetic fillers have been amazingly popular.  Perhaps the leader among artificial materials can be called sintepon.  Its popularity is easily explained by cheapness, ease of care.  It is indispensable for the production of upholstered furniture and warm clothes, mattresses and pillows, blankets and many other products that accompany a person in everyday life.  In general, the concept of ‚Äúsynthetic winterizer‚Äù is collective, it combines three types of material that differ in components, purpose and properties.  By the way, sometimes a synthetic winterizer is called a synthetic version of batting.  A synthetic winterizer is produced in the form of a non-woven fabric, it contains synthetic fibers that were obtained from either primary or secondary raw materials.  Let us consider what properties are characteristic for a given material, what it looks like, what disadvantages and advantages it has. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="prom.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to sew a do-it-yourself blanket on a synthetic winterizer" class="if uuid-2640653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2640653.jpg"></div><h2>  Varieties of syntepon </h2><p>  To date, there are three varieties.  This is <span>hollofiber,</span> sherstepon, sintepuh.  All these types can be called improved versions of the most common synthetic winterizer, they have a number of advantages, because the technologies for their production have been improved, and additional materials have appeared in the composition.  So, sherstepon is made from sheep's wool and synthetic fibers.  Thanks to this, the material turns out to be unusually strong, it is protected from knocking down, which allows it to be used as a filler for a superbly light and warm blanket.  Suitable for blankets and syntepuh.  This material is characterized by lightness, softness, moreover, such a filler is incredibly warm.  That is why, if you are thinking about what and how to sew a blanket from sintepon, pay attention to such a variety as sintepuh.  The finished product will delight you with the fact that it will not go astray and will last for more than one year. </p><h2>  Production technology </h2><p>  In order to sew a blanket from synthetic winterizer yourself, you need to choose a quality material.  To do this, you need to familiarize yourself with the methods of its manufacture.  We say right away that this filler can be made from both primary and secondary raw materials.  Of course, good quality material can only be obtained in the first case.  The fact is that when using primary raw materials, pure polyester fibers are used, in which sometimes natural ones, for example wool or cotton, are added.  It is important to note that a quality synthetic winterizer consists of several layers that have a different direction.  This provides high strength and durability of the material.  Fillers made from recycled materials, of course, are of low price and not particularly high quality.  Often, plastic bottles and even disposable tableware are used for its manufacture!  Experts note that such material deteriorates very quickly, after a couple of washings it rolls up or gets off. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="master.pro.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sewing blanket from padding polyester" class="if uuid-2640659" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2640659.jpg"></div><p>  Experts identify three methods for the production of such a filler as sintepon.  The best material is obtained in a needle-punched way, if you are thinking about sewing a children's blanket from synthetic winterizer, pay attention to the filler obtained using this technique.  Wear-resistant filler is also obtained by applying the so-called thermal method.  In this case, the material is made under the influence of high temperatures.  The cheapest emulsion method: synthetic fibers are bonded together using <span>latex glue.</span>  The finished canvas turns out airy and stunningly soft, but can not boast of special strength. </p><h2>  Positive sides </h2><p>  If you are seriously interested in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsewing blankets from synthetic winterizer, you need to pay attention to the positive and negative qualities of the material.  Among the advantages are its softness and airiness, heat-saving properties.  In reviews of this filler, it is often said that it is strong enough and elastic, able to restore its original shape.  Of course, this is only possible if you have chosen quality material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="all.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sewing a children's blanket from synthetic winterizer" class="if uuid-2640661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2640661.jpg"></div><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Of course, even such a wonderful filler as a synthetic winterizer has a number of shortcomings and weaknesses, which are extremely important to know.  So, if the glue method was used in the production, allergic reactions can occur.  In addition, such a material quickly weakens the bond between the fibers, they disintegrate, which means that the product is deformed and becomes unusable.  It is also important that repeated washing can lead to the fact that the thickness of the material (even of sufficient quality) is reduced by two to three times.  Among the shortcomings and the low level of hygroscopicity, such a blanket will not absorb moisture well.  In addition, sintepon is characterized by low air permeability.  In order to make the sleep under a synthetic blanket comfortable, only natural fabrics should be used for coating, while choosing a small filler thickness, 10 by 20 millimeters is enough. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  We sew a blanket from a synthetic winterizer! </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to determine the size and shape of the future product.  Today, the light industry offers customers more than a hundred different sizes of blankets.  If you are thinking about how to sew a blanket from sintepon, pay attention to the fact that the following sizes are most common: </p><ul><li>  120 x 120 cm - for newborns; </li><li>  140 x 110 cm - baby blankets; </li><li>  200 x 150 cm - single blankets. </li></ul><p>  One and a half- and double-sized blankets, Euro sizes, deserve special attention.  So, one and a half can be 205 x 150 and 215 x 155 centimeters.  If you are thinking about how to sew a blanket on a synthetic winterizer with your own hands for a double bed, choose from sizes 215 x 175, 210 x 180, 200 x 200 centimeters.  The Euro size is characterized by parameters such as 200 x 220 and 210 x 220 centimeters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="halat.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sewing blankets from synthetic winterizer" class="if uuid-2640662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2640662.jpg"></div><p>  How to sew a synthetic winter blanket?  Be sure to consider the height of the person for whom it is intended, the size of the bed.  As for the form, it is possible to make a round, rectangular, square product or even a heart-shaped blanket from a synthetic winterizer! </p><h2>  Fabric size </h2><p>  Specialists pay attention to the fact that during washing almost all cotton fabrics sit down.  In length it is about 3-7 cm per meter, and in width about 1-4 cm. That is why it is extremely important to wet a new fabric before you start sewing blankets with a synthetic winterizer, and even better to wash it.  After that, you will need to thoroughly dry the material and iron it with an iron.  Another option is to add a shrink allowance. </p><h2>  Cutting </h2><p>  You think about how to sew a blanket from a synthetic winterizer with your own hands?  It is necessary to carve it out correctly.  Experts advise taking a wide fabric.  The fact is that in this case no seams will appear in the middle of the product.  It is necessary to adjust and cut the surface material both in length and in width, usually it depends on the width and pattern applied to the fabric.  It is imperative to add allowances when cutting.  One centimeter will be needed on each side for the seam, from 2 to 15 cm will be needed for shrinkage of the fabric.  This size depends on the quality and size of the blanket.  It is important to leave a quilting allowance.  Its value depends on what thickness of the synthetic winterizer you will use, how often you will arrange the lines, of course, the more these indicators are, the more there should be an allowance.  For example, if you decide to sew a blanket on a synthetic winterizer for an extract, you just need to add about 3 cm of allowance, but if you plan to make a Euro-sized blanket, voluminous and lush, with a large number of lines, the allowance should will be at least 10 centimeters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cuttnsew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to sew a do-it-yourself blanket from a synthetic winterizer" class="if uuid-2640669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2640669.jpg"></div><h2>  Necessary tools </h2><p>  Of course, to make a blanket, you will need a synthetic winterizer suitable for you in length and width, a fabric the size of which should be two squares of the blanket plus allowances.  When sewing blankets can not do without a tailor's ruler and square.  Of course, you will need good sharp scissors, needles, threads and a sewing machine. </p><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><ol><li>  After you have determined the length and width of the blanket, cut out a rectangle, square or oval (you can choose the shape yourself) from the piece of padding polyester of your desired size.  In the event that you want to sew a multilayer blanket, you will need two or three layers of filler.  How to sew a blanket from synthetic winterizer, if its width is less than the width of the future product?  Just cut a strip of the required size and sew it to the main piece.  For this, a simple frequent seam is suitable, which the seamstresses call the ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù.  Of course, an additional piece can be stitched, but this is not necessary. </li><li>  After this, it is necessary to stack on top of each other all layers of synthetic winterizer, and then combine their edges.  In the event that any of the edges protrudes, it should be carefully trimmed.  Using the seam ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù, connect all the layers of filler in the center, laying the blankets along the edge.  Please note: stitches can be large enough, this will not affect the quality of the future product. </li><li>  The next step is preparing the coating for the future product.  Suppose you decide to make a rectangular blanket.  Prepare the fabric - two canvases, leave a few centimeters for allowances, sew the three sides of the rectangle and turn it on the right side. </li><li>  The resulting cover must be ironed carefully, only then can the filler be inserted into it.  Carefully put the synthetic winterizer inside, straighten it and fasten it.  For this purpose, large stitches or pins are suitable.  Please note: in no case can you lose a single pin, otherwise you are unlikely to be able to sleep peacefully under this blanket.  Therefore, if you took, for example, 15 pins, at the end of the work there should be exactly 15 pins!  Another condition: the sides of the gasket should ideally coincide with the side seams of the cover. </li><li>  Speaking about how to sew a blanket from sintepon, it should be noted that it needs to be sewn along all side seams, while capturing the gasket. </li><li>  After that, bend the inside of the slice on the fourth side, also capturing the filler.  Then you need to outline a line at a distance of 10-12 centimeters from all the edges and carefully sew the blanket again. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="mybigfatdiscounts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to sew a synthetic winter blanket" class="if uuid-2640705" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2640705.jpg"></div><p>  If you are thinking about how to sew a <span>quilt</span> on a <span>padding</span> polyester, you only need to carefully stitch it in the middle.  You can do this with straight lines or squares, rhombuses, having drawn any pattern, having beaten that pattern that is applied to the fabric.  The distance between the stitches should be between 20 and 40 centimeters, while the stitches should be neat on both sides of the product.  The blanket is ready! </p><p>  By the way, using the same technology, you can make a simple sleeping bag that you can take with you on a long trip.  You just need a padding from synthetic winterizer and two panels.  On one of the short sides it will be necessary to make a drawstring, bending 2-3 centimeters.  When sewing the second short and lateral sides, you will need to sew a long zipper so that the unclosed end is at the fold.  After that, you will need to quilt the blanket, carefully stitch it around the edges, and insert the cord into the drawstring! </p><h2>  Care for the synthetic winterizer product </h2><p>  How to sew a blanket from synthetic winterizer, you now know.  But how to care for this product?  The fact is that a blanket with such a filler requires careful care.  Only in this case will it last much longer without losing its positive qualities and properties.  First of all, we offer to talk about how to <span>wash a blanket</span> with filler from synthetic winterizer.  The water temperature in the washing machine should not exceed 40 degrees, the optimal mode for the product is a delicate or hand wash.  By the way, pay attention to the fact that ordinary detergent for sintepon-based blankets is not suitable.  Instead, you should use a liquid product that contains a minimal amount of various chemical components.  Do not forget to put tennis balls in the drum of the washing machine, which will not allow the product filler to stray. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.harikahaliyikama.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Care for a padding pad from a padding polyester" class="if uuid-2640709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2640709.jpg"></div><p>  It will be useful to use a special cover, so you can prevent any damage to the fabric that you used for the surface of the blanket.  Dry products with sintepon filler should be on a clothesline in the fresh air.  Proper care of the blanket is a guarantee that it will serve you as long as possible without losing its original qualities! </p>
