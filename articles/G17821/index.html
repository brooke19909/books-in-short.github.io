And always, for a more successful army operation, an experienced person was required to lead the soldiers.  Otherwise, everyone will act as he wants, which will lead to inevitable defeat.  It was the generals who acted as those who took charge of the troops.  Someone controlled the army well, someone - badly.  However, this did not affect the fact that the names of the commanders-in-chief entered history. </p><h2>  The names of the great commanders need to know </h2><p>  Many remember the First World War.  The generals in the history of this period played one of the most significant roles.  It was they who more than once decided the fate of thousands of soldiers in numerous battles.  And it was they who, leading the army, contributed to the fact that military battles ended in an unconditional victory.  However, few people know their names.  And even the most beautiful commanders at the present stage are gradually forgotten. </p><p>  Heroes-commanders of the First World War accomplished many deeds.  They must be remembered and honored.  Therefore, in this review, it was decided to consider the most famous commanders who took part in a huge number of battles. </p><h2>  Military Advisor Alekseev </h2>

    <p>  What commanders of the First World War were remembered for their heroic breakthroughs?  It should be noted Brusilov Alexei Alekseevich.  He was born in the family of a lieutenant general.  The future commander lost his parents at an early age, so he was brought up with his relatives.  Alexei received a fairly good education.  He came to Petersburg in 1867.  In 1872 he was recruited as a warrant officer.  For participation in the Russian-Turkish war received three military orders.  During the fighting, he distinguished himself in the assault on the Ardagan fortress.  Brusilov also played an important role in the capture of Kars. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Why exactly <span>Aleksei Alekseevich</span> should be highlighted, speaking about which commanders and military leaders of the First World War showed themselves on the heroic side?  In 1916, he was appointed commander of one of the fronts, which gave him the opportunity to act independently.  And already after a short period of time in the same year, leading a relatively small force, he made a breakthrough in the enemy‚Äôs defense (Austro-German forces).  This combat action went down in history under the name Brusilovsky breakthrough.  This operation was among the largest.  Its result was a huge loss from the enemy.  After the breakthrough, the Germans had to transfer 17 divisions east from the Western Front. </p><h2>  Iron Brigade </h2>

    <p>  What kind of people still glorified the First World War?  Generals, Russian soldiers and ordinary people have committed many heroic deeds.  And Denikin Anton Ivanovich played a significant role in numerous victories.  He was born in the Warsaw province in the family of a retired major.  In the first battle, he participated in the 4th ‚Äúiron‚Äù brigade of the 12th army corps.  Under the leadership of General Kaledin, soldiers, among whom was Anton Ivanovich, defended the passes in the Carpathians.  For these battles, Denikin received the Order of St. George 3rd degree.  In 1915, the brigade was reorganized into a division.  Soldiers constantly went to where breakouts and threats of the environment could occur. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In September 1915, Denikin in the "iron division" fought for the city of Lutsk.  The fighting ended successfully, about 20 thousand enemy soldiers were captured.  After this heroic battle, Denikin received the rank of lieutenant general.  Speaking about which <span>great commanders of the</span> First World War distinguished themselves, it should be noted that Denikin took part in the battle for Chartoryysk.  It is impossible not to say that he became the hero of the Lutsk breakthrough, having valiantly completed his task.  For military art and courage, he received a rare award - the St. George's weapon, which was decorated with diamonds. </p><h2>  Not only victories accompany commanders </h2>

    <p>  Not only Russian military leaders remembered the First World War.  Hero commanders also met in the troops of other countries.  One of them was <span>Foch Ferdinand.</span>  In 1911 he received the next general rank, after which he was appointed commander of the division.  In 1912, he began to command the 8th Corps in Bourges.  A year later, the 20th Corps in Nancy came under his command.  After some time, it was decided to reorganize the army group into the 9th French army, commanded by General Foch.  This is what the army became heroic in the battles on the Marne River that took place in 1914.  Under the leadership of Foch, the soldiers resisted the onslaught of the enemy.  After suffering heavy losses, the general was still able to keep the city of Nancy.  However, some time after the battle on the Somme was lost, General Ferdinand Foch was removed from his post. </p><h2>  Not a single battle was complete without bloody battles </h2>

    <p>  Great damage to France caused the First World War.  The generals tried to defend their positions, but they did not always succeed.  July 21, Germany declared war with France.  The commander in chief of the French army was Joseph Jacques Joffre.  From the very beginning of wartime, he had to establish relations with the union country of England.  Due to the fact that all military operations took place on the territory of France and Northern Belgium, Joseph began to urgently prepare for a positional struggle.  German forces had a hard time on all fronts, as General Joffre did not give up without bloody battles. </p><h2>  A commander who was distinguished by barbaric methods of warfare </h2>

    <p>  Which World War I commanders distinguished themselves in battle?  It is necessary to mention Ludendorff Eric, who, although he was an assistant to General Hindenborg, independently led the army on the Eastern Front.  And in 1916 he began to control all the armed forces of Germany.  Ludendorff was a supporter of ruthless methods of suppressing unrest from the people.  He considered the most barbaric methods of warfare.  It was at his insistence that Germany launched an unlimited submarine war.  However, it should be mentioned that it was his adventurous strategy, which was designed to defeat not only the Soviet troops, but also the Entente countries, that failed completely.  And this is precisely what led to the defeat of the German troops. </p><h2>  Personalities of the First World War </h2>

    <p>  The generals decided the fate of millions of people.  And this fully applies to the commander in chief of the Eastern Front of the Hindenburg.  He was distinguished by the fact that at the very beginning of 1916 he managed to disrupt the advance of the Soviet troops near Lake Naroch.  Commanding large forces, he launched a counterattack to the advancing troops, who managed to break through the German defenses.  At the end of 1916, he was appointed commander of the Field General Staff.  After the defeat of Germany in the war, Hindenburg became the head of the forces, which were supposed to suppress revolutionary actions.  And it was thanks to him that he managed to maintain the military power necessary for the revival of the state. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The First World War brought a lot of losses and troubles.  The generals, like ordinary soldiers, tried to lead their troops to victory.  However, this was not always possible.  And even the most successful at first glance military operations eventually turned into defeats.  But the heroism of the commanders, their skillful actions in military battles are not subject to any doubt.  Making sometimes unconventional decisions, they reversed the enemy‚Äôs troops, forcing them to flee the battlefield.  And even if there were not so many high-profile victories during the First World War as during the Great Patriotic War, it is simply necessary to remember the names of commanders.  They made the history of states in the most difficult times for people. </p>
