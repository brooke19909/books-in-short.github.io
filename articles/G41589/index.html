How not to get caught by scammers?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Everyone knows that sports forecasts, bets and sweepstakes are a separate business area with a huge turnover of funds that has been flourishing for many years.  The only thing that has changed in this segment is the approach.  In recent years, such a business has either been legalized or forced to go ‚Äúinto the shadows,‚Äù or rather, the Internet.  As a result, today most of the most popular bookmakers are sites that everyone can bet on from anywhere in the <span>world.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Betting popularity </h2><p>  In general, why sports betting is so popular is no secret.  Yes, people really like to watch sports and cheer for their favorite teams or players.  And yes, each of us does not mind getting some kind of ‚Äúfreebie‚Äù - excitement and the desire to win in everyone‚Äôs blood.  That is why many fans tried their hand at paid rates. </p><p>  Someone is able to really increase the funds invested in the office, and ultimately get a nice bonus.  And someone, on the contrary, loses the money that was originally set, and understands that sport is not so predictable. </p><h2>  Purchased Predictions </h2><p>  But, of course, in addition to the bookmakers, there is another direction - paid forecasts.  This is a business that operates within the world of betting.  And its bright representative can be called the Fuckbet website.  The reviews of its visitors indicate that the resource administrators are selling sports forecasts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The essence of the business is simple: sellers say they can predict the outcome of sporting events;  players pay them for access to such knowledge and make their own bets in accordance with the forecast made.  The task of such sellers is to convince sports fans that they really understand their business and can predict the outcome of games for sure. </p><p>  To understand how this works, look at the reviews from http://fuckbet.ru.  Most of them praise the organizers of the project in every possible way, claiming that their forecasts really worked, and the author of this characteristic allegedly hit the jackpot.  This is normal practice: those who doubt whether it is worth buying forecasts or not, just read such recommendations and place an order.  And the administration receives its dividends. </p><h2>  Fuckbet.ru: reviews </h2><p>  Of course, if the recommendations from buyers are posted on the website of the company that sells forecasts, then we can say with a high degree of probability that such reviews are fake.  Even if no forecast came true, the owners of the site that sells them would not have allowed customers to post comments on the resource.  The conclusion is that trusting such information is not worth it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Therefore, it is worth about the company "Fakbet" reviews to look for those that are located on other people's sites.  So at least the chances that they are untruthful or ordered are much less.  Actually, a search in this form brings certain results - on several different sites people claim that buying forecasts is not worth it.  On other resources, they even call outright scammers those who launched Fuckbet.  Reviews about the site, as we see, are not the most flattering. </p>

    <h2>  Exposure </h2><p>  There are materials that truly compromise the owners of the resource.  We are talking about the fact that on the Internet they found a real informational stuffing.  Its essence was as follows.  The social network published reviews of Fuckbet people who allegedly won huge sums of money.  If we compare these comments, it became clear that they are fake and differ from each other only by the names of the authors.  So the dirty advertising campaign of the owners of the resource, built on the false testimonies of supposedly "buyers", was uncovered. </p><p>  It is logical that immediately the question arises of why, if the site already offers true forecasts, its owners needed to fake and write something on behalf of non-existent people.  Why couldn't you just ask your clients to leave recommendations on their own behalf?  Apparently, for Fakbet, reviews of this nature were much more difficult to find and present.  Then all this calls into question the honesty of the resource administrators and the advisability of buying forecasts on this site in general. </p><h2>  Tips for the future </h2>

    <p>  Actually, the same fears and conjectures were published by other users who worked with Fuckbet.  Thus, reviews about the office with forecasts cannot be called positive, just as the seller itself cannot be called a bona fide and honest person. </p><p>  In general, when trying to find analyst predictions about the outcome of future games, always remember one golden rule about where there is free cheese.  The fact is that truly reputable players can post their prediction before the match for free, if they are really sure that it will work.  If people trust him, then he knows what he is doing, and simply shares his thoughts with his followers.  Otherwise, if a person is not trusted, there is little sense in his predictions. </p><p>  Therefore, remember the tip: do not spend money on paid forecasts.  Everything you need for a successful betting, you already have. </p>
