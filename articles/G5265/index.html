A variety of machines, appliances and other electrical devices spoiled humanity.  So, with the advent of Apple, the world of millions of people has changed dramatically.  Since 1970, the company began producing fashionable and highest quality products.  The creator of Apple - Steve Jobs - with his best friend <span>Steve Wozniak</span> formed a new company and assembled the first personal computer based on the processor MOS Technology 6502. After some time, having received money from the sale of equipment, the founders officially registered their company.  Today, manufactured products are considered one of the most sought after, stylish and expensive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apple creator" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/248456.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The creator of Apple is considered the person who opened the mass production of personal computers.  After some time, the company began to produce tablets, audio players, telephones and software.  The American corporation is famous for its unique design, stylish models and product quality.  In 2011, the company's products were recognized as one of the most expensive, and the brand - the best in the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apple creator" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/248460.jpg" width="225"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Already in the eighties, the company created the first 32-bit computer.  It was equipped with its own operating system.  Surprisingly, the number of sales decreased significantly by 1990.  Then the creator of Apple was already thinking about closing the corporation and its future bankruptcy.  But after a while everything changed for the better, and the number of sales increased several times, exceeding the wildest expectations.  Over the years of its existence, the company has more than once been absorbed by powerful corporations.  There was also a merger of several firms into a single whole.  The value of shares was constantly changing, and by 2011 their number amounted to 921.28 million units.  When the creator of Apple thought about liquidating the company, it cost almost nothing.  By 2012, the corporation was valued at $ 500 billion. </p>

The most popular are mobile phones iPhone.  The creator of Apple could never even dream of such a success.  Nowadays, in branded stores you can buy iPad, MacBook Pro, Mac mini (PC system units), iMac (all-in-one computers), Apple TV players, MacBook Air - an ultra-thin laptop - and much more.  The points of sale of branded products are located all over the world, so anyone can easily purchase the cherished equipment with a logo in the form of a <span>bitten apple.</span>

Every day, staff in the person of 46.6 thousand people works on the design of technology, the invention of new functions and improving quality.  It is worth noting that in just a year, the manufacturer of branded products earns fourteen billion dollars in net profit.  And yet, everyone should know the name of the creator of Apple, because it was this person who gave people joy, comfort and the ability to constantly be in touch.  And this is the most important thing in our time.  After all, the pace of modern life is simply frantic, and we need to be in several places at the same time.  Apple products give you the <span>effect of presence</span> even hundreds of kilometers away. </p>
