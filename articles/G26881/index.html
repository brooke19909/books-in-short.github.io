    <h2>  Golden Gate (Elista): address, how to get </h2><p>  Altn Bosch is located very close to <span>Lenin Square.</span>  The sacred structure is installed on the <span>Heroes Alley</span> in <span>the Friendship Park.</span>  It is almost the very center of the city.  Nearby is the government building of the Republic of Kalmykia.  In the same park is a one and a half meter Buddha statue and an original fountain called "Boy and Dragon."  The gate can be reached by shuttle bus at number seven.  Locals claim that any bus that goes to the new sleeping neighborhoods of the city passes by, and you can ask the driver to stop.  Nobody will refuse you.  By the way, in Elista there are quite a lot of similar gates, especially those built in recent years.  But these are the main and most important.  Heroes Avenue is a park area where adults and children walk on weekends.  Therefore, there are always people here who will show you the path to the arch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Gate Elista Address" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1694677.jpg" width="600"></div>

They are stylized as a traditional Kalmyk Buddhist temple.  It is an oriental type building with golden-colored roofs.  Their corners bent upward resemble wings, which makes the gate seem to hover in the air.  Their height is about fifteen meters.  The gate is an openwork arch.  Inside they are painted. </p><p>  In the ensemble "Golden Gate" (Elista) the history of the Kalmyk people is reflected from time immemorial to the present day.  These are twenty-eight paintings that reflect the most important milestones in the development of Kalmyk culture and the formation of their state.  Behind the gate begins a path lined with white stone.  The whole arch is hung with sacred bells that ring in the wind.  In the evening, around Altn Bosch, spectacular lighting is installed, so those who wish can enjoy this attraction at night. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Gate Elista Description" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1694686.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Golden Gate (Elista) was installed in the late nineties of the last century.  Their architect was V. Shanghai, by profession - a civil engineer.  During the construction of Altn Bosch, he did not depart one iota from the canons and traditions of Buddhist architecture.  Maybe that's why the gates have become a modern architectural masterpiece.  The arch in white, pink and golden colors seems to soar in the air.  And her interior is the work of the artist Nikolai Borisov from the city of Lagani.  He wanted to reflect the history of the Kalmyks - from their legendary ancestors, the Oirat tribe from Dzungaria (Western Mongolia), to our time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Golden Gate (Elista) is also decorated with illustrations for the famous epic "Dzhangar".  It recalls the stories about the knights of the Round Table, telling not only and not so much about the militancy of the ancient Kalmyks, but about real male friendship.  Reflected here and the era of the Golden Horde, and the capture of the emperor of the Celestial Empire, and the formation of the Great Silk Road. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Gate Elista photo" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1694689.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Value in culture </h2><p>  In Buddhism, such arches symbolize the threshold beyond which spiritual purification begins, as well as good and prosperity.  The Golden Gate (Elista) is no exception.  Such a threshold means the end of the old life and the onset of a new one.  The path that follows the arch symbolizes the entry on the path of virtue leading to paradise and enlightenment.  When believers pass under these gates, they feel that they have an inner power that gives them the opportunity to confront all the problems of today.  If at that moment when you are under the arch, the bells will ring, then you need to make a wish.  The belief says that if you are pure in heart and intend to live according to conscience, then it will certainly come true.  If you have a streak of misfortunes or have overcome problems, old-timers advise you to drop everything and go under Altn Bosch.  Perhaps you will not only feel better, but an idea will come to your mind on how to fix this situation. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who visited the <span>capital of Kalmykia</span> write that the Golden Gate (Elista), the photos of which they place as an illustration to their feedback, captivate and captivate them with bright colors and originality.  Many write that after they passed under the arch, their mood rose.  Some even decided to explore other Buddhist monuments of Elista - the temple, the Stupa of Enlightenment.  After all, if you have found true peace of mind and psychological balance, then you do not want to lose it.  And here the newlyweds who come here to take a walk together under the arch are photographed here.  This tradition has also developed recently.  They say that if one asks for happiness and prosperity, the couple will be strong and friendly. </p>
