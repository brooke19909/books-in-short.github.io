For a long time, it served as a social and cultural center for the inhabitants of Athens. </p><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  As a refuge from enemies, the Acropolis - as the ancient part of Athens was called - began to be used by the local population at the end of the third millennium BC.  e.  The walls of the fortification reached ten meters in height and six in width.  To penetrate the hill, either the western or northern side could be used.  At the same time, the first was less reliable, so the entrance there was strengthened by the locals more carefully. </p><p>  On the north side, the oldest part of Athens, apparently, was well hidden by bushes.  Narrow staircases were cut to it in the rock.  Over time, the northern entrance to the fortification was stoned, only the western one was preserved. </p>

    <h2>  Acropolis as a social and cultural center </h2><p>  Thus, the Acropolis is the name of the oldest part of Athens.  Initially, it was a rocky hill on which the fortifications of the city were located.  However, in the second millennium <span>BC,</span> as shown by the results of archaeological excavations, litigation, meetings of rulers, and also festive religious events were actively held here.  So, for example, the researchers discovered a site that apparently served as an arena for the ancient Greek mysteries.  A well was located at the northern gates of the Acropolis, which made it possible to provide residents outside the fortification walls with high-quality drinking water. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what was called the oldest part of Athens" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31720/724566.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is known that the percentage of the urban population at that time was much higher than the rural one.  Cities were of paramount importance in the life of the polis.  Athens, in turn, gradually became the main trading and administrative distribution center throughout the Mediterranean.  This state of affairs played a positive role in the cultural development of the city.  The Acropolis, as the oldest part of Athens, was famous for its temples. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the name of the oldest part of Athens" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31720/724564.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  So, in the VI century BC.  e.  here was the temple of Hekatompedon ("one hundred feet"), built in honor of the goddess Athena and characterized by extreme beauty.  Its main attraction was the gate of the Propylaea, decorated with columns.  It was necessary to rise to the temple gradually along the hillside, which also reinforced the stunning external effect.  Also, the architecture of the temple and its gates was distinguished by a special symmetry, which later Greek sculptors used to create statues that adorn the pediments of the temples. </p><h2>  Parthenon </h2><p>  Subsequently, an even more magnificent temple was built on the site of Hekatompedon - the Parthenon (447-437 BC, sculptor - Phidias).  In order to get to the temple, visitors had to first go around it, since the entrance was located on the opposite side of the front gate.  This was done for the purpose so that guests could feel the solemn spirit of the temple and tune in the appropriate manner.  So, on the Parthenon wall, a bas-relief ribbon was constructed depicting a large-scale procession in honor of the goddess Athena: horsemen, girls with palm branches in their hands (a symbol of peace), noble elders. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Currently, the temple is in dilapidated condition. </p><h2>  Erechtheion </h2><p>  The work to create this temple (421-405 BC) was long and painstaking, as other sights of the city that suffered from the Greco-Persian wars were being restored in parallel.  Accordingly, funds for construction were very limited. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient city of athens and its monuments" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31720/724565.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Initially, the Athenian ruler Pericles was the initiator of the construction of the temple, and Phidius also became an architect.  However, the magnificent building was built after the death of Pericles, under the guidance of the architect Mnesicle. </p><p>  The temple received its name in honor of the Athenian king Erechtheus.  The Acropolis, as the oldest part of Athens, captured many plots of <span>Greek mythology</span> in its architecture <span>.</span>  So, according to legend, Erechtheus was the son of <span>Hephaestus (the god of</span> fire, as well as the heavenly patron of the blacksmith's craft) and Gaia (goddess of the earth).  During the war with the city of Eleusis, unleashed on religious grounds, Erechtheus killed the <span>son of Poseidon</span> (Eumolpus), who was the leader of a hostile clan.  In response to this, the angry <span>god of water,</span> with the help of his brother Zeus, brought lightning to the Athenian ruler.  So Erechtey died.  At the same time, a trace from the legendary lightning, which destroyed several marble slabs, was allegedly preserved on the Acropolis.  Here is the grave of Erechtheus, in the place of which the eponymous temple was erected. </p><p>  Erechtheion architecture is non-standard.  The temple building consists of two buildings of unequal size, which are also located at different levels.  The eastern part of the temple is dedicated to Athena, the western - to Hephaestus, Poseidon, as well as Booth, the first priest of the goddess Athena and the brother of Erechtheus. </p>
