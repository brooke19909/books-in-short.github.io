It has good technical specifications and affordable price.  It is precisely his capabilities that this article will be devoted to. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.xtremetecpc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tp link tl wn7200" class="if uuid-2282843" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2282843.jpg"></div><h2>  Appointment </h2><p>  Theoretical TL-WN7200ND can be connected to a TV or satellite receiver.  But he will not work in conjunction with such devices.  The necessary software for its functioning in these two cases is missing. </p><p>  Therefore, the only possible application for such a network card is to connect it to a personal computer.  The latter can be either a stationary system unit or a laptop or netbook.  Also, such an adapter can be connected to a tablet running the Windows operating system.  But to use such a solution in combination with any other system software does not work for the reason that there are no drivers for such use. </p><p>  In the simplest application, such an adapter, connected to a PC port, is designed to connect to a wireless Wi-Fi network and exchange information with it.  But if the computer is properly configured using special software, then such a device can be turned into a router. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.talkofweb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tp link tl wn7200nd" class="if uuid-2282844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2282844.jpg"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The solution considered in this article has the following delivery option: </p><ul><li>  Network Card TL-WN7200ND. </li><li>  Instructions for assembly, connection and configuration. </li><li>  External antenna. </li><li>  Interface wire. </li><li>  Disk with diagnostic utilities, a collection of drivers and documentation. </li><li>  Warranty card with a validity period of 2 years from the date of purchase from the manufacturer. </li><li>  A set of advertising booklets in which the capabilities of this device are considered and possible options for its application are given. <div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tl wn7200nd instruction" class="if uuid-2282852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2282852.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Communication and Management </h2><p>  The TP-Link TL-WN7200 Communication List consists of two connectors.  One of them is microUSB in the performance of type A. A complete interface cord is connected to this port, using which a connection to a personal computer is implemented.  At the other end of this wire is a regular USB port. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second important connector of such an adapter is a socket for installing an external antenna.  It is displayed on the back of the wireless network card enclosure.  Additionally, it is necessary to note the possibility of adjusting the position of the antenna.  In some cases, this can significantly improve the quality of the received signal from the network node. </p><p>  There is also a QSS button on the adapter case.  Pressing the latter allows you to quickly activate additional wireless security technology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.computadoreseniac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tl wn7200nd driver" class="if uuid-2282848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2282848.jpg"></div><h2>  Main characteristics from a technical point of view </h2><p>  Nominally, the TL-WN7200ND must be connected to a 802.11n Wi-Fi network.  In this case, the maximum possible data transfer rate will be 150 Mb / s, and all the features of this adapter will be fully utilized.  But also such a solution can be connected to 802.11 b / g wireless networks.  In such a combination, a similar device will work, but the exchange rate will significantly decrease. </p><p>  It is also allowed to use the network card in question in the fastest 802.11ac networks.  At the same time, the capabilities of the router will not be fully utilized, but the adapter can produce all the same maximum possible 150 Mbps. </p><p>  As previously noted, the interface for connecting this solution to a personal computer is USB.  The external antenna of the adapter in question has a gain level of 5 dB.  According to the manufacturer, this is enough to catch a network signal passing through three brick walls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wn7200nd adapter" class="if uuid-2282850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2282850.jpg"></div><h2>  Setting procedure </h2><p>  In the process of assembling, connecting and configuring such a wireless adapter, you must perform the following manipulations: </p><ol><li>  At the first stage, it is necessary to clarify the name of the SSID network to which the personal computer will be switched using a network card, and the password for accessing it. </li><li>  We remove all the components of the supply of this device from the company box. </li><li>  We fasten the external antenna to the corresponding socket and turn it perpendicular to the body at the bend. </li><li>  Using a complete interface cord, we connect the computer and the adapter. </li><li>  Next, install the TL-WN7200ND driver from the CD on the computer.  It is also recommended to install various diagnostic utilities that are written on it. </li><li>  Then we reboot the PC.  This must be done so that all changes to the software correctly take effect. </li><li>  After that, open the network connection control center and initialize the auto search procedure.  Select the previously set SSID and enter the password. </li><li>  We test the connectivity by launching any browser and switching to a search service, for example Google. </li><li>  The next step is to visit the manufacturer‚Äôs website and download the latest software from it.  After that, install it by repeating steps 5-8. </li><li>  Now you need to pay attention to the level of the received signal.  If necessary, you can try to reposition the antenna on the adapter.  In some cases, this improves the signal strength of the network. </li></ol><h2>  The current cost of the adapter at the moment </h2><p>  Currently <span>TP Link TL-WN7200ND</span> can still be found on sale.  Its actual cost varies from 1000 to 1300 rubles.  At the same time, the lowest price can only be found on the Internet, but in the case of such an acquisition, it will be necessary to wait 3-5 days, which will go to the adapter. </p><p>  If you buy it in electronics supermarkets or specialized stores, then the cost will increase to 1300 rubles.  But at the same time, you can immediately get a network card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tl wn7200nd" class="if uuid-2282853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2282853.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  During operation, the owners did not notice any significant flaws in the adapter TL-WN7200ND.  Conditionally, only the presence of drivers for the Windows operating system can be attributed to the minuses.  But this is the most massive software platform today, and it is on it that the developers are guided. </p><p>  The pluses in the reviews include: </p><ol><li>  Reliability. </li><li>  High functionality. </li><li>  Affordable cost. </li><li>  Simple assembly, switching, and use procedures. </li><li>  Sufficient equipment, in which the manufacturer has included all the essentials for the first launch of the adapter. </li><li>  The ability to receive even a weak signal through the use of an external antenna. </li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you need to connect your computer to a Wi-Fi network, but it does not have such an integrated transmitter, then the TL-WN7200ND can be an excellent solution to this problem.  It can also be used in case of damage to the built-in adapter. </p><p>  Another application of this solution is due to the presence of an external antenna.  If the signal level is low, and it is not possible to move the system unit closer to the router, then the use of such an adapter can be a solution to such a problem.  These are the main cases of using such a device. </p>
