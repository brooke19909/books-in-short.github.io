Exchange of small coins for banknotes in Sberbank: options and procedures</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Probably, for every person over many years of buying goods, a decent amount of coins of 50 cents or even ten cents have accumulated.  As a rule, such a trifle is collected in a glass jar and left until better times.  Of course, using these coins in order to purchase a particular product is not very convenient.  On the one hand, the seller cannot refuse, since this is money (no matter what form they are), but on the other, there is a great awkwardness because a person will have to manually count all these coins.  Therefore, sooner or later, the moment comes when the piggy bank is full and a completely rational question arises whether it is possible to hand over a trifle to Sberbank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Coins are small" class="if uuid-3165285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71085/3165285.jpg"></div><p>  At the moment, such a service is not much advertised for logical reasons.  However, in Sberbank there is the possibility of exchanging money, despite the fact that the employees themselves insist on the contrary.  They say that in this case we are only talking about exchanging larger bills for smaller ones.  Is it so? </p><h2>  Is it possible to hand over a trifle to Sberbank </h2><p>  But in fact, some financial institution operations officers are a little cunning.  They just don't want to mess with the recount of little things once again.  However, it is worth referring to the Regulation of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation No. 318 "On the procedure for conducting cash transactions."  There is a clause that says that a bank employee must accept a trifle, if in this way the client pays. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, in order to exchange smaller bills for larger ones, Sberbank needs to fill out an appropriate application, as well as pay a commission, which can be from 1 to 3%.  Moreover, the overpayment cannot be less than 100 rubles.  This is an official requirement, so you can rely on it in case there are problems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inform.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank logo" class="if uuid-3164375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3164375.jpg"></div><p>  But in fact, speaking about whether it is possible to hand over a trifle to Sberbank, it happens that the bank teller simply redirects customers to grocery stores and says that such a service cannot be provided.  On the one hand, it‚Äôs possible to understand the employees of a financial organization, since if each client brings a lot of little things with him, the work of a banking institution will simply rise.  But on the other hand, there is a law.  Therefore, speaking officially, is it possible to deposit a trifle with Sberbank, the answer will be yes.  However, to achieve this is not always possible. </p><h2>  Features of the procedure </h2><p>  If we talk about the exchange of 10-ruble coins for banknotes, then this usually does not arise.  Bank employees perceive such procedures without negativity.  But if we are talking about coins of a smaller denomination, then there is one caveat.  According to the general legislation and regulations regarding the provision of banking services, a bank employee may decide to refuse service to a client.  In addition, it is worth considering that if a client of the bank does not want to pay any commission, then in this case he may legally be refused. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If such activity on the part of a bank employee causes outrage, then you can make a complaint and send it to the manager of the branch of Sberbank of Russia.  However, one must be realistic.  As a rule, no one punishes the operators for the fact that they do not want to spend extra time on customer service.  In this case, there are no violations of the regulations.  But if we are talking about the procedure with the appropriate commission in favor of a financial institution, then it is difficult to refuse such a payment. </p><p>  However, when a refusal is received, you can go for some tricks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.saint-petersburg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="National currency" class="if uuid-3164365" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3164365.jpg"></div><h2>  The secret of guaranteed exchange of a trifle </h2><p>  Regardless of the branch of Sberbank of Russia, such methods should work.  In order not to cause unnecessary indignation on the part of an employee of a banking institution, you can go in several ways.  If the user has an account or a Sberbank card, then he has the full right to deposit funds into it.  At the same time, the regulation does not say what denomination the funds should be.  That is, the operator simply does not have the right to refuse to deposit a trifle on the account. </p><p>  Some use the accumulated small coins in order to pay loan payments.  In this case, the bank employee will also have his hands tied, and he has no right to refuse. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another interesting way is that you can open the so-called instant issuance card and deposit money into its account.  These cards are issued free of charge at the time of treatment, they can be obtained within 10 minutes.  Thus, the bank employee will not be able to refuse to exchange trifles in Sberbank, and the client will be satisfied.  Here are some simple ways. </p><h2>  Banknote exchange procedure </h2><p>  If the operator agrees to exchange a trifle for banknotes in Sberbank, then in this case some preparatory measures need to be made.  At the time of visiting the branch, the client of the bank must have a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation.  He should also fill out an application in which his personal data will be indicated.  Such a paper is compiled without fail in case the person suddenly made fake money.  The exchange algorithm itself is extremely simple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moscow.touristgems.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One ruble" class="if uuid-3164366" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3164366.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, the client writes an application and indicates in it all his passport data, as well as the amount of the amount he wants to exchange.  After that, the bank employee must count all the coins and confirm this operation with his signature and seal, which are put on the application.  At the next stage, the client is given cash. </p><h2>  Good to know </h2><p>  It is worth noting that for such a procedure in some bank branches there is a special device.  They make the correct calculations and are suitable specifically for small coins.  It is best to contact precisely such institutions, since in this case no refusal will follow.  The recounting is very fast, so the operators are not very annoyed by such calls. </p><p>  Therefore, when deciding where to exchange coins one ruble or less, it is worthwhile to call the department beforehand to clarify whether they have a special counting machine for metal money. </p><h2>  Limits </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the amount of the commission cannot be less than 100 rubles.  Accordingly, you need to understand that the amount of little things should cover the overpayment itself.  In addition, if the final amount does not exceed one hundred rubles, then in this case an employee of a financial institution has every right to refuse to perform this manipulation.  If this happens, for example, you need to exchange 50 rubles, and paying a commission is not reasonable, then you can contact the store.  Sellers always have a huge problem, which is the lack of trifles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pravdareport.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A lot of coins" class="if uuid-3164367" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3164367.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that residents of large cities are less likely to have a problem where to change coins.  As a rule, large bank branches are equipped with the necessary equipment.  Specialized equipment may be installed at a financial institution. </p><h2>  The terminal for the exchange of little things in Sberbank </h2><p>  Today, specialized terminals are gradually appearing in banking institutions that exchange without the participation of an operator.  Thus, the procedure is performed much faster and does not lead to the fact that the whole line is forced to wait until a person manually counts the coins. </p><p>  Exchangers of this type work on the same principle.  First, the client must fill all the money in a special bowl, the receiver, after which the device will make a quick calculation.  At the next stage, the terminal should display the total value of the amount, as well as the commission.  After the client confirms the operation, he receives paper bills.  However, it must be understood that in this case a commission of 3% is provided. </p><p>  If we talk about where to take the trifle in Moscow, then a similar terminal, for example, can be found at the address: 19 Vavilova street. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.69993680000003" data-lng="37.57972245396729" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/0/7/7/16077.png"></div><p>  Also, such devices are now available in stores called the Coin Company. </p><h2>  If the exchange is denied </h2><p>  In this case, it all depends on what amount has accumulated in the coins.  On the one hand, of course, you can go on the principle and spend half a day clarifying the relationship in order to get a piece of paper with a face value of 100 rubles.  However, you need to be prepared for the fact that Sberbank employees will insist that they are not obliged to accept such a trifle and so on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Branch of Sberbank" class="if uuid-3164370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3164370.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, each client has the right to demand the presence of the manager of this department and ask him all the questions of interest.  As a rule, if it comes to this, then the bank employee has no choice, since according to the requirements of the Central Bank, employees are required to perform a similar procedure. </p><p>  But there are a few exceptions.  Of course, no one will exchange one ruble.  Also, the refusal will be legal if the equipment for the necessary procedure is broken in Sberbank or if there is simply no bargaining chip.  Theoretically, after this, you can agree with the bank employee on the day when he will be able to accept the necessary amount and issue paper cash. </p><h2>  Alternative methods </h2><p>  If you can‚Äôt deposit money or donate money to Sberbank, the easiest way is to contact a retail store or a network pharmacy.  You can also visit any nearby market, especially in the morning.  When any outlet starts its operations, the cash desk is completely empty, and serious exchange problems arise. </p><p>  Another good way is to contact the taxi drivers, which are very numerous in every city.  They are constantly faced with the fact that they can not give change to a large stream of customers. </p><h2>  Special offers of banks </h2><p>  It is best to pay attention to stocks that are constantly held by banks.  The fact is that the Central Bank is trying as much as possible to return the coins, which today in a huge amount are deposited in the banks of citizens, since this is the metal that is needed to produce new money.  In this regard, periodically the bank accepts small bills. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.freemalaysiatoday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Past the bank" class="if uuid-3164376" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3164376.jpg"></div><p>  For example, a year ago, before the onset of the new year, Sberbank officially announced the beginning of such activities.  Clients could exchange fairly large amounts of coins with the lowest commission.  For example, for 500 rubles in coins, customers received 450 rubles in paper notes. </p><h2>  Another trick </h2><p>  There is another interesting option that can be used when a very large amount of money has accumulated in coins.  To do this, it is enough to open a demand deposit.  After that, all the necessary money in any form is deposited into the account. </p><p>  At the next stage, the user can receive paper notes on the deposit.  In this case, you should not be afraid that the bank operator intends to give him his own small coins.  The metal from ten-cent coins, which comes at the disposal of the bank, is usually not returned.  This money has long begun to withdraw from circulation. </p><p>  However, you need to understand that with any tricks that involve depositing money to the card with coins, you need to be prepared for very unpleasant words in your address.  Of course, the operator has no right to such.  But everyone is familiar with such a concept as the human factor.  If this happens, then you can try to call the main manager. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Based on the foregoing, it becomes obvious that a bank employee must provide a money exchange service.  However, in fact, many face numerous challenges.  To avoid this, the easiest way is to find a branch with an appropriate terminal, or at least with a computer.  Some even abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãexchanging small money, because they believe that in the future collectors will be willing to pay much more for them.  In this case, you have to wait too long. </p>
