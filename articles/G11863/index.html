The territory consists of both multi-storey buildings and small isolated bungalows.  The architecture of the buildings is made in a style quite characteristic of the island.  On site, as well as in rooms, guests will be provided with all the necessary amenities to ensure a good rest.  The last reconstruction is dated 2006. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  This hotel is located on the west coast of the famous island of Crete.  Nana Beach 5 * is located on the seashore.

Extras include a desk and a wardrobe.  The balcony is equipped with garden furniture. </li><li>  The conditions for accommodation in a <em>bungalow (1522 euros)</em> are largely reminiscent of the previous category.

    <h2>  Negative comments </h2><p>  But there are also not quite flattering reviews about the Nana Beach 5 * hotel (Crete).  Based on them, you can highlight some of the negative aspects of the rest in this hotel.  These include the following: </p><ul><li>  even despite the fact that the Internet is paid, it absolutely does not catch; </li><li>  the number of rooms is very dilapidated, with creaking furniture and outdated equipment; </li><li>  the bathroom has a lot of black mold; </li><li>  the playground is very dirty, and many attractions are broken; </li><li>  due to clogged sewage, the drain in the bathroom is very slow; </li><li>  until midnight, music is played throughout; </li><li>  the animation is sluggish and not very interesting; </li><li>  insects are found in the rooms (this problem is especially acute in the bungalow); </li><li>  uncomfortable entry into the sea (there is a high probability of injuring your legs with sharp stones); </li><li>  fruits are served in a restaurant in a cut form (I would like them to be whole); </li><li>  diluted drinks in bars. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  This hotel makes a pretty good impression on travelers.  Considering that the main contingent of vacationers is Germans and French, the service is nevertheless tailored for them.  Everything is very polite, neat, high-quality, delicate and beautiful.  The territory is simply stunning, and the rooms, although not exclusive, but quite decent.  But the whole impression can be spoiled by the quality and cost of the Internet.  If you want to chat without interruptions on social networks or connect with friends on Skype, it is better to sit in a nearby cafe for a cup of coffee, rather than spend a lot of money on hotel vouchers. </p>
