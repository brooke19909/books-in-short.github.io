    <h2>  short biography </h2><p>  The scientist‚Äôs date of birth is September 1828, the number in different sources is not the same.  He was the son of Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Butlerov, his mother lost early enough.  He spent all his childhood in his grandfather‚Äôs family estate, in the village of Podlesnaya Shentala (now the region of the Republic of Tatarstan). </p><p>  He studied in different places: first in a closed private school, then in a gymnasium.  Later he entered Kazan University at the Department of Physics and Mathematics.  However, despite this, he was most interested in chemistry.  The future author of the theory of the structure of organic compounds remained at the end of his studies on the spot as a teacher. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1851 - the time of defense of the first dissertation of the scientist on the topic "Oxidation of organic compounds".  After a brilliant performance, he was given the opportunity to manage all the chemistry at his university. </p>

    <p>  The author of the theory of the structure of organic compounds went through a long career ladder and by 1874 became one of the best academicians of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. </p><p>  The scientist died in 1886 in the place where he spent his childhood in the family estate of his grandfather.  In the family local chapel, he was buried. </p><h2>  Scientist's contribution to the development of chemical knowledge </h2><p>  The theory of the structure of Butlerov's organic compounds is, of course, his main work.  However, not the only one.  It was this scientist who first created the Russian school of chemists. </p><p>  Moreover, from its walls came such scientists who later had great weight in the development of all science.  These are the following people: </p><ul><li>  Markovnikov; </li><li>  Zaitsev; </li><li>  Kondakov; </li><li>  Tabor </li><li>  Konovalov; </li><li>  Lviv and others. </li></ul><p>  The author of the theory of the structure of organic compounds has created a number of works on natural science, including chemistry.  Especially a lot of research was devoted specifically to organic compounds. </p><h2>  Organic Chemistry Works </h2><p>  There are many such works.  After all, Butlerov spent almost all his free time in the laboratory of his university, carrying out various experiments, drawing conclusions and conclusions.  That is how the theory of the <span>chemical structure of</span> organic compounds was born. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are several particularly capacious works of the scientist: </p><ul><li>  he created a report to the conference on the topic "On the chemical structure of matter"; </li><li>  thesis "On Essential Oils"; </li><li>  The first scientific work "Oxidation of Organic Compounds". </li></ul><p>  Before its formulation and creation, the author of the theory of the structure of organic compounds studied for a long time the works of other scientists from different countries, and studied their works, including experimental ones.  Only then, summarizing and systematizing the knowledge gained, did he reflect all the conclusions in the provisions of his nominal theory. </p>

    <h2>  The theory of the structure of organic compounds A. M. Butlerova </h2><p>  The XIX century is marked by the rapid development of almost all sciences, including chemistry.  In particular, extensive discoveries on carbon and its compounds continue to accumulate, <span>organic substances</span> strike everyone with their diversity.  However, no one dares to systematize and streamline all this factual material, lead to a common denominator and identify common laws on which everything is built. </p><p>  Butlerov A.M. was the first to do this. It was he who owned the ingenious theory of the chemical structure of organic compounds, the provisions of which he spoke massively at the German conference of chemists.  This was the beginning of a new era in the development of science, organic chemistry embarked on the <span>path of intensive development.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The scientist himself went towards this gradually.  He conducted many experiments and predicted the existence of substances with desired properties, discovered some types of reactions and saw the future for them.  He studied the works of his colleagues and their discoveries a lot.  Only against this background, through careful and painstaking labor, did he manage to create his own masterpiece.  And now the theory of the structure of organic compounds in this <span>section of chemistry</span> is practically the same as the periodic system in inorganic. </p>

    <h2>  Discovery of the scientist before creating the theory </h2><p>  What discoveries were made and theoretical justifications given to scientists before the theory of the structure of organic compounds by A. M. Butlerov appeared? </p><ol><li>  The domestic genius was the first to synthesize such organic substances as urotropin, formaldehyde, methylene iodide and others. </li><li>  He synthesized a sugar-like substance (tertiary alcohol) from an inorganic substance, thereby inflicting another blow to the theory of vitalism. </li><li>  He predicted the future for polymerization reactions, calling them the best and most promising. </li><li>  Isomerism was explained for the first time only to them. </li></ol><p>  Of course, these are only the main milestones of his work.  In fact, the many years of painstaking work of a scientist can be described for a long time.  However, the theory of the structure of organic compounds has become the most significant today, the provisions of which will be discussed later. </p><h2>  The first position of the theory </h2><p>  In 1861, the great Russian scientist at the congress of chemists in Speyer shares with his colleagues his views on the causes of the structure and variety of organic compounds, expressing all this in the form of theoretical provisions. </p><p>  The very first point is the following: all atoms within a single molecule are connected in a strict sequence, which is determined by their valency.  In this case, the carbon atom exhibits a valence index of four.  Oxygen has a value of this indicator, equal to two, hydrogen - unit. </p><p>  He proposed calling this feature the chemical <span>structure of matter.</span>  Later, the notation was used to express it on paper using graphical full structural, abbreviated and molecular formulas. </p>

    <p>  The phenomenon of the connection of carbon particles with each other into infinite chains of different structures (linear, cyclic, branched) also applies. </p><p>  In general, Butlerov‚Äôs theory of the structure of organic compounds determined by his first position the significance of valency and a single formula for each compound, which reflects the properties and behavior of a substance during reactions. </p><h2>  The second position of the theory </h2><p>  In this paragraph, an explanation was given to the diversity of organic compounds in the world.  Relying on the carbon compounds in the chain, the scientist suggested that there are unequal compounds in the world that have different properties, but at the same time completely identical in molecular composition.  In other words, there is a phenomenon of isomerism. </p><p>  The theory of the structure of organic compounds by A. M. Butlerov not only clarified the essence of isomers and isomers with this provision, but the scientist himself confirmed everything by practical experience. </p><p>  So, for example, he synthesized a butane isomer - isobutane.  Then he predicted for pentane the existence of not one but three isomers, based on the structure of the compound.  And synthesized them all, proving their innocence. </p>

    <h2>  Disclosure of the third position </h2><p>  The next point of the theory says that all atoms and molecules within the same compound are able to influence the properties of each other.  The nature of the behavior of the substance in reactions of various types, the manifested chemical and other properties will depend on this. </p><p>  Thus, on the basis of this position, several <span>classes of organic compounds are</span> distinguished <span>that</span> differ in the type and structure of the functional determining group. </p><p>  The theory of the structure of organic compounds by A. M. Butlerov is summarized in almost all textbooks on organic chemistry.  After all, it is she who is the basis of this section, an explanation of all the laws on which molecules are built. </p><h2>  The value of theory for the present </h2><p>  Of course, it is great.  This theory allowed: </p><ol><li>  to unite and systematize all the factual material accumulated by the time of its creation; </li><li>  explain the laws of structure, properties of various compounds; </li><li>  give a full explanation of the reasons for such a wide variety of compounds in chemistry; </li><li>  gave a start to numerous syntheses of new substances based on the provisions of the theory; </li><li>  allowed to advance views, to develop atomic-molecular learning. </li></ol><p>  Therefore, to say that the author of the theory of the structure of organic compounds, the photo of which can be seen below, has done a lot, is to say nothing.  Butlerov can rightfully be considered the father of organic chemistry, the ancestor of its theoretical foundations. </p><p>  His scientific vision of the world, the genius of thinking, the ability to predict the result played a role in the long run.  This man had tremendous capacity for work, patience, and tirelessly experimented, synthesized, and trained.  He was mistaken, but always learned a lesson and drew the right promising conclusions. </p>

    <p>  Only such a set of qualities and business acumen, perseverance allowed to achieve the desired effect. </p><h2>  Studying Organic Chemistry at School </h2><p>  In a secondary education course, not so much time is devoted to studying the basics of organics.  Only one quarter of the 9th grade and the whole 10th grade (according to the program of Gabrielyan O.S.).  However, this time is enough for the children to be able to study all the main classes of compounds, the features of their structure and nomenclature, and practical significance. </p><p>  The basis for the beginning of the development of the course is the theory of the structure of organic compounds by A. M. Butlerov.  Grade 10 is devoted to a full examination of its provisions, and subsequently to theoretical and practical confirmation of them in the study of each class of substances. </p>
