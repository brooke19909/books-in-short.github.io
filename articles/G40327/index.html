Many people enjoy relaxing here until the end of October, after which most of the hotels close before spring.  Now the Russians are actively buying up vouchers to Turkey in order to enjoy the pleasant Mediterranean climate and boast an even chocolate tan before returning to the cold, returning home. </p><p>  Most of our compatriots choose hotel complexes located in Alanya for recreation.  The Calido Maris Hotel 5 * hotel, to which our today's article is devoted, is located in another resort, no less popular among tourists - Side.  But it is not too long and difficult to get to the beloved Alanya from the hotel.  It is the location of the Calido Maris Hotel 5 * hotel that provides it with wild popularity among tourists of various categories. </p><p>  However, opinions about the rest are not always as unambiguous as the description of the hotel complex in the tourist catalogs.  Therefore, we decided, talking about the Calido Maris Hotel 5 * hotel, the tourists' reviews should be used as a basis, so that it would be easier for the reader to navigate how much relaxation here is right for him. </p>

    <h2>  Brief information about the hotel complex </h2><p>  Most tourists always focus on hotel descriptions in reviews.  The Calido Maris Hotel 5 * hotel belongs to one of the newest complexes in Turkey.  It was opened last year, so guests can not worry about the deterioration of the number of rooms and design.  Here, the hotel administration did its best, and guests enjoy the pleasant interiors in the apartments and all public areas during the whole rest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From the description of the Calido Maris Hotel 5 * hotel given by our compatriots, we can conclude that its territory is extremely small for the declared five stars.  It only fits two pools and a small water park with slides, which is spent most of the day by adult vacationers.  But the hotel complex itself accommodates up to one and a half thousand guests, which creates some difficulties for them when visiting restaurants and relaxing by the pool. </p><p>  Many Russians in reviews of the Calido Maris Hotel 5 * hotel mention that it clearly does not reach five stars.  Small imperfections and not the highest level of service interfere with their high status.  Therefore, tourists often write that it looks more like a ‚Äúfour‚Äù, although the cost of tours to the hotel complex is identical to the prices of the other ‚Äúfive‚Äù of Turkey. </p><p>  <span>Calido Maris Hotel 5 *</span> is a multi-storey complex, which houses more than four hundred rooms of different categories.  They differ in area and level of comfort. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews on the location of the hotel complex </h2><p>  The location of the Calido Maris Hotel 5 * in Turkey in the catalogs is written in completely different ways.  Some leaflets contain information that he is in Side, others call him Alanya.  In fact, the Calido Maris Hotel 5 * is built on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  Locals call this area Chengerkey.  And the nearest settlement to the hotel is the village of Gazipasha.  The distance to it does not exceed sixteen kilometers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you want to go to a disco in Alanya or Side, then keep in mind that tourists do this quite often.  It is necessary to drive about forty kilometers to Alanya, and Side is located much closer - within twenty kilometers.  Many reviews of the holiday noted that hotel guests often went to the above resort areas to just walk the streets or go shopping. </p><p>  The photos of the Calido Maris Hotel 5 * hotel, posted on the Internet, allow us to conclude that guests will go to their own rather than the city beach.  However, tourists will have to cross a small road along the way.  Advertising catalogs always mention that the hotel complex is located on the first coastline. </p>

    <h2>  Description of the beach area </h2><p>  The sea is what almost all Russians go on vacation for.  Therefore, choosing a hotel, they are primarily interested in the condition and equipment of the beach area.  The Calido Maris Hotel 5 * in Side has its own sand and pebble beach.  But the reviews about his condition do not always cause positive emotions among future guests of the hotel complex. </p><p>  Many tourists complain about the lack of paths on the beach, so you have to go to the water on hot sand, and then on sharp stones.  Also, the entrance to the sea is not equipped, which complicates swimming with young children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Sunbeds on the beach are enough for all vacationers, but they stand quite far from the water.  Therefore, you can often observe the pattern of dragging deck chairs to the edge of the sea. </p><p>  In reviews of the Calido Maris Hotel 5 * hotel in Turkey, it is often mentioned that the beach is poorly cleaned, because it is littered with garbage during the day.  Mattresses on sunbeds also can not boast of cleanliness, vacationers write in the comments that lying on them is quite unpleasant. </p><p>  But none of the tourists have complaints to the sea.  In this part of the beach it is almost crystal clear and has an amazing turquoise hue.  Therefore, despite numerous shortcomings, most of the hotel guests were satisfied with the coastal zone. </p><h2>  A few words about infrastructure and territory </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that the Calido Maris Hotel 5 * hotel has a small territory.  Guests literally have nowhere to go in the evening, because almost no flowers have been planted throughout the entire territory.  For a five-star hotel, this attitude to landscaping is unacceptable. </p><p>  Also for the "five" the hotel has a small number of infrastructure facilities.  Almost all the guests noted this in their comments, specifying that over time the hotel will become completely bored. </p><p>  There are two restaurants for guests: the main and a la carte.  You can also spend time in the bar, which is combined with a small cafe. </p><p>  Those who do not want to go to the sea can spend time near the pool.  There are always enough sun loungers, and six water slides add variety to the measured life of vacationers.  The slides themselves are new, so they fully comply with safety standards. </p><p>  The pride of the hotel complex is the conference room.  It is equipped with the most modern equipment, so you can easily hold any event here.  The beautiful hall is designed for two hundred people, if necessary, it is turned into a banquet hall intended for celebrations. </p><p>  A gym in the hotel is also available.  But he is distinguished by obvious imperfections.  Here and there, wires sticking out from under the floor are visible, and the equipment of the hall is extremely poor.  Of the connected simulators, guests can use only one treadmill, and the set of dumbbells is limited by small weights. </p>

    <h2>  Service level </h2><p>  Tourists who visited the Calido Maris Hotel 5 * in Turkey, Side, almost unanimously believe that the level of service and the number of services provided do not correspond to the stated five stars. </p><p>  Guests have the opportunity to resolve their issues through staff working around the clock at the reception.  Many of them speak good Russian, but without a tip they are in no hurry to fulfill their basic duties.  This is noted in various comments and significantly spoils the impression of rest. </p><p>  Room service works, but often the guests are brought at all the wrong dishes that they ordered.  Moreover, many write that they try to bring to the apartments what is not in demand in the main restaurant. </p><p>  At the reception guests can use safes free of charge, but most tourists prefer to use the ones installed in the apartments. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel has its own store, guests prefer to go shopping in large shopping centers.  This can be done using the transfer from the hotel complex.  Bus schedules are usually posted in the lobby, round-trip fare varies from seven to nine US dollars depending on the direction. </p><p>  The animation team consists of eight people, but during the day they are practically not visible at the hotel.  In the evening they hold a show program, which guests recognize as rather weak.  Therefore, bored youth prefers to go to nightclubs in Side and Alanya. </p><p>  Check-in takes place at about two in the afternoon, however, many tourists write that even without a tip they were able to get into their rooms before the deadline.  Immediately upon arrival, they were issued and issued the keys to the apartment.  Most of them have sea views, which adds to the hotel complex pluses. </p><h2>  tour cost </h2><p>  The hotel complex last season was very popular among our compatriots, largely due to its affordable cost.  Compared to other five-star hotels, the prices for which are "biting", Calido Maris Hotel 5 * looks very attractive. </p><p>  For example, twelve nights for two with departure from Moscow in October will cost vacationers a little more than sixty thousand rubles.  Naturally, in the summer season the ticket will cost a little more, but still this amount will not be ruinous for the family budget. </p><h2>  Fun for kids </h2><p>  Since the hotel has rather weak animation, children almost always have to entertain themselves.  For them, there is a private pool with three slides, where small guests prefer to spend their time. </p><p>  Also, the child can engage in games on the playground or in the club.  Animators who speak several languages ‚Äã‚Äãwork here, so do not be afraid that no one will understand your child. </p><p>  There is no children's menu in the restaurant; at the request of the parents, a nanny is called to the room.  This service is paid, therefore it is registered in a separate account, which is paid when leaving the room. </p>

    <h2>  Food concept </h2><p>  The hotel complex operates on an all-inclusive basis.  The concept includes the following meals: </p><ul><li>  breakfast; </li><li>  late breakfast; </li><li>  dinner; </li><li>  afternoon tea </li><li>  dinner. </li></ul><p>  Guests can also have a meal in the cafe during the day, and late-night guests can enjoy night soup.  From drinks available local alcohol, soda, concentrated juices, tea and coffee. </p><p>  Guests eat in the main restaurant, but reviews on the quality of the dishes are not always positive.  Tourists often write that fifteen minutes after the opening of the restaurant, the most popular dishes ended, which were not replenished in the future.  In general, the food is characterized as fresh and not too tasty. </p><p>  You can have a bite to eat burgers, which in the cafe, guests collect their own from the proposed ingredients.  Some guests consider this approach unacceptable, while others are quite satisfied with such self-service. </p><p>  A place in the √† la carte restaurant must be reserved in advance.  According to the quality of the dishes here, the opinions of the guests also vary greatly.  Some guests noted the delicious meat dishes, while others believe that the food in both establishments is no different from each other. </p><p>  Local alcohol is served in bars slightly diluted, which, however, is common in Turkish hotels, regardless of their star rating. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel reviews: positive and negative </h2><p>  Of course, even recognized leaders in the field of tourism are difficult to please all the guests, without exception.  Therefore, among the comments about this hotel there are positive and negative.  Let's start with the obvious drawbacks that almost all guests noticed: </p><ul><li>  unequipped and uncomfortable beach; </li><li>  eating problems; </li><li>  saving on trifles; </li><li>  poor spa hours </li><li>  paid internet; </li><li>  small and ugly territory. </li></ul><p>  All of the listed shortcomings of the hotel complex are attributed by some guests to the fact that it was opened recently, therefore it cannot boast of the coordinated work of the team. </p><p>  The hotel also has a lot of advantages: </p><ul><li>  beautiful and clean apartments; </li><li>  sea ‚Äã‚Äãview from most rooms; </li><li>  magnificent water park; </li><li>  free spa service; </li><li>  the cleanest sea, in which it is pleasant to swim at any time of the day; </li><li>  nice pools that are cleaned every night; </li><li>  the ability to use the safe for free. </li></ul><p>  Analyzing the numerous reviews of hotel guests, we came to the conclusion that it can be safely chosen for the first visit to Turkey.  For little money, you can get acquainted with local hospitality and appreciate all the advantages of the all-inclusive system.  But for those who have already visited Turkey more than once and can conduct a comparative analysis, it is worth looking for another hotel complex that is more consistent with the status of five stars. </p>
