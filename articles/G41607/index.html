  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Marxist Theory</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Karl Marx, a German public figure and thinker, formed a political theory in the 19th century, which subsequently influenced many areas of public life.  His companion was Engels.  Marxist theory became the basis of the work of the Russian revolutionary Lenin. </p><p>  The idea was oriented towards an approach to society as a <span>single social</span> system.  Along with this, the analysis of society was carried out from the perspective of materialism.  Marxist theory pointed out that all political phenomena are not based on human consciousness, but on the <span>being of people.</span>  The ultimate reason and decisive driving force of the events of history for the followers of the doctrine seemed to be a change in the <span>methods of production.</span> </p><p>  Marxist economic theory gave impetus to the origin and subsequent development of class political ideas.  Classes were some "derivatives" of the production structure of society.  In this regard, their confrontation is the very essence of politics. </p><p>  Political freedom for the individual, from the perspective of Marxist theory, was seen as freedom from oppression and the opportunity to participate in the political life of society.  The followers of the idea considered politics ‚Äúa matter of millions,‚Äù advocating that the masses should be given the opportunity to express their views and realize their will.  The main role was assigned to the working class.  This social stratum, freeing itself from the yoke of the bourgeoisie, frees the whole people from it.  Thus, the conditions for the free development of each individual are formed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Marxist theory also interprets the problem of political and <span>social equality</span> from the perspective of classes.  There can be no equality between the exploited and the exploiters.  The main factor contributing to its achievement is the seizure of political power by the working people.  In this case, the question of the political and social equality of the peasantry, the working class and the working intelligentsia will be resolved. </p><p>  The theory of Marxism considers the issue of power, mainly state power, to be the main political issue.  The presence of state power allows these or other forces to influence all spheres of social life, thus affirming their dominance. </p><p>  The Marxist theory of money considers the role of gold as a special kind of commodity.  Gold, preserving its marketable nature, has value and consumer value.  The latter is that it is used for industrial purposes.  The value of gold is defined as an indicator of the social labor spent on its extraction.  Taking on the <span>functions of money,</span> gold acquires special properties.  Thus, consumer value begins to act as a universal form by which the value of other goods is manifested.  A concrete work, enclosed in money, can be considered as a universal expression of the abstract labor of man. </p><p>  Finance is considered an independent, independent <span>exchange value.</span>  Developing, commodity circulation contributes to the formation of new monetary functions, new forms of money itself.  The functions formed in the process of commodity circulation (means of payment, treasure, means of circulation, value measure, etc.) form in some way steps in the formation of independent value. </p><p>  Through the whole theory of Marxism passes the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãclass, political interests.  They reflect everything that can help strengthen the position of one or another subject (nation, party, class) in society.  At the same time, in the <span>political sphere,</span> great importance is attached to the fact that the subject recognizes his own political interest, as well as the ability to see the true interests of other participants. </p>
