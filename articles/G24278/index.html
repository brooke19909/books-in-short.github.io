    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The manufacturer, with the goal of increasing the service life, installed a direct drive on his device.  In addition to increasing the time of use, this version of the drum spends less energy, and this is already quite a significant advantage.  The device is able to work quietly, unlike its competitors.  Due to the newly introduced program (function), the manufacturer decided to completely abandon the pulley and belt.  This is also an effective method against rapid breakdown of the device.  The factory gives 10 years warranty.  The drive actually works quite well, which confirms the quiet operation.  You can not be afraid to wash at night, for fear of waking someone up.  The <span>LG E10B9LD</span> washing machine has an engine, which is located in the axis of the drum.  This option helps to reduce vibration, but all recommendations must be considered when installing the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Washing modes </h2><p>  The machine is capable of washing things weighing up to 5 kg.  It is worth noting its wonderful function, which avoids unscheduled breakdown of the mechanism.  It is an automatic system that distributes things evenly, avoiding overload at one point on the drum.  This function is active not only at the beginning of washing, but also before spinning.  Many people like the fact that the <span>LG E10B9LD</span> washing machine is equipped with different modes.  Thanks to these options, a person does not have to set the same parameters every time.  It is worth noting that buyers especially highlight this advantage, leaving only positive feedback. </p><p>  The technique carefully treats linen, which is a definite plus.  In washing modes, optimal parameters are laid.  The most suitable options for everyday life: ‚Äúfast‚Äù and ‚Äúintense‚Äù.  You need to choose between them, only starting from pollution.  ‚ÄúPrewash‚Äù may also seem convenient.  As a rule, it is used for severe pollution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="automatic machine" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1291794.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  This automatic machine is made in white, like most conventional washing machines.  As you know, all equipment is divided into classes.  The washing machine of this brand belongs to class ‚ÄúA‚Äù for washing and power consumption, and for spinning - to ‚ÄúB‚Äù.  Dirty things are loaded into the device using a special window located on the front wall.  Drying is not provided.  There is a display that shows the end time of the wash. </p><p>  A total of 9 programs are installed, there is a timer system, but it is used, as a rule, very rarely.  The width of the washing machine is 60 cm. The height is 85 cm, but it can be reduced by a removable cover.  The spin speed reaches 1,500 rpm for 1 minute.  As in other washing machines, there is protection against leakage and overloads in the network. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine width" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1291793.jpg" width="351"></div>

    <h2>  Installation </h2><p>  The width of the washing machine allows you to install the appliance in the kitchen or bathroom.  It does not take up much space.  The floor in the right place should not have a slope (if there is one, then no more than 1 <sup>o</sup> ).  The socket, into which the plug from the machine is connected, must not be used by additional electrical appliances at the same time, otherwise this will lead to burning of the wiring.  From the rear panel to the wall, the recommended distance is about 10 cm, on the sides - no more than 2 cm. Foreign objects cannot be stored on the LG E10B9LD.  This will help keep the original appearance longer.  Do not forget that the machine has a built-in fan.  If the floor is still uneven, then you should find another place.  You do not need to use bars and other coasters to properly install the washing machine, since during operation it can come off them. </p><h2>  Before the washing process </h2><p>  The first time (after arriving from the store or from the warehouse), it is necessary to start the first circle without laundry, this method will remove excess moisture left from the factory during the testing of the device. </p><p>  Before you put things in the hatch, you need to carefully study the information on the tags.  As a rule, it is there that contains data on the material, the recommended temperature, the method of extraction and drying.  It is best to wash all clothes in several passes, grouping similar options. </p><p>  When loading laundry into the machine <span>LG E10B9LD (reviews</span> about this model are positive for the most part), it is necessary to alternate big things with small ones.  Otherwise, the drum may break.  You should definitely check your pockets for money, a phone or other things.  Otherwise, this can lead not only to damage to these items, but also to damage to the machine itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg e10b9ld reviews" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1291795.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Washing machine LG E10B9LD - price and quality </h2><p>  Indeed, high-quality washing machines have a high cost, which is not suitable for every person.  Keep this in mind.

With proper care, the machine will in no case break down, but will serve for a long time for many years.  If something happens and this situation fits the warranty, then the service center will quickly fix the defect. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The manufacturer gives a warranty on the LG E10B9LD, which lasts 36 months.  That is, this is a pretty decent period, which indicates a good quality of manufacture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg e10b9ld price" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1291796.jpg" width="397"></div>

    <p>  If we talk about the positive aspects, it should be remembered that the device works quietly, efficiently, consumes little energy, and it is quite simple to manage.  For a better perception, all the functions on the scoreboard glow in a special color, so it will be difficult to get confused.  Considering the shortcomings, it is necessary to say about such a feature of this machine: it does not squeeze without rinsing, but since few people use this function, its absence is not very evident.  In general, the LG E10B9LD washing machine has quite adequate characteristics and it works just fine. </p>
