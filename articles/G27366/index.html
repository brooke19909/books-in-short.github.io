    <h2>  What </h2><p>  What to deal with?  What is a <span>transport tax?</span>  You need to know this.  Indeed, not every citizen pays such contributions to the state treasury.  But only those who own a particular vehicle. </p><p>  So, the transport tax is an annual contribution to the tax authorities for the registration of vehicles (with an engine) in the traffic police.  This payment does not apply to those who have bicycles, skateboards, snowboards and so on.  Transport tax is regional in nature.  And he, as you might guess, is installed in each region individually.  It is not regulated by the tax code.  Beneficiaries also for transport tax are determined in each specific subject.  But there are general rules.  As for settlements (rates), and in relation to beneficiaries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who does not pay </h2><p>  Should I pay transport tax?  The answer to this question is unequivocal: yes.  But do not rush.  First you have to understand who is freed from him.  And only then, taking himself into this or that category of citizens, should he deal with this issue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax rate" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1196613.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Beneficiaries include veterans and the disabled.  The military, who took or are taking part in hostilities, can also be attributed to special citizens.  Heroes of the Soviet Union need not be forgotten.  These categories of citizens are fully exempt from the payment of transport tax.  They generally do not have to think about how to pay it. </p><p>  In addition, large families are also exempted in most cases from this penalty.  Only people should have at least 3 minor children.  Keep this in mind.  All other citizens can think about how to pay the transport tax. </p><h2>  Senior citizens </h2><p>  A separate point in our today's question is pensioners.  The thing is that in Russia, older people are among the beneficiaries.  Therefore, they often wonder if they need to pay a fee for the vehicles they own. </p><p>  This question is not so simple.  Firstly, pensioners are rarely completely exempt from payment.  Instead, they are granted a benefit.  For example, if the property has 2 or more vehicles, an elderly person should pay only 10% of the total amount. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How can I pay the transport tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1196615.jpg"></div>

Citizens of retirement age who have low-powered cars and other means of transportation are completely exempted from paying this contribution.  The exact data is worth knowing in your area.  Typically, engine power varies from 70 to 150 horsepower. </p><h2>  For calculations </h2><p>  Transport tax for individuals is always different.  It depends on many factors.  It has already been said that this payment is regional.  Therefore, when calculating the amount, the city of residence will be taken into account.  What will help to find out how much the transport tax will be in one place or another? </p><p>  First, you need to know the <span>tax rate.</span>  It is determined by the characteristics of your vehicle in each region.  The role is played by engine size, year of manufacture and class ecology. </p><p>  Secondly, a tax base is required.  It is also called horsepower.  The more vehicles they have, the higher the tax will be.  Data is indicated in the TCP. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax deadlines" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1196614.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Thirdly, the transport tax rate is calculated based on the time of car ownership.  It is important.  Indeed, for some calculations, it is required to select certain formulas.  About them - a little later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The last thing that can come in handy is a multiplier.  Has a place for expensive vehicles.  Appears only when the cost of a car exceeds 3 million rubles.  You need to find out the coefficient in each region. </p><h2>  Formulas </h2><p>  How can I pay the transport tax?  Before dealing with this issue, it is worth having an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe calculations thereof.  After all, no one wants to overpay.  Just like underpaying.  Both in the first and in the second case there are problems with the law.  And, as you might guess, nobody needs them. </p><p>  How much will the transport tax be in any given case?  You will have to turn to special formulas for calculations.  Just keep in mind: first you must get all the data on tax rates and other components for your region.  After all, as already mentioned, our current tax depends entirely on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresidence.  In fact, not everything is as difficult as it seems. </p><p>  The standard formula that will help determine the exact amount is when the transport tax rate is multiplied by the amount of horsepower.  It is from these data that you have to build on. </p><p>  But for cars owned less than a year, there are rules.  To get the exact amount you have to deposit, the standard calculation formula is multiplied by the ownership months divided by 12. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="whether to pay transport tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1196616.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Luxury cars also have their own formulas.  More precisely, one.  The standard formula is simply multiplied by the <span>increment factor.</span>  And it turns out the amount that the taxpayer must pay.  If we are talking about a luxury car that has been owned for less than a year, then you will have to slightly change the calculation system.  How exactly?  Take the formula for calculating transport taxes if you have owned it for less than a year, and then multiply by a raising factor.  Nothing difficult or special. </p><h2>  Dates and orders </h2><p>  So we figured out <span>how to calculate the transport tax.</span>  The timing of payment, as well as the procedure for this process should not be surprising.  Indeed, for all taxes there is one rule - you are limited to the reporting period. </p><p>  It lasts until April 30th.  Of course, the faster you pay, the better.  You should not hesitate with this process.  Once you have received the appropriate payment, try to make the payment as soon as possible.  It is easy to do.  Especially with modern features.  How to pay transport tax?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><h2>  Bank </h2><p>  The first option is the simplest and most familiar.  But it is not too convenient for most modern people.  It is about paying by bank.  You will need to take the details of the tax authorities, just in case documents for the car, without fail a passport.  TIN and SNILS will not be superfluous either. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax for individuals" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1196617.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Then, with the payment received, go to any bank, transfer your ID and account for payment.  Pay cash to the cashier, receive a check and save it.  The process is over.  Only him, as already mentioned, not all citizens recognize.  Moreover, now the Internet and cashless payments are in great demand.  And it‚Äôs a sin not to use it. </p><h2>  Government services </h2><p>  For example, if you are thinking about how to pay the transport tax, the service "Payment of public services" is suitable.  Here you need to find the "Taxes" section.  Next, you will be available to search for possible payments.  The main feature of this service is that you can immediately see what kind of debts you have. </p><p>  Enter your TIN in the appropriate field, and then select "Transport tax".  If you have already paid a fee, it should not be there.  Now it remains to fill in the data about yourself and about the transport, if there are empty fields.  And enter the amount of payment (sometimes it is affixed automatically). </p><p>  Everything is almost done.  It remains to choose a calculation method.  Suitable "Bank card."  After clicking on the appropriate button, new fields will be available for you to fill out.  They are directly related to your bank card.  Enter all that is required and confirm the operation.  You can print a check.  By the way, in the same way, payment is made using Internet services such as Sberbank Online. </p><h2>  In tax </h2><p>  Another option that will help answer how to pay the transport tax is nothing more than contacting all the documents with the tax service in your area.  Now there are separate cash desks where everyone has the right to make payment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much transport tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1196623.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The process is no different from the actions in the bank.  Unless you, most likely, will be asked for PTS and data about the car.  This practice is very common.  That's all.  Now it‚Äôs clear how to pay the transport tax. </p><p>  In addition to these methods, you can use ATMs and payment terminals.  Insert a bank ‚Äúplastic‚Äù into them, select ‚ÄúPayments and transfers‚Äù, ‚ÄúSearch for a recipient by TIN‚Äù.  Next, enter the tax details, select "Transport tax", print the necessary data (you can not write your TIN, but it is better to indicate it), and then confirm the payment.  That's all. </p>
