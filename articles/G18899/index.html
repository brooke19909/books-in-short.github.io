    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  "Montenegro" is a hotel, reviews of which are usually positive.  But there are some disadvantages that can overshadow the rest.  We list the main ones: </p><ul><li>  the carpets in the rooms are poorly cleaned, there is a lot of dust; </li><li>  small and cramped showers that are not suitable for tall and full people; </li><li>  Russians are not accommodated in the best rooms, while foreigners get the best apartments; </li><li>  every morning guests are awakened by checking the minibar; </li><li>  instead of juice, a low-quality instant drink is served for breakfast. </li></ul><h2>  Who should go to relax at this hotel? </h2><p>  Many tourist complexes can offer Montenegro.  Hotel "Montenegro", whose prices can be called low, stands out among them with a good quality of service.  For two adults, 5 days of rest in this hotel will cost from 25 thousand rubles (breakfast only, low season).  For tourists with children, this hotel will be a great option, and young people, on the contrary, can be bored here.  Also, this quiet hotel can be advised to elderly couples or people who love a calm and measured rest on the sea. </p>
