    <p>  In the XVIII century, sphragistics began to form as a department of diplomacy.  Its goals at that time were to date the document, as well as establish its authenticity.  In the future, the concept of what sphragistics was expanded.  Since the end of the 19th century, numerous seals have been introduced into scientific use, which have lost touch with the document (Old Babylonian, Ancient Egyptian, Old Russian, Parthian, Ancient Indian, etc.).  They were discovered during excavations.  Since that time, sphragistics is a science that studies, among other things, the history of the development and formation of ancient institutions of the state based on the classification of seals, which revealed changes in its apparatus.  In the USSR, there was a noticeable rise in this science.  This was due to a significant expansion of materials found during excavations in Pskov and Novgorod. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Russian literature, with the exception of a special chapter in A. Lakier‚Äôs book ‚ÄúRussian Heraldry‚Äù, which describes the press and answers the question of what sphragistics is, for a long time there was only insignificant and fragmentary information on this science.  Yanin published in 1970 a two-volume study entitled "Actual Seals of Ancient Russia".  This scientist became the continuation of the case of NP Likhachev, who is considered the founder of Soviet sphragistics.  It was Likhachev who became a key figure in the study of the heritage of Ancient Russia after the Novgorod settlement was discovered at the beginning of the 20th century.  The science of seals is not very active today, but it is still developing.  New research is emerging in this area. </p>

    <h2>  The relationship of sphragistics with numismatics and heraldry </h2><p>  So, we learned that sphragistics is a science that studies the press.  We now find out with which branches of knowledge it has the greatest connection.  This science is directly related to numismatics and heraldry.  With the latter - the fact that previously used only on seals, numerous images then went into coats of arms.  The seals were used by the specific princes.  They depicted the emblem of the inheritance in which they reigned.  After some time, these emblems often entered the coat of arms.  This happened, for example, at the princes Golitsyn (coat of arms of the Principality of Lithuania). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sphragistics is connected with numismatics by the fact that the seal of the prince who at that time ruled was often minted on coins.  If the inscription on the coin was not preserved, by the emblem on the seal one could find out its origin. </p>

    <h2>  Ancient seal </h2><p>  In order to better understand what sphragistics is, let us turn to history.  Very old is the custom of using seals.  Already in ancient times, eastern peoples put a print of the seal.  <span>This custom</span> was distributed mainly in Babylon, Persepolis and Egypt.  The seals of that time were solid colored stones, which had the form of beetles, cylinders, etc. Various signs were applied to them. </p>

    <p>  In many places in the Bible, mention of seals can be found.  For example, in XXI chapter III of the book of Kings, in XIV chapter of the book of Daniel, in XXXVIII chapter of the <span>book of Genesis.</span>  The custom of their use from the Eastern peoples was borrowed by the Romans and Greeks.  The Romans usually used seal rings.  They made a print of the press, applying it to various kinds of acts.  The tribes that settled on Roman soil adopted this custom, which nevertheless became universal and common not earlier than the 12th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The meaning and custom of using seals in antiquity </h2><p>  For a long time, the seal replaced the signature, so its significance was great.  Various precautions were used to prevent forgery.  It was precisely this goal that the science of the press served as a source.  With special solemnity, they were applied to important acts.  Both the Germans and the Romans had a custom to put a ring seal in the tomb with the deceased.  They were sometimes worn around the neck by the keepers of state and royal seals. </p><h2>  Types of Ancient Seals </h2><p>  Until the VIII century, they were used mainly unilateral.  However, after two centuries, they began to be replaced by double ones that stuck to paper, parchment or hung on shoelaces.  There were lead seals (in other words - bull seals, which got their name from lead balls on which the image was knocked out), silver, gold (rarely), bronze, wax, tin and wax.  With the exception of wax and wax, they were all hanging.  In Western Sphragistics, such seals were called sigilla, or sigilla pendentia.  They were hung at the bottom of the letters, immediately after the signature, on silk or linen lace or on a piece of leather or parchment.  If there were several seals, at their placement they followed the rank and position of the owners. </p>

    <p>  The shape of the seals was very diverse: they were round (the oldest), oblong, oval, square, triangular, hexagonal, etc. </p><h2>  Seal color value </h2><p>  The nature of the deeds and the dignity of persons differed in the color of the wax.  Belonging to the sovereign, as well as to persons with special privileges, gave the right to print with red wax.  Usually in black wax, the patriarch of Constantinople printed his letters.  The azure or blue color was considered a privilege in the 16th and 17th centuries. </p><h2>  State press </h2><p>  The seals depicted emblems assigned to the owners, inscriptions in the form of rules, instructions, images of the owners' faces.  Symbols or emblems were especially diverse.  Special state presses were and are available in each state.  They are divided into three main types: small, medium and large.  Large ones were intended for the most important documents, mainly international treatises and legislative acts.  Small and medium ones were used for less important documents, as well as for letters of sovereigns.  For personal use of rulers in some states there are a special kind of private press (in particular, in the Netherlands and England).  For the most part, the keeper of the state press is the Ministry or Minister of Justice, as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (in Sweden, W√ºrttemberg, the Netherlands and Bavaria) and the State Ministry (in Prussia). </p><p>  The Pope of Rome has the <span>family coat of arms</span> .  It is attached to papal treatises and letters.  The State Secretary of the Pope also has a special seal.  The state seal in Switzerland is kept in the office of the Union Council. </p><h2>  The first Russian press </h2><p>  The first mention of seals in Russia is in the agreements of Svyatoslav and Igor with the Greeks.  From the document of 945 we learn that our ambassadors were supposed to use gold seals, and merchants (guests) - silver.  Vladimir in 1006 arranged free trade between Russian and Bulgarian merchants.  He provided both seals with special seals as a sign of princely permission.  They also served as an identification of the title of merchants. </p><h2>  Seal distribution in Russia </h2><p>  The right to have a seal at first belonged only to the <span>Grand Duke.</span>  However, with fragmentation into the destinies of Russia, it also spread to the specific princes.  The seals with the administrative development of our country have become the property of servicemen of various kinds.  Orders and cities also had them.  There were two types of princely seals: personal, private (seal rings) and state, official.  Following the example of the first, noble nobles began to start printing at home.  They were metal - silver, gold, lead and silver gilded;  wax (yellow, black, red and dark brown);  Waxy, which, due to their greater strength, replaced wax;  seals on tar or tar (very rare), as well as wax seals, which have come into use since the end of the 17th century.  On shoelaces of various colors - hemp, yarn and silk - metal prints were hung.  Others were applied, and for better safety, sometimes covered with a piece of paper.  Because of this, they began to be called seals under the Custodian. </p><h2>  Printed Images </h2>

    <p>  The most ancient princely seal that has come down to us is silver, gilded, on which on one side the face of Christ is depicted, and on the other - the striking serpent of the Archangel Michael.  This seal is attached to the letter of merit of Mstislav Vladimirovich (prince) and Vsevolod (his son).  It dates from 1125-1132.  In addition to the images mentioned, in the later seals of the princes there are <span>saints Nicholas,</span> Alexander, Simeon, John the Baptist and others, images of princes, various emblems, as well as an inscription that this is the seal of a prince.  A lot of antique samples were found among the seals of the XIV-XV centuries.  The science of sphragistics is still engaged in their research.  They, apparently, were exported from Byzantium.  These seals depict mythological subjects. </p><p>  The oldest of the city seals that have come down to us is Novgorod, dating back to 1426.  It was attached to the contract of letters of Novgorod with the Tver Prince Boris Alexandrovich.  It depicts an animal with a horse's head, legs and back of a lion, running with its tail raised.  A rope in the form of a bridle is visible between his neck and head.  On the back is an inscription that reads: "Novgorod seal."  Novgorod seals later depicted a panther or a tiger, a female figure sitting on a chair, a <span>two-headed eagle, a</span> bear, etc. </p><p>  The Pskov historically follows the Novgorod ones.  The oldest of them dates back to 1510.  It depicts a leopard running with its tail up, its tongue sticking out and its claws extended.  Around the seal is the inscription: "Seal of the Pskov statehood."  The cities of the press built in the 15th and 16th centuries received from the government.  It often supplemented and changed them.  Different seals were used until 1702, and after - mainly with a two-headed eagle. </p>
