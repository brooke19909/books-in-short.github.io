Word history for centuries</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the ancient Russian state is fraught with many strange and mysterious names and titles.  Faced with them in modern life, it is quite difficult to unravel the meaning of such names and toponyms.  One of the strange names that are found in ancient chronicles is the     ‚Äô‚Äô.  This word has changed its meaning several times over time, so you need to figure out what it meant, gradually. </p><h2>  Old Russian times </h2><p>  In the manuscripts of the 10th century, the word fireman appears for the first time.  In ancient Russia, this meant - the person in charge of the economy, the house of the prince.  Since the words "home" and "hearth" were almost synonymous, the manager of the yard and got its name, derived from the word "hearth".  <span>This position</span> was highly respected and honorable.  At first, it was elected, but later it began to be inherited.  About this is the fact that along with the concept of "ognischanin" began to be used the phrase "Tiuna ognischny".  And tyun is already a representative of the nobility.  He was in charge of the entire princely court, stables, barns and herds. </p><h2>  Characteristic of the Fireman </h2><p>  Ognishchanin is an educated person trained in literacy.  It was he who was responsible for collecting taxes and customs duties.  Naturally, such a person became respected and prosperous.  Therefore, there is such a definition of the word "fireman" - a knight who has many servants and slaves. </p><p>  "Russian Truth" since Yaroslav the Wise highly appreciates the life of a housekeeper.  For the murder of a fireman, those responsible for his death should have paid a fine of 80 UAH.  For comparison, the life of a free man was estimated at 40 UAH, the killers of stink or slave were paid 5 UAH fine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Novgorod freemen </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 12th century, in the Novgorod lands, the word "fire" meant not only "fire" and "house", but also transformed into a broader concept of "possession".  The owner of the land allotment also received the name "ogne≈°chanin".  The definition of this word in the Novgorod dialects is already different from the generally accepted one - after all, most of the lights of that time did not have a direct relationship with the prince's squad, but simply were prosperous landowners.  In the period of 12-13 centuries, an influential layer of citizens of Novgorod formed from the firemen who formed public opinion at the popular council and determined the policy of the <span>Novgorod Republic.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="a fireman in ancient Russia is" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/695871.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Last mention </h2><p>  By the 17-18 centuries, the word gradually lost its meaning.  In the letters of the 17th century it is found only in the lands of Northern Russia.  Ognishchanin is the headman of a small town or village, sometimes performing the duties of a lay judge.  After the 18th century, this word no longer occurs in either oral or <span>written language.</span> </p><h2>  Alternative Values </h2><p>  The generally accepted meaning of this word has often been disputed.  According to Mstislavsky, the fireman is a hero who came from the family of the most ancient Slavic princes.  This point of view is questioned by modern science, since the security and aristocracy of the lights was initially by no means hereditary.  As studies have shown, the first representatives of the tyuns of the Omsk fire were selected from ordinary combatants. </p><p>  The second meaning of the word is mentioned in the famous Veles book, about which many historians have broken feathers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fireman definition" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/695875.jpg" width="338"></div>  According to an unknown author of this publication, the firemen are pre-Christian pagans who worshiped fire.  But this statement is also controversial.  Fire was worshiped by all the primitive <span>Slavic tribes,</span> who had a similar pantheon of gods, and this did not give grounds for some tribes to deify fire more than others.  There is no historical evidence for this.  The story of the definition of    ‚Äôis impressive.  As mentioned above, the word was used until the beginning of the 18th century, when fire-worshipers were already firmly forgotten.
