    <p>  The price of rooms depends on such factors as the number of rooms booked at once, the availability of discounts and special offers from the hotel, the seasonal influx of tourists, as well as offers focused on holiday dates. </p><h2>  Standard Twin Room </h2><p>  Rooms of this category have an area of ‚Äã‚Äã25 to 30 m <sup>2</sup> and are located on the ground floor of the hotel.  The walls of the room have good sound insulation.  The furnishings of the standard rooms are quite simple: two beds 90 to 130 cm wide, a TV, a desk with drawers, 2 chairs, a mirror, a wardrobe or a wardrobe.  There is a private bathroom and toilet.  Complimentary toiletries, towels and bed linen are provided. </p><p>  The room is bright and spacious, all the furniture is walnut-colored, matched in style.  The guests choosing the ‚Äústandard‚Äù note almost the only drawback of the room - too high windows.  However, if your task is active leisure or business meetings, rather than spending time in four walls, then in other aspects the number is more than satisfactory. </p><h2>  Comfort Double or Twin Room </h2><p>  These rooms at the Hotel Park Krestovsky Hotel (St. Petersburg) are intended for non-smoking guests only.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãeach of them is 35 m2, there is good sound insulation and large windows.  At the guest‚Äôs request, the room can be equipped with one wide bed (from 151 to 180 cm) or two small beds.  The furniture also includes: TV, wardrobe, desk, chairs, bedside table.  The presence of carpet, mosquito net, shower in the bathroom, hair dryer, telephone distinguishes this category from the standard. </p><p>  The presence of several satellite and cable channels especially appealed to guests who booked "comfort", going to the "Hotel Park Krestovsky".  Positive reviews also touched on the internal design.  Customers note a cozy and relaxed atmosphere in a classic style, conducive to relaxation. </p>

    <h2>  Suite </h2><p>  Suites are medium in size rooms at the Hotel Park Krestovsky Hotel.  The description of the furniture includes a standard set for all types of rooms, in addition to which there is a sofa and a coffee table.  The main feature is the space with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã45 m2 delimited by the entrance, living room and bedroom.  Amenities include hair dryers, bathrobes, slippers, a telephone and a mosquito net.  Most often, newlyweds and non-smokers who prefer deluxe accommodation book a suite. </p><h2>  Spacious Family Room </h2><p>  This room category is suitable for companies of 4 people or families.  The block has two bedrooms, each of which is designed for two guests, a living room and a hall.  The general furniture of the room consists of a seating area, sofa, wardrobe, tables and nightstands.  At the request of the guests, two berths for children under the age of 14 can be additionally equipped.  The room is designed in a classic style, the interior tones are calm and unobtrusive, red-brown and green colors prevail. </p><p>  Guests note a beautiful view of the park from the window, a sufficient area of ‚Äã‚Äã75 m2, comparable to a two-room apartment, and the presence of two bathrooms - one for each bedroom.  The main disadvantage of this type of family rooms is the payment of an additional set of bed linen and towels for children. </p><h2>  Executive Family Room </h2><p>  Superior family rooms are the most expensive and spacious apartments in the entire Hotel Park Krestovsky Hotel.  The layout resembles an ordinary family room, but with a larger area - as much as 85 m2.  The rooms are located on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd floors of the hotel, furnished in a classic style, have two bathrooms, two toilets, from household appliances - 3 TVs and a refrigerator. </p><p>  Despite the maximum comfort, most customers speak of these apartments as rather cold - in the winter, the living room is poorly heated.  The rest of the executive rooms justify their price and category. </p><h2>  restaurants and bars </h2><p>  Catering for tourists in the hotel is organized in two ways: breakfast already included in the room reservation or meals for guests at their own expense.  However, the first option, according to guest reviews, is most preferable: 350 rubles for a morning buffet - the standard price for all rooms at the Park Hotel.  Krestovsky Island itself, by the way, does not abound in various cafes and eateries.  Therefore, breakfast without leaving the hotel, before a cultural trip to the historical places of St. Petersburg will be very convenient. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has several eating places: </p><p>  - Lobby bar; </p><p>  - restaurant "Krestovsky"; </p><p>  - restaurant "Elagin"; </p><p>  - summer terrace; </p><p>  - dining room. </p><h2>  Lobby bar </h2><p>  Hotel Park Krestovsky has its own <span>lobby bar.</span>  <span>This is a</span> stylish and bright room in brownish-orange tones.  The bar is perfect for treating yourself with a cup of coffee or tea, sitting with friends or family and discussing the impressions that have accumulated over the day.  On days of sporting events, matches are broadcasted here, the rest of the time you can just listen to music or watch the news.  The lobby bar is located on the ground floor, which is extremely convenient for those who are meeting or guests waiting for a taxi.  In the menu you can find not only hot and cold drinks, but also many desserts, as well as hot dishes for every taste. </p><h2>  Restaurant "Krestovsky" </h2><p>  For those who prefer dinner in a pleasant company and unobtrusive atmosphere, the restaurant "Krestovsky" welcomes open the doors on the second floor.  Up to 250 people are freely accommodated in the hall, which makes it possible to hold quite large-scale celebrations here.  White draperies, tablecloths and capes on chairs, coupled with sky-blue decoration and a large number of windows create a unique airy atmosphere and comfort.  It is also possible to arrange dance events, fashion shows or performances by artists - the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe restaurant hall fully satisfies this. </p><h2>  Restaurant "Elagin" </h2><p>  Restaurant "Elagin" is close to the lobby bar in terms of interior, but it has a slightly different status and is located on the second floor.  Here, guests of the hotel will be offered original cuisine, plenty of alcoholic, hot and cold drinks to choose from.  The restaurant is often rented for corporate events, anniversaries and weddings. </p><h2>  Summer terrace </h2><p>  The summer terrace is open exclusively in the warm season and is the pride of the Krestovsky Park Hotel (Peter).  It is located in an open space, has an original layout and a beautiful view of the Gulf of Finland.  Since no more than 50 people can be accommodated at tables, there is a certain feeling of a pleasant, friendly and unobtrusive atmosphere.  There, on the terrace, on summer evenings, a dance floor opens where you can have fun with friends and family. </p><h2>  Dining room </h2><p>  The dining room provides meals for groups of tourists.  The room at first glance seems compact, but it comfortably accommodates up to 100 guests.  The menu is standard, however, at the request or additional order, it can be expanded with vegetarian or dietary dishes during the guest's stay. </p><h2>  Conference rooms </h2><p>  In addition to the standard services for travelers, the Hotel Park Krestovsky Hotel in St. Petersburg is ready to provide its customers with several rooms designed for celebrations, banquets, conferences and business meetings. </p>

    <ol><li>  Congress Hall "Krestovsky" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã840 m2, the largest in the hotel.  Holds up to 450 visitors, has a separate entrance.  The hall is fully equipped with equipment that may be needed for speeches, presentations and meetings.  The main feature of the hall is the presence of a scene. </li><li>  Small meeting rooms.  There are 5 of them, from 65 to 120 m <sup>2</sup> .  Each room can accommodate no more than 80 people.  Ideal for negotiations and business meetings.  The presence in each room of video equipment allows for presentations. </li></ol><p>  If the company renting conference rooms does not have enough staff of its own, then for an additional fee the hotel is ready to provide its services in supporting events. </p><h2>  Hotel Park Krestovsky: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  On the positive side, the hotel guests noted primarily their location in a quiet green area and the ability to quickly reach most of St. Petersburg sights by public transport.  The second plus is the large area even of standard rooms.  Many also mention the friendly and executive staff and the large free parking. </p><p>  Negative reviews deserved monotonous breakfasts, a poor internet signal in some places of the hotel and the high cost of food in both restaurants.  It is not recommended to check into the hotel during city holiday or sporting events - room prices are skyrocketing, and waiters during the influx of tourists do not have time to cope with their duties.  Also, upon arrival, you should immediately examine the location of the smoking area, so that later you will not be surprised at the bill for the corresponding fine - here it is equal to the cost of the room in which you decided to raise. </p>
