  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A trip from Moscow to Kostroma</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Kostroma is visited annually by hundreds of thousands of tourists from Russia and abroad.  Transport links between this city and the capital are well established.  From Moscow to Kostroma can be reached by bus, car, train. </p><p>  270 thousand people live in this ancient Russian city.  Many buildings of the 18-19th centuries have been preserved here.  That is why filmmakers are so fond of Kostroma - about 20 films were shot in this city.  One of the last - the historical series "Blood Lady". </p><div class="photo" data-original="tonkosti.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://tonkosti.ru/__"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kostroma city" class="if uuid-2670307" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2670307.jpg"></div><p>  There is an airport in Kostroma.  But from there you can only get to St. Petersburg and Simferopol.  However, the distance between Kostroma and Moscow is relatively small - only 330 kilometers.  Consider the most popular routes. </p><h2>  By rail </h2><p>  From Yaroslavsky station, trains leave daily for Kostroma.  From Moscow trains do not go to this city. </p><p>  The train leaves at 11 pm.  Travel time is six hours.  You can get from Moscow to Kostroma by long-distance train.  In this case, the road will also take no more than six hours.  The fare from Moscow to Kostroma in a reserved seat car is 900 rubles.  In the compartment - 1600 rubles. </p><p>  Another option for the route by rail is with a change in Yaroslavl.  From Moscow, the train leaves three times a day.  From Yaroslavl - twice.  This option of overcoming the Moscow-Kostroma route will not seem convenient to everyone.  In Yaroslavl, the train will have to wait several hours.  But it‚Äôs not at all necessary to spend this time at the station.  You can stroll around Yaroslavl and visit local attractions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  By bus </h2><p>  Passengers from Yaroslavl and Kostroma transport companies from Moscow to Kostroma.  Buses depart every two hours from the Shchelkovo station or from the VDNH station.  Ticket price - from 1000 rubles.  The road will take five to six hours. </p><p>  Buses to Kostroma also go from the airports of Vnukovo, Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo.  Konechnaya - Susanina street, 54. Buses departing from the VDNH and Schelkovskaya stations go to the Kostroma bus station.  If you go from one of the Moscow airports, then the road will take at least seven hours.  Moreover, a ticket for such a bus costs more - 1400 rubles. </p><p>  You can, of course, get a taxi from Moscow to Kostroma.  But this method is not suitable for a practical person.  A taxi ride will cost about seven times more than a bus trip. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotobus.msk.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://fotobus.msk.ru/photo/1860407/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bus Moscow Kostroma" class="if uuid-2670309" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2670309.jpg"></div><h2>  By car </h2><p>  There are two options for traveling by car from Moscow to Kostroma: </p><ol><li>  Via Vladimir, Ivanovo, Volgorechensk. </li><li>  Via Pavlov Posad, Yaroslavl. </li></ol><p>  The second option is more convenient.  It is on this route that buses from the capital go.  The roads are in good condition.  However, many travelers prefer to go past Ivanovo and Vladimir.  Indeed, in these cities there are many interesting sights that can be visited along the way.  On the way, you can call in to Suzdal. </p><p>  In order to get to Kostroma, you need to go to the M-8.  The exit from MKAD is carried out in Mytishchi.  The Kholmogory route runs through cities such as Sergiev Posad, Rostov the Great, Pereslavl-Zalessky.  Before Yaroslavl you need to turn in the direction of Shchedrin, thereby go to the Kostroma highway. </p><p>  Without stops you can get in four hours.  But more often, of course, takes more to the road.  Along the way, there are many interesting sights that few travelers leave indifferent.  Shops, cafes, gas stations along the highway are also quite common. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.asninfo.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://m.asninfo.ru/news/61130-avtodorogu-kholmogory-pod-vologdoy-otremontiruyet-vad"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hills" class="if uuid-2670310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2670310.jpg"></div><h2>  Sights of Kostroma </h2><p>  Kostroma is located on the banks of the Volga.  This city has long become one of the largest Russian centers of excursion tourism.  One of the main attractions of Kostroma is the Fire Tower, built in the 19th century.  Many tourist routes also include Shopping arcades, Guardhouse, Borshchova House, Romanovsky Museum.  During a trip to Kostroma, you should definitely visit the local museum-reserve, founded in the 20th century. </p>
