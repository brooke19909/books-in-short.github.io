For many decades, the city has been developing and building, absorbing towns, villages, villages.  So the Church of St. Nicholas the Miracle Worker, which was built on the Rzhavitsa River, in the village of Nikolsky, back in 1756, ended up on the territory of the modern city as a result of its merger with the surrounding settlements. </p><p>  Initially, it was wooden.  However, like many churches of that time.  The owners of the village of Nikolsky were Buturlins, then <span>Prince Golitsyn,</span> who resold it to Prince Dolgoruky.  By 1827, the son of the prince was rebuilding a stone temple, where a priest, clerk and sexton began their service.  St. Nicholas Church was a favorite parish of the residents of Rzhavka, Matushkino, Nazarievo. </p><h2>  The history of the temple in Nikolsky passage </h2><p>  The population grew every year and by 1848 there were already more than 500 inhabitants.  In addition to the temple, an almshouse was arranged on the territory for those who needed treatment and a shelter.  And she was kept on money from the capital of A. N. Dolgorukov.  After some time, a zemstvo school was also built for children and residents of nearby villages. </p>

    <p>  After the revolution, many churches were closed.  They were robbed and destroyed.  Until 1938, services were still being conducted in the St. Nicholas Church, but still the authorities closed it and set up a warehouse.  In 1941, fierce battles were fought on the territory of the future complex and buildings were badly damaged.  The artillery fire spotter was located on the bell tower of the church, and the Germans spared no effort to destroy this point.  After the war, it was decided to completely remove the bell tower, blowing it up.  But, falling, she damaged nearby buildings, leaving only sad memories about herself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Recovery from severe devastation </h2><p>  But time does not stand still, and in the early 90s, a serious restoration of the building begins.  At that time there were still no rich people, as well as philanthropists.  Therefore, ordinary people raised money for the restoration of the temple, but the administration of the city of Zelenograd helped the newly-emerged parish.  Initially, the church had six chapels, the bell tower in three tiers was also a unique structure. </p>

    <p>  And by the beginning of the restoration, the side buildings and the lower tier remained from the bell tower.  The building itself was in a state of destruction.  Therefore, the ministers of the St. Nicholas Church in Zelenograd, as well as the parishioners, faced the difficult task of rebuilding the temple in the form in which it was before the revolution.  I had to start almost from scratch. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  The first services in the St. Nicholas Church in Zelenograd began back in 1988 and did not stop for a single day, even for the time of restoration and repair.  Since then, daily services have been held, morning liturgies, all-night vigils.  On certain days, Akathists read to St. Nicholas and the icon of the Mother of God "Inexhaustible Chalice" with a water-worship. </p>

    <p>  After restoration in the church, all six chapels were restored.  This is the name of the specially designated part of the temple, which houses an additional altar with thrones.  Such a complex structure allows for more than one liturgy per day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sunday School and Volunteers </h2><p>  Currently, St. Nicholas Church in Zelenograd is a complex, which includes the temple itself, the bell tower, Sunday school, library and nuns' cells.  It occupies a fairly vast territory and has been a local landmark for many years.  After all, this complex is more than 250 years old.  Even on the coat of arms and flag of the district of Savelka there is an image of St. Nicholas Church.  For Sunday, for 25 years now, everyone can study the law of God. </p>

    <p>  Most often these are adults who are interested in learning the basics of Orthodoxy, dogma, and rules.  After all, everyone comes to church in some way, sometimes very ornate, carrying faith and unbelief, doubts and thoughts.  Starting from the very first service, clergy and parishioners are actively involved in the care of all city social institutions, and above all, this is spiritual care.  Volunteers come to the aid of priests who are ready to help in reading prayers or just to clean an apartment for a sick person.  They help in holding Orthodox and secular holidays, and work in a rehabilitation center with children with disabilities. </p><h2>  Temples of Zelenograd administrative district </h2><p>  St. Nicholas Church is a part of Zelenograd deanery.  This is a district, part of the diocese, which unites several parishes.  Before the revolution, such districts were called forty Amy, hence the phrase ‚Äúforty forty‚Äù appeared, so many churches were in Moscow.  They united on a territorial basis.  Zelenograd deanery unites the temples located in the district.  This is the church of St. Nicholas of Myra, the church of St. Philaret, the church of St. Sergius of Radonezh, several chapels.  The city is developing and growing. </p><p>  Given the population‚Äôs need for services and liturgies, the construction of three more modular churches is planned for the near future in the district.  The construction of one of them, the church of Alexander Nevsky, is already close to completion. </p>
