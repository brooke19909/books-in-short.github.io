    <p>  When extending insurance, many drivers are faced with the fact that its cost is very high, and the discount, on the contrary, has decreased or completely disappeared.  The fact is that since 2014 all insurance information has been entered into a single database, when entered into which information may be indicated incorrectly.  As a result of this, when renewing <span>car insurance, the</span> final cost of the policy may be incorrectly calculated.  Moreover, the reason for this is not the intention of the insurer to deceive his client, but in the human factor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Discount size decreased: what is the reason? </h2><p>  If you want to save on insurance for your vehicle and are thinking about how to return money for KBM under CTP, then you first need to figure out why the size of the discount can be reduced.  This can occur for several reasons, which will be discussed later. </p><h2>  Change of type of insurance policy </h2><p>  As you use the insurance policy, each driver accumulates points, which he can then use for discounts.  However, when changing the insurance program, for example, when switching from a regular program to a policy with an unlimited validity period, these points can be reset.  How to return KBM for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in this case?  This is entirely possible only if a new insurance policy is issued for the same vehicle by one owner.  Otherwise, the accumulated points are burned out, and you can not count on any discount. </p><h2>  Approval to drive multiple vehicles </h2><p>  If the driver, due to his activity, has the right to drive different cars at the same time, and he is indicated in several insurance policies, the insurer may not take into account points when extending insurance.  How to return money under the CBM OSAGO policy in this case?  Almost nothing.  The thing is that the insurance company, when calculating the cost of the policy, takes into account the number of points from the driver who has fewer points.  This is prescribed in the contract, therefore, the right to overstate the coefficient is completely legal and is reserved by the insurance company. </p><h2>  Accident or accident insurance </h2>

Do not be afraid to contact the insurer or file complaints with the relevant state institutions, as they exist in order to protect the rights of citizens.  Do not rush to fill out a policy at the first insurance company.  Due to the fact that today there is huge competition between insurers, each of them is fighting for its customers, offering the most favorable conditions. </p>
