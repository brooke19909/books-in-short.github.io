The commission will be 1.6% of the total payment.  Funds will be credited, most likely, instantly. </li><li>  Network "Euroset".  Her commission will be fifty rubles when paid up to five thousand or one percent over the specified amount.  To deposit funds, you need to go to the store manager, and then name the passport data with the contract number, as well as your mobile phone.  As part of the re-payment to Euroset, all the data no longer needs to be reported; identification will be carried out by phone number.  Where else to pay a loan at the Post Bank? </li><li>  The Golden Crown also provides the possibility of money transfers.  The procedure is absolutely identical and similar to how it happens in the Euroset. </li><li>  Western Union also provides similar services to customers. </li></ul><p>  In all situations, it is imperative that you have with you a passport with an account number, and preferably an existing agreement with the bank. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, Mail Bank customers are quite satisfied with the services this financial institution provides.
