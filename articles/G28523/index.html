    <p>  When going to Israel in April, it should be remembered that most often this month falls on the main Christian holiday - Easter.  So you need to understand that this month is the busiest in the country.  There are a lot of tourists from different parts of the world.  The Orthodox and Catholics are in a hurry to kneel at the Holy Sepulcher, to see the Holy Fire, to attend the procession.  Therefore, people who are far from religion, it is advisable to choose another time to visit Jerusalem. </p><h2>  What you must see </h2><p>  Many tourists, except sacred places, try to visit Tel Aviv - the largest Israeli city, next to which is the ancient city of the world - Jaffa. </p>

It doesn’t matter what month you came to rest, in April or in some other month, swimming in the azure sea or diving with a mask is unlikely to succeed, but you can always enjoy the sights.  The water in the reservoirs is relatively clean, entering the sea almost everywhere requires special shoes, diving is not interesting, almost no one lives here.  The beaches on the coast are municipal, but each hotel has its own plot with sunbeds and chairs, there are no toilets and locker rooms, and if there are, then you can use them for a fee. </p><p>  As for food, prices are always overpriced.  There are few catering places, and many people advise taking trips to Israel with meals.  The only thing that can be distinguished is the presence of natural juices everywhere. </p><p>  There are also few shops in Israel; shopping lovers have nothing to do here. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of mothers having a rest in Israel with children, everything is fine and convenient here: you can ride with a stroller, everywhere there are highchairs for children, products for caring for babies can be found in all stores, there are a lot of sandy beaches, which is also plus. </p><p>  But those tourists who came to this country for impressions are always satisfied with the trip.  According to them, there are surprisingly interesting excursions, many sacred places, incredibly friendly people. </p>
