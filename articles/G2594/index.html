Crab Gorge!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The village of Lazarevskoye is a very popular holiday destination in the Krasnodar Territory.  In this resort, in addition to swimming in the <span>Black Sea</span> and sunbathing on the beaches, there is an additional option: walking along the gorges.  From different sides of the village, canyons lead deep into the mountains.  Everyone has heard the Mamedovo <span>Gorge,</span> Svirskoe <span>,</span> Krabovoe.  About the latter will be our story.  This natural attraction is located in the north-eastern part of the village of Lazarevskoye.  The crab gorge, the photo of which is already causing a desire to visit it, is an enchanting corner of Colchis nature.  It is part of Sochi National Park.  The name of this gorge is not accidental.  In the stream, which flows along the bottom of the canyon, freshwater crabs of the Iberian potamone species live.  These animals are evidence of the ecological compatibility of the area.  After all, they can live only in very clean water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lazarevsky crab gorge" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1666486.jpg" width="532"></div>

    <h2>  For whom is a walk along the Crab Gorge </h2><p>  They do not carry excursions here.  But this natural attraction is worth visiting for everyone who is relaxing in the village of Lazarevskoye.  Crab Gorge - a route only one and a half kilometers in one direction.  There are two paths to choose from.  One is a fairly even primer, without large rises.  It is suitable for people with an unsportsmanlike build, the elderly, children.  It is almost impossible to get off this road.  The second path is along a shady forest path.  It is marked with red paint.  This path is of higher complexity.  The trail crosses a dirt road several times, but mostly goes up and down through the forest, sometimes crossing a river.  But the views from it are amazing.  Reviews of tourists recommend that all visitors, without exception, choose this trail.  Let slowly, slowly, but walk along it from beginning to end, making a lot of colorful photos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lazarevsky crab gorge address" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1666508.jpg" width="600"></div>

So you can plan an independent tour for two to three hours.  But to start a fascinating walk along the canyon, along the peacefully murmuring river with waterfalls and cascades, you should get to the end of Kalarash street.  Do not rejoice if you stumble upon it near the promenade.  This street is unusually long and leads through all of Lazarevskoye.  The crab gorge, whose address is not exactly registered (Kalarash street, without a number), starts at the checkout.  Yes, entrance to the canyon is paid - one hundred rubles from an adult.  In order not to bother going through the territory of Lazarevsky, you can take the bus number 68 to the stop "ABZH".  If you go from the center of the town, then the path to the end of Kalarash street will take forty minutes.  But even from a stop to the ticket office you have to walk about five hundred meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lazarevsky crab gorge how to get" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1666490.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lazarevskoe, Crab Gorge: how to get to the ticket office </h2><p>  Having left at the ‚ÄúABZh‚Äù stop, you should head to the Marka store.  Near it stands a pointer to the Crab Gorge.  First you need to go between the fences of private houses.  But after a couple of minutes you will get out to the barrier.  Next to it is another pointer.  The road further goes through the forest.  It is flat, well marked with red marks on trees and stones.  If you accidentally did not find a barrier, then you can ask the residents of the village of Lazarevskoye for directions.  The crab gorge (how to get to the beginning of the trail, we have already explained) starts from the river.  It may be dry in the hot summer season.  We cross the channel by pebbles and continue to follow the road.  It leads through a beautiful forest and finally leads to a platform equipped with picnic tables, a souvenir shop and a ticket office hut. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Canyon geology </h2><p>  Seventy million years ago, when there was still no mention of the village of Lazarevskoye, the Crab Gorge was the bottom of the sea.  The remains of mollusks settled on it, the crushed shells of which formed limestone layers.  Then this territory rose above sea level.  A small but persistent mountain rivulet did a titanic job.  She dug a deep and narrow canyon with her waters.  She washed in the soft rocks baths, where you can swim, and grottoes.  And the shores of the gorge sometimes close so tightly that you feel as if you are in a narrow corridor, where the sky turns blue above.  The steep cliffs cover the streaking formations.  The stones seem to cry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lazarevsky crab gorge how to reach" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1666492.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Walking along the Crab Gorge </h2><p>  Actually, the canyon begins even before the ticket office.  But behind the entrance everything is much more interesting.  Immediately after the ticket office there is a descent from the main trail.  He will lead you to the Mermaid Font.  We have already mentioned that the river washed in the mildest rocks of the ‚Äúbathtub‚Äù.  In such fonts it is good to swim in the summer day.  But in dry years, the river is very shallow, which makes the Mermaid Font more like a puddle.  Do not be discouraged, there will still be natural baths ahead.  The next descent from the trail will lead to the font of Adam.  Next you need to cross the bridge.  He is all hung with ribbons, which tie vacationers in the village of Lazarevskoye.  The crab gorge in its depths harbors the Bridge of Desires.  But the first crossing across the river, despite the ribbons, does not fulfill dreams.  In order to make a wish come true, you need to work hard and move on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lazarevskoe crab gorge photo" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1666501.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  Karst Grotto and other attractions </h2><p>  Having passed the first crossing over the river, we soon leave on the Desire Bridge.  It is a real place of pilgrimage for tourists who relax in the resort of Lazarevskoye.  The crab gorge in this place almost closes its arches.  If you stand on the bridge and look down, focusing on your desire, it will invariably come true.  Further the road forks.  The right path leads to Karst Grotto, and the left - to another font.  The crab canyon ends in a dead end.  You can go all the way back along the same path.  But if you climb a steep staircase, then you will get out onto a dirt road.  Turning left, you will make the return journey along the lightened route. </p>
