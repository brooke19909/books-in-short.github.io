Nanotechnology in the modern world</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  More recently, a new field has appeared in science and technology, which has been called nanotechnology.  The prospects for this discipline are not just vast.  They are grandiose.  A particle called "nano" is a value equal to one billionth of a value.  Such sizes can only be compared with the sizes of atoms and molecules.  For example, one billionth of a meter is called a nanometer. </p><h2>  The main direction of a new field of science </h2><p>  Nanotechnologies are those that manipulate matter at the level of molecules and atoms.  In this regard, this area of ‚Äã‚Äãscience is also called molecular technology.  What was the impetus for its development?  Nanotechnology in the modern world appeared thanks to a lecture by <span>Richard Feynman.</span>  In it, the scientist proved that there are no obstacles to creating things directly from atoms. </p><p>  A tool for efficiently manipulating the smallest particles was called an assembler.  This is a molecular nanomachine, with which you can build any structure.  For example, a ribosome synthesizing a protein in living organisms can be called a natural assembler. </p>

    <p>  The discovery of graphene is considered a real revolutionary event, which will allow a lot to change in our lives.  This material has such unique physical properties that it fundamentally changes a person's idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nature of things and substances. </p><h2>  Discovery story </h2><p>  Graphene is a two-dimensional crystal.  Its structure is a hexagonal lattice consisting of carbon atoms.  Theoretical studies of graphene began long before obtaining its real samples, since this material is the basis for constructing a three-dimensional graphite crystal. </p>

Volles pointed out some properties of graphene, proving that its structure is similar to metals, and some characteristics are similar to those possessed by ultrarelativistic particles, neutrinos, and massless photons.  However, the new material has certain significant differences that make it unique in nature.  But confirmation of these conclusions was received only in 2004, when carbon in the free state was first obtained by Konstantin Novoselov and <span>Andrei Game</span> .  This new substance, which was called graphene, was a major discovery by scientists.  You can find this element in a pencil.  Its graphite rod consists of many layers of graphene.  How does a pencil leave a mark on paper?  The fact is that, despite the strength of the layers making up the core, very weak bonds exist between them.  They break up very easily when they come in contact with paper, leaving a mark on writing.

But only when a material with such amazing properties leaves the walls of laboratories, it will become clear in which direction the development of practical application of this substance will go.  Today <span>, chemists,</span> physicists, as well as electronic engineers are already interested in the unique capabilities of graphene.  After all, just a few grams of this substance can cover an area equal to a football field. </p><p>  Graphene and its applications are potentially considered in the production of lightweight satellites and aircraft.  In this area, a new material is able to replace <span>carbon fibers</span> in <span>composite materials.</span>  Nanosubstance can be used instead of silicon in transistors, and its introduction into plastic will give it electrical conductivity. </p><p>  Graphene and its application are also considered in the manufacture of sensors.  These devices, made on the basis of the latest material, will be able to detect the most dangerous molecules.  But the use of powder from nanosubstance in the production of electric batteries will significantly increase their efficiency. </p><p>  Graphene and its application are considered in optoelectronics.  The new material will make a very light and durable plastic, the containers of which will allow to keep food fresh for several weeks. </p><p>  The use of graphene is also expected for the manufacture of a transparent conductive coating, which is necessary for monitors, solar panels and more robust and resistant to mechanical stresses of wind engines. </p><p>  Based on nanomaterials, the best sports equipment, medical implants and supercapacitors will be obtained. </p><p>  Also graphene and its use are relevant for: </p><p>  - high-frequency high-power electronic devices; <br>  - artificial membranes separating two liquids in the tank; <br>  - improving the conductivity of various materials; <br>  - creating a display on organic LEDs; <br>  - mastering a new technique of accelerated DNA sequencing; <br>  - improvements to liquid crystal displays; <br>  - creating ballistic transistors. </p><h2>  Automotive use </h2><p>  According to researchers, the specific energy consumption of graphene approaches 65 kW * h / kg.  This indicator is 47 times higher than that of the currently widely used lithium-ion batteries.  Scientists used this fact to create new generation chargers. </p><p>  A graphene-polymer battery is a device with which electrical energy is most effectively retained.  Currently, work on it is being conducted by researchers in many countries.  Significant success was achieved in this matter by Spanish scientists.  The graphene-polymer battery created by them has an energy consumption that is hundreds of times higher than that of existing batteries.  Use it to equip electric vehicles.  A machine in which a <span>graphene battery</span> is installed can travel thousands of kilometers without stopping.  It will take no more than 8 minutes to recharge an electric vehicle when energy is exhausted. </p><h2>  Touch screens </h2><p>  Scientists continue to research graphene, while creating new and unparalleled things.  So, carbon nanomaterial has found its application in the production of large-screen touch displays.  In the future, a flexible device of this type may appear. </p>

    <h2>  Graphene production </h2><p>  Since 2004, when the latest nanomaterial was discovered, scientists have mastered a number of methods for its preparation.  However, the most basic of them are considered ways: </p><p>  - mechanical exfoliation; <br>  - epitaxial growth in a vacuum; <br>  - chemical perophase cooling (CVD process). </p><p>  The first of these three methods is the simplest.  The production of graphene during mechanical exfoliation is the application of special graphite on the adhesive surface of an insulating tape.  After that, the base, like a sheet of paper, begin to bend and unbend, separating the desired material.  When applying this method, graphene is obtained of the highest quality.  However, such actions are not suitable for the mass production of this nanomaterial. </p><p>  When using the epitaxial growth method, thin silicon wafers are used, the surface layer of which is silicon carbide.  Further, this material is heated at a very high temperature (up to 1000 K).  As a result of a chemical reaction, silicon atoms are separated from carbon atoms, the first of which evaporate.  As a result, pure graphene remains on the plate.  The disadvantage of this method is the need to use very high temperatures at which the combustion of carbon atoms can occur. </p><p>  The most reliable and easiest method used for mass production of graphene is the CVD process.  It is a method in which a chemical reaction occurs between a metal coating catalyst and hydrocarbon gases. </p><h2>  Where is graphene made? </h2><p>  Today, the largest company manufacturing new nanomaterials is located in China.  The name of this manufacturer is Ningbo Morsh Technology.  He began production of graphene in 2012. </p><p>  The main consumer of nanomaterial is Chongqing Morsh Technology.  It uses graphene to produce conductive transparencies that are inserted into touch displays. </p>

This element, which is so necessary for optical devices, contains several layers of graphene.  Such material used on camera sensors significantly increases their photosensitivity (up to 1000 times).  At the same time, there is a decrease in electricity consumption.  A good camera for a smartphone will also contain graphene.

    <h2>  Getting at home </h2><p>  Can graphene be made at home?  It turns out yes!  You just need to take a kitchen blender with a power of at least 400 watts, and follow the technique developed by Irish physicists. </p><p>  How to make graphene at home?  To do this, pour 500 ml of water into the blender bowl, adding 10-25 milliliters of any detergent and 20-50 grams of crushed lead to the liquid.  Next, the device should work from 10 minutes to half an hour, until a suspension of graphene flakes appears.  The resulting material will have high conductivity, which will allow its use in photocell electrodes.  Graphene, also produced under domestic conditions, can improve the properties of plastic. </p><h2>  Nanomaterial oxides </h2><p>  Scientists are actively exploring such a structure of graphene, which inside or along the edges of the carbon network has attached oxygen-containing functional groups or (and) molecules.  This is the oxide of the hardest nanomaterial, which is the first two-dimensional material to reach the stage of commercial production.  Scientists made centimeter samples from nano- and microparticles of this structure. </p>

    <p>  So, graphene oxide in combination with diophilized carbon was recently obtained by Chinese scientists.  This is a very light material, a centimeter cube of which is held on the petals of a small flower.  But at the same time, the new substance in which graphene oxide is located is one of the hardest in the world. </p><h2>  Biomedical application </h2><p>  Graphene oxide has a unique selectivity property.  This will allow this substance to find biomedical applications.  So, thanks to the work of scientists, it became possible to use graphene oxide for the diagnosis of cancer.  To detect a malignant tumor in the early stages of its development allows the unique optical and electrical properties of the nanomaterial. </p><p>  Graphene oxide also allows targeted delivery of drugs and diagnostics.  Based on this material, sorption biosensors are created that indicate DNA molecules. </p><h2>  Industrial application </h2><p>  Various sorbents based on graphene oxide can be used for the decontamination of infected technogenic and natural objects.  In addition, this nanomaterial is able to process underground and surface waters, as well as soils, having cleared them of radionuclides. </p><p>  Filters from graphene oxides can provide ultra-clean rooms where special-purpose electronic components are manufactured.  The unique properties of this material will allow you to penetrate into the delicate technology of the chemical sphere.  In particular, this may be the extraction of radioactive, dispersed and rare metals.  Thus, the use of graphene oxide will allow the extraction of gold from poor ores. </p>
