One of the most important criteria for such an assessment is material wealth.  If a person wants to feel happier and get the widest possible opportunities for the realization of a personality, then you need to draw up the most thorough plan that meets your personal request, how to become more successful and richer.

    <h2>  Motivation </h2><p>  In this case, it is impossible to give an unambiguous answer or a fully developed scenario for moving towards the intended goal, so for a start it is worth thinking about your own priorities, the environment, and indeed ... what and how?  To become richer is a feasible goal, but for what?  Wealth itself does not create a happy life.  Joy and peace of mind brings what can be achieved with capital.  Thus, stable material wealth and superprofits create only the basis for moving further.  But where?  This is a question. </p><h2>  Personal goals </h2><p>  For those who decide how to become richer, it may be important to get the opportunity to travel a lot, to convey their thoughts, words or deeds to others, igniting them with their own ideas.  For some, this means brilliant education, providing relatives and other, no less optimistic aspirations.  And the most important thing is getting freedom in defining your goals, the ability to act without limiting your needs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How did the rich get rich?" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/435540.jpg" width="512"></div>

For example, Steve Jobs <span>(the executive director</span> and one of the founders of Apple Inc) was so bored with his studies at the University of California that he decided to work in a small radio-engineering company with great pleasure.  Later, having entered and studied for only one semester at Portland College, he went ‚Äúnowhere‚Äù, not seeing the point of spending significant parental savings on his studies, with which he did not associate life plans.  His subsequent life at first did not spoil, forcing even to hand over bottles from under the cola to acquire food and the most necessary.  He attended the Hare Krishna temple, in which he could have the opportunity to receive free food.  However, despite the lack of ambition and far-reaching plans, his enthusiasm for his own idea and concentration on his favorite pastime helped him achieve the heights he desired. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to become richer and happier ..." class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/434262.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The unknowable secrets of the rich </h2><p>  How did the rich get rich?  Many of today's oligarchs were forced to change oil at gas stations (David Medlock - $ 2.5 billion), fix used TVs and sell them (Andrew Beale - $ 4.5 billion), and even collect nuts in the surrounding forests (Charles Swab - $ 4.7 billion).  Denis Washington, Patrick McGovern, Sheldon Edelson and T. Boone Pickens, who have earned billions, began their careers from the very bottom of the information empires, newspaper peddlers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And take a closer look at the life of your inner circle: rather wealthy people most often become those who once, to put it mildly, did not shine with school successes and did not lead an exemplary life.  Therefore, it is not necessary to talk about a primitive understanding of the ways to achieve wealth, and to answer the question of how to become richer and happier, you can only thoroughly understand your own needs.  However, this is precisely what is most often covered in mystery, especially at the beginning of a <span>life's journey.</span> </p><h2>  How to become richer (statistical wealth analysis) </h2>

Rockefeller,</span> if you constantly think only about making money, then significant wealth cannot be achieved.  Yes, and a feeling of happiness will constantly slip away.  Analyzing the income structure of the largest US taxpayers, taken from the statistics of the Tax Department, we can say that maximum profits are derived from capital gains (about 46% of total income).  And only a small part of the welfare of the oligarchs increases due to wages.  Thus, choosing priorities and determining how to become rich, you should not invest in work for someone.  This can solve pressing problems, but does not lead to monetary abundance.  In practice, it has been proven that prudent investment is able to increase capital to a greater extent in order to invest it again.

    <h2>  How to become rich not for wages? </h2><p>  Apparently, the maximum attention should be paid to investing in fairly new and non-trivial directions of development.  It should be understood that their relative insecurity has not yet led to an influx of competitors.  In addition, large companies are an option already worked out by others.  It is much more difficult to develop a large-scale, clumsy colossus, because, having ‚Äúunwound‚Äù, such a company has a decreasing potential.  Investing in your own and other projects with a gold mine is the best investment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to become rich and famous?" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/434264.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  Developing beginning </h2><p>  On the way to financial well-being, it is very important not to think about how to become rich and famous, but to strive for continuous development.  It is the stubborn progress towards the intended goal without paying attention to the ridicule of others that distinguishes the most prominent representatives of the oligarchic world.  Obtaining high-quality education is also seen as extremely important, even if this does not take place in a completely traditional way.  Thorough knowledge of the most specific issues of their own business gives an undoubted head start to a potential candidate for financial power. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to become richer" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/434331.jpg" width="553"></div>

    <h2>  The power of faith and the ability to rejoice </h2><p>  Belief in one's own strengths and the success of the started enterprise helps radically change the attitude of colleagues and competitors.  At the same time, one of the main components in resolving the issue of how to become rich and smart is the ability to properly organize relaxation and enjoy the most basic things.  Sincere love for the family, as well as regular care for health, his own and those around him, make a person happy and successful. </p><p>  Observance of the laws of decency and justice sets up peace of mind and complete order in thoughts.  It is in this state that it is easiest to assess the adequacy of the chosen goals and the shortest ways to achieve them. </p><h2>  Passion </h2><p>  The simplest and least costly method to promote the latest business idea is its extreme passion.  This is to some extent capable of zombifying others and competitors, creating a favorable environment for development.  An exalted and extraordinary way of thinking at first may be somewhat frightening, but it will not leave you indifferent.  The diverse interest of as many potential followers and competitors as possible creates a specific atmosphere and emotional mood for a positive result.  Our rapidly changing world increasingly provides an opportunity to fulfill bold dreams, bordering on fantastic euphoria.  Delusional ideas, backed by enthusiastic confidence and knowledge, help future oligarchs not to think about <span>how to become more successful</span> and richer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to become a rich man?" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/434281.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The habit of not being lazy </h2><p>  Daily planning and following a well-established schedule do not leave <span>successful people</span> time to think about laziness.  Their lifestyle and deep-rooted habits do not leave room for a sluggish idleness.  They do not have to make any special efforts to achieve the goal, because they consider this mode of operation to be the most natural.  In thinking about how to become rich, each person solves the problems of internal routine and mental structure in his own way.  But the less free time is left for oneself to ‚Äúempty‚Äù inaction, the more it will be spent on the full perception of the surrounding world and interaction with it.  This means that a person will be given more chances for his efforts to be rewarded (often financially). </p><p>  In conclusion, we recommend that you do not focus on how to become richer, but try to live your own life, each day of which is given to you.  And it depends only on you how high-quality it will be and how many material goods are necessary for its full sensation.  God give you so much money so that you do not feel their significance and stop making petty calculations, because it is then that you can feel happy. </p>
