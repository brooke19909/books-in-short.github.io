What is it, the principle of operation, characteristics, advantages and disadvantages</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today it‚Äôs hard to imagine cleaning an apartment without the participation of such equipment as a vacuum cleaner.  Without it, all the dust scatters in all directions.  To clean the room as high quality as the presented household assistant would do, it will take a huge amount of time and effort.  Therefore, it is simply indispensable in the household. </p><p>  Today, there are many varieties of this technique.  The cyclone type of vacuum cleaner is very popular.  This species does not possess a bag.  Instead, the vacuum cleaner has a plastic flask.  The principle of its work, as well as advantages and disadvantages should be considered before buying in detail. </p><h2>  History of invention </h2><p>  Until recently, all vacuum cleaners included a bag for collecting garbage.  However, in the late 1970s, the British engineer D. Dyson offered the world a completely different design.  The engineer was not happy with how quickly the bags of the vacuum cleaners get clogged, and their suction power drops.  Not finding a suitable option among the cleaners existing at that time, he developed his own copy of the equipment. </p><p>  It was a new type of vacuum cleaner - a cyclone.  Dyson took the principle of air purifiers as the basis of his invention.  In them, the flow swirls inside in a spiral, increasing speed in the narrowing area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe collection.  For 15 years, the engineer created 5127 prototypes of a modern vacuum cleaner.  Only in 1986, the Japanese company Apex Inc.  took up the production of one of the Dyson models.  He was given the name G-Force. </p>

    <p>  In 1993, the engineer opened his research center, where he continued to improve his technology.  Here he managed to create a device that could even collect fine dust.  The Dyson vacuum cleaner, the price of which is still kept at a rather high level, is one of the best options for this technique. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Almost every modern company in this industry uses similar technology.  But each of them has its own unique engineering solutions, improvements. </p><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  The type of vacuum cleaner we are considering - the cyclone - has a special technology for collecting garbage.  Two plastic flasks are installed in the device case.  The air that enters them moves in a spiral thanks to the special shape of the inner container.  As a result, speed is increasing. </p><p>  In this case, <span>centrifugal force</span> pushes dust to the edge of the bulb.  There she is held.  Also, a similar technique has filters.  They delay various pollution.  One filter is for small particles, and the second is for large ones. </p>

    <p>  Thanks to this approach, 97% of all dust is retained.  Many modern devices retain this principle.  But the quality of cleaning depends on the design features.  Each manufacturer modifies some special details. </p><h2>  Filter system </h2><p>  Even inexpensive vacuum cleaners of the presented variety have a filter system.  Without them, technology would not be successful and efficient.  The most popular today are HEPA filters.  This is an English abbreviation.  It is translated into Russian (in the adaptive version) as a high-efficiency filter for air pollution particles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  This standard was developed by the United States Atomic Energy Commission.  <span>HEPA filters</span> are widely used in medical, laboratory facilities and other rooms where it is required to ensure high air purity. </p><p>  Most often, dust collectors for vacuum cleaners of the presented variety are equipped with a class H12 system.  It is capable of retaining particles of 0.3 microns in size.  Their cost is relatively high.  It is also almost impossible to restore them.  The HEPA filter is replaced once a year. </p><h2>  Power </h2><p>  To choose the best cyclone vacuum cleaner, you need to familiarize yourself with all the parameters of the device.  They are selected depending on the cleaning conditions and personal preferences of the owners. </p><p>  An important characteristic of a vacuum cleaner is its power.  The higher it is, the better cleaning quality can be achieved in the end.  In cyclone species, the power is quite high.  <span>The air flow</span> in them overcomes less resistance than in devices with a bag. </p><p>  Do not confuse this indicator with power consumption.  The dust suction power must not exceed 350 watts.  Otherwise, the appliance will harm the flooring of the house.  The <span>power consumption of the vacuum cleaner</span> must be weighed against the wiring capabilities.  For old communications, do not buy a device with a power of 3 kW. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Vacuum cleaner parameters </h2><p>  When choosing a cyclone type of vacuum cleaner, you should pay attention to its design.  The convenience of its operation will depend on this.  Initially, you should evaluate the capacity that dust collectors have for vacuum cleaners.  If the apartment or house has a large area, you should choose models with a large container.  A small one-room apartment will be quite enough a small dust bag. </p>

    <p>  The handle of the vacuum cleaner must be telescopic.  It will be so convenient to adjust its height.  It is better if the power adjustment and off button is located on it.  Additional nozzles will allow you to clean even inaccessible places. </p><p>  Cyclone species are usually not very heavy.  This makes them comfortable.  Nevertheless, it is better to pay attention to this parameter before buying.  If you move it hard, it is better to give preference to special lightweight options. </p><p>  Even the design of a vacuum cleaner is important to some.  However, this indicator should be considered last.  The main thing is that it is convenient and effective. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  A modern cyclone vacuum cleaner, reviews of which are presented in various sources, is very popular due to its unique qualities.  The main advantage is almost perfect cleanliness.  In the process of filling the container, air does not have to overcome the layer of debris.  Therefore, the suction power drops slightly.  Only when the filters are dirty will a slight decrease be observed.  Stable operation of the engine is a guarantee of its long service life. </p>

    <p>  The unit is easy to maintain.  It does not need to be shaken out while breathing dust rising into the air.  Gently pour the contents into the trash.  It is not necessary to wash the container after each cleaning.  Sometimes it is necessary to clean the filters.  Their replacement is not often done (depending on the model of the vacuum cleaner). </p><p>  Also, a solid container allows you to quickly find an item that got by mistake inside.  No need to rethink the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãdust.  Reasonable cost and ease of use elevate cyclone vacuum cleaners to the rank of popular technology. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Units of the presented type have their advantages.  Cons of a cyclone vacuum cleaner should also be considered before buying.  They are associated with design features, so they cannot be eliminated yet. </p><p>  The main disadvantage is the lack of efficiency in the process of collecting hair, wool or thread.  In some models, due to the accumulation of static electricity, the case may slightly shock.  This is not dangerous, but rather unpleasant. </p><p>  Inability to collect garbage at low capacities.  A vacuum cleaner of this variety needs a stable powerful flow.  Also, the sound at work is quite loud. </p><p>  In some models, the flask is made of inexpensive plastic.  Therefore, particles of contaminants, getting inside, can scratch it. </p><h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  Cyclonic vacuum cleaners, which can be rated according to user reviews, should be considered in three aspects.  Regarding the price, cheap vacuum cleaners (cost from 2 to 5 thousand rubles), the mid-price segment (from 6 to 12 thousand rubles) and expensive varieties of equipment (reach 45 thousand rubles) are distinguished. </p><p>  Among the cheap varieties, a <span>vertical vacuum cleaner</span> Kitfort KT-509, Daewoo RCC-153, Scarlett SC-VC80C03 should be highlighted.  These models have anti-allergenic HEPA filters. </p><p>  If you want to choose a really high-quality variety of equipment, you should give preference to the middle and high-price segment. </p><h2>  Rating of average cost of vacuum cleaners </h2><p>  Choosing a decent model of the presented equipment, you should consider the rating of the average cost segment.  Among the many options, the Samsung cyclone vacuum cleaner (model SC8471), Bosch (model BSG 62085) and Panasonic (model MC-E8035) stand out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Cyclone Vacuum Cleaner" class="if" height="213" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1335381.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  The first unit is well-equipped.  The kit includes several brushes designed for the standard cleaning mode (carpet / floor), for hard-to-reach spots and upholstery, as well as a device for collecting wool from carpets.  You can adjust the power on the handle.  The suction power is quite large (360 W).  He has a small container volume. </p><p>  Comfortable when cleaning is the Bosch model.  It is convenient to transport and store.  The suction power is 400 watts.  Also has an insufficiently large container.  Therefore, it is applicable only in small apartments. </p><p>  The leader of this group is the Panasonic vacuum cleaner.  It has the most proper container design.  This prevents quick filter contamination.  With small dimensions, the volume of the dust bag is large. </p><h2>  High price segment </h2><p>  Among all the expensive varieties of the presented technology, the Dyson vacuum cleaner, whose price reaches 45 thousand rubles, invariably holds the palm of leadership.  However, this device is worth it.  Its service life, thanks to thoughtful details, is longer than any other unit.  The filter system requires a change every 5-7 years. </p>

    <p>  The warranty period of this vacuum cleaner is 5 years.  For other companies, this period does not exceed 1-2 years.  The quality of cleaning with a vacuum cleaner of this brand is equated to professional.  No other manufacturer can still provide such a degree of purification. </p><p>  According to customer reviews, Dyson products cope with any severe pollution (hair, threads).  Cleaning with such a vacuum cleaner is really high quality. </p><h2>  Some recommendations </h2><p>  Choosing both expensive and inexpensive vacuum cleaners, you should pay attention to the rules of their operation.  They are indicated by any manufacturer in the instructions.  These appliances are designed exclusively for dry cleaning. </p><p>  The container should be washed after each cleaning.  This will minimize dust entering the filters.  You should also use a vacuum cleaner for its intended purpose.  This will extend the life of the equipment. </p><p>  Which type of vacuum cleaner to choose - cyclone or classic, is up to you.  However, after analyzing the reviews, we can conclude that the "cyclone" is an excellent helper in everyday life.  Having correctly chosen a variety, there is no doubt that the cleaning of the premises will be carried out easily and efficiently. </p>
