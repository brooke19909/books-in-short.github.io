How is he interesting? </p><h2>  Dniester River </h2><p>  It is impossible to start a story about this natural formation without mentioning the reason for its formation.  For the Dniester Canyon, the Dniester River, which flows through the territory of Ukraine and Moldova, turned out to be such a reason.  The river originates in the Ukrainian Carpathians, near the village of Volchye Turkovskoye.  Dniester begins its journey on Mount Chentyevka, at an altitude of 900 meters.  Stretching 1352 kilometers in length, the river flows into the Black Sea through the Dniester estuary. </p><p>  The river feeds on snows and rains, has a mountainous character with a fairly rapid course.  According to one version, its name comes from the phrase "rapid water."  During the rainy season, the Dniester is very overflowing, which often leads to severe flooding. </p>

    <p>  In <span>Ukraine, the river</span> flows next to such popular tourist sites as the Bakota rock monastery or the <span>Khotyn Fortress.</span>  At the intersection of three Ukrainian regions is the Dniester reservoir.  On the picturesque banks of the river in the western part of the country is the Dniester Canyon National Natural Park, and in the Odessa region is the Dniester Plavni Park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Moldova, the Dniester stretches for 660 kilometers in length.  The state border separating Ukraine and Moldova, as well as the border between Moldova and the unrecognized Republic of Transnistria, passes along the river.  On the Moldavian coast of the Dniester is the Soroca Fortress, in the city of Dubossary there is a reservoir and the Yagorlyk Nature Reserve. </p><h2>  Dniester canyon </h2><p>  The Dniester canyon is located on Ukrainian territory, passes through the Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopol, Khmelnitsky and Chernivtsi regions of the country.  The canyon is one of the largest in Europe, its length is more than 250 kilometers. </p><p>  The Dniester canyon was formed due to the special geological structure of the area, which for centuries was influenced by water flows and winds.  Here are rocks of various origins that store the remains of flora and fauna that existed 400 million years ago. </p><p>  The territory from the Zolotaya Lipa River to Zbruch is included in the Dniester Canyon landscape reserve.  It occupies the Zalishchytsky, Buchachsky, Boshchevsky and Monastic districts of the Ternopil region.  Here the width of the river does not exceed 200 meters.  Water makes its way along a canyon-like valley between Podolsk Tovtra, forming natural landscapes of incredible beauty. </p>

    <p>  A warm, pleasant climate has formed in the canyon, which differs significantly from a typical western Ukrainian one.  High rocky walls prevent winds from entering here and retain solar heat.  The animal and plant worlds are represented by a huge variety, but are poorly studied due to the rugged terrain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Natural attractions </h2><p>  Dniester Canyon is a unique natural formation.  Within its limits on the river there are various passes and rapids formed by crystalline rocks of gneiss, granite and blueite, which abundantly surface here. </p><p>  Along the territory of the canyon there are many waterfalls and mountain streams that fall directly into the river.  It is here that the largest plain waterfall is located - Dzhurinsky, which reaches 16 meters in height. </p><p>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe villages Trubchin, Ustechko, Vistri are high steep cliffs, whose age is more than 400 million years.  The rocks are Silurian and Devonian sediments.  These places are often visited by climbers and research scientists. </p>

    <p>  Within the conservation area, birch, hornbeam and oak forests grow.  More than 100 plant species are endemic and relict species.  Forest, water and steppe biocenoses combine in the Dniester canyon, which creates excellent conditions for the development and preservation of a wide variety of wildlife. </p><h2>  Historical and architectural monuments </h2><p>  The river valley was inhabited in ancient times by people.  On the territory of the Gorodenkovsky district is one of the oldest sites.  It belongs to the Early Paleolithic; the age of the site is about 300 thousand years.  Traces of <span>Trypillian culture</span> were found in 26 settlements within the canyon <span>.</span> </p><p>  Dniester Canyon is full of grottoes and caves.  Some of them served as housing for ascetic monks.  Bakotsky rock monastery is one of the most famous, it appeared around the XI-XII centuries. </p><p>  Among the <span>historical monuments</span> located in the villages near the canyon are churches, castle and palace ruins, ancient fortresses.  The most popular attractions are the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin, the Church of St. Michael, the remains of the fortress in the village of Okopy, the church of the XVIII century in the village of Korolets. </p><p>  Not far from Dzhurinsky waterfall are the ruins of the old mill and Chervonogorodsky castle.  It is located in the middle of a huge hollow.  Initially, the castle was built of wood in the XIII, but in the XVII century it was rebuilt from stone.  The slopes of the hollow are bright red due to the high content of iron oxides in the soil, hence the name of the castle. </p>
