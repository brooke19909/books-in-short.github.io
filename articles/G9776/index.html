    <h2>  Crystal manufacturing </h2><p>  Akim Maltsov was forced to abandon the expansion of production in the suburbs due to the ban on deforestation.  For the construction of new plants, the Vladimir region, or rather, the vicinity of the settlement, which today we know as Gus-Khrustalny, was ideally suited.  The sights of the modern city help to understand that Maltsov‚Äôs idea was a success, because the most important sightseeing objects are the current Crystal Plant and the Crystal Museum.  Production quickly gained momentum, new enterprises were built, and diamond cutting technologies were mastered.  In 1835, Ivan Maltsov (the grandson of the founder) acquired the secrets of <span>bohemian glass</span> making in Europe <span>.</span>  At this time, products from Goose were already known in many foreign countries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Goose-crystal: crystal plant </h2>

    <p>  This company operates today, and its products are in high demand.  The secret to success is simple - a combination of advanced technology and the work of excellent artists.  The products of this plant are very easy to notice in the total mass, the crystal is of high quality, and the products themselves are very beautiful.  The product range is regularly updated; today, the creative laboratory at the enterprise continues to function and monitor fashion.  Over the years, the company received a variety of awards, including international ones, thanks to which Gus-Khrustalny is known all over the world.  Sights of this scale I want to see inside and out.  It is really possible to visit the factory and see all the stages of crystal production.  Group tours are carried out, it is necessary to coordinate the possibility and time of the visit personally with the administration. </p>

    <h2>  Crystal Museum </h2><p>  If you have visited Gus-Khrustalny, sightseeing is a museum and a crystal plant.  A collection of production samples from different periods is located in the building of St. George's Cathedral, which is an architectural monument.  The presented exhibits allow you to clearly see how the technology has evolved.  Here you can see early specimens, which are loose glass with engraving, and modern art objects.  The cathedral was built in 1895.  Unfortunately, the bell tower was not preserved, but even without it the construction makes an impressive impression.  The temple was famous thanks to the rich interior decoration.  The famous <span>artist Vasnetsov</span> put his hand to him <span>,</span> today two of his works are preserved.  Today, the church urges the return of the cathedral to its possessions.  The problem is that there is no alternative room at the crystal museum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Orthodox objects </h2><p>  The main active city church is known as the Holy Trinity.  It was built in 1816, originally consecrated as the church of Joachim and Anna.  In 1940, the temple was closed and converted into workshops.  He suffered during the war.  In 1898, a major overhaul was carried out, and after the consecration, the doors of the church were again open for parishioners.  Another active object is the chapel of <span>Barbara the Great Martyr, the</span> building has a rather interesting architecture.  Opposite the St. George Cathedral is located no less interesting structure.  This is the so-called almshouse, which today houses the city hall.  Initially, the building was built as a shelter for the elderly artisans who did not have relatives.  In different years, there was a house for the disabled and various medical facilities.  If you visit the crystal museum in Gus-Khrustalny, be sure to pay attention to this interesting building. </p><h2>  Museum of History and Art </h2>

    <p>  The history of this city is inextricably linked with the history of the development of crystal production.  If you want to learn more about how a settlement was formed in this area and how the Maltz dynasty developed its business, be sure to visit the Museum of History and Art.  Among the exhibits there are many unique household items and documents of different periods.  The building itself on Kalinin Street, in which the museum is located, deserves attention.  Various temporary exhibitions and meetings with artists are held here, because, despite its provincial status, a very cultural city is Gus-Khrustalny.  The sights, photos of which are in any guidebook, are a monument to Akim Maltsov and restored residential buildings of the nineteenth century.  If possible, you should find the time to visit them. </p><h2>  Other attractions in Goose-crystal </h2><p>  It makes sense to start a walk around the city with Freedom Square.  Here is a shopping mall building, typical in its architecture for the Vladimir region.  Today, its facade is regularly restored; small shops and offices are located inside.  Nearby is the city promenade, well-equipped for hiking.  It is especially beautiful in the warm season due to the riot of greenery, flowering flower beds and working fountains. </p>
