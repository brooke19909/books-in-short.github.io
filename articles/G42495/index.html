  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Batteries for the camera: overview, description and types, specifications, selection tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is no secret that the productivity of the photographer depends not only on the quality of the equipment, but also on its <span>uninterrupted power.</span>  Actually, everything is simple - there is no charge, no pictures.  Therefore, before leaving for the next photo shoot, it is clearly not out of place to check your professional baggage for the presence of batteries for the camera. </p><p>  Moreover, modern, as well as advanced, technology is very demanding on batteries.  Here, the smooth operation of the flash must be ensured, and the normal brightness of the screen, and the work of the "filling".  So the choice of batteries for the camera must be approached very carefully.  Moreover, today's market offers a lot of options, as they say, for every taste and color. </p><p>  So, let's try to figure out which batteries for the camera are best suited to what to pay special attention in the first place and how not to miscalculate with the purchase.  Consider the main characteristics of batteries and what they are remarkable for when it comes to the field of photography. </p><h2>  Difficulty choosing </h2><p>  To begin with, we will conduct a short educational program on the types and types of batteries for the camera.  On sale you can find two types of such batteries, and they differ from each other very significantly.  The first are simple and disposable batteries for the camera.  That is, there is no question of any recharging of batteries.  They are directly from the store shelf ready to work and at times cheaper than their more productive counterparts. </p><h2>  Batteries </h2><p>  The batteries for the camera are designed for many recharging cycles.  Despite its high cost, such batteries are more practical in terms of not only efficiency, but also payback.  After purchase, they usually need charging, after which they can be used as ordinary batteries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Non-standard batteries (branded) </h2><p>  There are also specific and non-standard batteries.  They are equipped with proprietary equipment, it is almost impossible to find an alternative to them.  For example, a good half of Sony cameras have a built-in battery and only changes due to normal wear and tear or damage.  So here you can not even think about replacing the batteries. </p><h2>  Types of batteries </h2><p>  Simple and rechargeable batteries also differ in form factor.  Manufacturers of photographic equipment are not particularly smart and settled on two types of food - AA and AAA.  In common people ‚Äúfinger-type‚Äù and ‚Äúlittle finger‚Äù, respectively.  There are still very tiny AAAA and 9-volt massive "Krona", but they are very, very rare in photographic equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="piotomar.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="types of batteries" class="if uuid-2611665" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2611665.jpg"></div><p>  Beginners in this business and the owners of the ‚Äúsoap boxes‚Äù have enough ordinary batteries, and buying batteries is simply impractical.  Those who are professionally engaged in photography and have serious gadgets in their arsenal need stable, powerful and capacious batteries.  These qualities just offer batteries.  Of course, a sensible battery for a Canon or Nikon camera will cost a tidy amount, but their return is corresponding. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Chemical composition </h2><p>  Batteries may also vary in chemical composition.  A little earlier varieties of the chemical "filling" were a dime a dozen, but until today only four have survived, which can boast of an acceptable return for modern technology. </p><h2>  Ni-cd </h2><p>  Nickel-cadmium batteries are the most common batteries.  They are relatively inexpensive, well resistant to subzero temperatures and have consistently high charging currents.  This option also begins to slowly become obsolete, because the cons sometimes outweigh the pros. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nickel cadmium battery" class="if uuid-2611667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2611667.jpg"></div><p>  As a fly in the ointment, the toxicity of the elements and a decrease in capacity with each recharging are here.  In addition, such batteries must be charged only after complete depletion.  Otherwise, the operational period of the elements will be significantly reduced. </p><h2>  Ni-MH </h2><p>  Nickel-metal hydride batteries can be called an improved version of nickel-cadmium.  They retained all the advantages of the previous generation and practically got rid of its shortcomings.  Regular recharges here now have a lesser effect on the operating life, and the toxicity of the batteries has been reduced. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.indiamart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nickel metal hydride battery" class="if uuid-2611664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2611664.jpg"></div><p>  As for the operation, the efficiency of such batteries has doubled, and the voltage is stably maintained and does not change even with a minimum charge.  It is also worth noting that nickel-metal hydride batteries can have significantly higher capacities than conventional nickel-cadmium batteries. </p><h2>  Li-ion </h2><p>  Lithium-ion batteries are completely devoid of the effect of a decrease in capacity when recharging, they are light in weight and high in density.  The main advantages of batteries of this type are the lowest self-discharge and fast recharge.  In addition, the battery offers high discharge voltage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lithium ion battery" class="if uuid-2611669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2611669.jpg"></div><p>  Lithium-ion batteries are good in many ways, but they have their own, especially for the photographer working in the field, critical shortcomings.  Here we are talking about high sensitivity to the environment: low, as well as high, temperatures extremely adversely affect the condition and effectiveness of the battery. </p><p>  In addition, batteries of this kind do not tolerate full charge and glut.  That is, you can‚Äôt leave them for the night.  It is also worth noting that the cost of lithium-ion batteries is significantly higher than the same Ni-MH. </p><h2>  Li-Pol </h2><p>  <span>Lithium polymer batteries</span> are a more advanced version of lithium-ion.  They have a 20% higher charge density and are noticeably better resistant to ambient temperature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.batteryjunction.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lithium polymer battery" class="if uuid-2611666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2611666.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, the only drawback of lithium-polymer batteries is the high risk of fire during a charge oversaturation or overheating.  So on a hot sunny day it is better to leave them discharged at home. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  Professional photographers and experts in this field consider nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) <span>batteries</span> to be the <span>best batteries</span> for the camera.  They are as versatile as possible, are much cheaper than lithium-ion and polymer, and also have sufficient capacity to service almost any serious photographic equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sellsbd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best camera batteries" class="if uuid-2611670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2611670.jpg"></div><p>  As for manufacturers, here the situation is more or less clear.  The same pros and experts recommend paying attention to proven and well-established brands, as well as the series.  Beginners can sometimes offer quite worthy and inexpensive options, but you have to sort through them with great care. </p><p>  Among other venerable manufacturers, we can recommend the Sanyo brand, which, as they say, ate the dog in this matter.  The Eneloop XX series turned out to be the most successful, and you can without hesitation choose any model you like from this line.  Also, many warm words are said by professionals about Panasonic products, where almost every series has a high-quality set of models.  Well, do not forget about the fakes that have flooded the domestic market, and buy batteries only in trusted offline and online stores. </p>
