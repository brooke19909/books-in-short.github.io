True, then give him your soul for dinner, but it's worth it.  At least in the "Dark Butler" everything looks exactly like that.  But once everything comes to an end, even anime and manga tend to end.  But who said you have to put up with this?  Fan art, or doujinshi about the "Dark Butler" will help to re-breathe life into your favorite story. </p><h2>  Explain to us, sensei </h2><p>  For those who have not yet encountered the concepts of "manga", "doujinshi" or "The Dark Butler", but know what an anime is, we will explain everything in detail.  So, we started.  Manga is a Japanese comic book.  It is distinguished from the western one by its deep plot and features of drawing.  It began to develop after the Second World War, although it appeared in early Japanese art.  In 97% of cases, all animes are based on comics.  That the author‚Äôs work was filmed, he must observe two conditions: </p><ol><li>  Be popular. </li><li>  Release at least 5-7 volumes of manga. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="festy.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dark butler doujinshi" class="if uuid-2567883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45861/2567883.jpg"></div><p>  "The Dark Butler" is an anime in the genres of mysticism and detective story.  The plot is outrageously simple and indecently interesting: a fire occurred in the estate of Count Phantomhive, only the son of Count Ciel was saved.  To avenge the death of his parents, he makes a deal with the devil.  In exchange for his soul, he promises to help him achieve retribution.  So, the teenager had his own personal demon butler Sebastian. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But even such exciting adventures come to an end.  To stay with their favorite characters for a little while, fans begin to draw doujinshi.  These are independent publications, in a specific case, manga, which are drawn based on the existing plot. </p><h2>  Spread </h2><p>  Simply put, in Japan, this term means works that the author creates and distributes independently.  Since copyright laws in the Land of the Rising Sun allow you to create works on the basis of already published ones, it is not surprising that there are so many doujinshi about the ‚ÄúDark Butler‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="matome.naver.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="manga doujinshi dark butler" class="if uuid-2567882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45861/2567882.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that other countries do not stand aside either.  Even domestic fans of the "Dark Butler" with the doujinshi are not only familiar, but also take an active part in their creation. </p><h2>  What to read? </h2><p>  Currently, there are more than a hundred author manga in Russian translation for this fandom.  True, the main part of the doujinshi on the "Dark Butler" in the yaoi genre.  Yaoi is a genre in which relations between men (and not only romantic) are represented.  For example, ‚ÄúSweetness or prank‚Äù, ‚ÄúCheshire‚Äù, ‚ÄúBathroom‚Äù, ‚ÄúScarlet Moon‚Äù, etc. There, mainly stories are told about Sebastian and Ciel.  But there are other stories, for example, comic stories ("Rainbow Butler"), mystical thrillers ("Sorry") or romantic short stories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.square-enix.co.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dark Butler Yaoi Doujinshi" class="if uuid-2567884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45861/2567884.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, doujinshi differ in quality from the original work both in the drawing and in the plot.  Usually they are created by amateurs who need to supplement the story with their experiences.  But worthy specimens are not so rare. </p><p>  The story does not end with the last series or the last volume of the manga.  She continues her narrative at the doujinshi, and The Dark Butler is another confirmation of this.  Here the storyline can continue or take a completely unexpected turn.  Perhaps the author uses only heroes, but will create his own universe for them, or maybe a new character will appear.  There are many options, but one thing is certain - the story will never end. </p>
