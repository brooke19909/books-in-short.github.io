This is the city that is the capital of Greece.  Famous for its ancient history and glorious past.  It attracts tourists with famous monuments of architecture, myths and legends, as well as unusual culture. </p><h2>  Where is the city of Athens? </h2><p>  Where is this amazing place located?  The city of Athens is located in the southeast of Greece, or rather, in the coastal prefecture of Attica.  On three sides it is surrounded by mountains: </p><ul><li>  Pendels </li><li>  Parnita; </li><li>  Egaleo. </li></ul><p>  It is washed by the waters of the Aegean Sea.  Throughout the year, the capital is warmed by the rays of the Balkan sun.  The ancient city of Athens has a very unusual and complex terrain.  It was formed from twelve hills and many plains. </p><h2>  History of Athens </h2><p>  They are interested in many as the archaeological and cultural center of antiquity.  Beautiful Athens ... Which city in the world can boast such a significant contribution to the culture of mankind like this?  According to historical facts, the city was named after the goddess Athena, who was famous for her wisdom and military strategy. </p><p>  One legend says that a dispute arose between Athena and the god of the sea Poseidon.  They both wanted to rule the ancient city.  To resolve this issue, the judgment of the gods took place.  At it, a decision was made, which was that the ruler would be the one who would bring the city the most valuable gift.  Poseidon hit with his trident, due to which a source of sea water appeared in the rock.  When the goddess struck with a spear, an olive tree sprouted from the ground.  The court decided that the victory must be given to her.  And so the famous city of ancient Greece - Athens - appeared. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It was in this city that democracy was born.  World-famous sages and philosophers were born here, while others came here to get an education.  Answering the question of what Athens is, we can safely say that this is an open-air temple created by the greatest geniuses.  Even today, you can look at the remains of architectural masterpieces.  Various amphitheaters, sacred temples, beautiful mountains and mysterious caves still surprise tourists.  The archaeological site that gave us the Acropolis and not only also cause a sense of admiration for those who came to look at them. </p><p>  There is no other place like Greece and the city of Athens that would have a huge impact on the history of civilization.  It was here that such great philosophers were born as: </p><ul><li>  Socrates; </li><li>  Aeschylus; </li><li>  Plato; </li><li>  Euripides; </li><li>  Sophocles. </li></ul><p>  This is one of the oldest cities, because in the 1st millennium BC.  e.  he was the most influential of all in the state.  During this period, the heyday of Greek civilization falls.  The "Golden Age of Greece" lasted throughout the V-IV century BC.  e.  The city was the main cultural and scientific center of the Western worlds.  It was thanks to him that Western civilization further developed.  The best poets, artists, scientists, philosophers, playwrights and sculptors lived in Athens. </p><p>  The <span>Greek city of</span> Athens was founded in antiquity.  In 490 BC  e., when there was a Greek-Persian war, 40 km from Athens, the famous Marathon battle took place.  The inhabitants of the city, together with the payers, defeated the Persian army, despite the fact that it was superior in number, and this happened under the leadership of Miltiad. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, ten years later, Athens was faced with the attack of Xerxes I, as a result of which the sanctuary on the Acropolis was destroyed.  In 480 BC  e.  there was a battle at Salamis, after which on September 20, the Persian fleet was destroyed by Themistocles, and his ruler had to flee. </p><p>  In 431 BC  e.  war again came to Greece.  Athens and Sparta are the cities between which the confrontation began.  Due to the fact that the city suffered from the plague, he failed to win.  As a result, the ramparts were completely destroyed.  Even in our time, remains of city fortifications are still found, especially on the bank of Piraeus. </p><p>  After these events, the city began to flourish again and was the center of education and science, but this continued until the late Roman period. </p><p>  In 86 B.C.  e there was another seizure of the city.  The army under the command of Sulla arranged a siege for Athens for many months, after which the soldiers robbed the city for three days.  Sulla wanted to completely destroy it, but he was visited by a delegation of the Athenians who reminded him of how great this city was in the past.  The ruler listened to them and changed his mind. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the Byzantine Empire adopted Christianity, in 529 AD  e.  The famous philosophical schools of the city were closed.  As a result, the cultural center, which has been such for thousands of years, has lost its value and gradually turned into a provincial town. </p><p>  At the 11th-12th centuries, the rebirth of the city of Athens falls.  The capital acquired many new Byzantine temples, and this period was called the Golden Age in the development of the art of the empire.  At this time, the city was enriched by trade, as was Corinth with Thebes.  Over time, Athens became the main center for the manufacture of soaps and paints. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Later, the best knights of Italy, Byzantium, and France fought for the rule of the city from the 13th to the 15th centuries.  Then the power over Athens passed to the Ottoman Empire, which was then led by Sultan Mahmed the Second Conqueror.  It happened in 1458.  The Sultan was very impressed by the beauty and grandeur of ancient architecture, so he forbade anyone to touch the ruins.  And the Parthenon became the main mosque of Athens. </p><p>  The Ottoman Empire began to weaken at the end of the 17th century.  The population has declined significantly, and the quality of life has become much worse.  Because of this, the Turkish government was not so patronized by ancient buildings, and the Parthenon served as a warehouse for weapons.  During the Venetian siege of the city, the temple was badly damaged, as a shell hit it.  The powder kegs that were stored in it exploded. </p><p>  When Athens was proclaimed the capital of Greece, their population was 5,000 inhabitants.  It happened on September 18, 1883. It was from this day that the city of Athens - the capital of the Greek kingdom.  In the next decade, it gradually turned into a modern town. </p><p>  The year 1896 was remembered in history as the year of the First Summer Olympic Games.  Then in the 1920s there was another rapid growth of the city.  At that time, many new neighborhoods were built that were intended for Greek refugees.  As a result of World War II, the capital was occupied, so for some time there was a shortage of food. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  What is Athens?

Here you should look at the <span>Temple of Hephaestus,</span> which is very well preserved, as well as the Attal Gallery. </p><h2>  Acropolis Museum </h2><p>  Attention should be paid to the history of the construction of this structure.  One of the reasons it was decided to build the museum was because Greece had long wanted to regain artifacts.  The latter were stored in the British Museum, and got there due to the fact that they were taken out of the country by Lord Elgin. </p><p>  The British did not want to return the artifacts, explaining this by the fact that in Greece there is no special building that can provide decent conditions for the preservation of valuable things.  Therefore, the Greeks built a museum that corresponded to all modern technologies, but failed to return the lost. </p><p>  However, despite this, the museum has something to see, so it is worth a visit.  In addition, the building has a very interesting design, which seems to soar in the air.  This was done so as not to harm the ancient artifacts that are under it. </p><h2>  Temple of Hephaestus </h2><p> One of the most popular tourist attractions in Athens, the photo of which is below.  It is located on the northwest side of the Agora.  For centuries, the temple was similar to the Orthodox Church.  Over time, it was recognized as a national historical monument, inside which a museum was equipped.  In the last century, the building was returned to its original form. </p><p>  This temple managed to survive best of all.  It is built of durable marble.  Previously, historians as well as archaeologists were convinced that the temple was erected in honor of Theseus.  This is due to the fact that on the walls of the building there are his images.  However, later, statues of Athena and Hephaestus were discovered inside the attraction, so experts abandoned previous statements. </p><p>  Near the temple there is a souvenir shop in which tourists can buy an interesting and unusual thing that reminds them of the grandeur of this place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple of Hephaestus." class="if uuid-3020382" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3020382.jpg"></div><h2>  Constitution Square </h2><p>  Syntagma is the tourist center of Athens.  Also called Constitution Square.  This place will not pass by any tourist, because it is located in the very center of the city. </p><p>  The square has its own attraction - a monument to the unknown soldier, which was erected in 1932, when the country celebrated Independence Day. </p><p>  The favorite entertainment of tourists is to watch the change of the guard of the National Guard guards who are dressed in military uniforms.  The guard changes every hour, so be sure to look at this colorful performance. </p><h2>  Stay recommendations </h2><p>  In order to see all the attractions that were planned, as well as spend the rest calmly and without problems, you need to familiarize yourself with some recommendations for a stay in Greece: </p><ol><li>  Check the opening hours of city exhibitions and museums in advance.  After all, the schedule of their work can change, and on some holidays they can be closed at all. </li><li>  When crossing the street, be very careful, as local drivers are not very familiar with the rules of the road. </li><li>  Here is the most expensive taxi in all of Greece.  If the driver can not tell you the exact amount of the trip, while asking for more than 30 euros, then it is better to refuse it. </li><li>  This is a very calm city, where you can walk even at a later time and not be afraid that something bad will happen.  There are many round-the-clock establishments that you must visit to enjoy the nightly Athens. </li><li>  Any attendants must be rewarded for the services that were provided to you.  In cafeterias and restaurants, tips are approximately 10-15%. </li><li>  In this city, smokers can be completely calm, as smoking is allowed everywhere.  Finding prohibition signs is almost impossible. </li><li>  In city pharmacies, you will not only be advised, but they will also measure your blood pressure for free. </li><li>  Most of the beaches here are state-owned.  But pay attention to the fact that if there are umbrellas and deck chairs on the coastal zone, then most likely you need to pay for equipment rental. </li><li>  Women should abandon lonely walks in remote areas of Athens.  It is recommended to do this, accompanied by any. </li></ol><p>  Now you know what Athens is.  An amazing city whose history is admirable.  Ancient sights reminiscent of its majesty and significance, you will certainly enjoy.  If you like to travel, then be sure to visit here to feel the spirit of antiquity and admire the best creations of great people. </p>
