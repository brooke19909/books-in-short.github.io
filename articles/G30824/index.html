On its territory of 56,700 ha there is a specially protected area.  And this is no accident.  After all, the presidential residence ‚ÄúRus‚Äù is located there.  The national park includes 90 settlements, as well as a scientific and experimental farm.  Just 150 kilometers from it is Moscow.  Zavidovo is a village in the Tver region, but the park is also located in the <span>Moscow region.</span>  In general, the complex occupies 5 administrative districts.  But not in vain it is called Zavidovo.  The Tver region occupies a large part of it - 54%, while the Moscow region - only 46%.  Its plain territory includes several rivers, including the Yauza, Lama, Shosh and others. </p>

    <h2>  For people and not only </h2><p>  In 1929, a hunting farm was located here, in 1972 it was a nature conservation complex, which in 1972 was transformed by the decree of B. Yeltsin into Zavidovo National Park, which is a state complex that includes Rus, and since 1996 it has been given the status the residence of the President of the Russian Federation.  The residence includes a hotel complex, swimming pools, boat stations, farm buildings, a hunting reserve, whose services were used by E. Honecker, U. Kekkonen, L.I. Brezhnev.  For Leonid Ilyich, a luxuriously finished two-story cottage was built in the village of Kozlovo.  The Secretary General was very fond of hunting and receiving guests, so the hotel was additionally rebuilt for 12 rooms with a cinema hall and billiards.  In order to have the opportunity to present fresh meat, sausages, fish, ham, smoked meats to the members, candidates and secretaries of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU, the production in Kozlovo was equipped, where the game was received.  Also, the territory of the national park served as a gathering place for mushrooms, berries and honey.  Currently, it serves as a meeting place for statesmen and leaders of different countries.  The President holds various negotiations on his territory, as well as resting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Care for wildlife </h2><p>  This does not interfere with the main goal of creating the park - environmental protection.  Its fauna and flora are protected.  The local forests are home to a large number of valuable animals.  This elk and hare, fox and wild boar, weasel, lynx, ermine, as well as a brown bear and roe deer.  Beavers, a raccoon dog, deer and sika deer were specially introduced.  There are many birds on the territory.  Among them, capercaillie, partridge, hazel grouse, black grouse.  The Upper Volga lowland, on which the Zavidovo National Park is located, has many ponds, wetlands, lakes, so there are <span>waterfowl</span> here <span>:</span> crested black, wide-nosed, crackler, googol, mallard and teal, as well as a featherworm and <span>red-headed duck.</span>  Rivers are rich in fish.  They include rudd, ide, common carp and bream, bream and pike perch, tench, asp, as well as burbot and pike.  Animals periodically move to neighboring forestries, and then come back. </p>

    <h2>  On four sides </h2><p>  Symbolically, Zavidovo National Park is divided into four parts: southern, northern, western and eastern.  The southern part is located between <span>the Lama River</span> and the right tributaries of the Yauza and Little Sisters, the floodplain of which is overgrown with viburnum.  The forests here are mostly pine, but also mixed.  The northern part is a wasteland, swamps and fields.  Forests are mixed or deciduous, although spruces grow along the banks of the Ivankovo ‚Äã‚Äãreservoir.  This is a reserve in which police are involved.  Thus, the large swamp Wingar turned into pastures and hayfields.  In the Shoshinsky reach in this part of the park you can see 15 islands - these are villages that were flooded during the construction of the Ivankovo ‚Äã‚Äãreservoir.  A large amount of peat was mined in the central part of the park; therefore, in the <span>Mokhovoe</span> and Chisty Moss <span>swamps</span> , quarries and cultivated sites can now be observed.  Forests in the core of the reserve are young birch and old spruce-pine.  There are streams, swamps and lakes.  The western part is a forest area of ‚Äã‚Äã22 hectares.  It is represented by pine trees and swamps. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Join the beautiful </h2><p>  Those who wish to relax in an ecologically clean place can visit Zavidovo, a complex located near the village of Shoshi on the banks of the Volga.  This picturesque place is often chosen for holidays, holidays or weekends by residents of the capital of our country.  But of course there is no direct road Moscow - Zavidovo.  Those traveling by their cars must travel 125 kilometers to get to the Konakovsky district of the Tver region, where the complex is located.  The regional center of Konakovo is located only 25 kilometers from it.  Zavidovo is a complex that occupies a vast territory of 56 hectares.  It houses buildings with rooms and cottages for guests. </p>

Even adults will be interested in visiting this place.  A farm is a living area where people interact with animals that can be touched and fed.  Among the pets there are rabbits and goats, ferret and parrots, ponies and rams, as well as aquarium fish and a turtle.  In the complex, children are treated with special care.  After all, parents bring them here so that they can rest, gain strength, talk to nature and break away from the monitor screens.  In "Zavidovo" for this all conditions are created.  The nature there is so beautiful that the children will not want to go into the room, but will spend all their free time in games in the fresh air. </p>

The house-museum was damaged during the Great Patriotic War, but was restored, as well as the collection presented in it.  The museum is visited by connoisseurs of creativity Drozhzhina and lovers of poetry in general.
