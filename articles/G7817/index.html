Is this concept left in the past or has survived to this day?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The amazing history of the word "curia" can be traced for many centuries.  It has long become international and visited the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof various nations and states.  Oddly enough, in Russia the concept of ‚Äúcuria‚Äù was familiar to people and was actively used.  We learn from this article how this word arose, what it has denoted for many centuries and whether it is used now. </p><h2>  Ancient Rome </h2><p>  In the era of the formation of Roman civilization, tribes were united on a territorial and national basis.  Initially, there were three tribes - Ramna, Titius and Lucius.  Under these names, three branches of the Roman people were formed: the Romans themselves, the Sabines and the Etruscans.  Each tribe had its own unique association, called the "curia".  It was a kind of union where only adult men were allowed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="curia is" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/700673.jpg" width="553"></div>  It is possible that in these associations, which were called chicken comitia, initiation rites were carried out during which young men became men and defenders of a kind.  The head of the curia was the kurion - the chosen representative of the tribe, who was vested with priestly functions.  The place where the rites were held was also called the "curia".

In the days of the empire, the curiae degenerated into city councils, which had the functions of local governments. </p><h2>  Curia in the Middle Ages </h2><p>  In the <span>Middle Ages,</span> people borrowed many achievements from the famous ancient Romans.  The concept of "curia" has also passed into this era.  This word was used to designate large landowners - feudal lords with their king.  The feudal curia gradually became a royal council (Curia Regis).  The functions of such councils are not strictly indicated; the royal curiae convened irregularly to resolve certain issues.  With the increase in absolutism, the royal curia degenerates into a narrow circle of close associates of the king, and judicial and financial issues remain under the jurisdiction of individual state institutions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="selective curiae" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/700674.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Selective curia </h2><p>  In European <span>suffrage</span> , the word "curia" usually refers to a class whose members had the right to participate in elections to <span>the</span> country's <span>governing bodies</span> .  Usually, power was in the hands of members of three curiae: the aristocracy, merchants, and representatives of the bourgeoisie.  In Russia, the division into curia was also carried out.  For example, elections to zemstvo electoral assemblies were carried out by the curiae ‚Äî peasant, noble, and raznochinsky.  After the legal reforms that took place in all European countries, elective curiae ceased to exist. </p><h2>  Church curia </h2><p>  In the era of the Early Church, bishops participated in the dissemination of Christian teachings.  They solved various economic affairs of Christian communities and often acted as their representatives in worldly disputes.  Over time, the influence of the church increased, a new series of employees who served it appeared.  These were apostolic lawyers, notaries, chaplains and other persons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="papal curia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/700676.jpg"></div>  Later, the work of individuals became ineffective, and the emergence of various departments like the papal chancellery, the college of cardinals and the apostolic chamber became quite expected.

    <p>  The papal curia is a combination of various activities of the representatives of the <span>Catholic Church</span> and their empowerment.  Separate divisions of the papal curia in the name of the Pope of Rome answer questions of believers, consider individual complaints, requests and appeals directed to the address of the Holy See. </p><p>  Thus, the word "curia" has transformed and has existed for two and a half thousand years.  This is a rare example of a concept that has survived to this day, retaining almost the same meaning that it had at the beginning of its existence. </p>
