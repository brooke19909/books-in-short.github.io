    <h2>  Before we begin .... </h2><p>  Beginners should know some basic rules before starting work.  Preparation and selection of material of appropriate quality will greatly facilitate the process of painstaking work.  So that it does not turn into hellish labor, you need to purchase patterns for embroidery with beads, special threads, fabric and, in fact, the beads themselves.  Each item from this list has its own requirements, chosen not by chance.  For example, beads can be different, for embroidery you need to choose high-quality samples of Czech or Japanese production.  There are a lot of beads from China on the market, but the cheap price will result in a large amount of marriage, different sizes of beads, so in the end it will also have to be picked up. </p><p>  The thread is used special, thin and strong (monofilament).  A sewing needle is not suitable for these purposes.  Her thickened ear does not always miss the beads, so it is better to purchase a special thin needle. </p><h2>  What patterns for embroidery are there?  What are their differences? </h2><p>  Patterns for embroidery with beads, you can choose the most diverse.  They are divided into groups according to several criteria: basis, size, complexity of execution.  There are those that need to be filled completely with beads, and those where only a small fragment is embroidered. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Beginners should not immediately choose complex pictures for embroidery with beads.  Schemes need to be selected so that the work brings pleasure, goes easily and quickly.  The best schemes for this are the patterns printed on the gabardine, they do not need to embroider the entire background, and few colors are used.  This will be a great start for a beginner needlewoman.  Ease of operation does not mean poor results! </p><h2>  Patterns for embroidery in a set </h2>

    <p>  Most often, such schemes are sold in ready-made sets, where the right colors and sizes of beads, the required number of threads, and special needles are already selected.  This greatly facilitates the work, because it is sometimes difficult for a beginner to independently choose the right shades. </p><p>  Those who have some experience in embroidery, and who enjoys the process itself, can safely take on more difficult work.  Assistants will also be canvases on which ready-made patterns for embroidery with beads are printed.  For beginners, this option is no exception, but a large amount of work can become an obstacle to obtaining a result.  In such works, you have to deal both with juicy colorful paintings and with monophonic pictures.  The color scheme can range from several tens to hundreds of different colors.  In addition to the beads themselves, additional elements in the form of rhinestones, glass beads, round or faceted beads often need to be inserted into the picture.  The most popular among buyers are patterns for embroidery with beads from such companies as Nova Svoboda, Canvas Magic, Butterfly, Abris Art.  And although the price of such sets is a bit biting, however, the quality of the goods is worth it.  An ungreased picture, the optimal amount of beads will allow you to start and finish a wonderful job without any problems. </p><h2>  How to create icons from beads? </h2><p>  Among the abundance of flowers and a riot of colors, I would like to separately tell you how masters of their craft (and just enthusiasts) create icons with beads.  Patterns for embroidering such specific works can also be bought without problems.  There are sets and separate schematic drawings in handicraft stores, both simpler and rather complex.  However, to carry out such work, you need to approach it consciously, with pure thoughts and a clear head.  The icon from beads will be a wonderful gift, decorate any home and cause awe among everyone, even a skeptical person. </p>

    <p>  For those who have never tried to embroider with beads, it seems that this work is incredibly difficult.  But actually it is not.  Such needlework is affordable for almost anyone who possesses perseverance.  No special sewing skills are needed.  The seams are simple, most often they are ordinary oblique stitches, in which the needle comes out of the lower left corner and enters the upper right.  When doing stitches, the most important thing is to fill your hand in thread tension.  If you sew the beads very tight to the fabric, the image will be tight and deformed.  That is why it is better to start with a simpler job that will help you get on track and get the hang of it. </p><h2>  Create a pattern for embroidery with your own hands </h2><p>  A big disadvantage of embroidery kits is their limited selection.  A great alternative is provided by ready-made patterns for embroidery.  It can also be embroidered with beads; in this case, instead of one cross, one bead is used. </p>

    <p>  But the real height of art is the creation of a pattern for embroidery with beads.  To do this, use special online programs.  They digitize any image, whether it‚Äôs a photo of a pet, just a picture you like, a family photo or a reproduction of a world-famous artist‚Äôs picture.  The program will split the image into separate fractions, stitches, pick up the number of threads, beads, its colors and shades.  However, it is important to carefully monitor which material is taken as the basis.  Different manufacturers' color numbers may vary. </p>
