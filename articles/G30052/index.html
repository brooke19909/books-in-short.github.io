Economical refrigerators</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Large electricity bills are forcing people to look for economical household appliances.  As for refrigerators, there are many manufacturers who present interesting options.  On average, a two-chamber model consumes about 230 kW per year.  If we consider refrigerators without a freezer, then this parameter decreases to 150 kW per year. </p><p>  The <span>power</span> consumption of the compressor, the volume of the chamber, as well as the type of control unit affect the power consumption.  It is also important to consider the parameters of the start-up relay and capacitor.  Some models have two evaporators installed, and this is also displayed on the energy consumption indicator.  In order to understand this issue in more detail, you should separately consider single-chamber devices and refrigerators with freezers. </p>

Dehumidifiers are used with liners, and problems rarely occur.  Compressors are installed low power.  It is also important to note that in single-chamber modifications, a stub is used.  Thus, the noise level, as a rule, does not exceed 35 dB. </p><p>  If we consider two-chamber devices, it should be noted that there are many models on the market with digital blocks and displays.  On average, they consume about 255 kW per year.  For two-chamber models, this is quite a lot.  When choosing a refrigerator, it is important to give preference to devices with a plug.  The condenser must be installed with a dehumidifier. </p>
