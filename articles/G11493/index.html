The southern cities of Russia are still popular.  Today, the introduction of a resort tax is an urgent problem.  The order to introduce this fee was given by Putin.  Vacation tax in Russia must be paid to those tourists who will stay in licensed institutions. </p><h2>  The concept </h2><p>  There is no such term in Russian law.  The tax code includes only the concept of ‚Äúcollection‚Äù.  But if you look at publicly available sources of information, you can find an interpretation of this term. </p>

    <p>  Resort fee - tax levied by the state in a particular resort area.  This type of payment was previously used in the legislation in 1991, but it was canceled in 2004. It became known about its renewal in 2016. </p><h2>  Who pays? </h2><p>  Tax on rest in Russia is paid by individuals.  Moreover, this applies to both citizens of the country and foreigners.  It is not necessary to make such a payment to persons engaged in entrepreneurship in the resort area. </p><p>  The resort fee will apply only to sanatoriums, <span>hotels, hotels.</span>  It is assumed that it will be included in the price of the permit.  You can pay the fee at check-in or check-out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where does the fee apply? </h2><p>  The project will not develop immediately.  First it will be introduced in the Crimea, Stavropol Territory, Altai and Krasnodar Territory.  For 5 years, fees will be paid only in these regions.  If the introduction of the law brings positive results, most likely it will be valid in other resort areas. </p>

    <p>  The exact date when the holiday tax in Russia will be paid is not yet known.  2016 was not the year of its introduction.  If you look at this information on the website of the Association of Tour Operators, then there is information there, then payments will need to be paid in 2017. </p><h2>  Fees </h2><p>  How much will a resort vacation tax have?  The answer to this question was provided by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation Anton Siluanov.  Previously, information was circulated that the payment would be 300 rubles, but this amount was high.  It is assumed that the fee will be equal to 100 rubles. </p>

    <p>  To introduce fees, a holiday tax law will be issued.  It is believed that the money will be intended for the development of the resort.  This idea was supported by the Federation Council.  Most likely, the tax on rest in Russia in each region will be different. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where will the funds go? </h2><p>  The President of Russia supports the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãestablishing a tax.  These payments are already in many countries of the world.  The money will be earmarked for improving the sphere of tourism and spa holidays.  There is also an idea for establishing a fund from which funds will be transferred for specific purposes. </p><h2>  Privileges </h2>

    <p>  There is a group of people who do not need to pay holiday tax in Russia.  Although the exact beneficiaries have not yet been determined, it can still be assumed which citizens are exempted from payments: </p><ul><li>  minors; </li><li>  disabled people; </li><li>  persons who have arrived for permanent residence or for study; </li><li>  pensioners; </li><li>  children who came to relatives - pensioners. </li></ul><h2>  Tax refund </h2><p>  In some cases, you can use the compensation for the money spent on the trip.  Refund of vacation tax is possible in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  The ticket is issued by a travel agency; </li><li>  "Wild" rest; </li><li>  the cost price is not more than 50,000 rubles per 1 family member; </li><li>  when vacation is more expensive than the approved limit; </li><li>  compensation can be obtained for the spouse. </li></ul><h2>  Popular resorts </h2><p>  In Russia, there are many resort cities where you can go on vacation.  One of the most popular is Sochi.  The city is located on the Black Sea coast of the Krasnodar Territory.  The territory of this resort is very warm compared to other places of rest.  There is practically no winter in the city, since all days are sunny. </p>

    <p>  Another popular tourist destination is Anapa.  The city has sandy beaches, as well as an ecologically clean sea.  On its territory there are many resorts and camps. </p><p>  In Russia, you can go to Gelendzhik, which is located on the Black Sea.  The nature in the city is very picturesque.  Every year, many tourists relax in sanatoriums and boarding houses.  There are other types of resorts, for example, Tuapse, Mineralnye Vody, Essentuki, Zheleznovodsk. </p><h2>  What do experts say? </h2><p>  It is assumed that the tax on holidays in Russia will help to improve the tourism sector.  2016 was the last year for many cities, when the tax could not be paid.  Many experts believe that the introduction of this norm will have negative results.  Additional contributions are the reason for the increase in vacation prices.  And since it has become so expensive in the Crimea, many tourists will choose private housing rather than hotels.  Therefore, the private sector will remain in the shadows, because the authorities do not have the ability to control the arrival of tourists. </p><p>  In 2016, in the Crimea, many vacationers chose the private sector, since the cost of other types of housing is much higher.  It is assumed that this trend will only develop.  Private accommodation is always less expensive than hotels. </p><p>  Patency in sanatoriums and hotels will be critical.  When developing a project, the experience of other countries where these types of payments have been operating for a long time is taken into account.  For example, in Mallorca a tax of 0.5-2 euros was charged per person per day.  Tour operators turned to the authorities to cancel the fee.  Nevertheless, this requirement was met. </p><p>  It is assumed that due to the depreciation of the ruble and sanctions in Russia, little is spent on vacation.  Therefore, pricing should be flexible.  Only then the tax will not affect the decrease in the flow of tourists.  A suitable price for the collection is the amount in the range of 50-100 rubles.  When it is higher, then tour operators will lose a lot of customers. </p>

    <p>  Recently, Crimea and Altai are profitable destinations for recreation.  The approval of the tax is considered premature, and will not be able to make Russian tourism popular, since the prices for air travel and hotel stays will be expensive.  The main resorts of Russia have a well-developed infrastructure.  Many citizens will not be sure that the money is transferred for the improvement of tourism. </p><h2>  Opinion of tourists about tax </h2><p>  Many Russians do not like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãintroducing a tax because they believe that the infrastructure will remain the same.  The funds received will be used for the maintenance of organizations that control improvement.  Holidays in Turkey or Egypt with excellent service will be cheaper than in Russia.  Because of this, many citizens will not choose our country for travel. </p><p>  So, the resort fee is a new payment that tourists pay when vacationing in some parts of the country.  Due to its introduction, the price of rest is increasing.  But the establishment of a new payment is only in the draft, and there is no based law yet.  Only after its adoption does the obligation to make payments appear. </p>
