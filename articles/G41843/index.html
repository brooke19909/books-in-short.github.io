We have already said that modern users can contact specialized companies.  Service centers often offer software installation and OS updates for a fee. </p><p>  All that is required is to give the mobile device to the service center, after having paid for the services of an employee of the selected organization.  After a while, you can pick up a gadget with an updated operating system. </p><p>  Important: a similar service can take up to several days.  It is recommended to specify more accurate information in the selected service center.  There you will also need to find out data on the cost of changing the firmware. </p><div class="photo" data-original="softdroid.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What you need to update the &quot;Play Market&quot;" class="if uuid-2481438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2481438.jpg"></div><h2>  If no updates have arrived </h2><p>  Does Android update?  Each user searches for the answer to this question on their own.  It should be noted that without installing new software, the operating system will begin to fail over time.  Therefore, neglecting the process under study is not recommended. </p><p>  Sometimes it turns out that a specific person did not receive automatic updates of Android.  It is proposed to correct the situation in just a couple of minutes.  To do this, you need: </p><ol><li>  Take a look at the main menu of the mobile device. </li><li>  Select "Settings" - "Applications". </li><li>  Click on Google Services. </li><li>  Tap on the "Erase" button. </li><li>  Complete the process. </li></ol><p>  Now you can search for auto updates.  Everything should work.  Not everyone knows about this technique.  And therefore, few people use it. </p><h2>  That there were no problems </h2><p>  A few tips on how to ‚Äúupdate‚Äù the software without errors and crashes.  Indeed, some people complain that they were unable to independently change the firmware on their mobile device. </p><p>  How to update the "Android" on the phone, we found out.  In order for the procedure to pass without much difficulty, it is required: </p><ul><li>  charge the smartphone battery to the maximum; </li><li>  connect the device to the PC via wires; </li><li>  provide an inextricable Internet connection. </li></ul><p>  Only under these conditions the process under study will pass without failures.  Otherwise, the update will fail.  In some cases, the OS of the device will be destroyed.  And then only a service center employee can help. </p><div class="photo" data-original="androidtab.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Completion of the Android update" class="if uuid-2481433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2481433.jpg"></div><h2>  "Play Market" and reinstallation </h2><p>  Sometimes it becomes necessary to update the "Market" on the "Android".  "Upgrading" the OS will not give the desired result.  Therefore, you have to behave differently. </p><p>  Ideally, the <span>"Play Market" is updated</span> automatically.  The main thing is to launch the appropriate software and authorize through a Google account.  This application is reinstalled in the same way as other programs on the phone. </p><p>  Important: without a Google profile, you can‚Äôt cope with the task.  You will still have to register a separate account if it was not. </p><p>  In order to carry out the update, in all of the above cases, you must connect to the Network.  It doesn‚Äôt matter which way.  Updates are completely free.  They are not charged under any circumstances. </p><h2>  On tablet </h2><p>  <span>How to update Android on a tablet?</span>  The previously proposed instructions are relevant for any mobile device.  So, they can be used on tablets as well. </p><p>  Is there any difference in the techniques learned?  In the main menu of the device, the signature in the "About the device" section will change.  If the user works with the tablet, the message "About the tablet" will appear here.  Otherwise, you can see the signature "About phone / smartphone." </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  How to update Android?  Now the answer to this question should not perplex a person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="poandroidam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Android update via PC" class="if uuid-2481439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2481439.jpg"></div><p>  All existing methods for updating the Android operating system were presented to your attention.
