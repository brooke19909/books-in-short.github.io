This small resort, located in southern Turkey, is surrounded by the greenery of lemon and orange gardens.  It is famous not only for its beautiful beaches, but also for its many monuments.  Alanya, located at the foot of the Toros mountain range on the Mediterranean Sea, has a long history.  Even during Roman rule, this paradise piece of land <span>Mark Anthony</span> presented to his beloved.  For Cleopatra, he became a favorite place where she often came to rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cleopatra Alis Hotel 3" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1022068.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Holiday at the resort </h2><p>  Tours to Alanya last year broke a record for popularity.  In general, the tourism business brings this city more than a billion euros per year.  And this is not surprising.  Firstly, the resort can be reached very quickly and easily, since the airport is located only one hundred and twenty kilometers.  In addition, tours in this direction are inexpensive.  <span>Alanya hotels are</span> much more affordable than in many nearby resorts.  There is all the necessary infrastructure for recreation.  The mild climate in this region also contributes significantly to the fact that many elderly people and couples with children come here.  It is dry and hot during the day, and cool at night, since Alanya is located in subtropical latitude. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotels in Turkey - Alanya 3 *: prices </h2><p>  The rating of three-star hotels located in this country is based on reviews from tourists.  It is headed by hotels in Alanya, the prices for accommodation in which, according to many Russians, suit them with their democratic level.  However, you do not need to think that the resort has only three-star hotels.  In Alanya, inexpensive hotels are adjacent to chic multi-story hotel complexes offering the widest range of services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cleopatra Alis Hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1022062.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Nevertheless, it is the 3 * category that is the most popular among the average Russian tourist.  In general, it should be noted that the "star" in this resort does not always correspond to the set of services provided.  Many inexpensive hotels have a fairly rich infrastructure, a good beach area and are located almost on the first line from the sea - across the road.  At the same time, most three-star hotels, despite such a low category, have an equipped underpass that delivers tourists directly to the shore. </p><p>  The rating is headed by <span>Sunside Beach</span> Club and Big Blue, while Cleopatra Alis Hotel 3 * is not the last in the list of the best places where you can have a good rest. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Prices for accommodation in three-star hotels in Alanya, and throughout Turkey, depend on the season, as well as on occupancy.  For example, up to two hundred and fifty dollars can be paid for staying in a double standard room with the half board concept in December in the month of December.  The price does not include air travel and transfer. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Located on the second line from <span>Cleopatra's beach,</span> this medium-sized hotel is very popular with our compatriots. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alanya hotels prices" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1022058.jpg" width="600"></div>  Tour operators say that it is equally good for a beach holiday, and for sightseeing.  Cleopatra Alis Hotel 3 * (Alanya, Center) was built a long time ago - in 1985.  The last reconstruction in it was carried out in 2015.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is relatively small - one thousand eight hundred square meters.  The territory is fully landscaped.
