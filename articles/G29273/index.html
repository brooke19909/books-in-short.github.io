  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Renal colic. Emergency care for renal colic.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most renal colic develops due to obstruction of the outflow of urine from the <span>renal pelvis</span> .  During its development in the ureter, stones, dense crystals move, as well as various disturbances in the functioning and patency of the ureter (inflammatory processes, excesses). </p><p>  An attack begins, usually suddenly, most often as a result of physical stress.  Also, an attack of renal colic can occur and at rest - after heavy drinking and during sleep.  Patients during seizures behave uneasyly, rushing around, looking for a position of the body that could alleviate their suffering, while experiencing cutting pain with periods of exacerbation and lull. </p><p>  Very often, attacks take a lingering nature, have short remissions and last several days.  Starting from the lumbar region, the pain spreads to the abdomen and hypochondrium, into the bladder along the ureter, into the scrotum, to the labia and on the hips.  In most cases, pain accumulates at the level of the genitals and in the abdomen, and not in the kidneys, accompanied by frequent urination and cutting pains in the urethra. </p><p>  Long-term <span>renal colic is</span> accompanied by high blood pressure, and with pyelonephritis - an increase in temperature. </p><p>  <strong>Renal colic: emergency care</strong> </p><p>  It consists in calling a doctor who will administer atropine and <span>narcotic analgesics.</span>  If the patient suddenly has renal colic, help while waiting for the doctor should be limited to thermal procedures - a hot bath, heating pads.  So you can slightly remove the discomfort that causes renal colic.  First aid may include taking painkillers and antispasmodic drugs already available in the medicine cabinet: Baralgin tablet;  papaverine (0.04 g);  Avisan (0.5-1 g);  cystenal (10-20 drops). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you have renal colic, first aid and urgent hospitalization - this is the key to a successful and favorable treatment.  At home, it is contraindicated to conduct treatment until the causes of pain attacks are clarified.  An acute pain attack requires the doctor to quickly recognize renal colic and take urgent measures.  Only a specialist in a hospital can confirm or rule out this disease.  In the prehospital period, therapeutic measures for renal colic are permissible only when the diagnosis is not in doubt. </p><p>  So, help with treatment begins with the removal of pain syndromes.  This is achieved by the use of thermal procedures, painkillers and antispasmodics.  It is during this period that the above is of great importance for the patient: when renal colic began, emergency care in the prehospital period should consist of enhanced heating (heating pads, hot baths, sand - 40-50 degrees).  In most cases, these measures either relieve pain, or completely relieve it.  And only when their use does not cause the desired effect, in anticipation of the doctor, they begin to use medications.  Usually they begin to intramuscularly administer gpazmolyticheskie and <span>painkillers.</span>  The use of narcotic drugs is allowed only with the exclusion of diseases in the <span>abdominal cavity,</span> basically do without them. </p><p>  One of the best drugs used in the diagnosis of renal colic, emergency care for pain relief is baralgin (five milliliters).  The drug has the most effective effect when administered intravenously, it is contraindicated for use by patients who have an allergic reaction to analgesics. </p><p>  In a hospital, it is preferable to use ‚Äúlytic mixtures‚Äù to stop renal colic. </p><p>  To achieve the differential diagnostic and therapeutic goals, a blockade of the uterus uterus or spermatic cord is sometimes carried out - 10-30 milliliters of novocaine (1%).  After which, within 20 minutes, renal colic subsides, with the exception of acute diseases of the abdominal organs.  Sometimes, instead of <span>novocaine blockade</span> , paravertebral blockade with chloroethyl is used. </p><p>  Thus, if you or a person close to you is overtaken by renal colic, emergency care performed promptly and correctly helps to quickly restore the functions of the organ and prevents the occurrence of serious complications.  After eliminating renal colic, the patient needs a detailed examination by a urologist. </p>
