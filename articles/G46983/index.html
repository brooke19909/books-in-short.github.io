Pros, cons, differences from the original</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Apple is famous for its attention to detail and first-class service.  And if your gadget fails before the warranty period has expired, having come to their store, you can exchange it for a new one or return the money.  What is the fate of the devices handed over in this way?  If the breakdown is uncritical, and the gadget can be brought back to life, then the technique goes to recovery.  The malfunction is eliminated, then the smartphone is equipped with new headphones and charging, it is assigned a special serial number, indicating that the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù has been restored.  The price tag for such products is much nicer, but does such a saving make sense, and is there a risk when buying such devices?  Let's consider this question further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cultofmac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to distinguish 7 original from restored" class="if uuid-3174082" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3174082.jpg"></div><h2>  Should I buy a restored iPhone 7? </h2><p>  Of course, many are wary when they sell good products inexpensively, but when you buy a refurbished device, you get the same guarantees as when you purchased a new one.  However, it is worth considering before purchasing such a device from your hands or at questionable points of sale.  To do this, you need to know how to distinguish the original "iPhone 7" from the restored. </p><p>  Apple does not repair a failed part, after diagnosis it is replaced with a completely new one, thereby completely eliminating the breakdown.  Before packing, the phone is tested according to the same high criteria by which the new devices of the company are tested.  After, having passed all the tests, he goes on sale.  There are also "iPhones" restored in artisanal conditions, but more on that later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Buying an officially refurbished smartphone can save a lot of money.  Technically, it is fully operational, the kit contains completely new accessories, and comes in the same factory packaging as any other Apple product.  There are no signs of use on it.  You can verify all of this by reading customer reviews.  In general, they are pleased with the acquisition. </p><h2>  Is there a guarantee on them? </h2><p>  Yes, a guarantee for such products is provided.  Moreover, the official.  If the restored iPhone 7 fails, it must be taken to an authorized Apple service center, where the wizard will diagnose, identify the problem and replace the failed part with a new one.  The guarantee for it is also one year.  Of course, mechanical damage like broken glass or moisture entering the case is not a guarantee case. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="like iphone 7 original from refurbished" class="if uuid-3174081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3174081.jpg"></div><h2>  How to determine if "iPhone 7" is officially restored or not? </h2><p>  Determining the officially restored smartphone is quite simple.  When buying with your hands, if you are told that it is original, you need to find out its serial number and enter it in the box on the special page on the Apple website.  From there you will get all the information about the device: whether it was in the service, whether the warranty period has expired, as well as the date of activation of the gadget. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the case was replaced, it will be noticeable immediately.  You will notice significantly worse materials and color compared to the original, which will probably differ from the original.  It is strongly not recommended to buy the reconstructed ‚ÄúiPhone 7‚Äù in this way, since it is not known what caused the breakdown, the technical condition of the internal parts, and how and by whom the repair was carried out. </p><h2>  Difference from new </h2><p>  How to distinguish the restored "iPhone 7" from the original?  This is easy enough to do.  After restoration at the factory, the phone number and serial number change.  Such smartphones are called factory refurbished, hence the letter ‚ÄúF‚Äù at the beginning of the series and ‚ÄúRFB‚Äù at the end.  Also, it must absolutely coincide with the number in the ‚ÄúAbout the device‚Äù settings item.  In all other respects, there are no differences.  There is a protective film on the screen and the case, new headphones, a charging cable and power supply, a new sealed box and a full set of documents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.uswitch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to distinguish iPhone 7 original from restored" class="if uuid-3174085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3174085.jpg"></div><p>  There are also the so-called seller refurbished smartphones on the market.  As the name implies, they were restored by the seller, that is, they were once surrendered under warranty, after they were brought to the store‚Äôs service and put up for sale.  The quality of the restoration in comparison with the official one is much worse, since components from other used devices or Chinese spare parts could be used.  The name of this type of device is conditional, since it also includes ‚ÄúiPhones‚Äù on the ‚Äúandroid‚Äù ordered from China.  They may differ from the factory in worse sound quality, faded color rendering of the display and flashes, cheaper body materials and more.  The price tag for them is usually even lower than for the factory refurbished, but there are no guarantees anymore.  Thus, it turns out that the lower the price, the more suspicious a smartphone you get. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wccftech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to distinguish iPhone 7 from restored" class="if uuid-3174083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3174083.jpg"></div><h2>  Where can I buy a refurbished device? </h2><p>  The officially restored iPhone 7, which has undergone restoration at Apple, can be purchased at almost all electronics stores.  Phones restored by craftsmen, or otherwise seller refurbished devices, can be bought almost anywhere: from hand, in online stores, at unofficial points of sale.  However, in any case, such an acquisition can be very risky. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wccftech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to distinguish iphone 7 original" class="if uuid-3174084" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3174084.jpg"></div><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The acquisition of the officially restored iPhone 7 makes sense if you want to save several thousand rubles.  No one can promise you that he will not fail in a few months.  Buying a reconditioned device from your own hands or on the Internet is everyone‚Äôs business, but the lack of a guarantee, dubious components and the craftsmen who performed this procedure, clearly cannot inspire confidence. </p><p>  In the event that you buy an official device from your hands, it is enough to check the serial numbers in the settings and on the box.  If they coincide and have the necessary letters, which were mentioned above, this means that "iPhone 7" is officially restored.  Such a gadget will be more reliable, in addition, you can return it under warranty in case of failure. </p>
