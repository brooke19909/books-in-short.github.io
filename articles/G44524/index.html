  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lamp against mosquitoes - caring for people, merciless to bloodsuckers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For those who relax in the summer at the cottage, who love to sleep at home in the summer with the window open, annoying mosquitoes become a real disaster.  Nothing can poison the rest of people like these flying bloodsuckers.  Different in effectiveness and complexity of the funds have been tried in the fight against them.  Something helps more, something less, something - nothing at all.  What place does the mosquito lamp take in this row? <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lantern from mosquitoes" class="if" height="226" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/263846.jpg" width="223"></div>  All mosquito devices are divided into repelling mosquitoes and attracting them.  And we are talking only about mosquito females.  They play a decisive role in the biological cycle of reproduction, mating with males and laying every 2-3 days to one and a half hundred eggs.  But for this cycle to be repeated over and over, females need blood.  "Donors" of mosquitoes - people - emit <span>carbon dioxide, a</span> specific <span>smell of sweat,</span> they are accompanied by an increased, compared with the environment, body temperature and lighting outside and inside the premises.  Females are guided by these signs. <br><br>  A mosquito lamp, based on a search for mosquito females, imitates several of these signs at once.  One of his devices converts the usual household gas propane into carbon dioxide, simulating the human breath.  In another device, there is a special bait that emits a smell, the composition is very close to human sweat.  Heaters raise the temperature of the device to body temperature.  Finally, lamps, including ultraviolet, also serve to attract mosquitoes. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lamp against mosquitoes" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/263844.jpg" width="400"></div>  Mosquitoes will inevitably be fatal, and it can be different, depending on what design features the lamp against mosquitoes has.  Their flight to it can suddenly be blocked by a <span>metal grate,</span> to which the voltage is applied - very small, but sufficient so that all the bloodsuckers that fell on it die from an electric discharge.  The lattice is reliably protected, therefore, neither a person nor a pet will accidentally touch it.  There are flashlights, vacuum cleaners, literally sucking in a stream of air of their victims into the vacuum compartment, from where the exit is impossible due to adhesive tape covering it.  In this compartment, mosquitoes dehydrate and die. <br><br>  The mosquito repellent lamp, on the contrary, makes the bloodsuckers leave the zone of its action as quickly as possible.  His work is based either on the reproduction of a particular sound, or on the formation of a cloud of another chemical substance, a repellent, invisible to the human eye. <br><br>  Sounds that repel mosquitoes are different.  One is published by a <span>male mosquito.</span>  Females, already fertilized and thirsty for blood to start the biological reproduction cycle, avoid repeated fertilization and fly away from males.  Another sound is an alarm when a predator appears.  The third one does not publish a mosquito, but a dragonfly - a sworn mosquito enemy, the rustle of dragonfly wings can scare away the bloodsuckers. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lantern from mosquitoes raptor" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/263845.jpg" width="225"></div>  The repellent, which uses, for example, the Raptor mosquito lamp, is extremely unpleasant for blood-sucking insects, but its composition is a natural insecticide released by some plants.  Therefore, it is completely harmless to humans and pets. <br><br>  The vast majority of such household appliances are made in a design that is ideal for lighting a room or a <span>house.</span>  Therefore, a lamp from mosquitoes is able, in addition to protection from bloodsucking and annoying insects, to give cozy light to a windowsill with an open window, a country house, a veranda, the place where you have a picnic in the open air or fry kebabs.
