The inhuman distributor of Nazi ideas loves beautiful women and girls.  In the society of the fair sex, nothing remains of cynicism, complacency and aggression.  Despite the large number of ties with women, the most talked about is the scandalous relationship of Hitler with his niece Raubal Geli. </p><h2>  Hitler family </h2><p>  Hitler‚Äôs family has a long history of incest, which has become traditional for the previous three generations.  Hitler family men marry their nieces.  Clara Peltzl, who later became Hitler's mother, enters into a love relationship with her uncle. </p><p>  It all happened like that.  The future father of the Fuhrer calls his niece from the village, who at that time turns 13 years old.  Years pass and the young girl prepares to become a mother, while the legal wife lies on the deathbed.  Subsequently, Clara marries him and gives six children, of whom the son Adolf and his sister Paula are still alive.  The mother of the future Fuhrer has a modest and quiet behavior.  For a long time, she continues to turn to her husband, calling him uncle. </p>

    <p>  In order to have a real opportunity to conclude such a marriage, I had to draw up a petition to the pope for the resolution of close relations.  The history of incest is continued in the connection between Adolf and Raubal Geli, who also began to live in his large apartment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Adolf Gitler </h2><p>  There were times in the life of Adolf when he could be put in jail in Germany or sent abroad.  He was the leader of the National Socialists, and the government oversaw his actions.  Therefore, a man settles not far from the Austrian border.  But Hitler‚Äôs plans are not to cross the line - this violates his far-reaching plans.  Therefore, his next adventurous step is the renunciation of Austrian citizenship in April 1925.  He expects that he, as a veteran of military operations on the side of Germany, will be granted German citizenship.  But his plans are crumbling.  In this situation, completely stateless, he does not hope for a family.  But that does not stop him from finding adventures at parties.  Sometimes such adventures develop into rather lengthy love affairs. </p><h2>  Gels Raubal: biography </h2><p>  Her mother, Hitler's half-sister, has two daughters - Geli and Fridl.  With them in 1928, she moved to her uncle's house as a housekeeper for housekeeping.  Angelica Maria Raubal (mother of Geli) has a father - Alois Hitler.  Alois's second wife, Francis, becomes her mother.  Hitler's half-sister maintains friendly relations with him.  Adolf calls her son Leo (brother of Geli) his beloved nephew. </p>

    <p>  School years Raubal Gels end in 1927.  The girl has a dream - to become an opera singer.  In 1928, she studied singing.  Teachers note a pleasant unusual timbre of voice and lively cheerful character.  The young lady herself hopes that Uncle Adolf will help her achieve dizzying successes in the pennates of the Vienna Opera House. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Hitler's niece becomes attractive, her face and figure with beautiful puffy shapes corresponds to a truly <span>Slavic appearance.</span>  Historical facts speak of several lovers of Geli.  One of them in the arms of the girl managed to catch <span>Emil Moris, the</span> driver and bodyguard of Hitler.  The romance between them is too annoying for the future Fuhrer.  Despite this, fascinated by his beloved, Adolf decides to move with her to an expensive area, where he has his own apartment for living together.  The only surviving correspondence between Emil and Geli is sold in a private collection.  Today, her location cannot be determined. </p><h2>  Joint years of lovers </h2><p>  Hitler and Geli Raubal met in 1925 in Bavaria.  But the nascent feelings of two hearts were not developed, although Adolf was already fascinated by the girl and her melodic angelic voice.  A fleeting impression for Hitler grew into a desire to meet with a young lady again. </p><p>  In the summer season of 1928, Adolf settles in Obeltszalberg, for this he saved some money.  Hitler rents a villa from an industrial widow.  After being appointed chancellor, Adolf redeems the building and organizes a major redevelopment, which ends with the transformation of the villa into a huge fashionable mansion called the Berghof.  At this time, the half-sister enters the life of the future Fuhrer, who together with herself brings Adolf's future love for living.  Getting a zealous housekeeper in his house, he hopes to see a niece who has sunk deep into his soul. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Couple relationship </h2><p>  In Hitler‚Äôs huge mansion, there are 9 cozy rooms, one of which is equipped to the taste of Gels for her stay.  Adolf forgets his women and passionately enjoys a charming cohabitant.  The whole environment of the Chancellor believes that a lover of idle life overtakes a real feeling.  Adolf travels everywhere accompanied by his niece.  She is next to him at party meetings, meetings, participates in conferences, at rallies.  Not a single visit to a cafe, restaurant, or theater show is complete without a couple in love.  Geli's mother lives in the same house with them, so for the sake of sensation Adolf leaves with his niece in the mountains for long walks. </p><h2>  Is it love? </h2><p>  There are still various rumors about Geli‚Äôs feelings for Adolf.  Some believe that the young girl sincerely loved her uncle and was happy in the relationship.  Others provide historical papers indicating that the young lady had several novels on the side.  In any case, relations with Hitler attract young Geli with a prudent future. </p>

    <p>  The indisputable fact is that the couple is constantly jealous of each other.  This results in a showdown and scandals.  Once Geli makes a picturesque tantrum when he receives news that Hitler wants to arrange a marriage with Winifred Wagner. </p><h2>  Wagner's daughter-in-law </h2><p>  Hitler is fond of Wagner's works.  A constant presence among the composer leads to the fact that a woman lover draws attention to the musician‚Äôs daughter-in-law - Winifred.  For the chancellor, the composer's house in Byrot becomes a kind of pass to the high society.  After the death of her husband in 1930, the widow often meets with Adolf.  And he relates a new friend to the category of unique people.  She sincerely believes in Hitler's love.  The F√ºhrer warms up confidence: once he expresses the idea that it is difficult to find a candidate for the first lady of Germany better than the daughter-in-law of a famous composer.  This is perceived as a promise to marry, which is not fulfilled, like many others. </p><h2>  Community Resonance </h2><p>  Everyone around discusses the connection.  And there is no doubt who <span>Hitler‚Äôs</span> beloved <span>woman is.</span>  And the chancellor himself does not try to hide her from society.  Relationships give rise to the discontent of many old party associates.  Their opinion remains standard - the party leader should have a more strict relationship with the fair sex.  In the future, Hitler will respond to this by saying that "he is engaged to Germany."  The Gauleiter of the city of W√ºrttemberg one day will demand that he stop the demonstration of unlawful relations.  The ultimatum concerns the constant displays of his mistress in public.  As an option, it is proposed to create a healthy family unit of the German nation. </p>

    <p>  Statements make the Chancellor furious, after which the Gauleiter does not linger in the chair for one day.  But Hitler, these words make you think about the possible creation of a family.  After that, he appeals to the church for permission to marry Raubal Gels. </p><h2>  The tragic continuation of love </h2><p>  Do not forget to have fun with other women, the Fuhrer is still jealous of his beloved woman for everyone.  He requires only Raubal‚Äôs belonging to him, forbids her to study vocals and travel to Vienna.  Relations, crushed by the despotism of Adolf, begin to deteriorate.  In 1929, the F√ºhrer wrote a frank letter in which Geli confessed to his addiction to sexual games in love with his niece.  Suddenly, this correspondence falls into the hands of strangers.  This threatens them with complete annihilation on the part of Hitler, as well as all those who could only think of reading the lines. </p><p>  In early autumn 1931, a stormy scandal took place between lovers.  Geli finally informed Hitler about her desire to move to Vienna and become an opera vocalist.  In matters of jealousy scenes, they are not equal.  Hitler urgently leaves for Hamburg to resolve the issues of the election campaign. </p>

The police, after conducting an investigation, concludes that she committed suicide. </p><h2>  Violent Death Version </h2><p>  After the death of his girlfriend, Hitler refuses meat food and becomes a vegetarian.  Over the years, rumors have spread that she died a violent death.  There are two versions: </p><ul><li>  Hitler himself killed her in a fit of jealousy; </li><li>  Heinrich Himler had a hand in this with the help of mercenaries. </li></ul><p>  When remembering his Gel, the ruler had tears in his eyes.
