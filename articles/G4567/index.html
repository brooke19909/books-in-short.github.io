  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make everything for dolls for school, including furniture and accessories</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How to make everything for dolls for school, and is it necessary to do it if today you can find anything in stores?  Making a school for dolls and accessories is not at all as difficult as it seemed at first.  A little patience, paper, scissors, cardboard - and in one evening you can make a complete set to send your darling in the wonderful world of knowledge in the morning! </p><p>  And if you have a printer, plasticine, a needle, threads and a couple of simple materials - you can make a copy of these school books and pens.  School desks and a board are also simple and quick.  After all, the main desire and a head full of ideas to play incredible stories, fantasize as much as you like!  Why spend money if the creative process is more interesting and useful than shopping, and save. </p><h2>  What do dolls need at school </h2><p>  Each student knows what accessories he will need in school, what to wear and what the office looks like at school, but not everyone knows how to make dolls for the school with their own hands.  The idea seems grandiose and impracticable, but to make for the puppet students an absolute copy of the school will enthrall so much that time will fly by. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mycrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="School doll accessories" class="if uuid-3208140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/138395/3208140.jpg"></div><p>  So, what exactly will be needed for little schoolchildren: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  a briefcase or backpack; </li><li>  notebooks and textbooks in various subjects; </li><li>  a diary; </li><li>  pencil case with office (pens of different colors, ruler, simple pencil, sharpener, eraser); </li><li>  album, brushes and paints or felt-tip pens; </li><li>  school furniture (desks, blackboard, educational posters, a globe, book shelves or shelves); </li><li>  if schoolchildren are modern - laptop, smartphone. </li></ul><p>  How to make everything for the dolls for the school, if at hand there is nothing but paper, pen, cardboard and glue.  Easy and simple, if a little fantasy!  But of course, the set will turn out to be much prettier if you print the blanks of real training materials on a printer or paint everything yourself. </p><h2>  From thought to action, school furniture </h2><p>  You can start with class design.  Take the box of the right size, stick the printed or painted windows with curtains, cut a hole for the door and glue it. </p><p>  How to make everything for the dolls for the school is more or less clear, but how to deal with the school board and furniture.  Again, do not forget to fantasize: the board can be made separately or decorated on the wall of the box, simply by drawing it;  you can tangle a little more and cut out the rectangles from the cardboard, stick them to the whole cardboard rectangle with adhesive tape (these will be the opening / closing doors of the board) and glue the whole structure to the wall with glue. </p><p>  School desks are easier to make from matchboxes by sticking cut pieces of juice from the juice instead of legs or by making them plasticine.  Then the finished desks can simply be painted.  And the chairs are easy to make from cardboard and the same sticks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.rainbowtinklesworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to arrange a puppet class at school" class="if uuid-3208124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/138395/3208124.jpg"></div><p>  A cabinet or chest of drawers can also be made from matchboxes.  There, the teacher will keep his textbooks and student notebooks.  On the cabinet you can put a globe made of plasticine. </p><p>  It remains to decorate the study with portraits of writers and hang up educational posters: a world map, alphabet, multiplication table, etc. </p><h2>  School supplies for dolls </h2><p>  How to make a school for dolls with your own hands, so that there are also stationery items in it: pens, felt-tip pens, colored pencils, erasers, sharpeners, etc.?  It will not work to make them out of ordinary plasticine - they will constantly stick together and bend.  Only non-sticky clay, ear sticks, toothpicks or wire can be used. </p><p>  Excellent felt-tip pens will be made from ear sticks - you just need to cut the stick into equal parts and paint the tips of each piece in different colors.  A simple pencil will come from a toothpick.  The handle of the wire on which the beads are strung is bent one corner, and where the ‚Äúwriting" part is coated with glue so that the beads do not crumble. </p><p>  Notebooks and textbooks can be glued from printed leaflets, and if this is not possible, cut out mini-leaflets of 3 by 2 cm in size (or choose your own sizes).  Covers for them should be made of thin cardboard or colored paper.  In notebooks you must remember to draw the fields with a red pen.  Sheets can be fastened together in the middle with a stapler or will have to be stitched - one seam is enough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mycrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY stationery for dolls" class="if uuid-3208141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/138395/3208141.jpg"></div><p>  It is more difficult to make a portfolio - it will either have to be sewn, made of paper or scotch tape.  The latter option is simpler and faster. </p><p>  Making a laptop and phone is also not difficult - here you can already use plasticine, paper and colored pencils or a printed image of the laptop to stick on a cardboard folded in half, not forgetting to stick the logo of an apple or another on top. </p><p>  All other accessories can be made from the same materials at hand - the main thing is to fantasize and not spare time for crafts - then there will no longer be a question - how to make a school for Lol or Barbie dolls.  After all, you want to play your home-made school endlessly and you can even play real life stories with your child for educational purposes, thus teaching him courtesy, patience, hard work, and the desire to learn. </p>
