This Turkish city is more marked than others by a touch of Europeanism.  Discos, night clubs, a free, if not to say, libertine way of life.  It also has an ideal climate.  The cool sea breeze disperses the heat even in July-August.  Around Marmaris is a very beautiful nature.  Mountains covered with pines surround the city in a semicircle.  And there is a very calm sea.  Sedir Island closes Marmaris Bay from storms.  The coast is safe for swimming for children, but also interesting for divers - there are about fifty underwater sites in the district.  And, in addition, EU citizens and Schengen visa holders can visit Greek Rhodes in one day - ferries sail to this island in only fifty minutes.  But where to stay in Marmaris?  The central beach does not shine due to the large size of the city.  We are trying to bring to your attention the hotel Ideal Panorama Holiday Village HV-1.  Description of the hotel is built largely on the reviews of tourists.  Therefore, you will not fall for the tricks of flyers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ideal Panorama Holiday Village HV-1" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1475568.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  This is a country hotel.  It is located at a reasonable distance from the center of Marmaris (3 km): close to get to evening entertainment, and far from the hustle and bustle of the big city.  <span>Dalaman</span> International <span>Airport is</span> one hundred and ten kilometers away.  In this area near the beach lies a road.  Therefore, all hotels automatically become located in the second lane.  Although, in fact, the Ideal Panorama Holiday Village HV-1 does not separate any buildings from the sea.  If your voucher does not provide a transfer, you can easily get to the hotel from Marmaris - by the Domlush minibus (travel two and a half lira or one US dollar).  The only thing a tourist needs to know is that until 2014 the hotel was called ‚ÄúSemera Halichi 4‚Äù.  Because of this, some dolmushi drivers may not know the location of the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Territory and hotel buildings </h2><p>  The hotel is located on a hill, so from the balconies of the rooms a perfect panorama opens.  You should immediately decipher the abbreviation at the end of the name Ideal Panorama Holiday Village HV-1 5 *.  "Hotel Village 1" means that the main buildings on the territory of the hotel are cottages or bungalows, in the presence of high-rise buildings.  The last two.  The main building has five floors, and the Annex Building - four.  Between them there is a pool, and this circumstance tourists call a significant plus.  But the main buildings on a vast territory of eight and a half thousand square meters are two-story bungalows.  There are sixty of them, and they are located among pine trees and park plants.  Between them and the lower exit to the beach there is a spacious pool with a bar and a sun terrace.  On the territory there is a playground.  Hotel buildings were built under the previous owner, in 1990, but the last repair took place in the winter of 2015. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ideal Panorama Holiday Village HV-1 Marmaris" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1475569.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Room Categories </h2><p>  Guest rooms are divided into Standard and Family Room.  The last category is more expensive.  Family rooms consist of two rooms - a bedroom with a door and a living room.  And the size of the Family Room is more spacious (thirty-five square meters).  This type of room is ideal for families with children.  A clear advantage of the Family Room is kitchen and tableware, an electric kettle and bags for self-brewing of hot drinks.  But, in general, the differences between family rooms and "Standards" are limited to this.  The latter are available in both buildings and in the bungalow.  And the panorama of them all opens up perfect, as stated in the name of the hotel Ideal Panorama Holiday Village HV-1.  Where is better to order a room?  Reviews in this matter contradict each other.  In the buildings there is an elevator, in two-story bungalows it is not.  But the hotel is located on a hillside, so walking up the stairs is still guaranteed.  But the bungalows are designed for only two rooms.  So the risk of having restless neighbors is significantly reduced. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ideal Panorama Holiday Village HV-1 (Marmaris)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1475566.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are one hundred and thirty-four such rooms designed for the comfortable accommodation of two guests.  "Standard" is a bedroom and a bathroom.  This room also has a balcony, even if it is located in the basement of the bungalow.  Reviews mark cleanliness in freshly renovated rooms.  All equipment in good condition.  The air conditioning will drive even the most sweltering heat away from the room.  A TV with cable channels (there are also Russian speakers) diversifies the evenings.  To save values, there is a safe.  Using it is free.  There is also a minibar.  In it, upon check-in, the guest will find a large bottle of drinking water and two bags of juice.  These products are not replenished.  You can not say about bottles and sachets of hygiene products.  Their maids deliver every day when they clean the room.  Bed linen is changed twice a week.  And towels - every day.  Reviews mention that in the bedroom the flooring is cool ceramic tiles, which is very nice in the summer.  Bathrooms have glass-walled showers and hair dryers.  There is no Wi-Fi in the rooms, only in common areas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ideal Panorama Holiday Village HV-1 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1475567.jpg" width="600"></div>

But about the food in the hotel Ideal Panorama Holiday Village HV-1 (Marmaris), only praises sound.  Not a single capricious voice breaks out of the general laudatory chorus.  Turkish ‚Äúfive‚Äù with ‚ÄúAll inclusive‚Äù - and that‚Äôs it.  Guests are invited to a restaurant where meals are served in a sumptuous buffet setting.  Would you like to leave the beach for lunch?  And it is not necessary!  At the beach bar you can enjoy burgers, hot dogs, pizza, Turkish tortillas, refreshments and hot drinks, desserts and fruits.  After a day they give wonderful ice cream.  In general, the hotel has three bars.  But, reviews say, alcohol is not poured everywhere, but only in the institution, which is located at the lobby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ideal Panorama Holiday Village HV-1 Hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1475564.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What tourists say about food </h2><p>  ‚ÄúAbove all praises‚Äù ... ‚ÄúA paradise for the stomach‚Äù ... ‚ÄúWe have gained two kilograms in ten days‚Äù - these phrases sound like refrain in reviews of the Ideal Panorama Holiday Village HV-1 hotel.  The skill of the cooks was appreciated.  Even french fries are prepared here breathtakingly, "better than at McDonald's."  And there are reasons for this.  Eighty percent of hotel guests are Dutch and Belgian.  They consider fries their "national dish", and eat it at all meals.  To please them, local chefs learned to fry potatoes no worse than Belgian ones.  A very varied diet is given for dinner.  Always something new and tasty.  There is nothing to say about the quality of Turkish desserts - they are <span>already a byword.</span>  There have always been many fruits - nectarines, watermelons, peaches, sweet apples, melons, grapes.  Fans of a healthy diet for breakfast were also satisfied - there are granola and yogurt.  Meat and fish were present at lunches and dinners in different types and conditions (including grilled ones).  Alcohol was poured free of charge only locally produced.  Tourists praised Turkish wines and beer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ideal Panorama Holiday Village HV-1 Turkey" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1475570.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pools and Beach at Ideal Panorama Holiday Village HV-1 </h2><p>  Tourist photographs often represent a hotel as an island surrounded by water.  Between the two buildings there is a small pool.  It has water slides for children.  Despite the modest size of this pool, the people there are usually much smaller than in the main one.  There is a bar near the shore of the second reservoir.  But he, as well as the pool, close after six in the evening.  But at the buildings you can swim at least at night!  Both pools are surrounded by sunbathing terraces with umbrellas and sunbeds.  The hotel‚Äôs private beach is across the street from it.  Go to it from the buildings and bungalows about two hundred and fifty meters.  What do the reviews say about the beach?  It is pebble and sand, common to three hotels.  Beach shoes <span>(coral slippers)</span> will not hurt to enter the sea <span>.</span>  The strip for sunbathing is quite narrow, but there is enough space for everyone.  Moreover, the bulk of tourists (Dutch and Germans) prefer to spend time by the pool and only occasionally go to plunge into the sea.  And it, judging by the reviews, is excellent.  Clean, warm, calm.  Sunset at sea, with the exception of rocks, is good for bathing children.  Of the minuses of the beach, vacationers mentioned the lack of a toilet and the insufficient number of changing cabins. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Ideal Panorama Holiday Village HV-1 (Marmaris) has secure parking on site.  Among the free services you can include wireless Internet, which, however, is only valid in the lounge area near the reception and in the restaurant.  Animation is available, both for children and for adults.  Little guests easily overcome language barriers, and the next day they play together with children from other countries.  And for adults, one Russian-speaking girl works.  The reception desk operates around the clock.  Even if you arrived late at night, you will be welcomed with smiles and kindly.  A Russian-speaking employee also works at the reception.  At your request, you will be given free use of an iron.  There are tennis courts on site.  You can play darts and board games. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ideal Panorama Holiday Village HV-1 photo" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1475565.jpg" width="600"></div>

Reviews have repeatedly mentioned the friendliness and high professionalism of the hotel staff.  The maids scuffle the rooms whether you tip them or not.
