All rooms in local hotels are quite ascetic.  You should not particularly count on super-comfortable apartments, as, for example, in Turkey.  In Indian hotels, visitors only sleep.  Most of the time they spend on the beach and on excursions.  This should be remembered when choosing a place to stay. </p>

    <p>  According to independent reviews, the hotel Villa Anjuna 2 * (India) is located in one of the most favorite areas of the city among guests.  The institution, according to its level, provides residents with decent conditions for recreation. </p><h2>  About India </h2><p>  Those who come for passive relaxation, who hope to enjoy the beautiful views from the window and the romantic scenery in the vicinity and walk along the streets washed with shampoo, should say right away: they were mistaken in choosing the wrong country.  According to experts, India is a real country of contrasts, in the widest sense of the word.  But once you know her properly, she will forever enter the heart.  This is a beautiful, vibrant, full of smells and tastes, good-natured country.  There is no longer such a thing on Earth - travelers in love with it are delighted.  You need to get acquainted with India by traveling daily on a scooter, bike (they are conveniently parked) or any other vehicle.  This is how those who know and love it characterize the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hotel Villa Anjuna 2 * is an excellent choice for accommodation for people who are inclined to understand India.  The country is worth it, the authors of numerous reviews assure.  Just do not sit still, they advise, meticulously assessing the shortcomings of the hotel service - they can be present in any hotel.  And Villa Anjuna 2 * (India, the north of Goa) is no exception in this sense.  It is better, as experienced travelers advise, to tune in to daily magnificent, unforgettable discoveries - and India will fully live up to its most bright hopes, giving an impression that will not be repeated in any other corner of the world. </p>

Reviews contain a description of a wide variety of impressions.  The authors say that upon arrival, while the suitcases are still at the reception at the hotel, guests usually go to the sea. </p><h2>  Town </h2><p>  Unforgettable first impressions of the guests of Villa Anjuna 2 * (India, North Goa Anjuna).  On the way to the sea they are met by cows (these animals, according to reviews, are much smaller than our cows), sellers cheerfully call buyers into tents, drug dealers offer their goods. </p><p>  The surface of the beach (it will be interesting to know about those who were going to become a guest of Villa Anjuna 2 *) reviews are described as covered with reddish sand.  The soil in India is reddish, after rain it resembles plasticine. </p><p>  Usually the first impression of the city is formed immediately upon arrival.  Feelings that still seize on the way to the hotel Villa Anjuna 2 *, the reviews of tourists are characterized as negligent. </p><p>  On the streets, as tourists say, a huge amount of garbage is slippery, wet and dirty under your feet during the rainy season.  The air resembles a steam room, and in the rain it is also watered from above.  Along with ordinary buildings, an abundance of some shacks is surprising here, sometimes a house consists of four pegs hammered into the ground and a film stretched on top.  Tourists are also surprised that people can easily wash themselves right on the street, women with their bare hands collect garbage along the roads, which they then carry in a huge bag on their heads.  Cows and dogs roam the streets everywhere. </p><p>  People on the street are smiling sweetly at visitors, and if they smile back, they are observed to bloom and become happier.  If you have difficulties with the language (and communicate here in English), you can contact Russian or Russian speakers living in Anjuna who will not refuse to translate.  Most importantly, the authors of the reviews advise, even if the tourist did not understand anything from what the Indians say, you need to smile, and then everything will work out.  But still, it does not hurt to know at least the basics of English, experienced travelers say. </p><p>  You should bargain with sellers in the market, and you can immediately drop 50-70% of the initial cost.  In stores, prices are fixed.  The rupee against the dollar: 59 - 61. The most unacceptable rate offer tour operators. </p><h2>  Hotel </h2><p>  After a fact-finding walk around the city, guests return to Villa Anjuna 2 * hotel and get acquainted with the territory and room. </p><p>  The hotel area is clean, in the morning you can watch from the balcony how everything is washed, cleaned, sweeping. </p>

    <p>  Some reviewers admit that in the first minutes after checking in, guests may experience a shock: the room is extremely ascetic, it resembles a room in a student dormitory.  But if you walk around the hotel, you can find more comfortable rooms with views and access to the pool. </p><p>  If you get a room on the first floor in the post-monsoon season (rain in the country lasts for six months), traces of dampness may remain on the ceiling, and the room will smell of dampness.  But on demand, the number will be changed to the best. </p><p>  If in the morning you leave the key at the reception, the room will be cleaned, towels will be changed and the bed will be redone.  According to the residents of the hotel, Wi-Fi here is a relative concept, since it practically does not work. </p>

    <p>  The hotel, according to the authors of the reviews, is "very personal."  Guests are advised not to wait for delights, for <span>North Goa the hotel</span> is quite good. </p><p>  For a company or a family of more than 2 people, tourists are advised to request a room with a terrace, because the hotel's terraces are large rooms themselves.  It is very nice to sit there for a cup of tea in the evening. </p><p>  Those who want to sleep at night, and not have fun, the authors of the reviews advise not to stay in rooms with pool views: Russian tourists like to sit out loud at night by the pool. </p><p>  The downside of the rooms is the lack of refrigerators: there is a fee at the reception. </p><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  Reviews recommend guests Villa Anjuna 2 * <span>(India, North</span> Goa, Anjuna) not to sit still, take a vehicle, map, and go to get acquainted with the city and country.  Watch is what. </p>

    <h2>  About local customs </h2><p>  Guests may not worry that anything will be stolen from them at the hotel.  Of the things that are left in the room, nothing will be lost.  On the street, too, no one will encroach on the guest‚Äôs belongings, even on the beach a backpack can remain unattended while tourists are swimming. </p><p>  The Indians, as the authors of reviews claim, for the most part do not know how to swim.  It is quite possible that a lifeguard on the beach, whistling to the whistle from the shore by careless bathers, is also not able to swim. </p><p>  Indians take pictures on the beach a lot, and pretend that they are shooting exclusively theirs, in fact, they are trying to capture tourists, white skin is a cult here. </p><p>  He may politely ask permission to take a picture together.  Guests are recommended if they don‚Äôt want something, you just have to smile and answer in English: thank you, no. </p><h2>  Food in the city </h2><p>  Guests of Villa Anjuna, like any other hotel in Goa, will be interested to know that in this city you can get acquainted with many exotic dishes, thereby enriching your experience of taste sensations. </p><p>  According to tourists, Goa fruits are cheap, tasty and "just wonderful."  The authors of the reviews acknowledge that some, for example, chica and custardapel, they have never tried before. </p><p>  Water is advised to use bottled water, it is sold in stores.  But some admit that sometimes they washed fruits with water from the water supply without negative health consequences. </p><p>  Coconuts (coconut) are also sold on the streets of Ajuna for drinking.  They are very tasty and satisfying (cost 50 rupees, or 47 rubles.).  Tourists are advised to try cane sugar juice (price: 30 rupees, or 28, 20 rubles). </p><p>  Dishes in restaurants and shakes, as the authors of the reviews put it, are ‚Äúindecently cheap,‚Äù including alcoholic beverages.  Vacationers say that for only $ 20 (1247.60 rubles), you can order lobster here with a side dish, for 1.8 dollars (112.28 rubles) you can buy a bottle of wonderful rum, for only 1 dollar (62.38 rubles) get drunk with wonderful papaya or mango jus. </p><p>  Reviewers advise trying local yogurt - lassi.  It is drunk with sugar, or with any fruit.  The drink is very tasty.  Of the dishes that you can eat in restaurants, they do not recommend buying seafood on the grill: they have a lot of garlic, in addition, they have an unpleasant aftertaste of smoke.  They also advise: do not try anything from the Indian menu: the dishes are tasteless, but very spicy. </p><p>  By the way, many restaurants already offer a menu in Russian.  The staff in them speaks a little Russian, so in Ajun the tourist will not be hungry. </p><h2>  Restaurant at the hotel </h2><p>  In the restaurant at the hotel Villa Anjuna 2 *, according to the reviewers, they also cook very tasty.  Waiters Krishna and Laki, vacationers share, will not let the guests get bored and cheer up with funny jokes. </p><p>  The hotel serves delicious food, according to the authors of the reviews, but the local food is not for everyone, not many Russian tourists like it. </p><p>  Breakfast consists of toast, jam and coffee.  Served in a very authentic dish.  You can also, having paid, have breakfast fully.  The authors of the reviews recommend that you take into account that you should pay for food right away, and not "later" at the reception.  Then you have to pay with interest.  The staff of the hotel almost never have change, so it is better to exchange money and give without change. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  Guests of Villa Anjuna remind that there is no private beach at the hotel. </p><p>  In general, there are a lot of beaches in Goa.  And it depends only on the guest whether he will be able to find the best of them.  Sand on the beaches comes in different colors: from various shades of red to white. </p><p>  The Arabian Sea, according to reviews, is very warm.  The waves are not small, as one would expect from the sea, but rather large, real ocean.  Seashells come into the water, inside of which real hermit crabs live, small crabs run along the sand on the beach.  Waves ashore agate and white marble sand.  It blows a very gentle and warm wind.  You can sunbathe at any time, except for the lunch period, when it is especially hot here (from 12.00 to 15.00), tourists advise, otherwise you can get sunburn.  It takes 15 minutes to walk to Anjuna Beach. </p><p>  If there are big waves at sea, you can take a taxi to other beaches.  Reviewers recommend Vagator Beach on the bay, where you can safely swim.  Taxi to Goa is very inexpensive, you can safely move. </p><h2>  Pool </h2><p> By the way, Villa Anjuna has an excellent pool.  Its depth: from 0.7 to 2 m. The hotel administration strictly monitors the maintenance of cleanliness in it.  According to the authors of the reviews, the pool is cleaned daily. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Reviewers recommend shopping in Panaji or Arambol for shopping.  There is also Fabindiya (Fabindia) - a good chain of stores where you can buy gorgeous cotton twisted scarves and bedding.  Souvenirs are better to buy at the market in the city of Maps, they go there on Fridays.  It is better for girls to cover their knees and put on a hat. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  Money can be exchanged directly in the hotel Villa Anjuna (there, according to reviews, a good rate).  If you are not lazy, you can contact the OXFORD supermarket (400 m) - there, vacationers say, the course is better. </p><p>  Hotel guests also recommend: when buying food (breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel are paid) it is better to give the seller small bills - large ones may not give change or will have to wait a very long time. </p><p>  Tourists who are going to visit Goa, the authors of the reviews are advised not to bring a lot of things.  This is especially true for ladies who love to bring evening dresses and high-heeled shoes with them on a trip.  None of this comes in handy.  Only a T-shirt (better than 2), shorts, a skirt (to the knee), and flip flops are needed.  It should be remembered why a tourist came: to show himself or to look at this wonderful country? </p>
