    <p>  Arriving at Tsnyanskoe reservoir, you should not neglect these rules.  At different times of the day and season, you can catch completely different fish.  In spring, fishermen expect to catch bream or crucian carp.  But not earlier than snow and ice will completely leave the reservoir.  Important: until this time, fishing in a pond is very dangerous.  In summer, fishermen catch zander and common carp.  True, these species of fish are difficult to catch, but in general, sometimes they succeed.  In autumn, perch bites very well, and in winter ruffs come across.  Therefore, Tsnyanskoe reservoir is quite popular among fishermen. </p><h2>  Vegetation </h2><p>  But besides the animal kingdom, these lands are also attracted by their diverse vegetation.
