The fish factory itself has sunk into oblivion and only ruins, several high-rise buildings and a name have remained of it.  And also - a clear sea with a large and beautiful beach, beautiful nature.  This is the main "magnet" that pulls people here.  More and more residents of Russia prefer to relax in Abkhazia, despite the devastation prevailing here. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  If there was a decision to relax in Pitsunda, the fish factory is located in the village of Lizawa, or rather, on its outskirts.  To do this, go through a small river that flows into the sea and separates the territory of the former fish canning factory from the village.  This amazing place is located in the depths of Pitsunda bay.  The Caucasus mountains surrounding it do not allow wind here.  Therefore, the weather here is mild and warm. </p><p>  The beach is located right in the Pitsundo-Musser Nature Reserve, where the famous relict <span>Pitsunda pine</span> grows <span>,</span> thanks to which the air in these places is healing, saturated with phytoncides secreted by trees, useful for the treatment and prevention of pulmonary diseases.  This species of pine grows only in the North Caucasus, in the region from Anapa to the coast of the Pitsunda Bay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  In the second century BC, the territory where modern Pitsunda, a fish factory, Lizawa village is located, was part of the Hellenic Greek Pontic kingdom, the port of Pitiunt was built here.  At the end of the first century BC, in this place, according to archaeological research, was a Roman fortress.  After the formation of Byzantium, the territory was part of it.  Since the 4th century, the center of Christianity in the Caucasus was formed in Pitsunda. </p><p>  It was in the <span>Cathedral of Pitsunda</span> that the relics of John Chrysostom, the greatest Christian saint, were buried.  In the XV century, the territory was a trading post of the Genoese and was called Petsonda.  From the 17th to the 18th centuries, it was ruled by the Ottoman Port.  The beginning of the 19th century was marked by the entry of Abkhazia into Russia. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPitsunda (Fish Factory) lies in the climatic zone of the Mediterranean subtropics.  Summer is long, warm.  The hottest month is August, at which time the temperature can reach 29 degrees, the coldest time of the year falls in January, when the thermometer drops to +11 degrees.  This is due to the location of the area in Pitsunda Bay and the Caucasus Mountains, which protect the territory from winds.  The swimming season on the beaches of Pitsunda is the longest in the Black Sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Population </h2><p>  In the Soviet period, the majority of the population were Russians and Georgians, after the events of the 90s, this part of the population left Abkhazia.

    <h2>  The territory of the resort </h2><p>  The village of Lizawa in Soviet times was a resort place.  Hundreds of vacationers came here from all over the former Union.  Near the village was a fish canning factory.  Several multi-storey buildings were built in which the workers of the enterprise lived.  Currently, it is completely destroyed. </p><p>  Vacationers from Russia took a fancy to Pitsunda (Rybzavod) because of the surprisingly clean and warm sea, as well as because of small pebble and sandy beaches.  Most vacationers, according to reviews, come here regularly, just because of these factors.  This is a relatively "wild" place, to which the benefits of "resort civilization" have not reached.  There are no entertainment facilities, the noise of the resort bustle.  Those who are satisfied with this type of vacation, and who want to relax from the whine and hustle and bustle of cities, can safely come here.  This place is ideal for families with children. </p><p>  Pitsunda beaches have always been popular.  In Soviet times, thousands of citizens improved their health here.  Currently, the resort is slowly recovering and gaining popularity.  This is partly due to cheap housing, relatively inexpensive food prices.  By the way, according to vacationers' reviews, food, fruits in Lizawa are more expensive than in Pitsunda, but the distance to it is only 5 kilometers and there is a bus and minibus. </p>
