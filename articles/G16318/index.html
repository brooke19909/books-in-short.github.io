    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  Representatives of the <span>ancient well culture</span> were carriers of the haplogroup (a group of similar haplotypes that have one ancestor, the mutation of which was inherited by descendants) R1a.  They are considered the first Indo-European shepherds. </p><p>  At the same time, the <span>pit culture of the early Bronze Age was</span> not uniform for all Indo-European communities.  She was adapted to the steppe living conditions.  In other climatic and natural conditions, Indo-Europeans created other civilizations adapted to them. </p><h2>  What is pit culture? </h2><p>  Genetically, it is associated with the megalithic culture of 4300-2700.  BC  e.  On the territory of Moldova, a community of Indo-Iranians formed.  Their early settlements are found on the coastal dunes of the river.  Volga and tributaries. </p><p>  The <span>pit culture</span> originates from the Khvalyn and Srednestogovsk civilizations.  The first was formed in the middle course of the river.  Volga, and the second - in the middle reaches of the river.  Dnieper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Early stage </h2><p>  The development of the <span>pit culture</span> took place in 3 stages.  The first period is considered to be from 1 half to the middle of 3 millennium BC.  e. </p><p>  <span>The word "pit", the meaning of</span> which is revealed in the process of studying the characteristics of culture, indicates a way of burying people.  They were buried in pits under the mounds lying on their backs and with bended knees.  The dead before the burial were sprinkled with ocher. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is pit culture" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1974544.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At an early stage in the development of the <span>pit culture,</span> people were buried head east.  Round-bottom and pointed-bottom vessels were placed in the pit, with stamped, carved, nakolchaty ornament. </p><p>  The settlements were temporary camps for herders. </p><h2>  Isolation of tribes </h2><p>  Along with signs of an early stage in the development of culture, graves with skeletons on their sides and their heads to the west are found in the Black Sea steppes.  In the burial pits there are egg-like dishes with a narrow neck, copper products, flat-bottomed pots. </p><p>  In the western part, at the second stage of cultural development, settled permanent settlements begin to appear. </p><p>  Within civilization, 9 local related tribal groups have been identified: </p><ul><li>  Volga-Ural. </li><li>  Ciscaucasia. </li><li>  Don. </li><li>  North-Donetsk. </li><li>  Priazovskaya. </li><li>  Crimean. </li><li>  Nizhnedneprovskaya. </li><li>  Northwest. </li><li>  Southwest. </li></ul><h2>  Third stage </h2><p>  It belongs to the period from the end of 3 - the beginning of 2 millennium BC.  e. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At this stage, local differences between groups are amplified.

    <p>  In the western territories, extended burials have been found.  However, not all of them have ocher skeletons.  Discovered burial mounds, pits with ledges.  Orientation is unstable. </p><p>  At this stage of development, the first large copper products arose.  Among them, for example, hammers, axes.  During the excavation, bone ornaments were also found. </p><p>  As a result of the spread of <span>local cultures</span> and the emergence of new civilizations, the <span>pit culture has</span> disappeared. </p><h2>  Occupation </h2><p>  Representatives of the culture were engaged in shepherd, mainly cattle breeding.  It prevailed over agriculture. </p><p>  Herds consisted mainly of cattle.  Bulls were the pulling force, despite the presence of horses.  The oxen were harnessed to carts with solid, massive wheels.  Meanwhile, part of the population led a <span>sedentary lifestyle.</span>  This is evidenced by the findings of the remains of pig bones. </p><h2>  Anthropological signs </h2><p>  Representatives of the Yamnaya culture corresponded to paleo-European groups. </p><p>  As N. Shilkina points out in one of her articles, people of that period had brachyric skulls.  Characteristic features were a strongly protruding nose, a low rounded face, and low orbits.  The average height of men was 173, and women - 160 cm. Outwardly, people looked like representatives of eastern peoples. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient well culture" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1974546.jpg" width="600"></div>

At the same time, representatives of other <span>anthropological types</span> were also present in the culture <span>:</span> high and narrow-faced, externally close to Caucasians. </p><h2>  Kurgan architecture </h2><p>  Most of the mounds were erected directly by representatives of the Yamnaya culture.  However, earlier mounds have been discovered.  As a rule, they are round or oval. </p><p>  There are multi-layered mounds and consisting of one embankment.  The latter are usually small in size - no more than 1.5 m. Rarely, the height reaches 3 meters.  The value varies depending on the number of embankments.  In multilayer mounds, more than a dozen fillings are often found. </p><p>  The elements of barrow architecture include cromlechs, ditches, stone facings. </p><p>  The moat is usually round in shape.  As a rule, it is associated with the main burial, but can also surround other embankments. </p><p>  A mound with cromlechs is a circle formed by stones dug vertically.  <span>The depiction of people on steles in the pit culture</span> was embossed or incised.  It is believed that such structures have a connection with the cult of the sun.  On stones there are images of not only people, but also animals. </p><p>  Archaeologists have found mounds with a combination of cromlech and moat.  Often the floor of the mound was lined with stone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meaning of the word pit" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1974547.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Patriarchy </h2><p>  According to many researchers, the organization of society was built on the patriarchal type.  It is possible there was a slight stratification of property.  However, there is no clear archaeological evidence for this. </p><p>  It is assumed that the structure of society was formed by three classes: </p><ul><li>  The brahmanas are priests. </li><li>  Kshatriyas are warriors. </li><li>  Vaishyami - ordinary community members. </li></ul><p>  It is believed that priests were at the highest hierarchical level.  A special role was played by female priestesses, although men were of key importance. </p><h2>  Culture spread </h2><p>  Part of the population migrated far to the eastern regions - to the Southern Urals.  Here, after some time, the main group of carriers of the haplogroup arose.  Subsequently, it played a crucial role in the development of Iran and India. </p><p>  As archaeological excavations show, people made trips from the Northern Black Sea region to the western and southwestern regions.  According to some researchers, they destroyed the Balkan-Carpathian Eneolithic tribes.  Nevertheless, the first burials with sketched and ocher-covered skeletons are found in Bulgaria, Romania and other southeastern territories of Europe at the turn of the Eneolithic and the Bronze Age. </p><p>  Presumably, the Pit tribes distributed during their campaigns not only Indo-European speech, but also new methods of metal processing, tools, weapons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pit culture early bronze age" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1974548.jpg" width="413"></div>

    <p>  A previously unknown technology for working with metal is associated with the formation of the Circumpontian Metallurgical Province.  It existed in the early and middle Bronze Age on a fairly vast territory surrounding the Black Sea.  The province was extended to the Urals, covering Mesopotamia, the Caucasus, the Levant, Anatolia, and southwestern Iran.  Accordingly, the territories of the Balkan-Carpathian tribes completely became part of the Circumpontian province. </p><p>  On this territory, cultures were combined that differed significantly in the nature of the economy, and in geographical position, and in the characteristics of the habitat of people.  In the northern part of the province, conditions were formed in which shepherding began to develop as the main form of management.  Representatives of cultures practicing mobile cattle breeding lived on this territory. </p><h2>  Strata of the population </h2><p>  During the heyday of the pit culture, horsemanship arose, large tribal unions began to form.  They attacked the population of agricultural territories. </p><p>  In tribal unions, there were "triads" - a popular assembly, councils of elders and military leaders.  The form of organization of society resembled military democracy.  It distinguished the most influential, powerful leaders who distinguished themselves in clashes with enemies for pastures and herds. </p><p>  There were people in cattle breeding whose activities were exclusively related to caring for animals.  They were engaged in treatment, grazing, milking, etc. Presumably, shepherds brigades with the head were also created. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is known about the pit culture" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1974549.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the final stage of the existence of culture, primitive types of crafts began to emerge.  In the late well-known period, exploitation of the labor of the lower layers of the population was used. </p><h2>  Funeral equipment </h2><p>  When studying the findings, many researchers conclude that the composition of the things that were present in the burial testifies to the social status of the deceased.  It is, in particular, about maces and scepters.  Such findings are not numerous, but are considered a symbol of religious authority.  Maces were considered a ritual decoration.  However, some researchers believe that their presence in the burial indicates that a woman is buried. </p><p>  Another evidence of the social status of the deceased is a polished stone ax.  In its form, it differs little from similar products made by representatives of other cultures.  The ax could have a scaphoid, triangular, rhombic shape.  The raw materials for the manufacture of weapons were sandstone, granite, basalt, limestone. </p><p>  In the pre-milking period, in the westernmost part of the steppe zone, axes were widely used.  They were made of hard rock and slate.  In the eastern regions, the population used mostly stone and flint flat axes.  These items fell into burial places. </p><p>  The steppe population of that time knew the technology of drilling stone.  This is evidenced by finds in the Khvalynsky burial ground. </p>
