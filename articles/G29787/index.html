    <h2>  Lelyushenko Dmitry Danilovich: a brief biography </h2><p>  Dmitry was born in October 1901 in the territory of modern Rostov region.  His parents were ordinary laborers.  From an early age he worked hard, helping elders.  A simple peasant family, like millions in the vast Russian empire, was in constant need.  Despite his young age, Dima noticed a huge gap between the "ordinary people" and the elite.  Therefore, with the outbreak of the Civil War, Dmitry Danilovich Lelyushenko joins the Bolsheviks.  His native farm Novokuznetsovka is under the occupation of the Don Cossacks.  In the spring of the eighteenth year, Boris Dumenko returned from the fronts of the First World War.  He organizes guerrilla pens to fight the White Guards.  Lelyushenko joins this squad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the battles of the civil war, the spirit of the future commander was tempered. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lelyushenko Dmitry Danilovich short biography" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1416704.jpg" width="400"></div>  After joining the regular Red Army, Lelyushenko participates in many liberation battles in the territory of Voronezh and Donbass.

After the Nazi invasion of the Baltic states, the <span>tank corps</span> fights with the invaders near the city of Daugavpils.  In August, the forty-first is engaged in the formation of new tank formations.  But after a few months he was urgently summoned to the headquarters of the commander in chief. </p><p>  In these difficult days for the country, the capital, Moscow, was in danger.  By Stalin‚Äôs personal order, Lelyushenko is entrusted with a special guards regiment.  In a record short time, Dmitry Danilovich forms a unit and goes to the front.  Fighters engage in battle with the tanks of Guderian near Orel.  General Dmitry Lelyushenko personally leads a nine-day battle in the region of Mtsensk.  After that, the fifth army is entrusted to him, and he occupies defensive lines near Mozhaisk.  In the battles for Moscow, he is injured and sent for treatment in Nizhny Novgorod. </p><p>  Already in the winter of the forty-first, Dmitry Danilovich returned to duty and carried out a successful offensive near Moscow.  After suppressing the resistance of the first shock army, it was possible to take the enemy group into the ring.  In the summer of the forty-second, the Soviet offensive against Rzhev begins, in which Dmitry Danilovich Lelyushenko takes part.  The biography of the military leader includes failure, but under Rzhev it was especially difficult.  One of the best German field marshals turned the city into an impregnable fortress.  Therefore, Soviet troops suffered huge losses here. </p><h2>  The liberation of the Soviet land </h2><p>  In the summer of forty-second, General Dmitry Lelyushenko launched an attack on Rzhev.  Having suffered losses, his army was never able to gain a foothold on the bridgehead.  But the fighters took revenge near Stalingrad. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lelyushenko Dmitry Danilovich biography" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1416706.jpg" width="600"></div>  The first guard army played a significant role in encircling the sixth army of Paulus and the defeat of the entire German group that besieged the city.

    <p>  After the beginning of the offensive of the Red Army on the entire front, Lelyushenko commanded the troops of the fourth Ukrainian front, which crossed the Dnieper.  In terms of intensity, these battles can only be compared to the battle for Normandy.  After the liberation of all Soviet Ukraine, the tank army participated in the offensive on Sandomierz. </p><p>  On the eve of Victory in the Czech capital began a national uprising against the Nazi invaders.  The rebels captured the city, but the desperate Germans decided to wipe Prague off the face of the earth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="General Dmitry Lelyushenko" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1418342.jpg" width="600"></div>  Their plans were not destined to come true: on May 5, Dmitry Danilovich Lelyushenko came to the aid of the besieged.  The family of the general recalls how he wrote in letters about the incredible gratitude of the fraternal Slavic people for the salvation of their country.
