  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a boat: choice of materials, procedure, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are many ways to make a boat out of paper or cardboard.  Such crafts are created at an exhibition at a school or kindergarten, they can be presented to dads on February 23, and glued on a sheet of cardboard with an application.  There are flat images, but it is interesting to design a three-dimensional product.  With boats it‚Äôs fun to play on the river or in the sea, letting them sail in the waves.  Crafts can be made from paper and cardboard, waste material and kitchen sponges, folded using the origami technique, constructed from newspaper tubes. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make a boat in different ways.  This is not difficult at all, therefore both senior preschoolers and younger schoolchildren can cope with work.  The described crafts can be seen in the photographs presented, so when making it is convenient to check the result with the author‚Äôs idea. </p><h2>  Volumetric application </h2><p>  In the older group of kindergarten, you can hold an application lesson, using not only colored paper, but also corrugated packaging cardboard.  The upper thin sheet must be carefully removed so that the lower wavy layer of paper remains, very similar in structure to a wooden boat.  For a sail, children cut a large triangle along the contours.  This will be the basis for crafts.  A white mast is glued in the center, made of a rolled up rectangle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.parentlane.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated cardboard applique" class="if uuid-2942429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2942429.jpg"></div><p>  Sails are decorated in different ways.  Confetti circles are attached on one side, and strips cut from colored paper are glued on the other.  A triangular flag is put on the top of the mast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Particular attention is paid to the background.  Before you make a boat, you need to carry out preliminary work.  First, sheets A-4 are covered with a blue, cyan or turquoise background.  After the workpieces have dried, the sheet is cut off by stripping.  Due to the tattered edges of the unpainted side of the sheet being visible, the illusion of white foam on the waves is created.  Since preparation takes a lot of time, sea waves can be done in advance, the day before the manufacture of the boat. </p><p>  How to make a boat so that it looks voluminous?  To do this, before sticking the vessel itself, you need to strengthen a small piece of corrugated cardboard at its location, and glue the craft itself on it. </p><h2>  Ship with pipes </h2><p>  You can make a boat out of paper with your own hands using toilet paper sleeves.  Get a large passenger ship with two volumetric pipes.  The background for the application is drawn with colored pencils or wax crayons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="applique boat with pipes" class="if uuid-2942405" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2942405.jpg"></div><p>  The hull of the boat is made of dense corrugated cardboard, cutting out the details according to the template.  On the lower part of the vessel, a red strip of waterline is drawn in gouache.  Use paint to apply strips on a lifebuoy. </p><p>  You can stick the hull of the vessel with PVA glue.  Separately, you will have to work on the manufacture of ship pipes.  The toilet sleeve is cut in half and slightly bent the edges inward.  Adhesive is applied to these folded strips and pipes are installed on the upper deck.  It remains only to cut out the porthole circles and attach in the right place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Easy craft for playing on the water </h2><p>  If you have accumulated a lot of wine corks, you can do the production of swimming equipment with your child.  Such a light boat consists of several parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="light cork boat" class="if uuid-2942378" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2942378.jpg"></div><p>  This is a raft of several corks tightened with an elastic band.  Insert a wooden skewer or any other thin plastic tube into the middle part.  Trapezium-shaped sails are cut with scissors from the kitchen rags.  The last step is to attach the flag to the top of the mast.  That's all, you can send the boat in swimming. </p><h2>  Origami ship </h2><p>  How to make a boat out of paper?  A step-by-step scheme of origami is located in the figure below in the article.  You need to act carefully, perform bends alternately and clearly connecting the edges of the sheet with each other.  They make a boat out of rectangular thick paper.  First bend the sheet in half horizontally.  Then turn the fold up and lower the upper corners, connecting them in the center of the workpiece.  The lower excess rectangles are bent upwards on one side and on the other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami boat diagram" class="if uuid-2942386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2942386.jpg"></div><p>  Then the work is turned to the side so that it turns out a rhombus.  Visually divide it in half and lift the lower half straight up.  It remains to turn the workpiece again sideways towards you, grab your fingers at the corners from above and pull them in opposite directions.  The boat turned out, it is desirable to smooth it out with his hands.  If the paper is thick enough, and all the folds are well smoothed, then the boat can float in the water for a long time.  It is interesting to play with him, as well as to do volume application. </p><h2>  Waste Material Swimmer </h2><p>  How to make a boat whose photo is below?  Do not throw packages from juice or milk, they will make a wonderful vessel.  It is enough to cut a rectangular piece on one half of the package in order to put the passenger. </p><div class="photo" data-original="funcraftskids.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="juice packaging sailboat" class="if uuid-2942376" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2942376.jpg"></div><p>  You can color a boat in different ways using gouache paints or pasting it with colored paper.  Further design depends on the type of ship.  If this is a boat, then attach a windshield, and if it is a sailboat, then install a wooden skewer and attach a piece of fabric or a paper sail on it. </p><h2>  Ancient ships </h2><p>  From corrugated cardboard, students will be able to make Viking boats.  These are vessels with a terrifying dragon on their bow, and the stern ends with their tail.  The Vikings often fought and made warships with a figure carved in front.  To make such an original ship out of thick cardboard, you need to draw a scan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="melaninmedia.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cardboard boats" class="if uuid-2942434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2942434.jpg"></div><p>  The bottom resembles the shape of a leaf with a truncated rear end.  Draw on the two sides of it the same side size.  The front part lengthens slightly.  This is necessary in order to strengthen the head of the dragon.  To attach the sides to each other, you need to add a small piece of cardboard at the back.  It remains to bend the rectangles to make benches and put the sails, sticking in one of them a wooden skewer with a sail. </p><h2>  Newspaper sailboat </h2><p>  Let's look at how to make a boat out of paper, a photo of which can be seen below.  The body of the craft is assembled from egg cells.  The deck and superstructure of the ship are made of newspaper tubes.  This is a popular material for children's crafts, so many masters already know how to make them.  If you have not tried to roll up newspaper tubes, you can prepare them from the pages of print media.  Not only newspaper sheets are used, but also magazine pages or A-4 white sheets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="newspaper-boat" class="if uuid-2942373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2942373.jpg"></div><p>  For bonding, you need a thick PVA glue.  The paper is turned angle to the master and with the help of a needle or pencil, the sheet is folded into a tight tube.  The edge of the paper is glued to the last turn.  When a lot of elements are done, start by building a deck.  Each piece after fitting is cut into the desired segments.  To install the mast, glue is applied to the end of the duct.  Additionally, thin ropes and flags are used.  If you have a glue gun on the farm, then installing masts on hot glue will be more reliable. </p><p>  The article gives instructions for making a variety of paper boats.  Choose the option you like and try to make it yourself.  Good luck </p>
