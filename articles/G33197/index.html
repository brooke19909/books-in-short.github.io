  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a flared skirt pattern yourself?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A flared skirt is a universal model that fits beautifully on any figure: it emphasizes the waist, makes the hips nicely rounded and creates a silhouette in the shape of an hourglass.  It‚Äôs easy to make such an outfit with your own hands, it‚Äôs enough to buy a suitable fabric, take measurements, build a flared skirt pattern, and then cut and stitch it carefully.  In just a few hours of work, the new outfit will be ready! </p><h2>  Material selection and fabric quantity calculation </h2><p>  Thin, well-draped fabrics are best suited for a sun skirt, in this case the material fits well in the figure and sways beautifully while walking.  For summer options, chiffon, crepe de chine, cambric will be a good choice, and thin wool for winter ones.  For a smart skirt, you can take satin or velvet.  If you like fabrics with a pattern, it is best to give preference to abstract and symmetrical patterns, so it will be easier to match them on the pattern and the flared skirt will look beautiful.  Consider that in this case the <span>consumption of fabric</span> will be more.  It is better to refuse knitted materials, as the product will stretch unevenly and as a result the hem will become crooked. </p><p>  The standard width of the fabric is usually 150 cm. With a skirt length of not more than 60 cm, a section of 165 cm will be required, and if you plan to sew a longer model, you need to buy twice as much. </p><h2>  Measurement and calculations </h2><p>  To make this beautiful model with your own hands, you need to take only two measurements.  To pattern a flared skirt with a belt on a button or button, you need to measure the waist volume, and if you want to make a skirt with an elastic band, you need to measure the volume of the hips.  The second measurement is the length of the product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Let's proceed to the calculations of the future pattern of flared skirts.  R is the waist circumference, it is calculated by the formula: R = 0.32 * ST </p><p>  ST - half waist, that is, half the volume.  In the case when you sew a skirt with an elastic band, instead of ST use SB - half hips. </p><h2>  Drawing and cutting </h2><div class="photo" data-original="apairandasparediy.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://apairandasparediy.com/2016/08/make-this-diy-circle-skirt-top-and-dress-using-the-same-easy-method/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flared skirt pattern" class="if uuid-2235850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2235850.jpg"></div><p>  A flared skirt pattern can be preliminarily made on paper, but the easiest way to draw is directly on the fabric.  Spread the material on a flat surface, such as on the floor or on a large table.  If the skirt is short, the fabric must be folded in half along the <span>shared thread</span> and secured with pins.  From the edge of the material, measure the length of the future product, then carefully draw a semicircle, the length of which is 1/2 from R. Then measure another length and connect the two points obtained with a large even semicircle. </p><p>  Since compasses of this size do not exist, you can use a shallow and long thread.  Fix the free end of the thread in the center of the pattern, tie the crayon to the other end, and then gently draw a smooth semicircle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.livemaster.com/item/12496173-sewn-sun-flared-bardo-a-warm-skirt"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wide belt flared skirt" class="if uuid-2235815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2235815.jpg"></div><p>  In the photo is a flared skirt with a belt, the pattern of which must be done separately.  To do this, draw a strip on the fabric with a length corresponding to R and a width of 7 cm. If you are cutting a long skirt of fabric with a pattern, you need to carefully compare the pattern. </p><p>  Cut the fabric along the lines marked with scissors and proceed to stitching.  Tuck the bottom edge of the skirt, sweep it, and then sew on the machine.  Sew a wide elastic band or belt and zipper to the top edge.  Flared skirt is ready! </p><h2>  Additional details </h2><p>  To make the product look more voluminous and interesting, folds can be made at the waist.  To do this, multiply the calculated number R by 1.5, and before sewing on the belt, lay the folds, pin them with pins, sweep, and then gently stitch on a typewriter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="glamoreux.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://glamoreux.com/author/glamoreux/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pleated skirt" class="if uuid-2235818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2235818.jpg"></div><p>  It is not difficult to make a flared skirt pattern.  To do this, you do not need to have special sewing skills or special knowledge.  Even if you are new to sewing, it is enough to act carefully, lay out the fabric evenly and do not rush to finish quickly.  Patience and attentiveness will be fully rewarded, and as a result you will get a unique, beautiful product that you can be proud of! </p>
