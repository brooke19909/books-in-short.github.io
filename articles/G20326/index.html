    <h2>  Playa de magalluf </h2><p>  As noted earlier, the hotel is built on the first coastline, some 200 meters from the beach of Playa de Magaluf.  The area is an important tourist center of the municipality of Calvia and the locals jokingly say: "Nightclubs, restaurants, cafes, bars and hotels are the landscape of Playa de Magaluff." </p><p>  The beach is located between Cape Punta de sa Torre Nova and Cala Vines Bay.  Playa de Magaluf boasts its size and snow-white sand, however, it is not of natural origin.  The beach was originally a swampy place that was used as shelter for smugglers' boats. </p>
