And can this be done at all?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As an analysis of the product lines of some Russian <span>banks</span> shows <span>, a loan to a</span> pensioner has been in great demand over the past few years.  However, taking it is not so simple.  Although the bankers themselves admit that the mentioned category of customers is one of the most conscientious and obligatory.  By the way, employees of housing maintenance offices could have said the same.  If, of course, it occurred to someone to ask them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loan to a pensioner" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/84745.jpg" width="440"></div>  Next, we look at several financial institutions where it is not so difficult to get a loan to a pensioner.  Although, of course, the special age of this category of clients and the modest amount of income make lenders behave very cautiously.  It should also be added that the above programs are not universal.  That is, we will not dwell on what kind of loan to a pensioner in Sberbank (consumer, you need to return when you reach 75 years old), we will not. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to get a senior citizen loan" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/84740.jpg" width="460"></div>  So, the first who offered a loan to a pensioner was Sovcombank.  His program provides that a citizen of Russia can apply for a loan, who will fully repay it before he turns 85 years old.  The maximum amount is 250 thousand rubles (or less).  Interest rate - 28% per annum.  This offer can be used by both working and non-working pensioners (old age, disability, who left early).  You can also use the Express Pension program: up to 30 thousand rubles at 33% per annum.  In this case, only a civil passport is needed. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loan to a pensioner in Sberbank" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/84742.jpg" width="225"></div>  Also, a loan to a pensioner can be issued by the Agricultural Bank.  As part of a special program, loans are issued in the amount of up to 100 thousand rubles.  Moreover, the customer pays for use only 15% per annum.  The terms of the program (by the way, it is called ‚ÄúPension Credit‚Äù) stipulates that a positive decision of the credit committee is possible only if a guarantor or co-borrower is involved in the transaction.  Alternatively, you can provide a liquid collateral. <br><br>  In addition to these organizations, the following is offered to a pensioner: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Bystrobank - up to 200,000 rubles at 26-35% per annum.  You will need to confirm income or provide a certificate reflecting the amount of the pension received. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Zapadny Bank - up to 250,000 rubles at 26% per annum (and higher).  To obtain a <span>pension certificate</span> and a civil passport are required. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Severgazbank - up to 100,000 rubles at 17% -21.5% per annum.  It is impossible to do without a surety here.  Moreover, the bank requires the presentation of a passport, a pension certificate and a certificate of received pension (or 2-personal income tax if the client is currently continuing to work). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Promsotsbank - up to 100,000 or up to 200,000 rubles at 20% -21% per annum.  In the second case, at least one surety is needed, and in the first - no.  Confirmation of the amount of the received pension is also needed.

    <p>  As for the pitfalls, here they are the same as for standard loan programs.  To avoid future difficulties, it is better to find free time to keep company with an elderly relative during his visit to the bank.  Moreover, one should go not just like that, but with the goal of becoming a guarantor.  This will reduce the risk of refusal of extradition and allow hope for a lower interest rate. </p>
