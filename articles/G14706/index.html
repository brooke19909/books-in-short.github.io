Picturesque landscapes, a comfortable climate and incredibly clean air attract guests from the most remote regions of the country.  Of particular interest to travelers is White Lake in Kosino.  Reviews about the reservoir, which are left by tourists who have been here, make everyone at least once in their life look into this amazing place. </p><h2>  Kosino: the origin of the name </h2><p>  One of the promising Moscow districts today is considered Kosino.  In tsarist times, Kosino was a small rural settlement, which was famous throughout the nearest district for its lakes.  Etymologists still do not know what the origin of the name Kosino is.  However, there is an assumption that it was the location of the reservoirs that played a key role in naming the village.  In support, it is indicated that Kosino comes from the word "spit" (stranded, leading from the shore to the reservoir). <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake White in Kosino" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2627/678701.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Famous Kosino Lakes </h2><p>  In total, there are three reservoirs in the territory of the village: Holy, Black and White Lake in Kosino.  Photos of natural attractions make it clear why they got such names. </p><p>  <span>The holy lake is</span> shrouded in numerous legends.  It is believed that on the site of the modern pond used to be a church.  During the service, the building began to sink under the water that came from the earth.  For a long time, a cross located on the <span>dome of the church</span> peeked out from under the surface of the lake, but over time there was no trace of the building.  A similar fact led to the modern name of the reservoir. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  <span>The Black Lake</span> in Kosino has a more scientific name.  The muddy bottom, wetland and peat have a significant impact on the reservoir.  The water of the lake has a characteristic dark shade, which allowed the locals to name Lake Cherny. </p><p>  And of course, the most favorite place for tourists is White Lake in Kosino.  Photos taken in the area are striking in their beauty and picturesqueness.  The origin of the name of the reservoir is not covered by sacraments and legends.  On the contrary, Lake Beloe in Kosino has become one because of the clean shore, clear water and a beautiful bottom quality, strewn with light sand. </p><h2>  Where is Lake Beloe located? </h2><p>  Lake Beloe in Kosino can be found at the boat station: Zaozernaya street, 19. Kosinskie reservoirs are located outside the Moscow Ring Road, so it is difficult to get to the lakes on weekdays.  You can get to the natural monument by metro (Vykhino station) or by passenger buses that run on routes No. 737, 747, 772. </p><h2>  The pearl of the Kosino-Ukhtomsky district </h2><p>  Lake White in Kosino has an oval shape, gentle shores and dense vegetation around the perimeter.  According to historical records, the reservoir appeared during the ice age.  Indirect confirmation of this are household items that were used by local residents during parking.  However, Lake Beloye in Kosino was first mentioned only in the 15th century in the issued spiritual letter of V. A. Serpukhovskiy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The main attraction of the reservoir is the Orthodox complex, represented by three churches: <span>St. Tikhon, St. Nicholas, Holy Assumption.</span>  The construction of St. Nicholas Church dates from 1673, when it was a wooden building.  The reconstruction of the bell tower with the help of stone took place in 1826. </p><h2>  Holidays in Kosino </h2><p>  Of course, White Lake in Kosino enjoys tremendous popularity among tourists who decide to relax in nature.  The beach of the reservoir is strewn with fine brown sand.  There are small grassy islands.  The dense vegetation around the reservoir, represented by spreading birches, willows and oaks, creates comfortable conditions for tourists even in the most unbearable heat. </p>

    <p>  In warm time (spring and summer), biting is noted on <span>float fishing rods.</span>  As a nozzle, you can use bloodworms, dough, worms or potatoes.  Here live both roach and scavengers, as well as perch, crucian carp, ruff or carp.  In the fall, the perch pecks, if you use the fishing technique for live bait.  In winter, you can catch perch, ruff and roach.  For the convenience of tourists there are boat bases where you can rent a boat. </p><h2>  Environmental Issues Kosino </h2><p>  Lake White in Kosino today has a number of problems that have arisen due to a lack of oxygen in the water.  After the fishing and sports club "Fortuna" relocated to another place of deployment, the artificial aeration of the reservoir stopped.  Because of this, there was a massive <span>death of fish</span> in the winter. </p><p>  The main reason for this phenomenon is considered the wrong policy of the administration of the <span>Kosinsky</span> nature <span>park.</span>  If earlier the Fortuna club was in charge of the ecosystem of the reservoir, then after a court decision to seize the territory by this organization, the entire share of responsibility passed to the park administration.  However, the necessary measures were not taken.  Firstly, the condition of the water was aggravated, including after winter ice breaks, when there was a decrease in the level of oxygen in the reservoir.  Secondly, fishing became widespread, including repeated attempts by poachers to use nets on the lake.  These two factors played a key role in the fact that the ichthyofauna has lost its diversity.  In addition, the fact of the attenuation of water from a large number of surfaced fish affected the quality of leisure for tourists. </p><p>  Thus, today the question arose of preserving the unique ecosystem of White Lake in Kosino.  Only a competent policy of the administration, environmental organizations and the correct position of tourists will allow preserving the pristine beauty, picturesque places and rich flora and fauna of the famous triozero of the Kosino-Ukhtomsky district. </p>
