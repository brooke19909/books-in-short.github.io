Entertainment and attractions of Montpellier attract millions of tourists annually.  This ancient city, its history and interesting places will be described in this essay. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, Montpellier is located in the south of France.  It is the eighth largest city, the administrative center of the Hero department in the Occitania region.  The city is conveniently located 10 km from the Mediterranean coast, which makes it attractive for tourists. </p><p>  According to historians, Montpellier became known at the beginning of the X century as a place where there was a massive trade in spices.  Montpellier then could not boast of attractions, since at that time it was not so big and was in the shadow of the seaside Maglon. </p><p>  In 1141, the Count of Toulouse built a castle in these places and, thanks to its capabilities, Montpellier was given the status and authority of the city. </p><h2>  Development </h2><p>  Gradually, the city began to grow, a large number of people reached it.  The population was multinational, and one of the main roles in the development of trade and life in general was played by the local Jewish community. </p><p>  In 1220, a university was founded here, which was legalized by the papal bull in 1289. People come here from all over the country to study medicine and other sciences.  The descendants of the founder of Montpellier owned the city until 1349, but sold it to the French monarchs. </p><p>  Over time, the city became the largest commercial center of the kingdom and remained so until the development and elevation of Marseille.  With the development of the city, sights in Montpellier began to appear gradually.  In 1536, the episcopal department was transferred here from Maglon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Montpellier begins to be actively built up, while using the most advanced technologies of that time.  Many of the architectural structures have survived to our time. </p><h2>  Attractions Montpellier </h2><p>  Today the city is a quiet and peaceful place, which is rich in beautiful parks with diverse vegetation and alleys.  Tourist peak falls in the summertime.  There are numerous restaurants and cafes, boutiques and shopping centers.

The Comedy Theater is located here, which is popular not only among tourists, but also among local residents. </p><h2>  Fabre Museum </h2><p>  Having appreciated the sights of Montpellier located on the Comedy Square, then you should pay attention to the Fabre Museum, located nearby.  It was founded in 1828 by the famous artist Francois Fabre, and later began to bear the name of the creator. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="2015lesstagesfrancophones.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="At the Fabra Museum" class="if uuid-2972478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2972478.jpg"></div><p>  The Fabre Museum is one of the most important cultural regional sites in France.  It has an area of ​​more than 9,000 m², on which there are about 800 paintings belonging to different periods of painting, 900 prints and 3,500 drawings of the XIV-XXI centuries. </p><p>  Here you can enjoy the work of such famous masters as Poussin, Rubens, Veronze, Matisse, Renoir, Manet and Brueghel.  The museum presents excellent collections of works dating back to different eras - from baroque to impressionism.  In addition to classic paintings, here you can get acquainted with modern art and its various directions. </p><h2>  Abbey of Valman </h2><p>  One of the oldest historical sights of Montpellier is the Valmagne Abbey.  It was founded in the middle of the XII century and is still valid.  During its heyday, more than 300 monks lived here.  Today there are no more than 30. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.frankrijk.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Abbey of Valman" class="if uuid-2972495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2972495.jpg"></div><p>  It is believed that the Valmani monastery was saved from religious wars and revolutions thanks to the vineyards that surround it from all sides.  Currently, connoisseurs of architecture and lovers of European Gothic come here.  A beautiful architectural ensemble, arches decorated with stucco, preserved to this day, amaze with their beauty.  As in the Middle Ages, the monks are engaged in winemaking, and the drink they produce can be tasted in a cozy restaurant located nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Triumphal Arch </h2><p>  The list of the best sights of Montpellier includes the triumphal arch, which is called the "Gate of Peyrou".  She is one of the symbols of the city.  This monumental structure was erected at the end of the XVII century in honor of Louis XIV.  Several architects worked on the appearance of the arch until it acquired its current appearance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.destination360.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Triumphal Arch" class="if uuid-2972451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2972451.jpg"></div><p>  It reaches 18 m in width and 15 m in height, and its main decoration is exquisitely executed baroque medallions, which describe and depict various achievements of the king.  For example, the construction of the Languedoc Canal, foreign policy victories, the abolition of the Nantes Edict.  The Arc de Triomphe is often compared with the gates of Saint-Denis in Paris, which is quite true, because it was made in the image of Paris. </p><h2>  Peyrou Park </h2><p>  Top sights of Montpellier (France) also include Peyroux Park, located next to the Arc de Triomphe.  It was also created in honor of the sun king Louis XIV.  The park is located at the highest point of the city.  It took almost a hundred years to build terraces and build a water tower, which is called the Water Castle.  The tower through the aqueduct is connected with the source of St. Clement, which feeds the entire city with water.  With the help of the Water Castle, life-giving moisture is supplied not only to the homes of local residents, but also to numerous fountains located in the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turismodelmorrosquillo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Water Castle&quot;" class="if uuid-2972470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2972470.jpg"></div><p>  The main symbol of Peyrou Park was the sculpture of Louis XIV, sitting on a horse.  In addition to the beauty of the park itself, numerous tourists and local residents are struck by the breathtaking views of the city itself, which are opened to the eye from viewing platforms. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  The Botanical Garden is a must-see in Montpellier.  Jardin de Plant is one of the oldest gardens in all of France.  It was founded in the 16th century as a garden for medicinal herbs and plants at the University of Montpellier.  The decree on the creation of such a garden, which would be used by pharmacists and doctors, was issued by Henry IV. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2972503" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2972503.jpg"></div><p>  The garden gradually grew and took on the size of a huge garden, and in the 19th century the first greenhouse was built in it.  A variety of exotic plants and trees began to appear here, and a bust was set up to the founder, Pierre Belvall.  After some time, the garden was filled with busts of other famous scientists who worked at the university.  Some malls were named after them. </p><p>  Nowadays, the area of ​​Jardin de Plant is about four hectares, on which more than three thousand trees and plants grow.  One of the visitors' favorite places is the alley on which a tree with a hollow grows.  There, guests of the park put their notes with wishes.  Who and when began to do this is unknown.  However, this unwritten tradition is still being observed.  In 1922, the Botanical Garden was given the status of a historical monument. </p><h2>  Montpellier surroundings </h2><p>  After visiting the city, the question may arise about what to see next to Montpellier.
