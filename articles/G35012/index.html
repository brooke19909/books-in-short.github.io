    <p>  Mennella - a famous scientist - investigated the weather features that some of the islands of Italy have.  At the same time, Ischia received the title of the climatic pearl of the country.  Compared to Naples, the winters are warmer and cooler in the summer.  The island is located in a zone of stable mild Mediterranean climate, and all thanks to the diversity of terrain and location.  The microclimate of different parts of the island is not always the same.  So, in the western territories it can rain, and in the eastern - the sun shines.  This plays a special role in agriculture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Unique gift of nature </h2><p>  What, besides the sea and the sun, attracts many tourists Italy?
