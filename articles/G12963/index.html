To begin with, you can study the appearance of the transformer with the child, listen to the name of the details of the “toilet”, a detailed commentary on what it is intended for, mixed with enthusiastic emotions, which your guide will pour over his explanations.  The benefit of such a pastime is great, believe me.  You and your son will stay awake, join the world of his dreams and fantasies, learn better than he "breathes".  At the same time, you will receive the necessary recommendations.  When, how to make an iron man costume, it will become more or less clear to you, it is time to start collecting materials at hand.  First you need a jumpsuit.  With a collar under the very chin.  Or a tracksuit, just not very wide and thick.  It is desirable that it is not very new, because after you try to make an iron man costume based on it, you will not come in handy for anything else.  Ready to donate?  Then buy more food foil.  And not just more - a lot! <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make an iron man costume instruction" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/202997.jpg" width="250"></div>  And also glue, with which to bond the foil with the fabric.  This must be done diligently, carefully, so that the “metallic” does not get a little crowded, the material does not become loose, and the entire outfit looks natural.  To facilitate the work, proceed as follows: cut squares or rectangles of a certain format from foil and stick them on the suit.  If at some stages you find it difficult and don’t know how to make an iron man’s costume carefully, put on his details (jacket, pants) on the child and stick on it.  The role of the dummy, of course, is not too pleasant for the children, but for the sake of an excellent result, the son will not tolerate it either.  Suppose you jacketed your jacket.  Now the details of the finish.  Cut strips imitating overlays from a real suit on landscape or printable sheets.  Paint them with cherry, red or golden paint.  When dry, cover with a colorless varnish.  And stick on the jacket.  Here's how to make an iron man costume, instructions.  Follow her making out your pants.

Firstly, the jacket fastens with a zipper.  It must be left, otherwise it will not work.  Only the material of the snake should be tried to be painted either in the general tone of the clothes, or in the color of the inserts.  Secondly, as you noticed in the pictures, the iron man has emphasized relief muscles.  This problem can be dealt with if the shoulders are hemmed to the jacket from the inside.  The gloves that the comic book hero can have can be replaced with leather ones by borrowing them from, say, dad.  To paint or glue by and large is optional.  And the fact that they are large - well, corresponds to a fantastic image.  Well, and the boots.  The finishing option is standard.

    <p>  How to assemble an iron man costume if only the helmet remains unprepared?  With him, of course, more difficult.  But a man's cap, tight, with twists, can help out.  In it, make holes for the eyes.  The fabric is also “turned” into armor, like a tracksuit.  Or buy the missing part of the image in the store. </p><p>  But even if your little son is left with his head uncovered (he lost his clothes in the battle!), You still have a wonderful outfit.  After all, he was made with his soul and his own hands. </p>
