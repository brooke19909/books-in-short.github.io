Sony was not an exception, which often installs Carl Zeiss optics on its cameras and camcorders.  This is especially true for the low and medium market segment.  One of the most successful such products from this manufacturer was the <span>Sony DCR SX45e camcorder</span> , which was introduced to the general public several years ago.  More details about it will be discussed later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony DCR SX45e" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1670824.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  In general, the model is an inexpensive, elegant and compact entry-level device.

The <span>Sony DCR SX45e</span> is 123.5x52.5x57 mm in size.  At the choice of a potential buyer, Japanese engineers proposed several options for the color of the hull. </p><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  As already noted above, the model is quite compact, so the user can have no difficulties with its transportation.  The weight of the device is only 230 grams (excluding the battery).  The <span>Sony DCR SX45e</span> can be placed in a handbag or even inside the jacket‚Äôs pocket.  There are no problems with managing the model.  The feedback from the owners of the device indicates that the camcorder is conveniently located in the hand and does not slip out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="camcorder sony dcr sx45e" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1670821.jpg" width="600"></div>

It should be noted that even with strong magnification, the images are very clear.  This is achieved largely due to the use of a high-quality SteadyShot stabilizer in the camcorder.  It operates across the entire zoom range and does its job perfectly even under conditions such as shaking hands or shooting in motion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony dcr sx45e specifications" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1670827.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Camcorder control </h2><p>  The control is mainly carried out through the rotary, tilt-up display of the <span>Sony DCR SX45e camcorder.</span>  <span>The instructions</span> that come with the device will greatly help the user with its operation.  The display itself has a size of 3 inches and also acts as a viewfinder.  On it, if necessary, the user can view the captured video.  Thus, there is no need to connect the camcorder to a desktop computer or laptop.  Many owners note that you can specify the focus object through the touch screen very quickly, simply and conveniently.  Moreover, to make adjustments to the video process or change the mode, there is no need to interrupt the process. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Interface and Settings </h2><p>  As noted above, amateurs are the main target audience of the camcorder.  In this regard, in order to simplify operation, Japanese developers installed the most simple and intuitive interface on the <span>Sony DCR SX45e model.</span>  <span>The feedback from</span> most camera owners indicates that it will not be difficult to deal with the control even for a person who is using this kind of equipment for the first time.  This is largely due to the fact that most of the settings here are automatic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony dcr sx45e instruction" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1670825.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <p>  Intelligent iAUTO mode deserves separate words, the peculiarity of which is that when it is activated, all shooting parameters are set based on external conditions - distance, degree of illumination, and also the scene mode.  In addition, it is impossible not to mention the face recognition function in the frame.  In this case, the camcorder independently adjusts the parameters so that the faces remain in focus with any background, regardless of the movement in the picture. </p><h2>  Recording and storage of material </h2><p>  Model <span>Sony DCR SX45e</span> creates videos with a frequency of 25 frames per second in 50i format, in a ratio of 4: 3 or 16: 9.  The standard resolution is 720x576 pixels.  Thanks to the built-in microphone, the recording is accompanied by stereo sound.  It should be noted that with the help of the device the user has the ability to take photographs as well.  They have a resolution of 640x480 pixels.  According to user reviews, the photos are characterized by a fairly high definition, a decent level of detail and an almost complete absence of noise. </p><p>  All footage is recorded on removable media.  As standard, a 4 GB memory card is offered.  If desired, the device owner can install a more capacious drive on it.  The device supports cards of various formats.  Quite original can be called a connection to a laptop or computer.  In particular, this is done not through a familiar wire, but through a retractable usb port.  The kit also offers a utility with which the user can send the footage to Internet resources.  It should be noted that you do not need to install special drivers on the computer to connect the camcorder to it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony dcr sx45e reviews" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1670822.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Completion </h2><p>  As of today, the <span>Sony DCR SX45e is</span> already out of production.  However, in some household appliance stores this camcorder can still be bought.  Its cost is about 250 US dollars.  In general, the device is a very successful development of the Japanese company, which is able to plunge into the euphoria of a novice user.  First of all, this is due to the ease of management and the rather high quality of video materials that can be obtained for a fairly modest price.  As for the main drawback of the model, most users call it a short time without recharging, which is only a few hours. </p>
