In older models, it is present.  It is intended for users who own smartphones to pair with the radio and it supports synchronization with both Apple and devices on the Android operating system. </p><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  Car radio Pioneer is a new series of 2-din radio tape recorders with touch control.  The following functions appeared in it: "Bluetooth", synchronization with mobile devices and many other innovations.  Now the menu is Russified, which contributed to the growth of the model's popularity in the Russian market. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.manualscat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer MVH AV270BT Red" class="if uuid-2767367" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2767367.jpg"></div><h2>  Radio specifications </h2><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  The size </td><td>  2 din </td></tr><tr><td>  Media supported by the radio </td><td>  USB </td></tr><tr><td>  Formats supported by the radio </td><td>  MP3, WMA, JPEG, MPEG4, WAW, AAC </td></tr><tr><td>  Peak power per channel, W </td><td>  fifty </td></tr><tr><td>  The number of connected channels </td><td>  4 </td></tr><tr><td>  Radio format </td><td>  FM </td></tr><tr><td>  Saved Radio Stations </td><td>  24 </td></tr><tr><td>  Display Size Inch </td><td>  6 </td></tr><tr><td>  Screen technology </td><td>  Tft </td></tr><tr><td>  Backlight color </td><td>  red </td></tr></tbody></table><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": lukez84, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer MVH AV270BT in car" class="if uuid-2767364" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2767364.jpg"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The Pioneer MBH-AV270BT radio is the oldest model of the Pioneer MVH-AV170 radio.  She has become more functional and attractive.  Also, a bluetooth module was added to the new version. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A review of the Pioneer MVH AV270BT is worth starting with the fact that its design is similar to the younger model.  The control buttons are located on the left of the screen, flush with the body.  The input for using USB-carriers is located on the rear side of the radio, as well as the Aux.  Someone may say that this is inconvenient, but a flash drive sticking out of the radio can spoil the aesthetics of the cabin. </p><p>  The menu is similar to the menu of the old model, with the exception of the appearance of a new Bluetooth connect button.  With it, the car radio can become a hands-free headset, in addition, the user can listen to music broadcast from the device. </p><p>  Pioneer uses technology to improve the quality of your Bluetooth conversation, even when driving with your windows open.  Remote microphone also plays a role in the quality of sound during a conversation. </p><p>  To listen to music via Bluetooth, just find the radio in the bluetooth devices on your smartphone, then connect.  Repeated connections are not required, when you turn on Bluetooth on your phone, it will automatically connect to the radio. </p><p>  When using flash media, file navigation is as easy as using the old version.  All folders are supported by the radio, but if the card contains an unsupported media type, the corresponding folders and files become inactive.  When playing tracks, the player automatically opens, which displays the album cover, track name, artist and album name.  Now, with the new version of the radio, it is possible to rewind the track by clicking on any point in the time line (this function was not available in the previous version). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Pioneer MVH AV270BT supports all the most popular formats, such as MP3, JPEG, MPEG4, WMA and, most importantly - WAW.  Files with this resolution weigh a little, which allows you to upload as many tracks or movies to the flash drive as possible.  Watching movies is not the most important function of this radio.  After all, they buy it for high-quality sound despite the presence of a screen, which performs an auxiliary function here.  Thanks to him, you can very conveniently control the radio by switching tracks, movies and photos. </p><p>  The Pioneer MVH AV270BT radio has 5 equalizer settings.  There are also 2 slots for user settings.  In addition, you can change each frequency of any add-on equalizer, choosing the perfect sound for yourself. </p><p>  The rear panel includes a connector for connecting to a car, a connector for an external antenna, RCA connectors for using speakers.  There is also a connector for using the steering buttons, with which you can use all the functions of the radio from the buttons on the steering wheel.  The USB connector is also located at the rear of the radio for greater aesthetics. </p><p>  The sound settings of the radio are not limited.  There are also video settings, thanks to them you can change the brightness of the video, contrast, saturation and color correction.  The transition to the radio settings is very simple and straightforward, in addition, you can add any specific settings item to the "Favorites" for faster access. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gumtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer MVH AV270BT kit" class="if uuid-2767368" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2767368.jpg"></div><h2>  Analogs </h2><p>  Analogs of such a radio tape recorder are Pioneer MVH-AV190, Pioneer MVH-AV170 and many other 2 din radio tape recorders.  Such models are also produced by companies such as Kenwood, Alpina and Sony.  Each device has its own distinctive functions, such as the availability of Apple Car Play, Bluetooth, the ability to synchronize with devices on Android and Apple devices, an adapter for connecting to the steering wheel, an adapter for a parking camera, and other functions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pccomponentes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer MVH AV270BT view" class="if uuid-2767365" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2767365.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Due to the high-quality sound and new features, reviews about the Pioneer MVH AV270BT are most often positive than negative.
