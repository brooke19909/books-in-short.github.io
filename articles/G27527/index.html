This is a cultural holiday, monasteries and amphitheaters, ski resorts and amazing shopping.  All this and much more is Turkey.  It‚Äôs quite difficult to say clearly why it is worth going here.  But all travel programs can be divided into several categories.  This is a beach bliss and a complete excursion.  In the first case, the tourist does nothing, in the second he does not sit in one place for more than five minutes.  Sandy-sunny trips are most often made to Kemer and Alanya, as well as to Marmaris.  The latter is considered the choice of lovers of bar holidays.  And why, let's understand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="d resort grand azur" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1980388.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A place for families </h2><p>  Today, Marmaris, a beautiful resort located in a picturesque bay at the confluence of two seas, is becoming the choice of tourists.  This affects the formation of a unique climate and becomes a determining factor for the riot of lush vegetation.  It's hard to believe, but until the 80s of the last century there was only a fishing village.  But the wonderful nature, climate and gentle sea did not go unnoticed, and soon the first hotel was built here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today it is a real gem of Turkey.  Hotels are located on the first coastline.  There is a small port and a yacht club.  Separately, it must be said about Bar Street.  This is really a street of bars.  It has at least a hundred different establishments with sea views.  You can choose any for yourself.  Just two kilometers from the city of Marmaris is a beautiful park - hotel D Resort Grand Azur.  This is the only institution in the city that has its own territory, a real <span>green park</span> where you can walk and breathe air, swim in the pool and enjoy life. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  D Resort Grand Azur is located in the resort town of Marmaris, near the castle of the same name.  This is an elegant and very beautiful five star beach hotel.  At the same time, the city center is literally ten minutes away, that is, all the shops and restaurants, snack bars and tourist attractions are open to all tourists.  The hotel opened its doors to guests twenty-five years ago, but today it is not the same as it was before.  In 2013, a complete reconstruction was carried out, after which it was completely renovated, he again began to give people rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="d resort grand azur marmaris" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1980362.jpg" width="600"></div>

Especially for their convenience, a shuttle service is organized, that is, guests are met at the airport and delivered to the place.  From Antalya Airport to Marmaris is about 227 km, and if you are tired after the flight, then this service will be very useful.  It is paid and available upon prior request when booking at D Resort Grand Azur.  But if you did not have time or did not think about ordering a transfer, then there is nothing to worry about.  At the airport, buses and taxis are always on duty, which will deliver to the place.  The only point is that you need to learn a few phrases in English. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="d resort grand azur 5" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1980355.jpg" width="545"></div>

    <h2>  Catering for tourists </h2><p>  Turkey is well known among Russian tourists for the fact that the rest here takes place on the system of "all inclusive", or All Inclusive.  This is very convenient, because when buying a ticket, you already pay all the basic expenses.  Additionally, you can take money with you on excursions and entertainment.  But even if there is no extra money, you can spend a wonderful vacation without needing anything.  Therefore, in 70% of cases, if you ask our compatriot where he will go next summer, he will answer - Turkey, Marmaris. </p><p>  D Resort Grand Azur 5 is the best hotel in this sunny beach, which, as part of the overall concept, provides guests with 24-hour meals.  In addition to hot dishes and snacks, local and imported alcoholic and refreshing drinks, beer, tea and coffee are waiting for you.  The free (that is, already paid) package includes fruits and sweets.  Only wines and spirits are paid by tourists on their own, at will. </p><p>  According to the current schedule, a rich buffet is served in the central hall of the restaurant.  Here, every gourmet can find something that will delight his spoiled taste.  Local, traditional and Mediterranean dishes are prepared daily by professional chefs in such abundance that it is simply impossible to stay hungry here.  Around the clock you are waiting in the cozy lobby bar.  In addition to the hospitable atmosphere, here you will find a rich selection of local and international drinks, pastries and sweets.  The stunning craftsmanship of local chefs is noted by numerous warm reviews.  D Resort Grand Azur is waiting for you at any time of the year, and regardless of the season it is ready to surprise with a luxurious variety of dishes and desserts, including berries and delicate fruits. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  The five-story building is equipped with an elevator, which is very convenient for those who have small children or elderly parents.  An elevator will take you to the beach, which also solves many problems at once.  On the territory there are excellent swimming pools that allow you to have a great rest without leaving its borders.  If you have several small children, then from the first day you will appreciate the importance of such a service. </p><p>  The outdoor pool is equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas, which is an excellent relaxation area.  There is also an equipped indoor pool with water slides.  Outdoor enthusiasts can sign up for aerobics classes.  It offers a full gym and Turkish bath, a magnificent sauna and jacuzzi. </p><h2>  At extra charge </h2><p>  If the above services were not enough, then there is the opportunity to diversify your leisure.  For dear guests, there is a massage room where real professionals will perform a therapeutic or relaxation program.  There is a beautiful tennis court on site, where rackets and balls are issued for a fee.  There are tables for table tennis and billiards, bike rental and equipment for water sports.  By order of the guests, live music is played in the evening.  Animator services are available, which is very convenient for parents who come on vacation with young children.  This allows you to spend a busy day for both adults and children. </p><h2>  For the smallest </h2><p>  Since we have touched on the topic of leisure for all family members, we dwell on this in more detail.  Among those who have already been here, there are many couples with children of different ages.  They all left the warmest reviews.  D Resort Grand Azur 5 * is an ideal place for adults and children.  The latter were very pleased with the program organized for them.  In addition to the fact that very friendly staff, delicious food and fantastic views from the windows of the hotels work here, it is also very fun. </p><p>  The program for children begins immediately after breakfast.  Parents can safely go about their business, on excursions or on the beach.  The day begins with a charge, followed by fun starts and competitions, relay races and creative lessons, solving mysterious quests and finding the stolen treasure.  By evening, happy and happy guys meet their parents and spend the rest of their time with them. </p><p>  Special furniture, high chairs in the restaurant and cots are provided for children.  In addition, there is a special pool and an interest mini-club on site.  Chefs daily create a children's menu that takes into account tender age and addictions.  Kids can spend time in the games room and on the playground, and in the evenings attend a mini-disco. </p><h2>  Hotel facilities </h2><p>  What else can you count on when booking tours at D Resort Grand Azur?  The hotel has a 24-hour front desk and an ATM.  The concierge is ready to provide any assistance at any time.  Room service is already mentioned above, it is cleaning, linen and food delivery. </p><p>  Want to spend your evening in a special way?  Then rent a car, for this you do not even have to leave the walls of the hotel.  Quickly filling out the necessary paper, go for a walk around the city.  And for more athletic tourists, there is a bicycle rental service.  Laundry and dry cleaning services are available on site. Ironing service is also available. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Since the hotel has been operating for several years, there are a lot of them.  We will try to single out only the most important thing in order to create a general impression.  I would like to immediately emphasize that for the most part the responses are good.  The hotel is quiet and calm, there are no noisy pool games and intrusive animations.  Well-organized food, no crowds that run for food.  In the evening, noisy entertainment and discos. </p><p>  But let's start again.  Checking into the room is quick, things will help to lift, and if necessary, unpack the suitcases.  At the reception, pleasant girls will wear special bracelets and tell you what services are included in the all-inclusive system, and what you can get for a fee.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  A large bed, upon request, they also put a nursery, a towel and bedding are snow-white, with a pleasant smell.  A wardrobe with enough hangers, a large mirror, in general, excellent living conditions. </p><p>  The hotel area is another huge plus.  Blooming, green, well-groomed, it pleases the eye.  I want to stay here, among the magnificent palm trees.  The pool is clean, there are always free sun loungers around it.  Very pleased and the pool bar, a huge selection of drinks and snacks.  But it is paid for all hotel guests.  Food is something that is not even five, but all six stars.  The variety of dishes is so fantastic that it's hard to even describe.  Every day on the table there are 6-8 kinds of meat and fish, salads and snacks, pancakes and rolls, desserts and fruits.  If you want to lose weight on vacation, then this is unlikely to succeed.  In general, a wonderful hotel, which I want to return every summer. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Traditionally, Kemer or Antalya is chosen for a holiday in Turkey.  If you want to diversify the program, then visit Marmaris.  This resort city is famous for its bars, but this does not mean that they all must be visited.  The cozy town is famous for its stunning nature and magnificent beaches that will delight every guest, even the most demanding one.  By the way, the five-star D Resort Grand Azur is designed specifically for demanding tourists.  Great service, friendly staff, comfortable rooms, amazing views from the balcony - all this and much more was created to make your vacation a memorable one. </p>
