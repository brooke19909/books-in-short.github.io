    <h2>  2 Star Hotels Rimini </h2><p>  It makes sense to compare it with others in order to understand what exactly is Hotel Orlov 2 (Italy, Rimini).  In this city, you can choose from almost six hundred hotels.  Of these, 69 are two-star.  Unfortunately, Hotel Orlov 2 stands out for its leading position ... from the end.  Of the rated hotels, it has the lowest average rating.  It also does not apply to the cheapest two-star hotels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The only thing that distinguishes it in a positive sense is that it is really close to the center.  Although there are still hotels that are even closer, such as Hotel Eriale or Villa Mirna, the overall rating is very high.  The most successful competitors of the Orlov Hotel are: Residence Maryel, Hotel Mary Fleur, Green Residence, Hotel Eriale, Hotel Greta, Hotel Holiday Beach, Albergo Colonna, Hotel Lora, Hotel Eriale.  Each of these two-star hotels has a lot of rave reviews and very high ratings. </p><p>  It is about Hotel Orlov 2 that the reviews are extremely mixed: from average ratings to enthusiastic and sharply negative.  The average score is 3 or 4 on a five-point scale.  On some resources, the average rating is 2 points out of five. </p>

    <h2>  Cheapest Rimini Hotels </h2><p>  Is the cheapest Hotel Orlov 2 (Italy, <span>Rimini)?</span>  <span>Reviews,</span> as well as hotel catalogs, indicate no.  Of the two-star hotels, the cheapest is Hotel Laika (you can rent a room for 1625 rubles), it is even closer to the center than the Orlov Hotel.  The following two-star hotels are slightly more expensive: Edy (1749 rubles), Villa del Prato (1785 rubles), Villa Donati (1806 rubles).  Each of these three establishments is highly rated according to reviews. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The cheapest hotel in Rimini is the Jammin 'Rimini Hostel (1416 rubles).  It has no stars, but it is popular and highly rated by tourists, breakfast is included in this price, the hotel is very close to the center (1.1 km). </p><p>  There are also three-star hotels in which you can rent a room at a price even lower than in Orlov: Hotel Melita (1487 rubles), Kursaal (1539 rubles), Costa Azzurra (1609 rubles). </p><p>  Note: the figures are as of the beginning of October 2016, the lowest prices have been selected, taking into account discounts, promotions, and special offers. </p><h2>  Horrible reviews </h2><p>  Oddly enough, many reviewers write that they decided to stay at Hotel Orlov 2 only because there was no choice, for example, only in this hotel a family or a company of three can stay in a room, plus this hotel is inexpensive for the price.  Below we consider the points that exactly the hotel liked by those who initially did not expect anything good. </p><h2>  The rooms </h2><p>  The rooms are not as cramped as some too picky travelers seem, albeit small.  In addition, many reviews mention that the rooms are cozy and well equipped with furniture, for example: a spacious double bed, bedside tables, huge wardrobes with mirrors, tables and chairs, a TV and even a safe.  Balcony - 3 meters, it offers a beautiful view of San Marino, Mount Monte Titano and the Church of St. Mary. </p><p>  As for the quality of the odds of sleeping.  It is not so rarely mentioned that mattresses are hard and uncomfortable.  One review said that one bed had a good mattress, and the other one was uncomfortable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Showers are very tiny.  They seemed cramped even to miniature young ladies.  However, experienced tourists who have visited not only Hotel Orlov 2 (Rimini Italy) know that this is ubiquitous in Europe.  Some reviews mention broken doors in the shower, which is very inconvenient, because during the use of such a booth water spills onto the floor.  ‚ÄúThere is water on the floor‚Äù is a fairly common complaint.  At the same time, there are many reviews saying that the bathroom is small, but always clean. </p><p>  Room cleaning is carried out daily.  Bed sheets and towels are in excellent condition, changed every 3-4 days, but more often on request.  It's free.  As for the change of linen and the cleanliness of the rooms, opinions differ.  Some tourists say that for their entire stay (12 days) bed linen and towels have not been changed even once.  Although it is noteworthy that it was these tourists who regretted that the staff did not speak Russian.  In addition, one of the reviews mentions that the used towels thrown to the floor remained in the same place until the end of the stay (more than a week).  What is this talking about?  Is it about dishonesty of hotel workers or about the fact that a person who calmly used the bathroom for a week, where dirty towels are lying on the floor, is at least unclean? </p><p>  Below you can see what the rooms at Hotel Orlov look like.  Orlov (photo below), according to the official website, offers this type of room. </p>

    <h2>  Noise </h2><p>  The nearby railway really makes a noise.  For noise-sensitive natures, this can be a serious drawback, but some of the reviews that wrote about Hotel Orlov 2 (Rimini) reported that they were so tired of walking and impressions for the day that they did not pay any attention to the noise, even ear plugs were not needed. </p><h2>  Table </h2><p>  The hotel has a bar where you can enjoy coffee with something sweet even in the early morning.  For breakfast, in Hotel Orlov 2 (Italy), in addition to coffee, cheese, sausage, sweets, jams, butter, toasters are served.  Plates replenish on time.  That is, no servings and no restrictions.  Breakfast time - from 7:30 to 9:30, two hours.  Although it is debatable.  Some reviews said that breakfast should be in time, and preferably before 8 o‚Äôclock, otherwise nothing will get.  Many called breakfast standard; some praised it very much. </p>

    <p>  What to say about dinner?  The owner (Emilio) personally finds out the wishes of the guests about dinner.  The cuisine is typical Italian.  The lack of soups on the menu and the abundance of pasta, fish, meat, lasagna, caprese - this is a feature not only of the hotel itself, but of the country itself.  If someone has individual wishes and needs to be prepared separately, for example, for a child, the hotel management will meet you without question. </p><p>  The portions are huge.  It would seem that this depends solely on the authors' appetites, and such an assessment is subjective.  However, regardless of who wrote the review - man or woman, what age, marital status, all unanimously noted that the portions are really huge. </p><p>  Dinner at Hotel Orlov 2 is not taken by all tourists, because numerous cafes are within easy reach, however, it should be borne in mind that the hotel is cheaper: here dinner will cost 10 euros, while in any of the street cafes - 15-20 euros. </p><p>  They cook deliciously.  But in assessing the taste of dishes, opinions diverged, although this is expected.  What could be more subjective than taste?  Some argue that the cook is a genius and created real masterpieces, others say that the food was very tasty, but at the same time they ate at the nearest cafes, and the restaurant visited the hotel only occasionally, while others said that the kitchen was very amateur and preferred Lunch and dinner exclusively in cafes and restaurants near Hotel Orlov 2 (Rimini). </p><p>  Reviews of some tourists are even sharper.  Some say that the food in the hotel restaurant was not always fresh, sour, poorly prepared, such as burnt potatoes, or unheated - even the most passionate pasta fans are unlikely to appreciate them cold. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel staff and host </h2><p>  It is difficult to say who is to blame for the conflict situations described in some reviews of Hotel Orlov 2 (Italy, Rimini).  The reviews are rather controversial in this regard.  Some say that the owner Emilio is very friendly, attentive and caring, always trying to solve any situation in the world, never raises his voice, attentive to children.  Many also noted that he is trying hard and loves his hotel.  He is very interested in clients.  The sincerity of the staff and the feeling of ‚Äúreturning from the excursion as if to your family‚Äù were noted by more than one person. </p><p>  At the same time, there are scandalous reviews where Emilio appears in a bad light: petty, jealous (?), Greedy, inattentive.  He wrote an answer to one of these reviews, from which it is clear that the author of the review did not behave in the hotel in the best way: she left the children in the room alone to drink and smoke, trimmed the children‚Äôs nails, dropping the trim on the floor, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Disadvantages of reviews </h2><p>  Perhaps the following disadvantages of Hotel Orlov (Orlov, Rimini Bellariva 2) for someone will not be minuses at all.  But someone is able to spoil the rest.  Therefore, it makes sense to know in advance what to expect. </p><ol><li><p>  Tourists who spend a lot of time on the Internet were very unhappy.  In the room on the second floor, Wi-Fi may not work, in addition, it is paid. </p></li><li><p>  There are no refrigerators in the rooms; bringing food and drinks not purchased at the hotel to the room is prohibited. </p></li><li><p>  In the second week, the menu begins to repeat. </p></li><li><p>  Very long service in the restaurant. </p></li><li><p>  There may not be curtains on the windows. </p></li><li><p>  For garbage - 5 euros per day, that is, bottles and boxes need to be taken out by yourself. </p></li><li><p>  Bike rental is only available for a fee, although other Rimini hotels do not have to pay for it. </p></li><li><p>  Some did not like the decor: bunk beds and white walls - evokes associations with the hospital. </p></li><li><p>  Save on soap, in the bathroom - a tiny piece. </p></li><li><p>  Cots (cribs) are not available in Hotel Orlov 2. </p></li></ol>

    <h2>  Reviews of Italians </h2><p>  It is clear that not only our compatriots stay at the hotel.  How do Italians respond? </p><p>  Most of the reviews are a few words, the maximum is sentences.  It is immediately evident that the owner in Italian warmly and verbose answers to the unfair, in his opinion, reviews.  For example, he found an extremely outrageous review, in which it was said that everything is old and dirty, noisy and poorly fed.  The response of the management of Hotel Orlov (Orlov, Bellariva 2 - 2 "stars") was full of outrage at this injustice, the owner was not too lazy to list what exactly is served for breakfast: cappuccino coffee, latte, croissants, 3 types of cakes, 5 types of jams, chocolate , cheese, crackers, biscuits, Pancarre white bread, 2 types of fruit juices, mineral water, toasts.  ‚ÄúIsn't that enough ????‚Äù  - asks the owner of the hotel.  As for the rest, he answers in style: why the author of such a bad review could not spend more money and not rent a room in a five-star hotel?  As for the situation, he commented that the situation has just been changed and corresponds to the level of the 4-star hotel. </p><p>  Another very negative review lists the following hotel flaws: </p><ol><li><p>  The hotel was almost empty. </p></li><li><p>  Close to the railway. </p></li><li><p>  A tiny bathtub without a bidet. </p></li><li><p>  A very small room, which was entirely occupied by two beds. </p></li><li><p>  They charge for air conditioning and Wi-Fi, although the latter is everywhere and free of charge - in this hotel it cost 3 euros per day. </p></li><li><p>  Very tight parking, on which it is so narrow that in order to leave, you need to move all the cars at the same time - 5 euros per day. </p></li><li><p>  The food is plentiful, but of poor quality, monotonous: for example, cold pasta with tuna, and then the same pasta with shrimp, or stew with potatoes, and then the same with onions and tomatoes. </p></li></ol><p>  The owner of Hotel Orlov 2 Emilio gives a detailed answer to all these claims, indicating that the review is full of inaccuracies: </p><ol><li><p>  Wi-Fi fee is 3 euros per day, but for the entire stay, and this is indicated when booking. </p></li><li><p>  Parking fees are also shown at time of booking. </p></li><li><p>  There was also a third bed in this client‚Äôs room, can such a room be considered cramped? </p></li><li><p>  If you wanted something different for lunch, why didn‚Äôt the client say so and why did he make orders? </p></li></ol><p>  There are also positive reviews from Italians.  Moreover, they look pretty convincing, because the authors do not forget to indicate that Hotel Orlov 2 (Rimini) is a budget hotel and is good for its price category.  As the advantages for the budget indicate: the price, friendly friendly helpful staff, comfortable sleeping conditions, cleanliness and well-groomed, delicious cakes for breakfast, private parking, which is not found in other hotels nearby.  As a minus: the proximity of the railway and poor sound insulation (dogs barking and even conversations of neighbors behind the wall are heard). </p><p>  Some mention uncomfortable mattresses, dilapidated furniture, to which the owner of the hotel regrets that the author of this review visited the hotel just before the change of furniture. </p><p>  What can be noticed, mostly families with children were satisfied, dissatisfied were single travelers.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that single tourists are more moody, perhaps the hotel is really better suited for families. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Many experienced tourists directly write that this hotel is not for those who are used to passive beach holidays in Egypt or Tunisia and sometimes want to lie comfortably in a spacious room.  Such lovers will be annoyed by the noise of passing trains, the crowded rooms and the typically Italian cuisine presented here is satisfying, but monotonous.  This hotel is a convenient inexpensive place for very active tourists who are inclined to explore the surrounding area up and down and do not sit for a minute, spending time on walks, excursions, and come to the hotel only then to have a quick meal, to exchange a few words with a kind master and fall asleep.  Many tourists rightly noticed that for such a low price (1700 rubles per day) you simply don‚Äôt notice any inconvenience. </p><p>  What is noteworthy, the hotel received the highest ratings from experienced tourists who have seen many hotels of different degrees of stardom in their lifetime.  They claim that the hotel is very good for their stars, some even said that the hotel is not inferior to other four-star hotels.  However, on the other hand, if you evaluate all two-star hotels in Rimini, the Orlov hotel does not look the best way against their background: there are many similar two-star hotels near the center of Rimini with much higher ratings.  Therefore, it depends only on tourists which hotel they choose. </p>
