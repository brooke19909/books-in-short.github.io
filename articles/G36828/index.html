The sights of this state are so diverse and attractive that thousands of tourists seek it here.  There are more than one and a half thousand museums scattered throughout the country.  <span>Monuments of historical</span> and cultural heritage are concentrated in the central part and in the northern territories.  For example, in Iasi County there are 526 archaeological sites, 580 architectural structures, 20 memorial buildings and 10 museums.  If we add to this list the picturesque nature, excellently preserved folklore traditions and the attractive region of Kotnar, famous for winemaking, then a trip to Romania can be limited only to this area, as there is simply not enough time to explore other interesting places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="romania sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/241047.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Numerous Romanian cities became famous for their unique architectural appearance, which is primarily associated with its rich history.  Due to the fact that many regions of Romania for a long time belonged to other states, this could not but affect their development.  That is why individual regions of the country have significant differences not only in natural conditions, but also in socio-economic terms.  If we take the old Romania, then this difference is manifested in the presence of various dialects, in national clothes, in the appearance of structures and residential buildings.  In order to draw up a specific plan for the tour, you need to find the sights of Romania on the map and draw up a specific route taking into account all the wishes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Where to start exploring interesting places, having arrived in such a wonderful country like Romania?

    <p>  But the interesting places that Romania is famous for do not end there.  Attractions noteworthy are located in the vicinity of Bucharest.  A huge number of historical monuments are concentrated here.  Among them are Getodak ruins, monasteries and churches, the construction of which dates back to the 16-18 centuries (Kretsulesku, Mihai Voda), the remains of Roman and Greek fortresses.  The most valuable architectural structures include Mogoshoiai Palace - a monument to the Brynkovyan era.  It was built in 1702 in the territory that previously belonged to the widow of Mogosh.  It is from here that the name of this majestic castle went.  In this building, a combination of elements of Western European and Eastern architecture can be traced. </p><p>  Brasov is the next city to visit when it comes to a country like Romania.  The sights of this settlement are architectural structures that combine various <span>styles: Baroque,</span> Renaissance, <span>Gothic, style of</span> late national romanticism.  One of the oldest buildings here is the church of St. Bartholomew, whose construction period dates back to the 13th century.

They can be described endlessly, however, in order to understand the true beauty of each monument, it must be seen. </p>
