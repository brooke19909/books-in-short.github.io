Can I get a loan to buy a home with a minimum number of documents and what conditions do banks provide? </p><h2>  Is a mortgage possible without a certificate of income </h2><p>  One of the main requirements of banks to customers is the availability of a sufficient amount of regular income for making monthly payments.  To confirm the financial situation, you need to provide a 2-NDFL certificate for the last 6 months. </p><p>  However, today's realities are such that a certain part of citizens either works informally, or part of their salary is not reflected in the documents.  There is no opportunity to provide an income statement, but this does not mean that they will be refused a mortgage.  If a few years ago, potential borrowers had to confirm the size of their salaries without fail, now many banks have simplified the process of registration.  A mortgage without a certificate of income is possible, but the conditions for it are much tougher than for standard programs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneywise.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage without reference" class="if uuid-2343564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78589/2343564.jpg"></div><h2>  Rate, installment and deadline </h2><p>  The conditions of banks that give a mortgage without a statement of income have their own characteristics.  The most important thing is the increased interest rate.  The percentage is on average 1-2 points higher than for classic mortgage programs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The refund period is short.  Usually the repayment of a mortgage without a certificate of income lasts no more than 20 years.  The first installment is more than under the terms of standard programs.  You must have at least 50% of the cost of housing purchased.  The availability of these funds is a guarantee for the bank of high solvency of the client. </p><h2>  Design Nuances </h2><p>  A mortgage without proof of income has several features: </p><ul><li>  The choice of programs is limited, since not every bank is ready to provide a loan to citizens without official employment, even on the security of the acquired object. </li><li>  Most banks issue a mortgage without a certificate of income only to participants in their payroll project.  If your monthly salary is not transferred to the bank card, then getting a positive decision will be more difficult. </li><li>  A small selection of real estate options.  Most often, banks offer mortgages in new buildings from their partner developers. </li><li>  If a client contacts a bank on whose card he receives a salary, then the conditions for him will be less severe, since information on solvency is already available in the database of a financial institution. </li></ul><p>  Despite all the nuances, such a program gives a chance to get their own housing for those who are unable to provide an official document. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ghl-ibiza.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage without reference" class="if uuid-2343582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78589/2343582.jpg"></div><h2>  What do we have to do? </h2><p>  How to get a mortgage without income statement?  You need to start by searching for a <span>bank.</span>  Customer <span>reviews</span> and recommendations of friends will help determine where to get a mortgage.  After choosing an institution, you need to start collecting documents.  Only a questionnaire and passport will be required.  Some banks request an additional identity document.  As it can be: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  international passport; </li><li>  driver's license; </li><li>  insurance certificate; </li><li>  employee ID. </li></ul><p>  Additionally, a spouse's or spouse's passport is required (if the client is married), as many banks register the applicant's husband or wife as a co-borrower. </p><p>  How to get a mortgage without income certificate?  You need to apply and wait for a decision.  The questionnaire is issued at the bank branch.  Despite the lack of official employment, it is necessary to fill out data on the amount of monthly income.  The figure must be real, as the bank will carefully check the sources of income.  You will also need to provide information about the work: address, name of organization, position, employer phone number.  On average, profiles are processed within 7-10 days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mortgagenetwork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to get a mortgage without help" class="if uuid-2343591" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78589/2343591.jpg"></div><h2>  What to do after approval </h2><p>  Next, the client is given 3 months to search for suitable real estate, after which he must provide documents for the selected housing: a document confirming the basis for the emergence of property rights;  extract from the USRN;  assessment report;  extract from the house book;  technical documentation for the object (cadastral extract, data sheet). </p><p>  If a mortgage without a certificate of income is drawn up for housing under construction, then title documents from the developer, a land document, an extract from the cadastral register of land, a building permit, a project plan, an agreement on participation in shared construction will be required. </p><p>  After the approval of the property by the bank, a mortgage agreement and an agreement on sale are concluded.  The transaction is registered in Rosreestr.  The purchased apartment is issued as a pledge to the bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.redfin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get a mortgage without help" class="if uuid-2343594" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78589/2343594.jpg"></div><h2>  Russian Agricultural Bank </h2><p>  As part of the program, it is available to receive funds for finished real estate, a residential building with a plot, as well as a new building from partners of the bank.

For state employees - 9.5%, for other customers - 9.6%. </p><p>  The rate for housing under construction for salary clients is 9.35, for public sector employees - 9.4%, for the rest - 9.5%.  The interest rate on a mortgage to buy a house with a plot for salary clients - from 11.95%, for employees of budgetary organizations - from 12%, for other persons - 12.5%. </p><p>  The rate increases by 1 point if the borrower refuses to insure life and health.  Requirements for loan applicants are standard: citizenship of the Russian Federation, age from 21 to 65 years. </p><h2>  "VTB 24" </h2><p>  Terms of registration: </p><ul><li>  down payment - from 30%; </li><li>  term - up to 20 years; </li><li>  amount - from 600 thousand to 30 million rubles; </li><li>  rate - from 10.7%. </li></ul><p>  It should be noted that the declared rate is valid only when the client is ready to issue an insurance policy, which includes insurance of the apartment, title and the borrower.  Requirements for the recipient of a loan: age from 21 to 65 years, a sufficient level of income for a monthly deposit of funds.  The presence of a permanent residence in the region in which the client applies for a mortgage is not required.  A loan is issued by passport and insurance certificate. </p><h2>  Sberbank </h2><p>  Mortgages without income statements in this bank are part of a program to purchase finished and under construction housing.  Conditions: </p><ul><li>  amount - from 300 thousand to 8 million rubles; </li><li>  down payment - from 50%; </li><li>  it is possible to obtain funds on the security of existing real estate; </li><li>  term - up to 30 years. </li></ul><p>  The rate on secondary market housing is from 8.6% (for young families), from 9.1 - for other customers.  For housing under construction - 7.4% (under the preferential program), from 9.4% - on basic conditions. </p><p>  For debit customers, improved conditions apply (the rate is calculated individually) and a simplified application procedure.  The request is considered only on the passport.  Persons who are not clients of the bank will additionally need one more identification document. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gobankingrates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage interest rate" class="if uuid-2343572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78589/2343572.jpg"></div><h2>  Sovcombank </h2><p>  Lending terms: </p><ul><li>  rate - from 11.4%; </li><li>  term - up to 20 years; </li><li>  installment - from 20%; </li><li>  amount - up to 30 million rubles. </li></ul><p>  The peculiarity of lending at Sovcombank is the ability to take a mortgage for pensioners.  The maximum age of the recipient of funds should not exceed 85 years. </p><h2>  Uralsib </h2><p>  The program may purchase housing under construction.  What does the bank offer: </p><ul><li>  rate from 9.4%; </li><li>  term - up to 30 years; </li><li>  amount - from 300 thousand to 50 million rubles. </li></ul><p>  The size of the down payment depends on the status of the client.  For salary clients, at least 20% of the appraised value of the property is required.  Those who apply to the bank for the first time need to have from 40% on the first installment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sellanyhome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage without reference conditions" class="if uuid-2343567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78589/2343567.jpg"></div><h2>  Transcapitalbank </h2><p>  It is possible to receive funds for an apartment in the secondary market and housing in a new building on the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  down payment - from 30%; </li><li>  amount - up to 12 million rubles; </li><li>  rate from 7.7% for up to 25 years. </li></ul><p>  For the bank to accept the request for consideration, it is enough to provide a questionnaire and passport. </p><h2>  Promsvyazbank </h2><p>  A feature of lending under the Promsvyazbank program is less stringent requirements for customers.  If most banks do not lend without proof of income of business owners, then this institution is willing to cooperate with private entrepreneurs. </p><p>  Bet on new buildings: </p><ul><li>  from 9.4% when purchasing housing under construction from partners-developers of the bank; </li><li>  from 10.8% for salary clients when purchasing apartments in new buildings from other developers (10.9% for persons who are not clients of Promsvyazbank). </li></ul><p>  Bet on the apartments of the secondary market: </p><ul><li>  from 11.2% for payroll clients; </li><li>  from 11.3 - for the rest. </li></ul><p>  The declared interest is applied only if the borrower is ready to draw up a comprehensive insurance contract.  The contribution is at least 40%.  Money can be received both on the security of the acquired property, and an existing apartment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chicagotribune.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get a mortgage" class="if uuid-2343587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78589/2343587.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to get a mortgage </h2><p>  When searching for a bank and a program, you need to proceed from your own initial data: how much is the down payment and how much you are willing to give monthly for paying a loan.  If you are a debit customer of a particular bank, then for starters it is better to contact him.  Banks are more loyal to their regular customers: the rate for them is 0.5-1% lower than for other individuals.  What to look for when choosing a credit institution: </p><ul><li>  Does the program involve co-borrowers?  An additional borrower (spouse or relative) can increase the chances of obtaining a mortgage, and also allow you to take the maximum possible amount, since the calculation of the loan will take into account the income of both borrowers. </li><li>  What is the size of the down payment.  Most banks require a deposit of at least 40-50% of the value of the property.  If this amount is too large for you, then you should pay attention to programs with a lower contribution.  However, keep in mind that the larger the amount you are willing to make to purchase an apartment, the higher the chances of approving the application and the better the repayment conditions. </li><li>  The cost of insurance.  When registering a mortgage without income statements and guarantors, the borrower must insure the acquired housing.  Additionally, he can take out life and health insurance.  Most often, insurance is already included in the terms of the contract, and its amount is distributed over the entire maturity.  Insurance can significantly increase the amount of overpayment, so it is important to know in advance about the cost of this service and choose the bank in which it is offered at the lowest rates. </li></ul><p>  A loan without proof of income is the best option for those in a hurry to buy a property or who are unable to provide a salary certificate to the bank.  It should be noted that taking a mortgage in Moscow without a certificate of income is much more difficult than using standard programs.  A plus is a good credit history and the availability of documents that indirectly can confirm unofficial income. </p>
