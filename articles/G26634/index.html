High Dynamic Range - expanding the dynamic range of a digital image</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The desire of smartphone manufacturers to make their products more attractive to customers has led to the fact that it is now quite difficult to find a device that does not have a built-in digital camera.  Dozens of megapixels, complex image processing algorithms, automatic range adjustment ... It would seem that it is enough to select the desired frame and press the button, and the rest will be done by automation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is hdr in the phone camera" class="if" height="207" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/thumb/a/1/0/8/6/6/0/1/1086601.jpg" width="600"></div>  Unfortunately, this is only partially true.  So, for example, an attempt to shoot a building against a bright blue sky will lead to a general excessive dimming, since in this case the brightest element is selected for the reference point, relative to which the remaining parameters are set.  If you interfere with the operation of the algorithms and manually specify the exposure, the result may be a building with an acceptable brightness in the picture, but with a white spot instead of the sky.  To overcome this, a special HDR mode is used, implemented in almost every modern digital camera, including models in smartphones.  By learning to work with him, you can be sure that the quality of the pictures will be perfect.  This abbreviation stands for dynamic range extension.  Thus, to the question: ‚Äú <span>What is HDR</span> in the phone‚Äôs camera?‚Äù  we can answer this way: "This is a special function of processing frames, designed to improve images by combining one final of several intermediate ones."  In general, quite an interesting opportunity, with which every owner of a modern smartphone is simply obliged to get acquainted.

HDR shooting assumes that the camera does not take one, but several frames at a time, <span>while</span> focusing on objects with different levels of illumination in the <span>background</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hdr shooting" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/thumb/a/1/0/8/6/4/2/0/1086420.jpg" width="600"></div>  Then the central processor selects pictures with averaged values ‚Äã‚Äãand combines them into one, which is offered to the user.  Thanks to this simple method, you can forget about objects that are too bright and not bright enough in one frame - everything is in balance.  Since this solution is completely software, for its use it is enough just to install an application that has a similar shooting mode.  Note that not all cameras preinstalled in the basic firmware of smartphones have this feature.

Even using it, the owner does not become a professional photographer.  The main problem is this: since the final image is formed from several intermediate ones, the apparatus itself and the objects in the frame should be motionless. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt=" hdr" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/thumb/a/1/0/8/6/4/1/8/1086418.jpg" title="" width="333"></div>  Otherwise, an unpleasant HDR effect may occur, in which everything in the picture looks blurry, doubles, etc. When using this mode, it is recommended to use a tripod.

    <p>  The next feature that should be taken into account is that in some cases, obtaining a picture with an average brightness is inappropriate.  For example, the silhouettes in the twilight, according to the photographer, should remain the same vague shadows, and not people in gray cloaks.  HDR shooting does not allow to realize this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  And finally, the brightness and contrast of pictures taken in this mode, in general, are slightly lower than in photographs taken in the usual way.  Sometimes this is very critical. </p><h2>  HDR Pro </h2><p>  Within the framework of the article, it is useless to try to describe all existing programs for smartphones in which the shooting mode with an extended range is implemented, since their number is in the tens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hdr " class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/thumb/a/1/0/8/6/4/1/7/1086417.jpg" title="" width="600"></div>  We indicate only a few.  One of the most famous programs in this group is the HDR Pro Camera.  Despite the fact that the release of new versions has been discontinued (the latest - 2.35), reviews about this application are the most flattering.  An additional plus is guaranteed performance even on the outdated "Android 2.2", which for some may be a decisive factor.  After starting, the user has the opportunity to choose automatic or manual mode.  In the second case, you can use the sliders on the screen to pre-adjust the brightness, contrast, color temperature with which pictures will be taken.  The program is distributed on a paid basis, but the cost is very affordable - less than 60 rubles.

    <h2>  SNAP Camera </h2><p>  Perhaps everyone who asked himself to choose a good program for photographing, came across a solution from the developer Marginz Software.  Snap Cam is very popular among many, due to several factors.  Among them are support and timely release of new versions;  some features are unique;  The program includes almost everything that can interest both professional and novice photographers.  In particular, when working with it, it is easiest to understand what HDR is in the phone‚Äôs camera.  To activate the mode after installation and startup, you must select HDR by rotating the graphic settings wheel (version 7.x.x).  It remains to take a picture.  By default, three frames with different exposures will be saved, among which you can choose the best.  The function of saving intermediate images, if it is not needed, is deactivated in the settings - HDR section.  In this case, the entire shooting process takes place completely automatically, except, of course, pressing a button.  Fans of "playing around" with the settings may be interested in focusing between intermediate frames, as well as milliseconds of delay.  The program allows you to adjust the clarity, brightness, resolution of images, cropping, etc. It is assumed to purchase a license. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="    " class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/thumb/a/1/0/8/6/4/1/6/1086416.jpg" title="" width="579"></div>

    <h2>  Basic functionality </h2><p>  The demand for HDR mode has led to the fact that more and more manufacturers of smartphones began to include in their operating systems an application for working with a camera, which initially provided for the possibility of taking pictures with an extended dynamic range.  However, when using stock (basic) solutions, there is no need to talk about the abundance of any additional settings.  For example, in the popular CyanogenMod assembly, clicking on three menu call points opens a window where you can enable or disable the use of HDR mode.  Parallel operation of this function and flash is not possible.  It is worth noting that very often an inexpensive <span>phone with a good camera,</span> shooting in normal mode, allows you to get better photos than more expensive, but with a low-quality matrix. </p><h2>  "Open camera" </h2><p>  That's what Open Camera is called an application that also deserves the closest attention from photography enthusiasts.  There are no less settings in it than in the above Snap.  However, to activate the HDR mode, a beginner has to study all the points in the settings.  In fact, access to the ‚Äúmagic button‚Äù can be obtained by clicking on the dot icon in the upper on-screen menu.  Among the items on the Scene list is HDR.  The quality of the final image is excellent, but the processing speed is one of the slowest among similar solutions.  Perhaps, in models of smartphones with productive processors, this delay is leveled.  To understand what HDR is in the phone‚Äôs camera, it‚Äôs recommended in practice to choose different shooting modes and compare the result. </p>
