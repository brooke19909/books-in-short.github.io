    <h2>  Resort specifics </h2><p>  It is hard to believe, but seventy years ago on this place there was only the sea and the sunlit coast.  Unlike the old Nessebar in the south, this resort is very new, created absolutely from scratch in the late fifties.  Therefore, counting on seeing some antiquities, historical sights there and simply Bulgarian color is not worth it.  Sunny Beach looks the same as most new-fangled resorts around the world.  But this is a very fun place.  Discos, night clubs, bars and restaurants are here at every step.  The largest and most famous attraction of Sunny Beach is ... it is its coast.  Here is one of the longest <span>beaches in Bulgaria.</span>  For ten kilometers stretches this fifty-meter strip of golden sand.  On the land side, the beach is surrounded by dunes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Where is the resort located Yavor Palace 4 * (Sunny Beach)?

Reviews repeatedly mention the central location of the hotel.  For many, this is a plus.  Those who like silence in the evenings solved the problem by closing windows with double-glazed windows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yavor Palace 4 (Bulgaria Sunny Beach)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1505253.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where guests are accommodated </h2><p>  Yavor Palace 4 * (Sunny Beach) is a rather large hotel.  In its four-story building are nearly two hundred rooms.  All of them belong to the same category.  But tourists, vacationing in large companies and having the opportunity to look at each other, say that each room is individually decorated.  There are bedrooms with walls and furniture of warm caramel and sand shades, which are conducive to relaxation.  And there are rooms with a "marine" theme, in which it is as if you hear the sound of the surf and where it is cool from the turquoise tones.  The windows and balconies, by the way, are furnished, either overlook the garden or the sea.  But the noise of foliage from the park and the splash of the cascade in the pool will lull you in the evenings.  All rooms have a private bathroom with shower. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
