Perhaps there are no such parents who would not want to protect their child from an unfavorable environment.  Therefore, many go on vacation to various health resorts, move to suburban homes or send a child to the village, where for certain reasons his days are not much different from each other.  However, not everyone has this opportunity, and for many, summer children's camps are the way out of this situation. </p>

In addition, educators do not give the child excessive indulgence, to cross certain boundaries.

You do not have to worry about the possible use of fast food and other harmful products.  Although there are exceptions to the rules, however, it depends directly on the chosen vacation spot.
