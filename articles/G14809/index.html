Moscow residents do not have to think about this for long: the Vorontsov Ponds park will always help in this matter.  This amazing place will shelter you at any time of the year and will charm you with its incredible beauty. </p><h2>  How to get to the place? </h2><p>  If you decide to visit this amazing corner of the capital, then getting to it will not be difficult.  You can get to the <span>Novye Cheryomushki metro station,</span> then take the bus number 616 or 721 and go to the corresponding stop with the same name.  Vorontsov ponds can also be visited from the metro station "Prospekt Vernadskogo", then transfer to the bus number 616 or 661. </p><p>  If you go by your own transport, you should keep a landmark on the street of the same name.  Using the navigator or online maps, you can easily find the right place. </p><h2>  Description of the place </h2><p>  Vorontsov ponds are located in the southwestern part of Moscow.  These places were especially popular in the second half of the 18th century.  It was during this period that the construction of a cascade of ponds began, not far from which a park was set up.  Picturesque places simply attracted tourists here. </p>

    <p>  In the Soviet period, the Vorontsov ponds were badly damaged: they were significantly damaged.  At the end of the Soviet era, they began to engage in restoration work, which allowed at least partially to restore the original appearance of this cultural monument.  Only five ponds survived, but their mesmerizing and soothing appearance compensates for all the shortcomings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modern period </h2><p>  Now the <span>Vorontsov</span> Ponds <span>Wellness Park</span> continues to develop and is proudly hosting guests from all over the city.  In its regular part, you can find plants whose age is more than one century old.  The oak grove located in these places is a true highlight for visitors, delivering extraordinary joy. </p><p>  Individual trees are real old-timers, they are already two centuries old.  To the noise of their spreading crown it is very pleasant to read the verses of the classics or just to walk along the alley, touching this wondrous antiquity. </p>

    <p>  At the address: Vorontsovskie Prudy, 3, there are a large number of companies providing various types of services to the population.  Among them you can find not only catering establishments and hairdressers, but even a veterinary clinic. </p><h2>  Forest part of the park </h2><p>  The park is not limited to ponds alone; its territory is quite large.  There is also a forest part in which forest inhabitants live: squirrels, birds, insects.  It is very interesting to watch them sitting on a bench.  Squirrels are courageous and even allow you to feed yourself directly from the hands.  Some guests visit the Vorontsov ponds for this very reason. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not so long ago, the park was subject to reconstruction, during which there was a complete drainage of the ponds, cleaning their bottom and <span>strengthening the banks.</span>  It is from them that the river called Ramenka originates.  After the reconstruction, the Vorontsov ponds earned the status of one of the most well-groomed parks in the capital. </p><h2>  Park Features </h2><p>  The park has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 40 hectares, which is quite a lot.  On this territory there are perfectly laid paths and a huge number of benches, they allow you to walk and relax a huge number of people.  At the same time, you can not only just sit on benches or enjoy the ponds, but also come with your family on a picnic and fry the barbecue.  For the youngest visitors there are playgrounds and park furniture.  You can always visit cozy cafes, and on holidays even pop stars give concerts here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wellness park Vorontsov ponds" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/1772214.jpg" width="600"></div>
