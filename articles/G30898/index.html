In these places beautiful sunsets are unforgettably, and meeting him in a boat is pure romance.

However, their attentiveness is not imposed on customers, everything is done tactfully.  The location of the Majestic Beach Comforts 3 hotel is pleasing. But the only negative is that it is difficult to find the road from the airport.  In this situation, it is better to take a taxi.
