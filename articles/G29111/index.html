With more than 100 factories, the region attracts Kiev businessmen, who, in turn, need passenger logistics services.  In addition, Zaporozhye is a city with objects of cultural heritage of all-Ukrainian scale.  One of these, included in the <span>seven wonders of Ukraine,</span> is the <span>island of Khortytsya,</span> one of the Ukrainian symbols and the place where the Zaporizhzhya section was located.  Zaporozhye is also a transit settlement for a trip to the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, to such resorts of the Zaporozhye region as Kirillovka, Primorsk, Berdyansk and others. </p><h2>  Communication Zaporozhye-Kiev </h2><p>  Nowadays, when transport systems are quite widely developed, it will not be difficult to get along the Zaporozhye-Kiev route.  You can take advantage of all possible means of transport, from the car to the train and plane. </p><h2>  Distance </h2><p>  The distance and travel time depends on the type of transport.  If you believe the cartographers, then between the points Zaporozhye - Kiev, the distance is 505 kilometers.  This is if you use the shortest path. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zaporizhia Kiev" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33695/770885.jpg" width="600"></div>

A train </h2><p>  Railway communication between these two settlements is provided by the forces of the State Enterprise "Ukrzaliznitsa".  Trains depart from Zaporozhye-1 railway station from the city of the same name and arrive at the Central Kiev railway station.  Both stations are located approximately in the city center.  Travel time depends on the selected train and ranges from seven to eleven hours. <br><br>  On the route Zaporizhia-Kiev runs two types of trains: class "Intercity Plus" and the usual fast train.  At the moment, you can get from Zaporozhye to Kiev by a choice of three flights.  Due to the difficult situation in the country, some flights were canceled. </p><p>  InterCity Plus trains run twice a day.  Flights number 732P and 736P from Zaporozhye depart at 15:52 and 23:12, respectively.  The duration of the journey for both flights is the same and is six hours fifty eight minutes.  <span>High-speed trains of the</span> South Korean production of the Hyundai brand of the Intercity and Intercity Plus class ply along the route.  Trains of this class appeared in Ukraine in 2012, as part of the transport development program for the Euro 2012 European Football Championship.  Initially, it was assumed that trains of this class would connect the participating cities of the championship, but later began to serve routes between other cities.  So, on the route Zaporozhye-Kiev these modern rolling stocks appeared. <br><br>  On Hyundai trains, passengers can use the services of two classes of cars: the first and second.  Accordingly, the first class is more comfortable due to fewer seats.  In the first class, according to the wagon diagram, there are four seats in a row, and in the second - six.  The cars are equipped with a convenient luggage compartment, climate control system, folding tables, TVs and Wi-Fi access to wireless Internet.  It offers passengers a mini-buffet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zaporozhye Kiev train" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33695/770886.jpg"></div>  Also, a night fast train runs along the route, which is much cheaper than usual and convenient for those who need to be in the capital in the morning.  Named train 072P leaves from Zaporozhye at 19:00, and arrives in Kiev at 5:58, which allows travelers to get a good night's sleep on the way.  The wagons of the Zaporozhye-Kiev train are of three classes: compartments, reserved seats and luxury.  The train runs relatively new, so the cars are pretty clean and comfortable.  Passengers are offered a standard set of services from Ukrzaliznitsa.  Average ticket price: reserved seat - 7 USD, coupe - 13 USD.
