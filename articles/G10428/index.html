Until 2012, it could be found on the Web under the name Polat Beach.  Then the hotel was completely renovated - both the building and the rooms.  Coastlight is a calm hotel with a homely atmosphere.  Of course, this is not a five-star palace in Kemer or Antalya, the animation here is rather weak, and the entertainment is mainly in the city center.  But tourists are often satisfied with the hotel, yet this is the real first line from the sea - it never gets any closer.  Let's see what this hotel looks like, in which resort it is and what they say about it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Coastlight hotel" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2000737.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Kusadasi: when is the best ride </h2><p>  This resort on the Aegean Sea used to be the headquarters of the famous Turkish pirate, and then Admiral Suleiman the Magnificent Barbarossa.  And now it is famous for its long and wide beaches, as well as picturesque bays.  The port of the city itself is especially interesting, where huge cruise liners call almost every day.  After all, Kusadasi is so popular among Europeans and Americans, because from this place it is convenient to make excursions to the famous ancient monuments, which we read about in the history textbook - Miletus, Ephesus, Smyrna ... And the city center will appeal to those who love Turkish exoticism - a network of oriental tangled streets, secluded coffee houses, fish restaurants and colorful colorful bazaars.  There is a beautiful promenade of Guzelchamly and an ancient fortress. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The weather in Kusadasi is such that it is best to go here in the last decade of spring, in June, and also in September.  The fact is that in July and August there is a peak in the tourist season, but there is intense heat.  If you intend to spend all the time on the beach, then you can go these months.  But if you want to see local attractions, choose the beginning of summer or autumn.  Then a breeze blows, and the weather is not hot, but comfortably warm.  And here is located the largest water park in Turkey.  And shopping in Kusadasi is also quite good.  Fans of snorkeling and diving love these places.  Fans of nightclubs can have fun in the morning at Bar Street. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Coastlight Hotel 4" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2000334.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there and what's next </h2><p>  Coastlight Hotel is ninety kilometers from Izmir Airport.  Turkish ‚ÄúHawaiollari‚Äù from Istanbul often fly there.  From the airport to the city center is a bus company "Havash".  Usually you can get to Kusadasi in two hours.  18 km away is the famous monument of antiquity - Ephesus.  The hotel is located in the suburbs of Kusadasi.  Its center is about 4 kilometers.  Go there for about fifteen minutes by minibus.  To the right of the hotel, a five-minute walk along the highway is the large Kipa supermarket.  There is also a shopping center.  Dolmushi (minibuses) ride along the highway, which can be used to get to the center of Kusadasi.  In the opposite direction the same bus goes to the National Park.  Near the gates of the hotel there is a grocery store, the seller is fluent in English, and his prices are reasonable, not overpriced. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  At Coastlight Hotel, everything is compact.  The territory is small.  There is a parking for guests, a library and a lounge for watching TV.  The hotel itself is a six-story building.  The pool is located directly at the exit of the lobby.  Tourists feel very comfortable here, although there are no huge parks and walking alleys here.  It is just a house near the sea.  From the coast there is a swimming pool, and right behind the house is a highway along which minibuses travel.  And to go to the beach, except for a swimsuit, you can not wear anything, because you get to the sea a few seconds after leaving the elevator.  In the evening, you can sit on the terrace right by the water or on the sand at the tables. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Coastlight 4: room description" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2000341.jpg" width="600"></div>
