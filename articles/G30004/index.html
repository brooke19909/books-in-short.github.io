The city was founded in 1604 and today it is almost 414 years old.  One of the main attractions of this small but very cozy city is Novobosornaya Square. </p><h2>  Tomsk city </h2><p>  In 1604, a fortress was founded on the banks of the Tom River, which was called Tomsk Ostrog.  After 25 years, the prison became the center of the region, artisans from all over Siberia came here to sell their goods. </p><p>  Ostrog also had strategic importance - protecting the Russian border, because in the 17th century raids of nomads were not uncommon.  In the 18th century, due to the expansion of borders in Northern Altai, the city lost its strategic purpose. </p><p>  In the 18th century, Tomsk was ranked among various provinces and provinces, and only in 1804 did it become the center of <span>Tomsk province.</span> </p><p>  Currently, Tomsk is the center of the <span>Tomsk region</span> , this status was assigned to it in 1944. </p><p>  You can often hear that Tomsk is the cultural capital of Siberia.  And this has its own truth, because in Tomsk there are six large universities, known throughout Russia and included in the top ten universities of the country, research institutes in the field of chemistry, nuclear physics, theaters, museums, galleries. </p><p>  The architecture of the city is also interesting, because the historical part of the city is kept in very good condition. </p><p>  Tomsk is famous for its sights, but the place to which all the guests of the city lead is, of course, Novobosornaya square. </p><h2>  Where is she </h2><p>  Novosobornaya square <span>in Tomsk</span> is located in the very center of the city.  The square is located along the length along Lenin and Sovetskaya streets, and along the width along Sportivny Lane and Herzen Street. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.4742855464874" data-lng="84.9516175312134" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/7/1/571.png"></div><p>  Getting to the square from any part of the city is not difficult, because there is a bus stop nearby.  There are shuttle buses No. 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 12, 19, 22, 23, 26, 30, 31, 32, 33, 36, 37, 52, 112 and many others.  Trolleybuses No. 1, 3, 4 also stop here. And from the side of Herzen Street there is a tram number 1. </p><h2>  History of the square </h2><p>  The history of Novobosornaya Square <span>in Tomsk</span> begins almost from the moment the city was founded.  Then, at the beginning of the 17th century, the land on which the square is now located was plowed under the sovereign arable land.  In those days, raids of white Kalmyks were not uncommon.  Therefore, the workers were constantly on their guard, in order to defend themselves if something happened. </p><p>  As mentioned above, in 1804 the city on Tomi became the center of the Tomsk province.  Soon, near the present square, a huge beautiful stone building with columns grew.  Currently, this building houses a concert hall, and then, in 1842, it was in it that the Provincial Directorate, and later the Physicotechnical Institute, was located. </p><p>  But why is the area called Novobosornaya?  After Tomsk was declared the center of the province, the city became interesting for the clergy.  And in the middle of the 19th century, the construction of the temple began in the center of the square.  This temple was an exact copy of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, which is located in Moscow.  Just after the start of the construction of the temple, which was called the Trinity Cathedral, the square was named Novobosornaya. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="tv2.today" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trinity Cathedral" class="if uuid-2249902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2249902.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the temple was delayed for more than 50 years, since in 1850 one of the domes collapsed.  After this incident, the construction was quiet.  But by the beginning of the twentieth century, the construction of the temple was still completed. </p><p>  The largest temple in Tomsk stood for only 34 years, and it was forbidden to conduct worship in it back in 1930.  In 1934 the temple was blown up and dismantled to the ground. </p><p>  The name of the square also changed.  On May 20, 1920, Novosobornaya Square in Tomsk was renamed Revolution Square, but in 1997, after almost eighty years, it again became Novobosornaya. </p><h2>  Rest place of Tomsk citizens </h2><p>  In the photo of 2018, Novobosornaya Square in Tomsk looks so elegant and colorful that it seems fabulous.  And this is not surprising, because every year before the New Year an ice town with beautiful ice figures, slides, ice rinks is created on the square.  It is in the center of the square that the main Christmas tree of the city is located, here on New Year's Eve residents of Tomsk and guests of the city come from all over the city to see the bright festive fireworks.  Since December 16, the main square of the city has become musical.  New Year's themed music sounded until January 8th.  Judging by the photo, New Year 2018 on Novosobornaya Square in Tomsk was held in a big way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.riatomsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Novosobornaya Square New Year" class="if uuid-2249922" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2249922.jpg"></div><p>  In the summer, the square is also not empty.  A small musical stage, a fountain, a monument to students are installed on the square.  Tomsk citizens often choose the area as a place for meetings, walks, and relaxation.  Also in the summer there are entertainments for children on the square, all kinds of trinkets are sold here, photographers and artists work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.glavny.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Novosobornaya square in the summer" class="if uuid-2249938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2249938.jpg"></div><h2>  Reconstruction </h2><p>  In 2017, the city authorities decided to reconstruct the square.  The reconstruction was launched in early summer and completed in early September, on the day of the city. </p><p>  During this time, paving slabs were replaced, the fountain lining was updated, new lights and benches were installed.  And in the summer of 2018, it is planned to greening Novosobornaya even more, to make additional flower beds in order to make the area even more beautiful and cozy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tv2.today" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reconstruction of Novobosornaya Square" class="if uuid-2249908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2249908.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Everyone in the city and those who have been here at least once surely have a photo of Novosobornaya Square in Tomsk.  After all, a square with a rich history is not only one of the main attractions of the city, but also a favorite vacation spot of Tomsk citizens of any age. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel-tomsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fountain on Novosobornaya Square" class="if uuid-2249939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2249939.jpg"></div><p>  The area is beautiful not only in the summer, but also in the winter, especially on the eve of the New Year holidays.  At that time, everything in the square was transformed, as if by magic: bizarre ice sculptures, a huge Christmas tree shimmering with hundreds of colorful lights.  Come to Tomsk, you will see everything with your own eyes. </p>
