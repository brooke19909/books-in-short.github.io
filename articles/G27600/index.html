    <h2>  Briefly about the organization </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the Ugra bank has a decent rating.  And he is growing tirelessly.  An increasing number of people trust the bank with their funds.  At present, the assets of Ugra Bank are 323,280,466,000 rubles.  Moreover, over the past month, since November, profit increased by 4.41% - by 13.65 million. </p><p>  It was founded in the Tyumen region.  The headquarters is located in Moscow.  It is interesting that initially "Ugra" emerged as a kind of "addition" to the "Promstroybank" of the USSR.  However, in 1992, the organization was transformed into a separate enterprise, which became known as a joint-stock commercial bank.  3 years later, in 1995, Ugra joined SWIFT, the international interbank system for making payments and transmitting information.  And since 1999, the organization begins to issue its own bank cards Cirrus / Maestro and Eurocard / Mastercard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But a real dynamic “leap” in growth happened in 2013.  In that year, the bank's assets increased 38 times.  Naturally, the rating of the Bank Ugra organization also took off - from 261st to 28th place.  And this was facilitated mainly by individuals who actively began to make deposits. </p>

    <h2>  Invest and earn </h2><p>  For this purpose, many people go to the bank "Ugra".  The rating of this bank is excellent, which means that you can trust it.  In addition, customers are offered very competitive rates. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Take, for example, the “Profit Year” contribution.  Available in three currencies - in rubles, dollars and euros.  The minimum investment amount is 100,000 rubles (1,500 $ or 1,000 €).  It is most profitable to open a deposit for 367 days.  Then the percentage is higher.  For ruble deposits, it amounts to 8.4% per annum (if a person has deposited less than 300,000 rubles on the account) and 8.5% (if the deposit amount is more than 300 tr). </p><p>  And there is a tariff "Maximum".  It is beneficial for wealthier customers.  The minimum deposit amount should be one and a half million rubles, and the maximum - 20 million. The most profitable solution is to open it for 151-180 days.  In this case, the most favorable rate is proposed - 9.2% per annum.  If, for example, a person invested 20,000,000 for 180 days, then after six months (if rounded up), he will receive a little less than 920,000 rubles in profit from interest.  What really is a good passive income. </p><h2>  Mortgage </h2><p>  Since everyone needs housing, but not everyone has enough money to purchase it, many decide to take a mortgage.  A considerable number of people turn to the Yugra Bank.  Reliability rating inspires confidence, and the conditions are transparent. </p><p>  People are invited to purchase, both finished and under construction housing.  Down payment - from 20 percent.  If the purchase is made by an individual entrepreneur, then its size will increase to 50%.  A mortgage can be issued for a period of three years to thirty.  The minimum loan amount is 300,000 rubles, the maximum - 10 million.  There is no moratorium on early repayment, but it is mandatory to insure the acquired property. </p>

    <p>  Bank "Ugra" reliability rating in terms of providing mortgages is not bad.  This organization is involved in the implementation of regional and federal programs to provide citizens with housing, so there is no reason not to trust it.  And the requirements for borrowers - as elsewhere.  Russian citizenship, registration at the place of stay, age of majority (21 years), at least secondary education, minimum annual experience, and last 6 months. </p><h2>  For corporate clients </h2><p>  Bank "Ugra" takes a solid place in the ranking of banks.  Largely - due to the trust of their corporate clients, who continue to actively use its services. </p><p>  They are offered loans, cash settlement, depository, brokerage and remote banking services, currency control, acquiring, documentary operations and issuing cards with special rates.  The latter service is especially in demand.  Bank cards are a great way to control corporate spending.  Thanks to them, there is no need to store and collect money, as well as keep a detailed record of the representation and travel expenses of the enterprise.  There are three projects - salary (for paying employee benefits), corporate (for managing company expenses), and collector (crediting large funds to the accounts of individuals and legal entities using an ATM). </p>

    <h2>  Other services </h2><p>  It is also worth noting that many financial institutions turn to Yugra Bank.  What place in the ranking of banks does this organization have - was said above.  And even financial institutions believe such a high level.  They are invited to attract and place funds in the money market (both in Russian and foreign currencies), 2-way quotes of financial instruments, opening correspondent accounts, custody services, brokerage services, securities transactions, and much more. </p><p>  Bank "Ugra" in fact can offer many more useful things.  Each service is profitable and good in its own way.  But, most importantly - this organization can really be trusted.  And the fact that tens of thousands of people use its services is a direct confirmation of this. </p>
