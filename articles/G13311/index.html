  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social communication: types, characteristics, goals</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Social communication is the <span>transfer of information</span> to large or small groups of the audience.  It is transmitted using symbols and signs.  With the rapid development of technology, this <span>type of communication has</span> acquired various forms, which, unfortunately, does not mean an increase in its effectiveness.  Also, some theorists see this phenomenon as a way of influencing large groups of audiences, with the help of which the goals of those who broadcast information are realized. </p><p>  <strong>Social Communication: Feature</strong> </p><p>  In the process of communication, 5 elements are involved, without which it cannot be realized: </p><ul><li>  Communicator - the one who initiates the transfer and forms it into speech, text, audio and video form; </li><li>  The message itself; </li><li>  The channel through which communication with the audience is established; </li><li>  The audience to which the information is directed; </li><li>  The purpose of the transmission and the level of effectiveness of the message (impact). </li></ul><p>  Thus, social communication is characterized by the presence of certain information that is distributed through a <span>communication channel</span> with a wide audience, its purpose is to influence people's behavior, emotions and feelings.  There is also such a presentation of information that is focused exclusively on the intellectual development of the masses and the expansion of their horizons.  This presentation is characterized by neutrality and the highest possible objectivity without evaluative elements. </p><p>  <strong>Types of Social Communication</strong> </p><p>  Some researchers, by social communication, understand not only the large-scale distribution of the message, but also the individual exchange taking place between two people.  Its usual form is conversation.  Despite the fact that this fits the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù characterization, more often than not SK is used in this sense when it comes to a group or mass of people.  Therefore, in this article we use a more common meaning. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  By type of audience, social communication is divided into specialized and mass.  The second category does not imply any specificity and is ready to accept any socially significant information. </li><li>  According to the source of the message, it is formal and informal: official statements by the authorities correspond to the first form, and, for example, rumors about the stars belong to the second. </li><li>  On the transmission channel can be verbal and non-verbal. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Social communication and its intention</strong> </p><p>  Intention is the goal.  A very important element of <span>mass communication,</span> because the quality of perception depends on this.  In modern communication, there are several types of intentions: </p><ul><li>  To spread knowledge about the environment, to inform people; </li><li>  To popularize the ideas of good, to draw the attention of the audience to <span>universal values, to</span> spread culture and reliable information about it; </li><li>  Impact on public opinion and consciousness, as well as the <span>emotional state of the</span> audience; </li><li>  Support and assistance in solving difficult problems, clarification of situations; </li><li>  The desire for a neutral and pseudo-objective coverage of events; </li><li>  Establishing a dialogue between the audience and the broadcast source. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Social communication and criteria for its effectiveness</strong> </p><p>  The basis of any type of communication is the establishment of a dialogue between the addressee and the addressee.  If it is installed poorly, or if the interpretation of the receiver of information is incorrect, then there is no need to talk about the effectiveness of communication.  Therefore, this topic is important when covering any type and type of communication. </p><p>  There are a number of criteria by which the effectiveness of this phenomenon is established: </p><ul><li>  A prerequisite is the communicator‚Äôs desire to clearly convey to the audience why he is publishing information, what is the purpose of broadcasting certain events. </li><li>  The next criterion is trust.  If the audience trusts the author-communicator and the means by which the message is carried out, then the dialogue can be successful.  The goals of the author and the audience should be consistent with each other. </li><li>  The desire to build material on the basis of universal values, making the right accents. </li><li>  Messages should not be intrusive or presented in an excessively neutral form: this violates their naturalness, and therefore reduces the effectiveness of the impact, associated with a lie. </li></ul><p>  Thus, the <span>effectiveness of communication is</span> easily achievable if you follow a number of principles for presenting information and clearly indicate your attitude to the audience.  Despite the fact that there are various types of communication, this article describes the most universal characteristics and tips that will be useful to everyone associated with the QMS. </p>
