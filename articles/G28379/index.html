Even those who have never been to these cities are well aware of it.  Montmartre in Paris is the home and work of artistic and artistic bohemia.  This was once known even to Soviet citizens who did not shine on a trip to France under any circumstances.  And those functionaries who were sometimes allowed to go there were forbidden to visit the Moulin Rouge cabaret in Montmartre.  But this is all in the past, today a trip to France is limited only by the financial possibilities of a tourist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="monmartre in paris" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/276534.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  Montmartre on a map of Paris, its history and geography </p><p>  This is the highest point of the city, and it is located in its northern part.  The height of the hill is 130 meters, and stairs have been laid to its top.  A tourist attraction and an obligatory point of sightseeing routes is Montmartre in Paris.  How to get to the famous hill?  In order to quickly find a bohemian region, it is best to focus on the snow-white domes of the Sacre Coeur Basilica, they are visible from afar.  But Montmartre Hill became the eighteenth municipal district of Paris only in the second half of the nineteenth century.  All the other centuries-old history of the French capital, he was outside.  But Montmartre in Paris quickly ceased to be an outskirts, when the poor part of the French artistic, literary and artistic bohemia began to move here in droves from the central regions of the capital.  Two circumstances attracted people to the creative professions - low prices for housing and premises for workshops and a good company of people who had already managed to settle on Montmartre Hill a little earlier.  Artists lived here whole communities, trying to minimize costs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="monmartre on a map of paris" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/276531.jpg" width="496"></div>  By coincidence, a special spiritual environment arose in Montmartre, in this aura masterpieces were created easily, quickly and in large quantities.  It is difficult to even list all the outstanding artists and poets who lived and worked on the crooked and humpbacked streets of a hill in the north of Paris.  Here a new art was emerging, opposing the official salon academism.  Most of the paintings of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, decorating the world's leading art galleries, have their place of origin in Montmartre in Paris.  People who worked here have made a coup in many areas of world art. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montmartre in Paris how to get" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/276532.jpg" width="500"></div>
