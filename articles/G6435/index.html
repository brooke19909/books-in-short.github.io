  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Types of car insurance</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Driving a car is not only fun.  It is comfortable, effective, but also risky.  Even if you are a law-abiding driver, and not a scorcher, there is always a chance of meeting an inexperienced or rushing motorist.  The condition of the roads, weather conditions also increase the likelihood of getting into emergency situations. </p><p>  The dream of any vehicle owner is that in the event of an unforeseen situation, regardless of the degree of guilt, the insurance company would bear all the costs.  Can existing types of auto insurance cover the damage received during the operation of a car or accident?  Alas, not always.  But regardless of this, all car owners become customers of insurance companies. </p><p>  The most common type of insurance is CTP, where the first letter of the abbreviation indicates mandatory.  Such was made not only by a decree of 2003, but also that, as they say, you cannot go far without it.  When <span>re-registering a car,</span> passing inspection, when meeting with the traffic police - everywhere this insurance policy is required.  Tariffs are set by the government and depend on the make and class of the car, engine power, driving experience and other factors.  Affects the amount of insurance and the number of people who will use the car.  Mandatory car insurance implies that the insured driver who violated the rules and is the culprit of the accident takes responsibility for covering the losses that the insurance company pays.  The maximum payout amount is 400 thousand rubles.  But very often with larger accidents or with a collision of several cars this is not enough.  The culprit must pay the missing amounts and restore his own car on his own.  To avoid this situation, you can resort to another type of car insurance - DSAGO, which allows you to voluntarily expand the limited framework of the main, as well as repair your car. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Relatively recently, types of car insurance replenished with another option - CASCO.  This view is most close to the dream of a motorist - to buy a policy and sleep peacefully.  The amount of insurance is the market value of the car.  Such policies are most often voluntarily acquired by the owners of new and expensive foreign cars, and those taking a <span>loan to buy a car</span> from a bank must purchase it without fail.  This option allows you to insure the vehicle against risks such as theft and damage.  The acquisition of such a policy is not cheap, but it must be borne in mind that cars older than 10 years are not subject to insurance. </p><p>  Therefore, owners of worn-out cars have to use DSAGO or <span>OSAGO auto insurance</span> only <span>.</span> </p><p>  <span>The insurance market is</span> still quite young and is under development.  Therefore, the number of proposed options is small.  In addition to the basic ones already mentioned, there are other types of car insurance - ‚ÄúGreen Cards‚Äù, insurance of passenger and freight vehicles, motorcycles. </p><p>  Whatever type of policy you choose, you need to understand that insurance is a business.  The more customers deposit money in the form of <span>an insurance premium</span> , the less insurance claims are paid, the greater the company's profit.  From the correct choice of the latter depends on whether you will cover your costs if necessary.  I would like to note that no matter what types of car insurance are used, their rules are different in different companies.  All conditions are described in the contract, which is often not read carefully, and you can find a lot of questions there that should be discussed in advance so that there will be no surprises.  The only reassuring thing is that both insurance companies and their customers are interested in having as few accidents as possible on the roads. </p>
