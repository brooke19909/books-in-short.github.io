  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tax breaks: a gift from the state.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When D. Locke wrote a great philosophical treatise on a social contract, in which he described the specifics of the development of the monetary system, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating banks, loans and, at the same time, taxes appeared.  It is not difficult to guess that since then, mankind has felt great distrust and hostility to this word, since they knew what it means.  A tax is a part of the money that every citizen of a country is obliged to pay to the state. </p><p>  It often happens that motivation is not given, but the amount of tax is still indicated.  <span>The monetary system</span> has become an occasion for the development of large-scale industry and technological progress.  But, on the other hand, in connection with the increase in our needs, our taxes also increased.  The modern state, which is carrying out various reforms, allows introducing tax benefits that contribute to lowering tax prices for individual representatives of the country who are deprived of full development.  Many people ask: what is the main purpose of tax benefits?  So, the state is trying to reduce your tax liability to it.  Installment payments can also lead to a complete reduction in tax payments. </p><p>  There are several <span>types of tax</span> benefits: </p><ul><li>  Depending on the object of taxation (children with disabilities, single mothers) </li><li>  Depending on the change in the amount of tax; </li><li>  Given the different tax payment deadlines; </li><li>  The term for the payment of benefits (there must be so-called holidays during which tax benefits are not provided). </li></ul><p>  Also, tax benefits can apply to children.  Recently, the government of the Russian Federation has provided the population with the opportunity to fully educate their children.  So, the law says that every new child who is under the care of parents should receive help from the state in the amount of 600 rubles per month (the earlier amount was 300 rubles).  Tax incentives for children include the following conditions: families that receive an average of 40,000 rubles.  per month, they have the right to use this service for all 12 months, since this salary is considered too low to support a child. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is also good news for parents with many children, allowing them not only to receive significant tax benefits (50%), but also to receive financial assistance from the government to support their children.  The monthly increase is currently about 1,400 rubles per month.  The bottom line is this: when paying tax benefits, the state does not take into account personal income tax, that is, it does not charge it from the population.  The employer does this for us.  Thus, making calculations, we can determine that each child will get about 182 rubles.  Similar tax benefits can each parent receive.  Despite the small amount, it‚Äôs still nice to feel that you are being taken care of. </p><p>  To get VAT tax benefits, every year you need to apply to the accounting department at your place of work, where you ask to give you tax benefits.  In addition, you must provide your copy of the birth certificate.  After the child's 18-year age, parents stop receiving these payments.  But if the child continues to study at a university, then payments can last up to 24 years.  As for <span>large families,</span> the benefits of personal income tax on children are even more increased.  For a third child, the amount reaches 3000 rubles.  monthly.  So, when calculating, a family with three children can increase their income by almost one and a half thousand rubles. </p><p>  Therefore, if you know that your family is also not without such an opportunity, get benefits for your children by contacting the accounting department of your place of work. </p><p>  So the state does our best to help us fully raise our children and feel help from the outside so that each of us is confident in the future. </p>
