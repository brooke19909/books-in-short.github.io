    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  So, Kihaad Maldives 5 * is a resort complex that spans 600 meters along the island and is surrounded by evergreen vegetation.  In walking distance in any direction - a gorgeous beach with white sand and colorful <span>coral reef.</span> </p><p>  This complex consists of 118 spacious villas and various buildings and areas that make up the entertainment infrastructure (bars, restaurants, SPA, etc.).  It is even difficult to call it a hotel.  After all, it is a well-maintained separate island, on which there is everything that vacationers need! </p><p>  By the way, this elite paradise resort was built in 2012.  Its total area in exact figures is 250x600 m. How to get to it?  All guests arrive at Male Airport, located on the island of Hulul, near the <span>capital of the Maldives</span> and the most populated city of the archipelago - Male.  Representatives of Kihaad Maldives 5 * usually meet them there and organize a seaplane transfer, which takes about 35 minutes.  Although there is another option - an internal flight and a boat.  The time is about the same.  Which option is more convenient for guests - they decide. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The service at Kihaad Maldives 5 * really deserves a solid five.  There is everything that can be useful to guests, any services: high-speed Wi-Fi, shuttle service, luggage storage, tour desk, 24/7 currency exchange, laundry and ironing, beauty salon, several large shops, and even a small business center with a conference room. </p><p>  In addition to the above, concierge services are provided, drinks and food are delivered to your room, packed lunches are prepared for the trip, and even waking up at the guest‚Äôs request. </p><p>  Speaking of staff.  Of course, highly qualified tourism professionals work here.  But how much language they speak will amaze anyone.  Thirteen!  Among them: Arabic, English, German, French, Spanish, Hindi, Italian, Indonesian, Portuguese, Ukrainian, Filipino, Chinese and, of course, Russian.  So no one should have problems associated with the language barrier. </p>

    <h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  In Kihaad Maldives 5 * everyone comes for two things - service and beach holidays.  The turquoise, perfectly transparent ocean and the cleanest beach with soft sand - the main thing here is entertainment.  But still, while staying here on vacation, you can do something else. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The complex has sun terraces and numerous pools (including panoramic ones) hidden in the shade of evergreen trees, a modern fitness center with many exercise machines and personal instructors, everything you need to play darts, billiards, squash, and two more tennis court.  There, by the way, trainers work who will teach beginners how to deal with a racket correctly. </p><p>  But what is really worth doing while staying at the Kihaad Maldives 5 * hotel is water sports.  In particular, riding a jet ski.  Who does not know how - can not worry.  After all, there is an instructor who will quickly teach a beginner, and if necessary, then he will provide support throughout the entire time of skiing. </p><p>  In addition, it is worth doing diving (everyone heard about the rich underwater world of the waters of the Maldives), swim with majestic mantas and order fishing at sunset.  If you manage to catch something, then the catch will be prepared in the restaurant as the guest wants. </p><h2>  Spa Salon </h2><p>  Naturally, it is also available on the territory of such a chic complex as Kihaad Maldives 5 *.  Service in the Spa-salon on top.  Even treatment rooms are categorized.  Some are designed for guests who want to enjoy Spa-services alone, while others are for those who came with their soul mate or with someone in the company. </p><p>  By the way, if guests are interested in massage, then it is not necessary to go to the salon.  It is also made on the beach.  It is worth noting that Thai, reflex and Swedish massage are especially popular here, as well as stone therapy (hot stones). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You can also visit the steam room, hammam or sauna, soak in the jacuzzi or sign up for beauty treatments.  Among them are body peeling, facial cleansing, body wraps, nourishing masks, aromatherapy, Spa baths, etc. A full list of services can be found individually or after arriving on the island. </p>

    <h2>  For the smallest </h2><p>  Some people with children take them with them when traveling to Kihaad Maldives 5 *.  The infrastructure of the hotel, as you could already understand, is quite developed, so the fact that there are entertainment for children here will not surprise anyone. </p><p>  On the territory there is a mini-club in which parents can leave their child and not worry about him.  The tutors are watching the kids there, and the organization of their leisure falls on the shoulders of the animators.  Entertainment programs, if you believe the reviews of parents, are excellent here - the children do not even want to leave the club. </p><p>  True, a very small child can not be taken into it, since you can only go there from the age of four.  But it's not a problem!  Guests can be offered the services of a personal baby sitter - a nanny.  She can be invited to the apartment and she will stay with the baby. </p><p>  I would also like to note that on the territory there is a playground for children, separate pools, and in the restaurants of the complex there is a children's menu and chairs for babies.  Everything is thought out, and this can not but rejoice. </p><h2>  Restaurants </h2><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the nutrition system in Kihaad Maldives 5 *.  Of course, a hotel of this level operates on an all-inclusive basis.  The following five restaurants operate on its territory: </p><p>  <em>1. Hanifaru Bay.</em>  Restaurant with great ocean views.  Service - buffet.  It specializes in international dishes and offers a huge selection of snacks.  There is a bar with a large selection of drinks. </p><p>  <em>2. Spices.</em>  Restaurant by the pool.  The main specialization is fusion cuisine.  Only dinner is served, you need to pre-book a table. </p><p>  <em>3. Sarong.</em>  This restaurant is located on the beach.  You can enjoy the delicacies of Pan-Asian cuisine.  It is open only for dinner, reservation is required. </p><p>  <em>4. Toddy.</em>  Bar located on the beach.  Guests can enjoy international cuisine there.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner and light snacks are served. </p><p>  <em>5. Chringuito.</em>  This bar is also located on the beach.  But only drinks and light snacks are served there. </p><p>  It is worth mentioning that in the institutions there is an evening dress code.  Their level is high, so coming to dinner in a bathing suit is not recommended. </p>

    <h2>  Villa "Reserve" </h2><p>  And now you can go to the description of the numbers of Kihaad Maldives 5 *.  As already mentioned at the very beginning, here are not apartments, but villas.  And the first category is ‚ÄúReserved‚Äù. </p><p>  Such villas, located in their own garden, have an area of ‚Äã‚Äã77 square meters.  m. There is a veranda, a wooden patio overlooking the beach, an outdoor bath.

And of course, the bathroom.  Hygiene products, slippers and bathrobes are also provided. </p><p>  What about the price?  Tours to the Maldives have always been expensive, and there is also an extra-class resort.  If you book about a month and a half before arrival, and not at the height of summer, then a week of living in such a villa will cost about 150-160 thousand rubles for two.  This price includes 12% tax, payment for the <span>all inclusive</span> service and collection of the accommodation facility in the amount of 11.5%. </p><p>  Additionally, you will need to pay an environmental fee ($ 6 per person per day) and a transfer.  At the moment it is 399 dollars (round trip). </p><h2>  Villa "Lagoon Prestige" </h2><p>  This is a more expensive option.  This villa has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã89 square meters.  Its highlight is an elegant rustic-style interior and a spacious terrace on the beach with direct ocean views.  Each villa ‚ÄúLagoon Prestige‚Äù seems to be in an open area, at arm's length, from the sea, but at the same time, while on the terrace, guests feel extraordinary privacy. </p><p>  Amenities - similar to the above.  Additionally there is also a DVD player and fan.  What is the price?  <span>Tours to the Maldives</span> with accommodation in a villa "Lagoon Prestige" will cost more.  A week of living for two people will cost 165-180 tr </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  I would like to touch upon them in the end.  People who have been to this <span>paradise island are</span> happy to leave detailed reviews about the entertainment in Kihaad Maldives 5 *, service, maintenance, furnishings, as well as about many other nuances related to their vacation. </p><p>  There are no negative comments, and you can understand why.  After all, these are the Maldivian five stars.  And travelers call their stay here magnificent for many reasons.  Here are just a few of them: </p><ul><li>  The villas are spacious and comfortable.  The highlight adds a special local flavor in the design - an open-air bathroom, which is very original. </li><li>  To the beach - within easy reach.  Each villa has its own deck chairs. </li><li>  The ocean is magnificent, the coral reef is something unbelievable.  And the underwater world is simply amazing.  It is unrealistic to describe in words - this must be seen. </li><li>  The range of dishes in restaurants is so diverse that many do not even have time to try everything during the holidays.  And there is alcohol, although there is a ban on it on many islands of the archipelago (in accordance with Sunni Islam). </li><li>  The staff is friendly, attentive and welcoming - here the guests are treated as long-awaited guests.  Any requests are fulfilled the first time. </li><li>  Wi-Fi can be caught from anywhere in the island. </li><li>  There are very few people.  Not because no one is coming here - on the contrary, the villas are full, there is simply a lot of free space on the island and there is no crowd feeling. </li></ul><p>  You can continue to list the advantages of the resort for a long time.  This is a truly luxurious, fantastic, in every sense of the word worthy resort.  And if there is a desire, as well as the opportunity to visit it, it is definitely worth it. </p>
