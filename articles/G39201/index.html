    <h2>  Description of the hotel complex </h2><p>  The hotel was built in 2012.  This is a complex consisting of two buildings, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is 5,000 square meters.  On the territory there are several pools, a business center, SPA-salon, conference rooms, a mini-club for children, a restaurant and a bar.  According to reviews of the Welcome World Beach Resort &amp; SPA, its beautiful garden surrounds it, making the area even more pleasant for walking and relaxing by the pool. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The exterior of the building of this hotel is not much different from the others, but the interior attracts attention.  It combines modern Europe and the decorative elements of provincial Thailand, and this merger ultimately forms an incredibly beautiful style. </p><p>  The surrounding area deserves no less attention.  Huge pools have trees and palm trees, and large lodges for guests with pillows are installed - an ideal alternative to simple sun loungers.  However, sunbeds are also here.  But it is much more pleasant to relax on comfortable mattresses - they can be seen in the photo. </p>

    <h2>  Relax or outdoor activities - the choice of hotel guests </h2><p>  It is immediately worth noting that some reviews (Welcome World Beach Resort &amp; SPA) emphasize such a drawback as the remoteness of the hotel, which is why after the excursion, vacationers from this complex were brought home last.  But there are advantages to this.  The hotel is calm, secluded, and from the tour there are such vivid impressions that the road to the hotel does not seem too long. </p><p>  Those who prefer a relaxing holiday are invited to take a walk around the hotel or go down to the beach, or go explore the surroundings.  A good idea would be to lie on a mattress or deck chair by the pool. </p><p>  You can recover and rejuvenate yourself inside and out in the sauna, massage room or SPA center.  They offer various relaxation treatments that will give a lot of pleasant sensations.  But those who want to spend time actively can visit the gym and fitness center or go to the coast, where beach games and water sports await. </p>
