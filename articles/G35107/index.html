  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a DIY jewelry box: materials, ideas and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A jewelry box is a thing that every beautiful person should have.  After all, it is convenient and original.  But many do not succeed in acquiring the desired product.  Prices in stores bite, but the option that really deserves the attention of the young lady does not come across. </p><p>  Of course, this is not a reason to deny yourself a little whim.  Therefore, we suggest you familiarize yourself with the technology of making jewelry boxes yourself.  Step-by-step instructions, the necessary materials and tools, the secrets of the creative process and many other interesting points - all this can be found in the material presented below. </p><h2>  What will be the craft? </h2><p>  First of all, it is important to determine the appearance of the desired product.  After all, if you go shopping and consider the goods of the desired category, it becomes clear that the boxes differ not only in the external design, but also in the internal design.  Some are quite simple, have one tier, others are distinguished by many cells, secret compartments, the presence of a mirror. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jewelry.kydfl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY jewelry box" class="if uuid-3056606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3056606.jpg"></div><p>  Since you plan to make a box for jewelry with your own hands, you get a unique opportunity to fully customize the craft for yourself.  To do this, it is better to reconsider your jewelry to determine the quantity, type, features of storage of certain items.  And after that, determine for yourself the desired version of the product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If time goes on and nothing interesting comes into your head, you can go shopping and choose the most suitable option from the presented ones.  Remember it or take a picture and use as a template. </p><h2>  Determine the parameters of the idea </h2><p>  As we have already noted, each beautiful person has her own set of jewelry.  Someone prefers large massive rings, others prefer thin rings.  Many young ladies love earrings and cannot stand the chain.  It is also important to consider that items should not be piled in a pile, everyone should take their place. </p><p>  Therefore, the next step is to consider the size of the craft.  If you do not want to design your own foundation, you can choose a suitable box.  For example, the one left from an e-book or a mobile phone.  Also, some needlewomen offer to make a composite jewelry box with their own hands.  What is meant by this? </p><p>  Everything is simple - a product that has several separate drawers and cells.  A great example is a matchbox.  It is presented in the following photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.helmuth-projects.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="matchbox jewelry box" class="if uuid-3056620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3056620.jpg"></div><h2>  Choose material </h2><p>  Those who examined the store caskets know that the product under study should be beautifully designed both outside and inside.  In this case, you can decorate the outer surface with colored, corrugated or wrapping paper.  Some needlewomen even use the remnants of wallpaper or clippings from magazines.  You can also decorate the jewelry box with various fabrics.  For expensive crafts, they often choose leather, but it is acceptable to limit themselves to cheaper material.  You should not consider it too hard and rude, because we are doing a girlish thing.  To make a jewelry box with your own hands, silk, velvet and even cotton are more suitable.  The main thing is to create an interesting, bright, original product. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Therefore, having decided on the basis of the craft, proceed to the preparation of the material.  If desired, you can buy it or use the old, unnecessary, left over from the previous work.  It all depends on the imagination of the needlewoman. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diytomake.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY jewelry box" class="if uuid-3056583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3056583.jpg"></div><h2>  What is required to complete? </h2><p>  In addition to material for indoor and outdoor decoration, foam rubber or household sponge should also be prepared.  After all, rings and earrings must be fixed so that they do not get scratched or break.  If you want to make an expensive jewelry box with your own hands, it is better to purchase rubber curlers in the store.  There are so many of them at present that each needlewoman will be able to find a copy that matches the color and size of the idea.  However, before work it is important not to forget to remove the wire from the curlers. </p><p>  Also, to implement the idea, you need scissors, a piece of chalk or a simple pencil, stationery glue for paper or ‚ÄúMoment Crystal‚Äù for fabric, if necessary, a ruler or tape. </p><h2>  What additional elements are provided? </h2><p>  For decorating crafts, any small items are suitable.  Beads, beads, buttons, artificial flowers, bows, colored pasta - all this can be safely used to create unique and original crafts.  In addition, you should decide in advance whether you need a mirror.  If the answer is yes, it is important to find it.  Some boxes are supplemented with a handle so that they can be moved if necessary.  In this case, it is important to consider this nuance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jewelry box for children" class="if uuid-3056614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3056614.jpg"></div><h2>  We make the basis </h2><p>  How to make a jewelry box with your own hands?  In fact, to answer this question is clearly impossible.  Depending on the type of product being studied, the technology varies.  However, in any case, you will have to decorate the inside and outside of the main and additional boxes with a cloth, paper or other drapes. </p><p>  Experienced needlewomen are advised to pre-prepare templates with which it will be possible to transfer the exact dimensions of the parts to the working material.  To do this, use white paper and a simple pencil.  Apply prepared boxes alternately and outline the sides.  After that, cut out the details and proceed to gluing all the components. </p><p>  When finished, set the boxes aside.  They must be thoroughly dry.  It will take 2-3 hours. </p><h2>  We work with foam rubber or rubber curlers </h2><p>  The next stage of our DIY Jewelry Box workshop can be completed while the base dries.  In order not to sit idle and not waste time in vain.  It involves the preparation of the zone in which the rings and earrings will be located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abeautifulmess.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jewelry box step by step" class="if uuid-3056561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3056561.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, take a household sponge, foam rubber or curlers.  We determine in advance in which cell the decorations of the desired type will lie.  And then we work with the bottom template from it.  Your task is to cut strips of the desired length.  If you are working with foam rubber or a sponge, you should prepare parts about the thickness of a finger.  And then decorate with a cloth.  It is better not to use paper for these purposes, it will tear very quickly and spoil the beauty of the box. </p><p>  It is important to note that experienced craftswomen advise cutting curlers with an office knife. </p><h2>  Getting started assembly </h2><p>  After you managed to decorate all the necessary details, we proceed to the final stage of work.  If you want to complement a DIY box made with a mirror, then this part must be attached right now.  And it‚Äôs better to use Moment-Crystal glue to make it more reliable.  The handle should be done separately, and then glued on the outside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jewelry.kydfl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jewelry box how to make" class="if uuid-3056594" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3056594.jpg"></div><p>  This completes the bulk of the work.  The further process completely depends on the desires and skills of a particular needlewoman.  After all, you can only decorate the box at your own discretion. </p><h2>  Easy-to-Use Option </h2><p>  If the workshop ‚ÄúBox for DIY Jewelry Boxes‚Äù described above seems to you too complicated and time-consuming, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the idea presented in this paragraph.  After all, such coasters are in great demand among many beautiful people.  In addition, they can not be decorated, which means that you can save on additional materials.  And get yourself new earrings or a ring. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to store decorating ideas" class="if uuid-3056580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3056580.jpg"></div><p>  To summarize, I would like to note that making a box for storing jewelry with your own hands is very simple.  In some cases, you don‚Äôt even have to spend money - you can even build an interesting thing from improvised materials.  The main thing is to approach the solution of the problem creatively. </p><p>  It is also worth mentioning that the finished fake will be an original, memorable and useful gift.  Presenting which can be both a young lady and a respectable adult woman.  The only thing - it is important to arrange the box accordingly. </p>
