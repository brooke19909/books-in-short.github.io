The very container for saving values ‚Äã‚Äãwas hidden under the fluffy skirts.  Such a casket doll today is not only a practical thing for storing jewelry, but also a beautiful decorative element.  We offer all creative people to learn to do such a thing with their own hands.  We will carry it out from improvised materials.  <span>We will</span> learn <span>how to make a casket doll</span> at home from the next master class. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doll box master class" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/360186.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Preparation stage </h2><p>  In order to independently carry out the original box for saving jewelry, you will need the materials indicated in the following list: </p><ul><li>  Barbie doll (or any other, similar in size); </li><li>  1.5 liter plastic bottle; </li><li>  paper; </li><li>  white crepe satin fabric; </li><li>  batting; </li><li>  lace kapron blue and white; </li><li>  satin tape; </li><li>  decorative elements (beads, small flowers from ribbons); </li><li>  threads for sewing. </li></ul><p>  In the work on the manufacture of such a product as a doll-casket (read the master class below), we will use the following tools: </p><ul><li>  scissors; </li><li>  clerical knife; </li><li>  a needle; </li><li>  compass; </li><li>  thermal gun. </li></ul><h2>  Doll box: master class.  The stage of manufacturing and designing the bottom of the product from a PET bottle </h2><p>  Using a <span>stationery knife</span> at a plastic container, cut off the upper part with a lid.  Its height should be 10 centimeters.  The neck is also cut off.  From the bottom of the bottle we measure 10 centimeters.  Cut off the "glass".  From it we will form the lower part of the box. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Getting to the design.  We make round patterns of paper with a diameter of 7 cm, 7.5 cm, 8 cm, 8.5 cm. We transfer them to batting and fabric.  From the crepe satin we cut two circles - 8 and 8.5 cm in diameter.  From batting, we make circles according to the patterns of 7 and 7.5 cm. Next, we prepare rectangular blanks.  From the fabric we cut out the details measuring 45 x 20 cm and 35 x 20 cm. </p><p>  On the largest circle of crepe satin we impose a workpiece of batting 7.5 cm in diameter.  Grabbing both of these parts with a needle at once, we sew a rectangular cut.  When performing this action, we pick up the fabric with uniform folds.  As a result, we get a bag with a round bottom.  Similarly, we sew and workpieces of a smaller size.  How is a doll-casket made out of a plastic bottle further?  Learn from the instructions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself barbie doll" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/360613.jpg?1395830720975" width="543"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  We lubricate the front side of the round part of the first bag with glue from a heat gun and fasten it to the bottom inside the ‚Äúcup‚Äù from the plastic bottle.  Well smooth and smooth the fabric with your fingers.  Next, we put the adhesive material on the walls of the container and in the same way we fix the side parts of the bag.  When the entire inner surface of the part is framed, we throw the remaining fabric over its sides and refuel under the outer bottom. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second part of the plastic bottle is formed in the same way.  For its decoration, a second bag (smaller in size) is used.  Here, the rest of the fabric is displayed on the outside and temporarily tied with an elastic band or thread. </p><h2>  Dress dressing stage </h2><p>  Next, the casket doll, the master class for the manufacture of which you study, should "put on" a magnificent outfit.  We will perform it from nylon lace.  Sew it, picking up with uniform folds, along the bottom edge of the ‚Äúglass‚Äù.  The next frill is done at a distance of 1-1.5 centimeters up from the first.  Make sure that the bottom edge of this ruffle covers the seam of the previous one.  Thus, we sew the required number of frills.  Performing them, alternate white and blue lace.  Using the same technology, decorate the second part of the plastic blank with ruffles. </p><p>  Next, on the upper part, remove the assembly.  We remove the legs of the doll and glue it to the place where the bottle had a neck.  Try to attach the parts securely.  It depends on how long the box will last.  Now the junction of the doll with plastic needs to be undecorated.  Take a piece of lace 30 centimeters long and sew it, gathering folds, to the satin ribbon.  Tie the resulting skirt on the waist of the doll. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doll casket from a plastic bottle" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/360223.jpg?1395769271837" width="334"></div>

    <p>  The next stage in the manufacture of crafts is the design of the upper part of the doll‚Äôs dress.  The fabric peeking from under the lace is cut off from the top to the required size, covering Barbie's chest.  We hem the edges of the textile so that they do not fray.  We decorate them with lace.  Glue the top of the dress to the body of the doll. </p><h2>  Make a hat </h2><p>  In an elegant headdress our Barbie doll (casket) will flaunt.  Do it yourself.  To do this, we collect a <span>satin ribbon</span> 30 centimeters long on a string and tighten it.  In the center, leave a hole with a diameter of about 2 cm. Sew the edges of the tape.  We collect the hair of the doll in the tail, thread it through the hole in the hat.  To keep the headpiece firmly held, apply a few small drops of glue on the inside and attach it to the hair.  Straighten the hair and folds on the hat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doll casket photo" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/360180.jpg?1395769316708" width="360"></div>

    <h2>  Finishing touches: stand design and joining parts </h2><p>  How to make the doll casket, the master class on the manufacture of which is presented to your attention, stable?  To do this, take the metal lid from the can and tighten it with crepe satin.  We lubricate the inside of this part with glue and fix the bottom of the lower plastic blank into it. </p><p>  Now we connect both parts of the product by sewing one to the other.  Perform this fastening in the place where the doll has a back. </p><p>  Decorate the box with beads and small satin flowers by sticking them to the doll‚Äôs dress and hairdo.  That's all.  An original and very beautiful casket for storing jewelry is ready. </p><h2>  Doll box "Bride" </h2><p>  This product option can be a great gift for a bride and groom on a bachelorette party or on a wedding day.  You can put some small present or money inside the box.  We will perform this craft from plastic deep plates.  We need two of them.  In addition, we prepare a small doll, white satin, nylon lace of the same color, threads, a needle, thin foam rubber, decorative ornaments and a heat gun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a doll casket" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/360179.jpg?1395769364571" width="373"></div>

    <h2>  Description of the work process </h2><p>  We glue the plastic plates with foam rubber on the inside and outside.  We remove the legs of the doll and use a sharp clerical knife to cut off the lower part of the body.  On one of the plates, cut a hole in the foam, pour glue there.  We insert the doll with the slice down and hold it with your hand until the glue sets. </p><p>  Next, we <span>fit</span> both the upper and lower parts of the product with <span>satin fabric</span> .  We decorate them with lace in the same way as described in the previous master class.  We decorate the dress and the inner surface of the upper part of the box with beads, sequins, small <span>ribbons bows.</span> </p><p>  Since the product is made in the form of a bride doll, she needs to make a veil on her head.  To do this, we sew the lace together in two or three tiers.  Next, we attach it to a narrow white satin ribbon, forming folds.  Decorate with small flowers, beads, beads.  Tie a veil under the hair of the doll.  We fasten together both parts of the product, stitching them inside in one place along the upper edge.  That's all.  It remains to put a little surprise inside the casket and go to congratulate the bride and groom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doll casket bride" class="if" height="470" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/360224.jpg?1395769399268" width="379"></div>
