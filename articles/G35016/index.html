    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Viva Ulaslar Hotel is located in the resort of Okurcalar, in the picturesque Gulf of Karaburun on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  The distance to the center of the tourist region - Alanya - is 32 kilometers.  The nearest air harbor is in the city of Antalya, which is 90 kilometers from the hotel.  The journey from the airport to the hotel will take you about two hours.  But the travel time for you, most likely, will fly by quickly, because you can admire the local beauties from the window of a car or bus.  If you bought a tour through a travel agency, then you will most likely be provided with a transfer from the airport.  If you booked your stay on your own, you can order a transfer service directly at the hotel, informing the administration of your desire in advance and receiving confirmation from it.  With regard to the proximity of the sea, the <span>Viva Ulaslar Hotel 4 * hotel</span> has, albeit a small, but its own clean sandy beach.  It is located a hundred meters from the hotel complex, but on the way to it you must cross the road and pass the promenade that runs along the coast. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

It should be said right away that, as in the cases with other hotels, some of the reviews are positive, but still there are people who are unsatisfied with something.  We offer to sort everything out in order. </p><p>  As for the hotel itself and the rooms, there were no special complaints from our compatriots.  Furniture and appliances in the rooms are not new, but everything is in good and working condition.  The rooms are clean and nicely decorated.  Cleaning was carried out efficiently and regularly.  There were also no complaints about the frequency of changing linen and towels. </p><p>  Very pleased guests with the location of the hotel.  So, the distance to the beach is only a couple of hundred meters.  In addition, near the hotel there are many shops and souvenir shops, as well as a bazaar with a large selection of products at very reasonable prices. </p><p>  Several guests were unhappy that, having arrived at the hotel early in the morning, they settled only for dinner.  However, most of the guests claim that a similar situation is possible only in the high season, when Viva Ulaslar is completely full.  So, if the hotel had free rooms, then guests arriving much earlier than the checkout time (14:00) were settled almost immediately after arrival. </p><p>  The Russians and the staff of Viva Ulaslar were pleasantly impressed.

When entering the water there are no stones, so you can easily do without special shoes.  The beach is regularly cleaned, so being on it is very comfortable. </p><p>  Dining in the four-star Viva Ulaslar, according to most tourists, is consistent with the declared category of the hotel.  The assortment of dishes, of course, is inferior to five-star hotels, but everything is very tasty and of high quality.  Our compatriots were pleased that, in addition to chicken and meat, in the restaurant they were offered almost every day dishes of fish and seafood. </p><p>  In general, summing up, we can say that the four-star Viva Ulaslar Hotel (Alania) fully met the expectations of travelers.
