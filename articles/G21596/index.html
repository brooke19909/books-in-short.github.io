Tilda is the embodiment of comfort and coziness.  She is endowed with tremendous positive energy and is able to return anyone to the world of childhood.  But tilda style is not limited to dolls at all.  This is a whole soft and kind world, having both simple and virtuoso techniques for playing toys. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tilde tulip" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/815364.jpg" width="600"></div>  A small part of this magical world is the Tilde Tulip.  You can give it, for example, to your beloved friend in honor of some holiday.

    <h2>  What is Tilde Tulip </h2><p>  Speaking the word "tilde", we mean by it the whole world.  It includes not only dolls with elaborate clothes and accessories, but also a wide variety of toys made in a primitive style.  One of such primitive souvenir toys is the tilde tulips, a master class on the manufacture of which will be discussed in this article.  It is these primitive flowers that managed to win the hearts of people around the world, striking at the same time with their simplicity and beauty. </p><h2>  What fabrics are most preferable to make tilde flowers (tulips) </h2><p>  The most pleasant and cozy are tulips made of fleece, although in fact you can use absolutely any fabric.  Of course, for the stems and leaves should choose green shades.  Stalks of tulips from checkered material or from polka-dot fabric look very interesting.  For buds, satin, satin or any other shiny material will be most effective.  The most important thing here is not to choose knitwear and fabrics that are too dense. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tulips tilda master class" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/815360.jpg" width="222"></div>  From the color scheme, white, yellow and pink colors look the most advantageous.  As well as a combination of different options in one bud.  Before starting work, any fabric should be washed in warm water and ironed.

Tools and materials </h2><p>  First of all, you will need fabric for buds, leaves and stems.  Also a needle and threads of all necessary colors.  In addition to all of the above, you need scissors, a stick for stuffing and stuffing material.  As the latter, you can use sintepuh or holofiber. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tilda flowers tulips" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/815365.jpg" width="530"></div>  Sometimes a wire comes in handy.  With its help, you can not only strengthen the stem of the flower, but also give it some form.  You also need a sewing machine, but if you don‚Äôt have one, then you should not be upset.  Such flowers can be easily sewn by hand using a ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù stitch.  Well, of course, you can not do without a pattern.

    <h2>  Tulip Pattern </h2><p>  Tilda-style tulips, the pattern of which is presented in this article, are not at all difficult to sew.  And their patterns are quite simple.  True, it is worth noting that the buds have two types of patterns.  Rather, it is not the form itself that differs, but the number of parts used to create the buds.  There may be two or four.  That, in fact, is the whole difference. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tilde style tulips pattern" class="if" height="201" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/815372.jpg" width="300"></div>  Tilda tulips, the master class of which will be discussed later, implies the following sizes.  The part for the bud is nine centimeters high, and its widest part is five and a half centimeters.  A leaf of a tulip in width at the largest site is also five and a half centimeters, and its length is sixteen and a half cm. The detail for the stem is a rectangle with sides twenty and two centimeters.  Of course, don't forget about seam allowances.

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Create a stalk </h2><p>  Any tulip-tulip has a stem.  We‚Äôll start with him.  Take a rectangular part designed for a flower stalk.  Fold it in half and sew the long side and one of the short ones.  The second short remains unstable for stuffing.  After construction, all allowances should be cut and the corner cut off and the future stem turned.  Do not cut the fabric close to the seam.  In the process of stuffing, the stem can diverge.  Now it remains to fill our detail.  You can simply fill the stem with stuffing material, or you can strengthen it with wire.  Then your tulip-tulip can be bent and fixed in this position. </p><h2>  Make leaves </h2><p>  It is impossible to imagine any flower without leaves.  Also, tilde-tulips, photos of which you can see in this article, all contain at least one leaflet.  Fold the two parts of the sheet face to face, chop them or sweep them and sew them, leaving the bottom open for eversion.  It will be ideal if you have the opportunity to trim the allowance with zigzag scissors.  But if you don‚Äôt have such scissors, then you can just make notches with ordinary scissors in bending or especially protruding places.  This is necessary so that when you turn out the sheet, it is even in all places and no unnecessary folds appear.  Iron the finished inverted sheet and lay a line along the edge.  This will add to your piece of elegance. </p><h2>  Create buds </h2><p>  The main and most beautiful part of the tilde-style tulip is its bud.  As mentioned above, it can consist of two or four parts.  If you have not sewed anything special before, then opt for the bud, which consists of two parts.  Make it easier, and it will turn out much more accurately.  The principle of tailoring is the same as that of the leaves.  Sew together two parts, turn them out and stuff them well.  Unlike leaves, of course, there is no need to rebuild the edge.  When the bud is full, you need to tighten it tightly in the region of the lower edge and sew it to the stem, using a hidden seam for this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tilda tulips mk" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/815363.jpg" width="600"></div>  There is another interesting version of the bud.  Its pattern has the appearance of a rectangle, and first half of the <span>foam ball of the</span> desired size is inserted inside, and then the filler is laid.  The rectangle is folded in half along the long side and stitched to the side.  Then it is pulled together in the lower part, and the upper edge is simply tucked up.  Inside we put the half of the ball with the convex side to the stem.  It will help keep the shape of the bud.  Put a filler on top.  Now the bud needs to be closed.  To do this, connect its opposite sides at midpoints with each other.  A bead is usually sewn into the center of this compound.

    <p>  Well, the tilde tulip is ready.  It only remains for us to sew a leaf somewhere in the middle of the stem and think about the design.  It can be just a beautiful soft bouquet tied with a suitable ribbon.  Or you can plant several flowers in an impromptu pot or drawer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tilda Tulips Photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/815361.jpg" width="320"></div>  True, for this you will need to insert wire into the stems.  And with the help of such tulips you get a wonderful and cozy composition.  For example, a soft wreath on the door.  Remember that the beauty of tulips will largely depend on what material you will make them from.  And although this is considered a primitive toy, no one forbids decorating the entire composition with additional decorative elements.  For example, sew a little beads to the bud or glue an artificial butterfly to the bouquet.  That's why he and the creative process, to experiment at your pleasure.
