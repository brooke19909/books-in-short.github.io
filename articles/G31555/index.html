This was accompanied by the improvement of enlightenment, science and literature, which began to reflect the self-awareness of the people and the first democratic principles, which were strengthened in Russian life during these years.  The supreme authorities understood the need for a socio-economic recovery.  But for this it was necessary to change something in the field of public education.  This system included the initial stage - one-class parish schools, and with it - two-class district schools, as well as four-year gymnasiums.  The highest links in this system are universities. </p><p>  In Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum studied nobles of different classes.  In the cadet corps they received a military education.  At that time, the number of libraries increased markedly. </p><p>  If we talk about Russia in the first quarter of the 19th century briefly, I must say that science has achieved significant achievements.  The study of Russian history was very successful.  N. M. Karamzin wrote 12 volumes of "History of the Russian State."  Russian sailors made 40 round-the-world voyages and discovered Antarctica.  A new observatory was opened, a railway and a magnetic telegraph were created.  The experiments of physicists in the field of electricity were successful.  World fame brought domestic mathematicians. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander I on horseback" class="if uuid-2497453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26550/2497453.jpg"></div><h2>  Reign of Alexander I </h2><p>  So, in Russia at the beginning of the 19th century, in March 1801, 23-year-old Alexander I Pavlovich ascended the imperial All-Russian throne (1777-1825).  He was the eldest son of Paul I and Maria Fedorovna and beloved grandson of Catherine II.  In pre-revolutionary historiography, it was officially referred to as the Blessed One.  The empress was crazy about his quick wits and angelic appearance.  She was very concerned about his upbringing and even created a collection of instructive sayings, proverbs and fairy tales, as well as Grandma‚Äôs Alphabet.  She herself picked up for him teachers and teachers.  His teachers were M.N. Muravyov (Russian language and literature), the scientist P.S. Pallas, the mathematician K. Mason, etc. His worldview was influenced noticeably by his teacher of Swiss origin F. Lagarpe, who was a big fan of French enlightenment .  Alexander himself often said that he owes everything good to him that he has to Lagarpe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.slavorum.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Catherine the Great" class="if uuid-2497459" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26550/2497459.jpg"></div><h2>  Killing father </h2><p>  Alexander‚Äôs life at court was very difficult.  Catherine II did not like Paul.  She even had a desire to leave the throne not to Paul, but to his son Alexander, who had to constantly seek a compromise between the imperious grandmother and the irritable father.  Because of this, the character of Alexander became secretive, since he wanted to please everyone.  But after the death of Catherine, nevertheless, Paul I took his throne, and he entrusted his son with the post of governor-general of St. Petersburg.  The relationship between father and son was tense.  Over time, sympathy for each other became less and less.  When all the nobility decided to remove Paul I from the throne, she dedicated Alexander I to her plans. The conspirators swore to him that they would leave their father alive.  They just make him abdicate and give the throne to the next heir.  However, Paul I was killed.  Alexander was deeply shocked by this event, and then all his life he did not leave feeling guilty. </p><h2>  The first steps in government </h2><p>  In Russia, in the first half of the 19th century, at the very beginning, a new emperor Alexander I appeared, who immediately realized that in his ruling policy he would need to take into account not only the interests of the nobility, which suffered from Pavlovsky arbitrariness and was frightened by the French Revolution.  He was also very worried about the mass peasant unrest that swept the entire territory of Russia due to the oppression of the landlords. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Alexander I immediately signs the manifesto of March 12, 1801, where he promises to rule the state according to the laws of his august grandmother - Empress Catherine II. </p><p>  And he began by restoring 12 thousand officers and officials in the service of disgraced father.  Following it, he abolished the Secret Expedition, which was engaged in political supervision and investigation, and forbade torture.  Alexander I gave the right to Russian citizens to freely travel abroad.  The import of foreign books was allowed into the country, private printing houses began to open. </p><h2>  Russia in the first quarter of the 19th century (briefly) </h2><p>  He wanted everything to happen according to the law, since he believed that it was they who should become a solid foundation in strengthening the empire.  At the same time, the wise autocrat realized that he needed like-minded people, since he did not trust either Pavlovsky or Catherine‚Äôs officials and nobles.  And so he creates the Secret Committee, which includes V.P. Kochubey, P.A. Stroganov, the Polish prince Adam Chartorysky, N.N. Novosiltsev.  This body did not have an official status.  Committee members often gathered and discussed government issues and reform ideas, which were very vague due to the fact that none of the committee had the proper experience and knowledge in managing state affairs. </p><p>  However, Alexander still managed to make several transformations.  In 1802, he signed the imperial manifesto, he established eight ministries (instead of the Peter's collegiums).  This included the ministries of the interior, naval forces, naval forces, commerce, foreign affairs, finance, justice and public education.  They worked on the basis of unity of command.  Ministers could personally report everything to the emperor.  A Committee of Ministers was established to coordinate the work of ministries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Legislative Senate determined the rights to observe justice and adopt bills after being approved by their emperor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diachroniki.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Serf people" class="if uuid-2497443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26550/2497443.jpg"></div><h2>  Serfdom </h2><p>  Russia in the first part of the 19th century continued to be serfdom.  The members of the Secret Committee wanted to somehow improve the state of affairs of the serfs, but this matter did not advance beyond the discussions.  V.P. Kochubey generally considered this matter to be very dangerous, since in Russia serfdom should be in the order of things. </p><p>  In the initial period of Russia's development in the 19th century, it should be noted that Alexander I banned the sale of state lands together with peasants, and to print ads on the sale or purchase of serfs.  The land was allowed to be bought into the property by the townspeople and state peasants, although earlier it was a privilege exclusively of the nobility. </p><p>  In 1803, the decree "On free cultivators" was issued.  The landlords had the right to release their peasants with allotments of land for ransom.  About 1% of serfs (47 thousand souls) received free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reformer Speransky" class="if uuid-2497457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26550/2497457.jpg"></div><h2>  Speransky </h2><p>  M. Speransky, who was an outstanding statesman, made a huge contribution to the development of Russia (the first quarter of the 19th century).  His father was a village priest.  He graduated from the seminary with honors.  Then he continued his studies in St. Petersburg.  Thanks to his abilities, Speransky was noticed by Paul I, which promoted him through the ranks.  But all his talents were fully revealed under Alexander I. The numerous legislative acts drawn up by him before 1812 were the ‚Äúworks‚Äù of his skillful pen. </p><p>  In 1809, Speransky considered that autocratic governance should be established under an indispensable law and created the ‚ÄúIntroduction to the Code of State Laws‚Äù.  He wanted the power to be divided into legislative, executive and judicial, where the emperor would be the supremacy.  Laws must be adopted by the State Duma.  Consider bills in the State Council.  And the emperor must approve or reject them.  On his account there are many legislative reformist projects. </p><h2>  Feud and Link </h2><p>  M. Speransky justified his reforms by saying that the authorities "from above" should prevent events in order not to get a new "Pugachevschina".  He managed to implement some reforms in life.  Under him, a state council was created, in 1811 a single ministerial structure was approved. </p><p>  But the tsarist environment was very hostile to his reformist ideas, especially the new order of production he introduced for civilian ranks.  To take a high rank, it was necessary to have a university education or pass a very difficult exam.  The court nobility was very unhappy with this.  They slandered him and ensured that the innovator was sent into exile in 1812.  From that moment, Alexander I lost interest in the reform of the state. </p><h2>  Reformer Alexander </h2><p>  The first half of the 19th century in Russia, Alexander devotes to liberal transformations.  But in the second, he takes care of state security.  The Napoleonic Wars showed him that with recruitment the state was not able to increase the number of people in the army during the fighting, and then reduce it with the onset of peace. </p><p>  Then it was decided to engage in military reforms, Minister of War A. Arakcheev became responsible for them. </p><p>  By the end of 1815 he created military settlements.  In Russia, in the first quarter of the 19th century it was planned to form a new military-agricultural estate, which at any moment could equip a constant army size at the level of wartime without the costs allocated from the budget.  This could allow the country's population to free themselves from the constant duty of maintaining the army and cover up the unexpected invasion of the enemy into the state from the western space. </p><p>  The military reforms of the 19th century in Russia led to the fact that by 1825 military settlements had grown significantly.  The soldiers in the Russian army totaled 169,828 and 374,000 state Cossacks and peasants.  As a result, the ‚Äúupper classes‚Äù began to criticize these settlements, and the ‚Äúlower classes‚Äù expressed dissatisfaction.  In 1857, settlements with about 800 people were abolished. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rusmania.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Under near Borodino" class="if uuid-2497444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26550/2497444.jpg"></div><h2>  Politics </h2><p>  The foreign policy of Russia in the first quarter of the 19th century consisted in the struggle to strengthen its borders in the Middle East and confront Napoleonic France. </p><p>  In 1783, Georgia entered into an agreement with Russia (St. George's Treaty), and now the administration of internal affairs in Eastern Georgia has passed to the Russian government.  In 1803-1804  Georgia almost completely became part of Russia, which became the occasion for the Russo-Turkish war of 1806-1812. </p><p>  The Turkish government, hoping for Napoleon, who promised to give them possession of Crimea, decided to declare war on Russia.  June 22, 1811 the battle ended in victory for the army of Kutuzov.  As a result, all of Bessarabia was annexed to Russia. </p><h2>  Patriotic War </h2><p>  The Russian-Iranian war of 1804-1813  was marked by the victory of the Russian army, and the Gulistan Treaty was concluded.  Dagestan and the bulk of Azerbaijan were annexed to Russia.  Iran has lost the right to have a navy in the Caspian Sea. </p><p>  The main foreign policy of the Russian state was determined in opposition to the impudent policy of Napoleonic France.  Russia decided to enter a coalition with England, Sweden and Austria.  The outbreak of the war ended in the defeat of the Russian and Austrian armies near Austerlitz in November 1805 and the occupation of Austria. </p><p>  The signed Tilzitsky treaty with Napoleon in July 1807 did not suit anyone, and Napoleon longed for world domination. </p><p>  Russian-Swedish war of 1808-1809  annexed to Russia Finland and the Alan Islands. </p><p>  World War II began in 1812.  The decisive battle took place on August 26, 1812 near the village of Borodino.  Napoleon‚Äôs troops suffered terrible losses.  Of his 640 thousandth army, about 40 thousand remained.  The Kutuzov guerrilla warfare system has shown excellent results. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rusmania.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kutuzov before the fight" class="if uuid-2497449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26550/2497449.jpg"></div><h2>  Arakcheevschina </h2><p>  Russia in the first quarter of the 19th century showed great patriotism.  He was shown by all walks of life.  This clearly showed that there was no longer any need to keep the peasants in serfdom.  People were waiting for the freestyle, which they never received.  The frustration of society led to the creation of the Decembrist movement.  After the victory, Alexander I was carried away by mystical moods and entrusted his whole domestic policy to Count Arakcheev - the near and petty formalist.  A huge resonance occurred due to the unrest of the soldiers and the reprisals against them in the Semenovsky regiment.  There were thoughts of a violent overthrow of power. </p><p>  In 1816, the war begins in the Caucasus.  His viceroy, General A. Ermolov, successfully conducted military operations, as a result of which many mountain tribes took the side of Russia. </p><p>  In the end, it should be noted that the foreign policy of Alexander I is mainly characterized by the creation of the ‚ÄúHoly Union‚Äù, which included European monarchs with the goal of preventing revolutions. </p><p>  During the reign of Tsar Alexander I, the borders of Russia expanded significantly: Georgia, Imereti, Mingrelia, Guria, Bessarabia, Finland and part of Poland took Russian citizenship. </p><h2>  End of board </h2><p>  Emperor Alexander I died on November 19, 1825 at the age of 47 years.  He was practically not sick, and therefore his sudden death gave rise to many rumors and legends that he became a hermit-wanderer under the name of Fedor Kuzmich. </p><p>  A year later, his wife Elizaveta Alekseevna, who became a nun Vera the Silent, the inhabitant of the Syrkov Monastery, allegedly died. </p><p>  Graphologists of the 21st century, handwriting experts, stated that the handwriting of Fedor and Alexander I are identical. </p><h2>  Nicholas I </h2><p>  After the death of Emperor Alexander I and the abdication of the Grand Duke Constantine, Nicholas was crowned throne (December 2, 1825).  He fell the suppression of the uprising of officers - conspirators, called the Decembrists.  Nicholas I fiercely defended the foundations of the autocracy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.systemaspetsnaz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decembrists arrest" class="if uuid-2497451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26550/2497451.jpg"></div><p>  Russia in the first quarter of the 19th century during the reign of Emperor Nicholas I showed significant achievements in the field of science and technology.  P. Schilling in 1828-1832  created an electromagnetic telegraph.  In 1837, the father and son of the Cherepanovs first launched the railway.  The ruler adopted many provisions to make life easier for peasants, and thereby created the foundation for the abolition of serfdom. </p><p>  During his reign, Russia participated in the wars: Russian-Persian 1826-1828, Russian-Turkish 1828-1829, Crimean 1853-1856. </p><p>  The emperor suddenly died of pneumonia on February 18 (March 2), 1855.  There is a version that he committed suicide, as he could not withstand defeat in the Crimean War.  The throne was eventually inherited by his son, Alexander II. </p>
