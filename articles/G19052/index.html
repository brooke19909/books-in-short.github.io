    <h2>  Old case or new? </h2><p>  The case is also not going smoothly.  Those factory images and 3D renderings of enthusiasts that we see now are not at all impressive.  The phone has become thicker, which 100% will negatively affect ergonomics.  Why could Cupertino's engineers take such a step, sacrifice convenience?  Either we finally wait for the massive battery, or Apple decided to install an induction aka <span>wireless charging</span> in the phone <span>.</span>  Why it is needed in the iPhone is unclear, but it is believed that Foxconn plants are already collecting special charging platforms (will be sold separately from the smartphone). </p><h2>  New colors and materials </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Knowing how Apple does not like visual changes, we can say with confidence that we are considering not only what ‚ÄúiPhone 8‚Äù is, but also what ‚ÄúiPhone 8 S‚Äù looks like.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">A solid aluminum plate is likely to disappear, and glass with stainless steel inserts will replace it.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Expensive and solid, but somehow messy and not at all in the style of Apple.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">There are also rumors about an expanded color palette.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This, too, may well be, given the recent release of the red iPhone 7.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">It turns out Apple is ready for such experiments and learned to paint aluminum.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">So, learn to paint glass.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The third option (the most coveted) is a scanner under the display.  Many still hope that Apple will nevertheless be able to introduce a new technology, and the entire display will take on the role of Touch ID.  This theory is indirectly confirmed by the unusual behavior of the iOS 11 operating system. When you click on a notification, the system does not respond with the requirement to unlock the smartphone, but only reports that it is blocked.  The fourth option (the most believable) is a 3D face scanner instead of a fingerprint scanner.  Apple has been working on advanced dual-camera face scanning technology for over three years now.  If they managed to achieve the maximum reading speed without pauses and errors, then it is quite possible this option will become a worthy replacement for the existing technology.  Simple and tasteful, all in the manner of an "apple" corporation. </p><h2>  And what about the characteristics? </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">What will look like "iPhone 8", figured out, and what will be "under the hood"?</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Surely, only one thing can be said - the fastest process of own production in the world will be installed inside again.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">A11 Fusion will again blow up benchmarks and take the iPhone out of the way, as he did the last 3 years.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The amount of RAM can increase up to 4 gigabytes (as in tablets, but not more).</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The main memory is enough, there is no need to wait for special generosity.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Of the interesting things, it is worth highlighting a new battery, which will change in shape and look not like a rectangle, but like a tetris figure in order to occupy as much space as possible in the smartphone case.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Perhaps it will become larger, as the phone case is slightly thicker.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">At the moment, this is all that is known about the inner world of the new iPhone.</span> </p>
