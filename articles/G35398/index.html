Today, the "apple" company is the most progressive and successful company, which is preferred by many users.  Around this brand, a society of fans has been created, watching the release of new devices and immediately rushing to the store after the start of sales in order to buy the latest generation gadget. </p><p>  Today we will talk about one very interesting device of this company - multimedia player Apple iPod Touch 6. Reviews about the products of this company are positive.  Buyers are constantly pleased with multifunctional news.  And most importantly, Apple protects its reputation, so the risk of encountering low-quality equipment is practically minimal.  Of course, the cost of the iPod is rather big, but it fully justifies itself. </p><p>  Let's quickly open the box and see what kind of apparatus is hiding inside. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apple ipod touch 6" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1113518.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Options gadget 6 generation </h2><p>  Under the cover of the box lies the handsome man himself - the Apple iPod Touch 6 player. A film with the image of the device‚Äôs interface is glued on his screen.  Under the device you can see the Lightning cable, <span>EarPods headphones</span> and the player‚Äôs instruction manual.  Many noticed one drawback - this is the cable.  It is, as usual, thin and a little fragile.  One can even say with absolute certainty that it will tear pretty quickly.  In any case, this is a long-standing problem with this kit item. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, music gourmets will not please headphones.  They, although quite high-quality in assembly, cannot provide sufficient sound quality, so it is better to choose a headset from third-party companies. </p><p>  Now let's look at the instructions for the Apple iPod Touch 6. It is quite understandable and interesting.  After reading it, the user will easily understand the management of this gadget.  It is very bad that there is no <span>power adapter</span> in the kit <span>,</span> I also wanted to have an original charger so that I wouldn‚Äôt inadvertently harm my device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apple ipod touch 6 16 gb" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1113524.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Design solutions </h2><p>  The appearance of the gadget is quite pleasant: it is not very large (123.4x58.6 mm) and thin (6.1 mm), it has a stylish aluminum case painted in one of six colors (silver, golden, gray, pink, blue and red).  Below are the speaker, charging jack and Jack 3.5 mm for connecting headphones.  You can see the lock button at the top, the volume is controlled by the key located on the left side. </p><p>  On the back cover of the <span>Apple iPod Touch 6</span> is an eight-megapixel camera with flash, in front there is a front-facing HD camera, a Home button and, of course, a 4-inch screen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apple ipod touch 6 reviews" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1113522.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Let's move on to the software part of the device </h2><p>  Initially, iOS 8.4 was installed on the device, however, the player currently ships with the ninth version of the operating system.  Also, many Apple branded applications are integrated into the iPod, such as AppStore stores and iTunes music, messages and FaceTime for those who like to talk a lot, the Photos and Videos section allows you to view the results of shooting.  Important for such devices is the memory, which is why the manufacturer produces several types of Apple <span>iPod Touch</span> 6: 16 GB and 32 GB. </p><p>  The application "Promotions" is intended for business people, "Health" - for those who are watching themselves, and gamers will be pleased with the Game Center service.  Well, of course, there is ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù - a simple player for audio files in MP3 format. </p><p>  To be honest, these are far from all the applications wired into the player: in reality, there are many other useful programs.  Unlike Android devices, iOS gadgets are not full of low-quality applications from third-party developers, which, moreover, cannot be removed without obtaining root rights, which is undoubtedly a huge plus of ‚Äúapple‚Äù devices. </p><h2>  "Iron" and its effect on the device </h2><p>  Let's see the processor of the player.  The heart of the gadget is the notorious Apple A8 and the M8 coprocessor, which also stand on the iPhone 6. RAM has doubled compared to the previous generation, and its size has become 1 GB.  The memory can be of different sizes, which is why each user can choose according to their needs the MP3 player Apple iPod Touch 6: 32 GB, 16 GB, 64 GB and 128 GB. </p><p>  The device‚Äôs screen is relatively small - only 4 inches, but its resolution is quite large (1136x640 pixels).  The player also has a triaxial gyroscope and accelerometer.  The wireless module can work with all modern standards. </p><p>  Such characteristics allow the device to work quickly with all types of applications.  For example, gamers will be pleased that the iPod pulls not only the primitive timekillers, but also the most difficult and demanding games.  Fans of movies and TV shows will be delighted with a high-quality screen and a huge amount of memory.  Internet residents will like a modern Wi-Fi module and a fast <span>Safari browser.</span>  Travelers will be delighted with the fairly accurate Maps app. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mp3 player apple ipod touch 6 32 gb" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1113520.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summarize </h2><p>  Apple iPod Touch 6 is a very modern and high-tech device.  Users of this device can enjoy really high-quality sound and the speed of the device.  However, not everything is so rosy.  The price of a gadget with a minimum amount of memory starts at 18,000 rubles, which very much hits the pocket of an ordinary resident.  So, the purchase must be planned carefully, based on your budget and the requirements for this unit. </p>
