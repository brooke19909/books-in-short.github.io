  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IPhone Parental Controls: Program Overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Programs for organizing parental controls on an iPhone help dad and mom protect their child from the dangers of the digital world.  Such software prohibits a child from accessing adult content or communicating with strangers. </p><p>  In addition, if you set parental control on an iPhone, you can monitor the time spent by the child on the World Wide Web.  It is very difficult for children armed with tablets, smartphones, and at the same time messengers with the ubiquitous "YouTube" to stop in time and postpone writing a post or watching a video until tomorrow. </p><p>  Apple‚Äôs mobile gadgets have both built-in parental control tools (on the iPhone or iPad), and the ability to install third-party ones.  The latter can be found in the brand's brand store.  We will consider both the first and second. </p><p>  Let's try to figure out how to enable parental control on an iPhone, what steps should be taken and how to make this procedure as painless as possible for both the child and the father and mother.  So let's get started. </p><h2>  Staffing Functionality </h2><p>  The company has fairly well developed the ability to restrict children from accessing the Web.  To put parental control on an iPhone, you need to go to "Settings" -&gt; "Basic" -&gt; "Limitations".  Here you need to create a unique password.  Be sure to write it down, because otherwise you will have to configure the phone from scratch.  It will also be needed to disable parental controls on the iPhone if necessary </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="parental control on phone iphone" class="if uuid-3201198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3201198.jpg"></div><p>  In the "Limitations" section, you can block access to a variety of applications, utilities, as well as to the camera.  In addition, it is possible to prohibit the installation of any software and its removal.  You can disable the work with built-in purchases in applications and set up verbal censor: movies or songs with obscene words will be excluded from the search.  The local assistant, Siri, will also not work with ‚Äúbad‚Äù expressions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  One of the most important parental controls on an iPhone is filtering web resources.  Here you can configure a ban on all pages except those listed in the list of sites.  Or, conversely, allow work with all resources, but add only a part of them to the lock. </p><p>  Another useful parental control item on an iPhone is store passwords.  In this case, you will need to decide how often the code will be requested in the proprietary AppStore.  You can make periodic requests or select ‚ÄúAlways‚Äù.  That is, if the child does not know the password, then something cannot be downloaded from the store.  It is also possible to allow separate access to free applications and restrict only paid ones. </p><h2>  Access and Permissions </h2><p>  In the "Privacy" section, you can configure the rights to access each program.  For example, to prohibit or allow the use of a microphone, photo album, wireless protocols, bluetooth and / or Wi-Fi, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to enable parental control on an iPhone" class="if uuid-3201199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3201199.jpg"></div><p>  Another section is ‚ÄúAllow Changes‚Äù.  In this case, you can prohibit updating programs, adding friends, editing the address book, and even changing the volume.  The last function will come in handy if the child likes to listen to his favorite songs at the maximum volume level. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can also set up another interesting function of parental control on an iPhone - ‚ÄúAsk to buy.‚Äù  To implement this feature, you must first activate the "Family Access" mode.  If a child wants to purchase some kind of game or developmental application, then he can send a request to his parents.  The latter will reject or, conversely, approve the choice of the child.  In some cases, this is very convenient. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the function "Find iPhone."  It must be enabled on the child‚Äôs mobile gadget.  You can find out if it is active in the settings by going to the iCloud section.  With it, you can find out the current location of the device. </p><p>  Next, we consider third-party parental control applications for iPhones 6, 7, 8, and X versions. </p><h2>  Norton Family Premier </h2><p>  Judging by user reviews, this is the best that this segment can offer.  The product offers the most reliable tools for filtering almost anything and everything.  Well-configured local profiles by the developer significantly facilitate the time-consuming process of organizing the protection of children of all ages from inappropriate content. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.av-test.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to set parental control on iphone" class="if uuid-3201201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3201201.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the application offers serious tracking tools.  The latter allow you to quickly and accurately track the movements of your child.  The program generates detailed reports on the user's activities: what web resources he visited, which links he clicked on, with whom he talked to and which SMS he received and sent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Software Features </h2><p>  In a word, if you need total control over a child, then this product is required to familiarize yourself.  Perhaps the only thing this utility can‚Äôt cope with is the time limit for applications.  That is, there is no way to disable, for example, a game after half an hour of use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="family.norton.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="parental control on iPhone 6" class="if uuid-3201202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3201202.jpg"></div><p>  Distributes the product under a paid license and will cost about 6,000 rubles for an annual subscription.  It is also worth noting that the developer very often holds promotions and offers a utility at a good discount for 4000 rubles. </p><p>  Application Benefits: </p><ul><li>  an abundance of reliable filters; </li><li>  many tools for controlling web content; </li><li>  Exceptional location tracking capabilities </li><li>  viewing in real time SMS and calls; </li><li>  a wide selection of intelligent profiles for all age categories; </li><li>  simple and intuitive interface. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  there is no possibility to limit applications by time; </li><li>  Cannot remotely block contacts. </li></ul><h2>  Qustodio Parental Control </h2><p>  As users note, this application is very easy to configure and has a large number of filters.  Moreover, the latter can be installed simultaneously for several users, which is convenient if, in addition to the child, someone else uses an iPhone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to put parental control on an iPhone" class="if uuid-3201204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3201204.jpg"></div><p>  The service showed itself especially well when setting time limits for individual programs, thus significantly expanding the regular functionality of the gadget.  The application allows you to easily and quickly track all SMS - both received and sent.  Directly from the admin panel, you can block users calling or writing messages to the child. </p><p>  The functionality for filtering web resources is somewhat limited when compared with regular tools, but in general it is enough for ordinary users.  The product is distributed under a paid license, where an annual subscription for five devices will cost about 3,500 rubles. </p><p>  Application Benefits: </p><ul><li>  intuitive interface; </li><li>  the ability to manage multiple users; </li><li>  setting time limits for each individual program; </li><li>  viewing call logs and SMS with the ability to instantly block subscribers. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  mediocre filtering of web resources; </li><li>  no geofencing support. </li></ul><h2>  My mobile watchdog </h2><p>  This utility has proven itself in the remote control of third-party applications.  If your child spends a lot of time on a mobile gadget and games in particular, then My Mobile Watchdog will take this matter under its control. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mymobilewatchdog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable parental control on an iPhone" class="if uuid-3201203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3201203.jpg"></div><p>  The applications selected on the iPhone simply will not open or function normally, and the child will be able to focus on other, more important things, for example, homework.  Only after your approval will the programs begin to function normally. </p><p>  In addition, the utility works well with monitoring calls and SMS.  If unauthorized contacts start to call or write to your child, then you will immediately receive a notification with all the details: date, time, text and attached content. </p><h2>  Software Features </h2><p>  Geofencing utility is implemented at an average level.  Information from the location magazine is rarely updated, so setting up an effective search for an iPhone, and with it a child, will fail.  Tools for filtering web resources are also dank, especially when compared to similar ones with Norton Family Premier.  The problem is that here you can only block specific sites one after another, and not work with categories.  So it will take a lot of time to configure the filters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.geckoandfly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="My mobile watchdog" class="if uuid-3201206" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3201206.jpg"></div><p>  The product is distributed under a paid license - about 6,000 rubles will have to be paid for it.  Subscription is designed for five mobile devices. </p><p>  Application Benefits: </p><ul><li>  intuitive interface; </li><li>  advanced functionality for remote application management; </li><li>  well-implemented monitoring of calls and SMS; </li><li>  ability to view browser history. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  mediocre geozoning; </li><li>  activity log seemed chaotic to some users. </li></ul>
