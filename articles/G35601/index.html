  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ski resorts in Yekaterinburg - an opportunity to relax from the Internet and TV</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is not the first year that people have been calling for a healthy lifestyle and agitate to play sports.  The Ural capital boasts its active residents.  One of the favorite sports is skiing.  As early as 1921, the first ski station was opened in Yekaterinburg on the territory of the City Pond in the pavilion.  For some year (from 1924 to 1925) 5.5 thousand people visited the sports complex.  By the end of 1925, the throughput of the complex increased by 100%, and about 270 people rode here every day.  In 1927, a new station was already opened at the rink "Uralprofsovet."  But the city faced another problem, it turned out that there were much more people who wanted it than inventory.  And then the factory for the production of furniture "Ural Proletariat" launched the production of skis. </p><p>  In 1934, major skiing competitions were already held in the city, the program of which included even the men's slalom.  Even the Second World War did not prevent the development of skiing, in 1943 the USSR Championship was held at Uktus.  And in 1957, a biathlon championship was held on the same Uktus mountains.  Today, the city and the region boasts a huge number of ski resorts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ksk66.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://ksk66.ru/2017/03/28/%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%B6%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8-%D1%8E%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%B9-%D0%B8-%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BA-%D0%BF%D0%B0/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski resorts in Yekaterinburg" class="if uuid-2237732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2237732.jpg"></div><h2>  "Lower Isetian" </h2><p>  The ski base is located on Stakhanova street, 65, in the forest park Uktusky Mountains.  There are several routes with a length of 1.5 to 7.5 kilometers.  They are prepared for both classic skiing and skating.  For visitors organized secure parking.  In addition to the ski slopes, the base has a gym and playgrounds, inexpensive hotel rooms and gazebos. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Locomotive" </h2><p>  The next on the list is the Lokomotiv ski resort located on 63 Reshetskaya Street. The base opened its doors to visitors back in the 70s of the last century.  In 2002, a large-scale reconstruction was carried out here.  Now children are engaged (by the way, three-time Olympic champion K. Boyarskie was engaged in KDUSSH) and ski equipment rental is working. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sport-oboz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sports base Dynamo, Yekaterinburg" class="if uuid-2237793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2237793.jpg"></div><h2>  CSS "Dynamo" </h2><p>  Ski resorts in Yekaterinburg cannot be imagined without this complex.  One of the largest biathlon sports arenas in the Russian Federation.  Located in a forest, 12 kilometers from the city, on the Moscow highway. </p><p>  The complex includes not only ski slopes, but also a 3.2 km long ski-roller ski track and a width of 3 meters.  There are other entertainments on the base: </p><ul><li>  shooting range; </li><li>  assembly and sports halls; </li><li>  hotel; </li><li>  Russian sauna. </li></ul><p>  You can also cook kebabs and drink artesian water (own well). </p><div class="photo" data-original="ngzt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Teplaya, Yekaterinburg" class="if uuid-2237739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2237739.jpg"></div><h2>  "Mount Warm" </h2><p>  The sports complex is located 50 kilometers from the city of Yekaterinburg, in the vicinity of the city of Pervouralsk and the village of Bilimbay.  Perhaps this is the most popular base, since all routes are closed from the cold wind, since they are all located on the south and south-west side of the slope.  Hence, in fact, the name "Mount Teplaya" (Yekaterinburg). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the very top is the entire infrastructure, cafe and parking.  This, by the way, is a rather unique location, since usually the entire infrastructure is located at the bottom of the tracks. </p><p>  There are 4 tracks. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Title </td><td>  Length m </td><td>  Drop, m </td><td>  Level of difficulty </td></tr><tr><td>  "Forest" </td><td>  850 </td><td>  120 </td><td>  Beginners and "average" </td></tr><tr><td>  "Central" </td><td>  500 </td><td>  120 </td><td>  For experienced </td></tr><tr><td>  Extreme </td><td>  550 </td><td>  135 </td><td>  For professional athletes </td></tr><tr><td>  "Training" </td><td>  450 </td><td>  80 </td><td>  For beginners </td></tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"></table><p>  There is also a descent for entertainment, which ride on "bagels" and "cheesecakes" and a snow park. </p><p>  On the basis of the complex there are 3 towing lifts and a snowmaking system. </p><h2>  Uktus </h2><p>  You can not ignore, describing the ski base of Yekaterinburg, "Uktus", located on Zimnyaya street, 27. Classes of the Youth Sports School of the Olympic reserve are held here.  Children from 3 years old are accepted here, now about 150 beginner athletes are studying. </p><p>  Today, the sports complex is in its second heyday since the 60s of the last century.  The sports basis of the school is fully restored, young professional trainers and masters of sports are involved. </p><p>  In addition to children, the base has access for everyone, you can ride here in the daytime and evening, all the tracks are lit.  If you wish, you can dine in a cafe or cook kebabs, there are gazebos on site.  There are even fields for playing futsal and tennis courts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ekburg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sports complex" class="if uuid-2237764" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2237764.jpg"></div><h2>  ETTU </h2><p>  The list of ski resorts in Yekaterinburg should be supplemented with a complex located on Pronina Street 25, owned by the Yekaterinburg tram and trolleybus department.  It was opened for the recovery of the company's employees back in the 60s, but now everyone can get here.  In 2001, the company's management reconstructed the base, and the project also included the purchase of sports equipment, children's snow scooters, mini-skis and bagels. </p><p>  Naturally, this is not a complete list of sports bases in Yekaterinburg, there is also Uralmash Insurance Company, Kirovskoye Municipal Unitary Enterprise and others.  As they say, drop the Internet and go for new experiences. </p>
