  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Beaded Cactus - Negative Energy Absorber</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Scientists have not yet figured out to the end, but there is an opinion that it is a cactus that can absorb all the negative energy and electromagnetic radiation emitted by a PC.  So why not weave yourself a cactus of beads, which there is no need to water?  Such a plant will delight the eye all year round, requiring no care and absolutely no need for sunlight.  On the contrary, it is recommended not to place the cactus from the beads on the windowsill, as the rays of the sun can make the bright colors of the beads more faded. </p><p>  How is a cactus made from beads?  The detailed description here is so simple that even a child older than ten can handle this work.  You can say even more - this is a very exciting collective activity for the whole family.  Why not work together to create a family absorber of negative energy? </p><p>  And to carry out all the work, the following materials will be required: thin wire, beads, <span>watercolor paints,</span> polystyrene foam, glue and a beautiful flower pot of the appropriate size.  You must immediately determine the color of the main, green beads and the choice of color for the flower.  A cactus from beads can be made as monophonic, or combine several shades of green, mixed and strung in a chaotic order at once.  The flower can also be either yellow, or red or pink. </p><p>  One of the most painstaking and long occupations is beadwork.  The cactus itself is not complicated, but to assemble it you need to build about a hundred thorns.  To do this, eight beads are strung on a piece of wire eight centimeters long.  One end of the wire passes through four beads and closes into a ring, but does not twist, but is left as is.  These will be the future cactus spines.  On the other hand, the longer end of the wire remains.  Such blanks are twisted in two and three pieces, and then joined together in five.  Depending on what sizes the future bead cactus is planned, more or less workpieces are made. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A flower is made very simply.  To do this, nineteen beads are strung on a meter long wire.  For a beautiful bend of the leaf, the wire must be passed through the penultimate bead and the stringing is repeated, but only seventeen beads are already strung to the base of the flower.  Here the two ends are fastened together, and one petal is obtained.  Thus, the entire length of the wire is used.  Forming a flower, the petals are twisted in a spiral.  The more petals you make, the more magnificent the finished flower will be.  In the exact same way, you can make a small flower, picking up less beads for its petals. </p><p>  Next, you need to prepare the basis for a cactus of beads, a detailed description of which is even simpler than working with ‚Äúthorns‚Äù.  A very good option would be balls from the children's pool.  But if there are none, the base can be easily made from any piece of foam, the main thing is that it resembles a ball or an oval.  Using acrylic paints, the foam base is painted green and slightly dried. </p><p>  Now you can start assembling the entire structure.  A piece of polystyrene is tightly placed in the pot, to which a green base is glued.  And the most interesting work begins - the creation of an entire cactus.  The thorns are stuck in long strips into the foam strip, covering its entire surface with the exception of the place for flowers.  Then flowers are attached.  This is not complicated beadwork.  The cactus is best placed near the computer, where it will collect negative energy and simultaneously delight everyone with its eternal colorful flowering. </p>
