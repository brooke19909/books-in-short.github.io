  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Louis VII: King of France, curriculum vitae, date of birth, period of reign, historical facts and events, date and cause of death</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Louis VII (years of life 1120-1180) ruled in France for forty-three years.  In traditional history, he was considered a weak monarch, but this can be argued.  Yes, he was not the one who defeated the Germans and was fond of carnal pleasures, but not everything is so simple.  It is worth it to be called a worthy representative of the Capetings. </p><h2>  Parents </h2><p>  Louis VII (Capetian dynasty) was the son of one who strengthened the king's power in France.  His father's nickname is Tolstoy.  He is considered one of the brightest representatives of the Capetings.  Mother's name was Adelaide of Savoy.  She was the daughter of Earl Humbert. </p><h2>  Intended for the spiritual life </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Louis VII" class="if uuid-2528089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2528089.jpg"></div><p>  Louis VII, whose biography is being considered, was the second son of the king.  Father began preparations for a peaceful transfer of power several years before his death.  In 1129, his eldest son Philip was crowned, who at that time was thirteen years old.  It was he who would have received the crown after the death of Louis Tolstoy.  But at the age of fifteen the young man crashed to death, falling from his horse. </p><p>  The father took the youngest son from the monastery, who became Louis VII.  The boy was crowned twelve days after the death of Philip.  The anointing was performed by the Pope.  So the son, who was preparing for a spiritual career, became co-ruler of the French king. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Governing body </h2><div class="photo" data-original="cdalebrittain.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sculpture of Louis and Alienora" class="if uuid-2528091" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2528091.jpg"></div><p>  Louis VII Young ruled with his father before his death, which happened in 1137.  No one disputed his right to the throne.  The kingdom was well protected from baron attacks.  Under the new ruler, the same advisers remained.  Abbot Suger from Saint-Denis headed them. </p><p>  During the reign, he held a number of events: </p><ul><li>  put down an uprising in Poitiers; </li><li>  made a trip to Toulouse, but without special results; </li><li>  interfered in the election of church hierarchs. </li></ul><p>  The most famous brought him a crusade.  However, it can hardly be called successful. </p><h2>  Second Crusade </h2><div class="photo" data-original="historylearning.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Louis on the crusade" class="if uuid-2528090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2528090.jpg"></div><p>  In Western Europe, talk began about the next crusade.  The impetus for this was the fall of Edessa in 1144.  Louis VII, king of France, announced that he was ready to accept the cross.  He decided to personally lead the campaign to the Holy Land.  Prior to this, none of the kings participated in such an event personally. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He adopted the cross in 1146.  In the absence of the monarch, the kingdom was to be ruled by Dionysius of Paris, who was associated with Saint-Denis, and hence with Sugerius.  The king moved east in 1147, along with a huge army. </p><p>  According to the conviction of the German emperor Conrad, who also accepted the cross, the king of France moved to Constantinople through the Balkans.  In the capital of Byzantium, he signed an agreement with Manuel. </p><p>  The Crusaders were engaged in robberies, which prompted the Greeks to start a rumor that the Germans had already defeated all Muslims.  The French headed for Conrad‚Äôs army, which actually suffered defeats from the Muslims. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chronozoom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Battle crusade" class="if uuid-2528092" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2528092.jpg"></div><p>  The troops joined and moved south through the western territories of Asia Minor.  On the road they were constantly attacked by light Muslim cavalry.  The king of France did not prepare for such a debilitating war, he brought with him a retinue and magnificent dresses.  Even his wife traveled with him.  In 1148, rulers with thinned troops reached Ephesus.  Conrad went to Constantinople, and his ally reached Antalya.  From there on the Byzantine ships he crossed to Antioch. </p><p>  In the summer of that year, he met with Conrad and the king of Jerusalem.  Muslims destroyed Edessa, so the crusaders decided to go to Damascus.  They failed to take it.  Failure forced Conrad to return to his homeland.  Louis traveled to Jerusalem and returned to France in 1149. </p><h2>  Marriage with Alienora </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="First wife of Louis" class="if uuid-2528097" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2528097.jpg"></div><p>  In 1137, the father of Louis VII managed to organize a marriage between his son and Alienora, the future owner of Aquitaine.  In July of the same year, a wedding was held in Bordeaux. </p><p>  The couple lived together for fifteen years.  There was an abyss between them.  Louis was distinguished by piety and a severe character, and his wife was a lively and energetic nature.  It is believed that she was constantly cheating on her husband.  Their union brought the kingdom only two daughters.  The absence of a male heir endangered the fate of the dynasty. </p><p>  In 1151, Suger died.  It was he who opposed divorces.  The king's hands were untied, and he dissolved the marriage in 1152.  He paid for freedom by Aquitaine and Poitiers, who returned to Alienore. </p><p>  In 1154, these lands became part of England, as the former wife of the Capetian representative became the wife of Heinrich Plantagenet. </p><h2>  Relations with Henry Plantagenet </h2><p>  Henry was a vassal of Louis VII, but this connection was formal.  After receiving French possessions from a profitable marriage, the king of England took an oath to Capeting.  In 1158, the monarchs even agreed to marry their children. </p><p>  In 1159, the British besieged Toulouse.  Capetting did not want to strengthen the Plantogenets, therefore came to the aid of the besieged.  When Henry saw the ruler of France on the ramparts, he retreated. </p><p>  Heinrich and Alienora had five children.  In the seventies of the 12th century, they began to disagree with their father about the governance of the country.  The French monarch took advantage of them.  He received his son-in-law, the eldest son of Plantagenet.  At that time, an open war began between Capeting and the English king.  Not only Heinrich Young, but also Richard opposed his father.  Supported by the French and the Scots.  The king of England was able to defeat the king of Scotland, going to war with Richard. </p><p>  Under pressure from the Pope, events ended in 1177 with the signing of peace in Paris. </p><h2>  The long-awaited heir </h2><div class="photo" data-original="firststreetconfidential.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philip on the crusade" class="if uuid-2528093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2528093.jpg"></div><p>  After a divorce from Alienora, Louis VII married Constance of Castile, but she, like her first wife, was able to give him two daughters.  During the birth of her second child, she died. </p><p>  A month after the incident, the king married Adele Champagne.  In 1165, she presented the first-born, who was named Philip.  The second child was Agnes. </p><p>  When his son was fourteen years old, the king, at the request of the church hierarchs, decided to declare him his co-ruler.  But until the coronation, Philip got lost in the forest.  He was found on the third day in serious condition.  Father decided to pray for the health of the heir at the grave of Thomas Becket.  As a result of the pilgrimage, paralysis broke him.  Philip was crowned, and the next year his father passed away.  Louis died on September 10, 1180. </p><p>  He gave the country a beautiful monarch, who was the first to use the title ‚ÄúKing of France‚Äù.  He is known for participating in the crusade along with Richard the Lionheart, the defeat of the Germans, the construction of round fortress towers that have survived to this day. </p><p>  Some historians deliberately belittled the achievements of Louis the Young to elevate Philip Augustus.  However, it was his father who left him fortified lands for the further development of the kingdom.  A similar analogy can be drawn with the rule of Philip and his son Alexander the Great in ancient times.  Everyone praises Alexander‚Äôs military achievements, but does not mention that his father reformed the army. </p>
