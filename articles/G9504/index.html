This is far from being the well-known Turkey - Kusadasi.  Reviews about these places can not be read everywhere, because the holiday season here is quite small.  Just three summer months.  There is not even a velvet season, for strong unpleasant winds begin.  But this region also has its own charms that tourists like.  Starting from the price.  They are lower than anywhere else. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey kusadasi reviews" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/263744.jpg" width="596"></div>

    <p>  <strong><span>Turkey, Kusadasi.</span></strong>  <strong>Beach Reviews</strong> </p><p>  To get here, you need to take a bus at the Izmir or Bodrum bus station (this is not possible directly from the airports).  And you can also get on a ferry from Greece.  City beach - pebble, with sunbeds (paid).  But because of this, a very transparent and clean sea.  Pebbles are smooth, and walking on it is not painful even for children.  This is typical Turkey.  Kusadasi has positive reviews for a good selection of bathing spots.  If you take a little ride on public transport, you can get on the sandy coast.  This is the so-called "Women's Beach".  Probably, it is believed that real macho pebbles and pebbles do not care.  There is a huge selection of all kinds of eateries, taverns and restaurants, as well as entertainment on the water.  Yes, and more people.  But the most popular is Long Beach.  It is located five to six kilometers from the center of the village, and extends for almost thirty.  So the name is quite true.  And even further is the original Pigal beach, where for some services you have to pay with specially purchased beads. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kusadasi Turkey Tours" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/263746.jpg" width="400"></div>

Two kinds of things.  Of course, Turkish souvenirs (to prove to everyone where you were): jewelry, carpets, leather and copper crafts.  And also - original little things of famous European brands, but at local prices.  But this is almost inaccessible in other resort villages, especially ‚Äúuntwisted‚Äù ones.  In the city itself, a very good bazaar, also with prices "for its own", is the best fish in Turkey, and they cook it amazingly.  There are two water parks to choose from.  Well, the nightlife is in full swing: bars, clubs, discos - just do not count.  And it is good to walk along the street of bars in the evening, after a day "weary of the sun".  And choose something to taste.  In the evening, you can put on a ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù more charge and walk along Ataturk Boulevard.  Well, do not forget to see some beautiful mosques. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey kusadasi hotels prices" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/263747.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Kusadasi (Turkey): excursions</strong> </p><p>  You can begin to get acquainted with the sights from close approaches.  For example, when visiting water parks, select "Adaland".  So you can kill two birds with one stone: see the dolphinarium and the National Marine Park.  There is also a nature reserve with wild animals - Diplek.  You can still admire the old city fortress.  It is located on an island (which, in fact, was called "bird", and then the whole village).  But you don‚Äôt have to sail to it - the island is connected to the mainland by a dam.  Kusadasi is an excellent base for making further excursions, especially for those who love ancient history.  Izmir (Smyrna), Ephesus, Pergamum, Didim, Miletus - all these names we heard from the school bench.  <span>Famous philosophers</span> lived here <span>.</span>  And the ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù of these excursions is the opportunity to go to the homeland of Pythagoras - the Greek <span>island of Samos.</span> </p><p>  <strong>Turkey, Kusadasi.</strong>  <strong>Hotels</strong> </p><p>  Prices in local hotels are very affordable - you can find a room from 600 rubles per night.  "Fours" and "fives" are located farther from the city - in the Long Beach area.  "Three" - closer to the center.  But they all provide excellent services and very high quality food.  In addition, there are no "second" and "third" lines.  All hotels are right on the beach, and the soothing sound of the surf is guaranteed. </p>
