    <p>  The colossus - the work of the sculptor Khores - was built over 10 years, starting from 290 BC.  e.  He portrayed the god Helios with a shining <span>halo over his head</span> and a torch in his hand.  The impressive bronze statue dedicated to Helios, the patron saint of Rhodes, has become a source of admiration and surprise for travelers.  The statue, unfortunately, was destroyed by an earthquake in 224 BC.  e.  They did not begin to restore it, since at that time broken or destroyed statues were not accepted to be restored.  In 651, the remains of the statue were sold to Jews, who took them out of the water and took them away on 900 camels.  Now on the site of the great statue is a bronze deer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Rhodes fortress</strong> </p><p>  The traces of the <span>knights of the Order of</span> St. John staying on the island of Rhodes are the impressive walls of the Rhodes fortress - the remains of the palace built at that time.  When in 1522 the siege of Rhodes ended with the 100,000th army of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, the knights had to leave the island. </p><p>  The palace was preserved, but 333 years later it was destroyed by an explosion in an ammunition depot.  After reconstruction in the 19th century, it became the summer residence of <span>Benito Mussolini</span> and the Italian king Victor Emmanuel III.  Italians from the neighboring island of Kos brought here Hellenistic mosaics, sculptures, furniture and ceramics.  <span>Byzantine icons,</span> medieval sculptures and manuscripts, as well as the original tomb of one of the Grand Masters - all this has survived to this day and annually attracts a huge number of tourists. </p>

    <p>  <strong>Hollywood Dreams</strong> </p><p>  Cinema fans can take a boat trip to <span>Anthony Quinn</span> Beach <span>,</span> which is located on the east coast.  The local cliffs were captured in the war film "Cannons of the Navarone Island", and the actor who played the main role, Anthony Quinn, wanted to build the so-called second Hollywood here, but his dream was not destined to come true.  From it there was only a beach named after the actor. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <strong>Acropolis of Lindos</strong> </p><p>  On the spit, in the eastern part, is the second largest city - the ancient Lindos - perhaps the most beautiful place on the whole island.  According to legend, Elena Troyanskaya once hid there.  <span>Holidays in Rhodes</span> (many reviews contain advice to visit there) will be inferior if you do not visit this historically significant place.  On the hill is an acropolis with a colonnade of the II century BC.  e.  And the Doric temple of Athena of Lindia.  Seven Doric columns are well preserved in the Temple of Athena in the Acropolis of Lindos.  On the southwestern slope rises the ancient theater of the 4th century.  From its top overlooks the rocky bays.  Today in Lindos there is a port and a gulf bearing the name of St. Paul, and nearby is a beach with golden sands.  The picturesque Lindos Bay is a great place to relax after a tiring walk through the acropolis. </p><p>  <strong>Butterfly Valley</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rhodes island" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/223822.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <p>  Very colorful and vibrant can be a vacation in Rhodes.  Reviews of experienced tourists recommend going here from June to September.  It was at this time that the migration of the butterfly butterflies took place here.  There is a feeling that it is raining multi-colored from petals of amazing flowers.  Especially a vacation with children in Rhodes at this time will be unforgettable!  The delight of little travelers will have no limits; they will remember this rainbow tale for a long time! </p><p>  If you are planning a vacation in Rhodes, 2013 is not a good time for this, since the rainy season begins there in the second half of October.  It is better to plan a trip for May-September next year. </p>
