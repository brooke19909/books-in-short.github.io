Train schedule</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Our vast country offers resorts to all comers.  You can go to the Black and Azov Seas at any time of the year, but the bulk of people go there in the summer, when the hot season begins.  Among all resorts, the city of Yeysk stands separately, because it has a special nature and conditions for recreation.  The question of how to get to Yeysk by train is especially acute in the summer. </p><h2>  Why go to the city of Yeysk? </h2><p>  The resort town of Yeysk is located on the shores of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov and has ideal conditions for families with children, but for some reason it is not very well known.  Thus, due to a more northern position, extreme heat can be avoided, and the sea has a very small angle of descent, so that you can walk hundreds of meters, and the water will still be knee-deep.  The beaches in the city are mostly sandy. </p><p>  Moreover, the city has a developed tourism infrastructure, and there is enough entertainment there, but at the same time, prices remain acceptable even during the season.  There are also many sanatoriums in the region that help people with heart, stomach and nervous problems.  Note that near Yeysk, as well as near all resort cities, there are many smaller settlements that also offer their services in the summer season. </p><p>  This city is closer to the capital than other resorts, which reduces the cost of travel and reduces travel time.  Therefore, tourists are increasingly choosing it. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Train Moscow</span> - Yeysk </h2><p>  If you live in Moscow, then the question of how to get to Yeisk by train is solved quite simply.  There is only one train Moscow - Yeysk; it has number 231.  In 2015, he will ride every day from June 6, all of July and August, and then stop running for the winter.  Since the train is seasonal, it is assembled from available wagons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The train leaves Moscow from Kurskaya station at 00:15, and arrives at its destination in a day at 6:20.  Thus, the train overcomes 1507 km in 1 day for 6 hours and 5 minutes.  On the way, the Moscow - Yeysk train makes 20 stops, of which the longest in the following settlements: Tula, Yelets, Rossosh, Likhaya, Sulin, Rostov, Pervomaiskaya and Starominskaya. </p><p>  If you make the return trip - Yeysk - Moscow, train number 232 is at your service.  He travels from June 7 to September 1 also every day and makes the same stops, but spends less time on them, and therefore travel time is reduced by 28 minutes. </p>

    <h2>  Other train options to Yeysk </h2><p>  In addition to the above flights, Russian Railways has many more options for how to get to Yeisk by train.  So, many trains follow from smaller cities through Moscow and St. Petersburg, and Yeysk will not necessarily be the final stop.  The train schedule is designed in such a way that residents of the capital and the city on the Neva can arrive in Yeysk at any convenient time. </p><p>  The only minus of these options is that the train does not arrive at the Yeysk station itself, but stops at Starominskaya station, 70 km from Yeysk.  Almost all trains that travel to southern cities, such as Adler, Krasnodar, Anapa and others, make stops at the station. </p><p>  From the Starominskaya station to the city of Yeisk, you can take the train (it runs only in the morning), by bus or taxi.  Note that there are no problems with public transport. </p><p>  Here are the trains connecting Moscow and Yeysk: </p><ul><li>  Moscow - Adler, </li><li>  Moscow - Novorossiysk, </li><li>  Moscow - Anapa, </li><li>  Murmansk - Anapa, </li><li>  Murmansk - Novorossiysk. </li></ul><p>  Trains between St. Petersburg and Yeysk: </p><ul><li>  St. Petersburg - Novorossiysk, </li><li>  St. Petersburg - Adler. </li></ul><p>  Note that all trains follow in the opposite direction.  Moreover, we must not forget that most of these routes are also seasonal, which means that they do not travel every day.  The schedule should be specified at the station. </p>

    <h2>  Ticket prices </h2><p>  If you want to travel the distance Moscow - Yeysk by train, the direct train will be the cheapest option.  Note that the cost of seats may vary depending on the period remaining before departure.  You need to buy them at least a couple of weeks, because otherwise the cost increases markedly.  Moreover, when you make a trip in the season, keep in mind that there are many who want to relax, and it is advisable to purchase tickets in both directions in advance. </p><p>  A ticket to a <span>reserved seat car</span> costs 2932 rubles, a coupe - 4491 rubles, and <span>a</span> ticket to a luxury car - 10 029 rubles.

    <h2>  Traveler Reviews </h2><p>  According to reviews, the condition of seasonal trains is just awful.  Dirt, unsanitary conditions and terrible heat reign everywhere.  Air conditioners do not work in reserved seats and compartment cars, and they often refuse in SV cars, tickets for which are much more expensive.  Often there are breakdowns in the toilets.  The same situation is observed with the composition following from St. Petersburg. </p><p>  In this regard, travelers recommend traveling by plane or by car or just traveling with transfers on trains that are in the best condition and run all year round.  Some tourists, after traveling by train, are even ready to fly to Rostov-on-Don and then travel by car.  They believe that this is a more convenient and reliable option than a train.  But at a cost, of course, such a trip will come out more expensive.  Many have recently traveled to the sea by car for the same reason - the poor condition of trains heading south. </p>
