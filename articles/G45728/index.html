Indeed, it is more convenient to download your favorite books or novelties from the Internet and read at your pleasure at home or on the way to work.  E-books require a careful attitude, so many people buy covers for them.  They are often unreasonably expensive, and the quality is better.  According to the color scheme for sale, you can find black or white options.  The latter are very easily soiled, so there is nothing to choose from. </p><p>  But if a handmade master lives in the house, then making a cover for an e-book with his own hands is not difficult for him.  The paper uses thick cardboard or cover sheets from old books for the foundation and any material for decoration.  This is denim from old trousers or skirts, genuine or faux leather, cut from an unnecessary bag or jacket, felt or any cotton fabric, colored dense paper with a print pattern.  The choice of material for the cover for the Kindle e-book depends on the imagination of the wizard. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider several options for performing work, what materials will be needed, what can be used as a sealant, than how to fasten materials.  We will also analyze several ways how to make a cover for an e-book so that you can safely transfer it from place to place without fear that the gadget will drop out. </p><h2>  Paper product </h2><p>  To work on a paper cover you will need: </p><ul><li>  Thick cardboard (you can cut the cover from the print edition of the right size or apply packing cardboard) for a solid base. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Printed paper for external and internal gluing of the base. </li><li>  Cotton fabric is best suited for decoration of the spine, although it can be strengthened with a screw in several layers. </li><li>  PVA glue. </li><li>  Shoe short elastic bands to hold the gadget in one place and one long to close the cover for the e-book.  With their own hands, they can be sewn with a thread with a needle or sewn on a sewing machine. </li><li>  Ruler. </li><li>  A simple pencil. </li><li>  Knife for cutting paper. </li></ul><h2>  How to make a cover </h2><p>  First you need to measure the size of the electronic book or simply circle it along the contours on a sheet of cardboard.  Then outline the future cover as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  First draw a rectangle to the size of the gadget to place the book on elastic bands. </li><li>  Then once again outline the contours of the template for the part that closes the monitor. </li><li>  The third rectangle is needed as a <span>stand for the book.</span>  Its height corresponds to the size of the cover, and the width is 1/3 of its part.  But that is not all. </li></ul><p>  An e-book has a certain thickness.  Taking measurements, add another 2-3 mm and draw thin strips for two roots. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper cover" class="if uuid-2581123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2581123.jpg"></div><p>  Then everything is cut out along the contours and the first thing is to strengthen the pages of the cover with side roots.  The photo shows how they assemble the cover for the e-book with their own hands.  On the outside, the root of the cotton cloth is attached to the sides of the craft.  It turns out the cover in the form of a book with flexible places of roots, thanks to which the cover can be folded. </p><h2>  DIY decoration </h2><p>  The blank cover for an e-book is glued with colored glossy paper, it is advisable to take an analogue with a printed drawing.  On the back side, the workpiece made earlier is laid out, then pasted over, bending 2-3 cm of brown paper from all sides inward. </p><p>  When the outer side is framed, the cover is turned over and another colored paper is pasted over its inner part.  It remains to attach at the corners of the second part of the gum to hold the book.  This is best done with hot glue or a transparent ‚ÄúCrystal‚Äù, as they must be firmly fixed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The last part of the job is to place the vertical gum along the entire length of the cover for closing. </p><h2>  Fabric cover </h2><p>  According to the principle described above, you can make a cover of fabric.  The blank is made in the same way from cardboard, the roots are strengthened with strips of fabric, and then instead of wrapping paper, a fabric cover is sewn onto the base.  In the course of work, you must immediately sew on and wide elastic bands to close the cover, and 4 thinner in the corners for the gadget. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chicaandjo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric option" class="if uuid-2578611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2578611.jpg"></div><p>  It is recommended to immediately <span>sew a</span> rectangular <span>case</span> on the wrong side, measuring the length and width of the cardboard base.  It will remain after turning on the front side to sew the last edge.  You can combine two different fabrics to highlight the inside of the craft. </p><h2>  Cover with pocket </h2><p>  There is another original version of tailoring the cover with a narrow pocket at the bottom for placing an e-book.  The main work is carried out similarly as described above.  The first step is to make a cardboard base for the cover, then a fabric cover is sewn, only instead of elastic bands at the corners from the bottom of the second page a double strip of fabric 4 cm wide is sewn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chicaandjo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cover with pocket" class="if uuid-2578619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2578619.jpg"></div><p>  The e-book is inserted into this pocket and is fixed tightly.  If it‚Äôs more convenient for you to put the book in a horizontal position, then a strip of fabric is sewn vertically. </p><h2>  Felt cover </h2><p>  A very pleasant to the touch cover is obtained from felt sheets or thin felt.  If you decide to decorate the cardboard base with felt, then it is perfectly sewn, the work is carried out as usual, as with the fabric.  With felt, things are even simpler, because for such a dense cover you do not even need a blank from cardboard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="felt crafts" class="if uuid-2578634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2578634.jpg"></div><p>  Felt holds its shape perfectly, so you can simply make the necessary measurements, cut two pieces to size, sew them together and sew a pocket or elastic band to hold the gadget.  The rounded edges of the cover look beautiful. </p><h2>  Patchwork </h2><p>  To sew a cover for a book of rags, you have to tinker much longer.  First you need to think about what parts the patchwork will be from, select fabrics that will be the same in quality of the material and compatible in color, so that the craft does not look lurid. </p><p>  A cardboard base will be needed here.  You can glue it before putting on a fabric cover with a sealant - synthetic winterizer, thin foam rubber, or attach a felt layer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.huidang.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork style cover" class="if uuid-2578655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2578655.jpg"></div><p>  Then the rectangles of the cover are folded from triangles or squares and a piping or satin ribbon is sewn around the perimeter. </p><p>  The cover looks original, no one will see it for sure.  Of course, there is a lot of work, but the efforts will justify themselves in the end. </p><h2>  Fashionable jeans with embroidery </h2><p>  When making crafts from fabric, you can use denim.  It is a dense, solid material, easy to process and durable to use.  The cover page of the cover can be decorated in different ways.  In the photo in the article, white cotton fabric with cross-stitch is sewn.  The ornament can be taken as plain, in the color of the main material, or multi-colored. </p><div class="photo" data-original="puhtelki.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jeans cover" class="if uuid-2578658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2578658.jpg"></div><p>  The cover looks interesting, the first page of which is decorated with an applique made of fabric or flowers made of satin ribbons.  The bead picture or bead ornament looks beautiful on the cover of the Kindle e-book.  You can sheathe the title part with sequins or paste over with rhinestones, making the contours of a butterfly or cat.  Choose the design depending on the age and gender of the user.  Naturally, this decoration is more suitable for young girls or girls.  Embroidery is more suitable for women.  Next, consider what cover can be done for men. </p><h2>  Leather item </h2><p>  Such a prestigious and representative cover made of genuine leather, as in the photo below, is suitable for any man.  They take only dense material for work.  After the measurements of the book, a double-size pattern is made in width plus 20 mm for the sides and a beveled part to close the cover on the button.  5 mm allowances are left in height on each side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="leather cover" class="if uuid-2578627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2578627.jpg"></div><p>  The corners for holding the book are made of thin strips of leather, stitching them with an awl and strong nylon thread.  On the part of the craft where there will be a button for closing, a hole is made using a hole punch for belts and rivets are installed.  If the cover is made of artificial leather, then you do not need to paint it.  If from natural, then wipe the skin with alcohol before painting.  When the paint dries, then for the final design of the cover you need to grate it with wax to give gloss.  Make it a sponge.  If desired, you can stamp the pattern with stamps. </p><p>  The article provides several simple ways to beautifully design cover for e-books, choose your favorite and get to work!  Good luck </p>
