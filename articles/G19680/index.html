This is necessary in order to be aware of all the events taking place in the observed area. </p><h2>  What protection methods are there? </h2><p>  To date, security can be achieved through video surveillance.  If you are interested in how to install a hidden camera on a vehicle, you should first decide what exactly you want to view.  Today, car cameras can be installed inside, outside, and additionally show the current location of the vehicle.  Modern systems can provide you with such conditions and protect objects without human intervention.  The size of the hidden camera can be minimal and completely invisible to strangers. </p><p>  But it is not always possible to install complex equipment, because it will not fit into the interior or simply will not be available for financial reasons.  In such cases, miniature cameras are often used.  If you do not know how to install a hidden camera, then you should read this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bgr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mini video camera" class="if uuid-2628370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2628370.jpg"></div><h2>  What does covert video surveillance mean? </h2><p>  Covert video surveillance differs from ordinary video only in the size of the camera itself.  In this case, the installation method will also be different.  If standard devices see everything, then a miniature camera can be hidden in any secluded place.  This allows you to install video surveillance and not spoil the interior. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to hide a hidden camera? </h2><p>  If you do not know how to do this, then it is worth remembering about the most inconspicuous places.  Where to install hidden cameras?  Often, in order to disguise equipment, use the following devices: </p><ol><li>  Interior items. </li><li>  Furniture. </li><li>  Books. </li><li>  Accessories </li><li>  Elements of architectural buildings. </li><li>  The ceilings. </li><li>  Walls. </li><li>  Joints </li><li>  Windows and doors. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="trojmiasto.wyborcza.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to hide a hidden camera" class="if uuid-2628377" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2628377.jpg"></div><p>  By the quality of shooting, small cameras will in no way concede to full-size options.  There are both wide-angle and directional lenses.  The rest of the equipment will not differ from standard devices. </p><h2>  CCTV installation </h2><p>  If you have some skills in working with electrical engineering, you can set up covert surveillance yourself.  Depending on the type of system, you may need cable clamps, tools for drilling walls, a multimeter to ring wires, and various screwdrivers. </p><p>  As with any installation, you first need to make a project.  First of all, when asked about how to install a hidden camera, the points where the cameras will be located are marked.  After that, taking into account the operating mode of all fixing devices, the lighting is inspected, the distance to the most distant object of observation.  Wire parameters should be selected depending on the load.  If we talk about recording equipment, then it should be fully combined with the entire video surveillance system.  For those cameras that will record video in the archive, you need to purchase a hard drive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you are not sure that you can choose the equipment, you need to make a project to order from professionals.  When it is ready and all the devices are purchased, then you can proceed to installation.  This process will include several stages and the need for knowledge of electrical engineering. </p><h2>  Work with wires </h2><p>  Video surveillance in stealth mode involves laying wires from the recorder to every point that needs to be removed.  All of them are laid, of course, hidden, so that nothing betrays the location of the devices. </p><p>  How to install a hidden camera?  Wall chipping during this procedure will be performed according to standard standards.  Turning is carried out only at right angles.  If stretch ceilings are made in the rooms, then all the wiring can be arranged in them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find a hidden camera" class="if uuid-2628372" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2628372.jpg"></div><p>  Before carrying out the procedure, it is best to mark each element.  All cables should be located at least 30 cm from the power line.  The edges of the wires are ringed with special plugs. </p><h2>  Fixture installation </h2><p>  Installation will depend on where all the shooting points are located.  If these are wall or ceiling structures, holes are cut out in them to completely deepen the device.  With the help of a building mixture, the camera is fixed, and only the lens remains on the outside.  It can be masked by a picture, furniture or other accessories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="offlink.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to install a hidden camera at home do it yourself" class="if uuid-2628384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2628384.jpg"></div><p>  In a closet, a mini-video camera is even easier to mount, but do not forget about some requirements.  The lens should not be placed in the dark or point towards a light fixture. </p><h2>  Connecting a camera and setting it up </h2><p>  In the process of installing a hidden camera, all loops are connected to the registration device.  After starting, the camcorder should go through identification mode.  This can be done using automatic or manual settings.  After the equipment has been tested, the mini-camcorder is ready for use. </p><p>  In the event that you install a video surveillance system in a public place, you need to notify all visitors and attendees.  In a different situation, this will be regarded as an invasion of personal life. </p><h2>  How to choose the right device? </h2><p>  In order to equip your own video surveillance system, first of all you need to decide on the number of devices, as well as their parameters.  Today, there are various options that will differ by all criteria.  In this case, attention should be paid to the main ones: </p><ol><li>  Resolution.  In recommendations on how to find a hidden camera, such a characteristic is always indicated.  It is measured in megapixels.  In order to get an image in high quality format, you can use a resolution of 2 megapixels.  You can check if you multiply the number of dots per inch.  If we talk about the acquisition of several cameras, then you can easily buy the main part at 1 or 2 megapixels, as well as stock up on one or two cameras at 3-5 megapixels.  Their installation is carried out in those places where you need to detail all the images.  If you purchase a camera for a summer residence or apartment, then this is not necessary. </li><li>  Matrix.  It is of two types - CCD and CMOS.  The first option is very picky about climatic conditions, and therefore it must be protected from direct sunlight.  In addition, it must be remembered that the matrix will respond poorly to temperature changes.  It will cost several times more than its counterpart.  The CMOS camera is not inferior to the original version, but you can save a small amount when creating your own video surveillance. </li><li>  Matrix size.  It is measured diagonally and the size is presented in inches.  You should pay attention to such a parameter only when focusing on other characteristics of the camera. </li><li>  Frame frequency.  It can be from 8 to 30 frames per second.  If you shoot motionless scenes, then you can stock up on a minimum.  But when busy objects come into view, it is best to choose a high frame rate. </li><li>  Photosensitivity.  The characteristic is indicated in suites and can be adapted for work at dusk, and at night. </li><li>  Zoom  Such a parameter can be in various versions, and there are a fairly large number of classifications of this indicator today.  Therefore, when choosing such a characteristic, it is best to consult with professionals. </li><li>  Infrared beam illumination.  It allows you to increase the distance that can be seen on the camera.  This parameter varies in the range from 5 to 100 meters. </li><li>  The presence of a microphone. </li><li>  Body.  For a hidden camera, this characteristic will be very relevant.  In this case, the housing may be plastic or anti-vandal.  You can‚Äôt save on it, because in the future it can simply be broken. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.easywifi.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hidden camera size" class="if uuid-2628375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2628375.jpg"></div><h2>  How to recognize a hidden camera? </h2><p>  If you do not know where the hidden camera is located, then it is best to use the detection technique.  The main methods include the following: </p><ol><li>  Find the signs.  The camera lens is usually masked.  Here you need to examine the possible places to find.  If you are in an apartment, then you need to start from the bedroom and finish the kitchen.  In addition, in most cases, cameras hide in various accessories.  Indoor plants, books, soft toys, furniture and much more can be used here.  If the room has bags, boxes, decorative objects, then it is best to check them as well.  If this is not found, then you need to look at the small hole.  They can be located on any surface where you can make a good overview of the room.  Take a closer look at the mirrors.  Near them, such devices are also installed. </li><li>  Suspicious places.  If you are walking along the street and do not know where the cameras are located, it is best to look at places with good visibility.  Usually it can be roofs, open spaces.  One example of such a hidden camera is in the photo below.  In this case, it is disguised as an ordinary birdhouse. <div class="photo" data-original="www.policja.waw.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to install a hidden camera on transport" class="if uuid-2628386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2628386.jpg"></div></li><li>  Stock up on video surveillance technology.  To do this, there are various hidden camera detectors that can be purchased at any electronics store.  In addition, you can use your mobile phone.  If your phone will make strange sounds or clicks, then this device is located nearby.  Not all phones can be used for verification.  Only those devices that respond to the phone or speakers fall under such criteria. <div class="photo" data-original="allegro.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to install hidden cameras" class="if uuid-2628373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2628373.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  As you can see, the installation process is quite simple.  To do this, you need to use only all your skills and stock up with the necessary information on how to install a hidden camera at home with your own hands.  In the event that you are not confident in your abilities, use the services of professionals better.  They will do it efficiently and quickly. </p>
