Therefore, it is important for beginner tailors to know the types of buttonholes and how to make them yourself.  If you follow the instructions, then it is not so difficult.  In this article, we will look at how to make button loops manually on a typewriter and using a needle and thread. </p><h2>  Types of loops </h2><p>  In total, there are 5 types of loops in light clothing.  It: </p><ul><li>  swept loops; </li><li>  hinges from a tucked cord; </li><li>  loops of straight flat fabric; </li><li>  air; </li><li>  obtachnye. </li></ul><p>  The location on the fabric of the welded loops can be different: transverse, lobar or oblique.  But the sewing process itself does not have fundamental differences. </p><h2>  Overcast stitches </h2><p>  This type of loop can be done manually.  And it is possible on a sewing machine, choosing a special mode for this.  The meaning of the overlay is that the fabric on the buttonhole does not crumble.  You can make such a loop in the same color as the product, and in contrast.  It depends on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe manufactured item of clothing.  So, how to make a buttonhole for yourself manually? </p><p>  First, you need to outline the location of the cuts with chalk or a special marker, which subsequently completely disappears.  It is necessary to draw on the front side of the future product.  To begin and end, sheathe the loop with thread.  They are clearly visible in the following picture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.madeeveryday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Basting stitches" class="if uuid-2845876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2845876.jpg"></div><p>  Bindings need to be done this way: several straight stitches forward, then back and again forward. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sheathe the place of the product where the slot will subsequently be made, it is not necessary close, leaving a small gap.  So the thread with which we wrap the loop will remain intact.  First you need to overcast one side, and then the other. </p><p>  But manually, a perfectly smooth swept loop cannot be completed.  Therefore, the manual method is relevant only for those needlewomen who do not have sewing machines.  However, in the presence of this miracle of technology that facilitates tailor's work, the process will not fundamentally differ.  The loops will only become smoother and more accurate.  But still, we will take a closer look at how to make button loops with your own hands using a sewing machine. </p><p>  First, again, we outline everything with a chalk (it is important that it is always sharp) or a marker on the front of clothes, underwear, etc., based on the size of the button.  The second is to install a special foot on the machine, which is specifically designed for overcasting loops.  It looks approximately as shown below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecolorfulworldofsewing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Buttonhole foot" class="if uuid-2845885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2845885.jpg"></div><p>  Next, select and set the desired mode, not forgetting to pre-select the type of loop we need. </p><p>  After stitching, we carefully cut a hole between the stitches with a thin blade.  Everything, the swept loop is ready. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Drawstring hinges </h2><p>  That's how elegant and airy they look. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.buttonthebride.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drawstring hinges" class="if uuid-2845939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2845939.jpg"></div><p>  How <span>to make</span> button <span>loops</span> manually?  This is not very difficult, and not even the most experienced seamstress can do it. </p><p>  To make a steering wheel (this is the second name for this loop), you need to cut a strip of fabric along the oblique (5 degrees), the width of which will be 3 cm. The length depends on the intended size.  The loop must be sewn with stitches of approximately 1.5 mm, not more.  Large stitches then make it difficult to turn the steering wheel.  The strip should look like a funnel: first a little narrower, and then wider.  After the future eyelet is sewn, the excess fabric along the seam must be carefully cut.  This will help to easily turn the steering wheel, and it will remain level. </p><p>  You can twist the loop with a needle, hooking it on the remaining thread and pushing inward with a blunt end.  Use a thimble, it will protect your fingers from wounds. </p><p>  After the cord is ready, it must be ironed with one end of a pin to the ironing board.  The handlebar does not need to be ironed, but only slightly ironed, holding the iron without weight, because the product should remain round, and not become flat. </p><p>  Now the loop from the drafted cord can be sewn to our product. </p><h2>  Straight-loop hinges </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blog.colettehq.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Straight Flat Loops" class="if uuid-2845972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2845972.jpg"></div><p>  Consider the instructions on how to make button loops manually. </p><p>  For this loop, a strip of 3.5 mm wide is cut out, and its length will be 4 cm plus two button diameters.  Such a strip is folded in half inward, with the wrong side out, and then folded edges are sewn together.  You need to retreat 1 mm from the edge.  Next, we fold the strip in half, but already across, forming a triangle on the fold, and go through the transverse line along it.  Bend the ends.  Now the loop can be attached to the fabric.  The ends are equalized among themselves.  We attach to the front side at a distance of 4-6 mm from the cut of the thing.  It is possible to process the edges of this fastener by picking or turning. </p><h2>  Air loops </h2><p>  They are made of thread.  It can be silk, floss, and so on.  It all depends on whether the clasp is hidden or not, whether it is a bright finish or an ordinary loop, and of the thickness of the fabric.  For example, on thin silk, other loops can look heavy and rough, and thin airy one may look right in place.  So how to make button loops manually? </p><div class="photo" data-original="patternscissorscloth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Air loop" class="if uuid-2846019" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2846019.jpg"></div><p>  The essence of the work is to make a loop of several layers of thread, and then trim it.  The diameter of the buttonhole should be 1-2 mm wider than the button.  How many arcs will be needed for this loop, you need to look based on the thickness of the threads.  3-4 is enough for some, but 12 may not be enough for thin silk. </p><p>  Loop processing options can be varied.  For example, tatting the seam when sewing everything with an ordinary buttonhole seam, but the nodules are made in the front or back in a checkerboard pattern.  Gedebo seam is also suitable.  Thanks to this finish, a hem along the entire length is formed on the loop.  Trimming should be done from the wrong side.  The double loop seam is also well suited for air loop processing.  It also needs to be done from the inside out.  Due to the fact that the needle sticks into the loop not once, but twice, the seam is quite tight. </p><h2>  Stitching loops </h2><p>  These loops are difficult to perform.  But there is a little trick that will help ease the <span>work of tailors.</span>  So that the fabric does not crumble and is precisely marked, it is necessary to use masking tape. </p><p>  How to make button loops manually: step-by-step instructions for the buttonhole loop: </p><ol><li>  It is necessary to determine how long the loop will be.  To do this, we use data on the diameter and thickness of the button, add 3-6 mm here.  The width of the loop itself is 6 mm.  We draw a loop on graph paper, laying a thin plastic and gluing it with tape.  On each of the loops you need to make a blank of adhesive tape. </li><li>  Already ready-made frames carefully run a seam with a stitch length of 1 mm.  Also, for each individual loop, you need to prepare your own turning with a width of 6.5 mm.  We pin the trim with safety pins to the front side of the side, where the loop is planned.  Now you need to lay two parallel seams from the wrong side, which will exactly coincide with the front ones.  The beginning and end of all seams are exclusively in the corners. </li><li>  Gently cut first the grinder, and then the board itself and turn the edges of the grinder to the wrong side.  We sew all edges with fastening lines. </li><li>  Sweep the board to the side, completely pierce the layers with pins.  Gently and accurately glue the adhesive tape to the finished part and sew.  The tape can be removed, the loop is ready. <div class="photo" data-original="www.juliabobbin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stitching loops" class="if uuid-2846043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2846043.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  It should be noted that such loops are used, as a rule, in the manufacturing process of outer thick clothes such as coats. </p><p>  We learned the basics of how to make button loops manually.  But sewing is a creative process.  And fantasy here is far from the last place.  It‚Äôs especially cool to think and work on how to make the fasteners a real decoration of the whole thing, and, of course, then with pride to wear this original product. </p>
