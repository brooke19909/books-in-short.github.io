    <p>  <strong>A bit about taxes</strong> </p><p>  If a person has electronic money, then tax authorities can pay attention to this income (especially when it is cashed through official organizations).  They will not look at your costs, they are interested in profit.  For example, a person spent 1.5 thousand rubles on a domain and hosting for a year.  And the income received for the same period amounted to only 1000 rubles.  Obviously, the site was unprofitable, but tax representatives can say that they do not know the costs, but the extra profit of a person amounted to a thousand rubles, 130 rubles must be paid.  1,500 rubles are the same expenses as the cost of food, clothing.  However, taxes are a separate topic for discussion. </p><p>  <strong>Some options</strong> </p><p>  Let's get back to <span>how to cash money</span> with WebMoney.  The best way is to find a trusted friend who needs electronic money, for example, to buy goods online.  He will give you cash, and you will transfer the necessary amount to the R-wallet.  In this case, you lose only 0.8 percent of the total cash amount.  Find out among friends and relatives who often have to replenish their electronic funds - your proposal may interest them.  In addition, this method allows you to cash out not only rubles - you only need to agree on the exchange rate.  Cons of such an exchange: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Sometimes it's hard to find such a friend. </li><li>  One person may need only a small amount of money, then you will have to look for a second person or look for another way how to cash money with WebMoney. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to cash money with WebMoney" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15118/230369.jpg" width="345"></div></li></ul><p>  You can withdraw the considered electronic means through exchange points.  They may be unauthorized, which means that you can become a victim of fraud.  It is better to go to the official WebMoney website and see a list of points of issue.  Try to avoid exchanges in suspicious places such as apartments, basements, or unofficial organizations in basements on the outskirts of the city.  It is better that these are central offices, which can be visited in the daytime.  Funds from your wallet to their account should be transferred only if there is a protection code.  Make an appointment in advance so that they will prepare the right amount of money for you.  If the company is honest, then they will immediately put the money in front of you, it remains only to say the code that will be driven into a special input line.  After that, your money will be transferred to their electronic wallet.  You may be asked for a passport, but with an amount that exceeds 2 thousand dollars, they will also check whether the data matches the ones indicated in your account.  What is this for?  It is believed that such organizations pay all taxes, this is necessary for reporting.  If you often withdraw large amounts, then the relevant authorities may be interested in you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <strong>other methods</strong> </p><p>  Many are interested in knowing <span>how to cash money with WebMoney</span> in the mail.  Withdrawals through such transfers are very slow, from 3 to 5 days.  In this case, you lose about 3.3%.  You need a personal or initial certificate, but there is still a limit on the amount displayed per day.  Mail on request can transfer information to the tax authorities.  Therefore, if you have decent income, then it‚Äôs better not to violate the law. </p><p>  There is still the possibility of withdrawing electronic funds through money transfer systems: UniStream, Leader, Anelik, Western Union and many others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to transfer money with WebMoney" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15118/230393.jpg" width="315"></div>
