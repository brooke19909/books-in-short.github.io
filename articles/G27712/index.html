Also, tourists are attracted by a large number of commemorative relics and the history of the city itself.  In the article you will find interesting facts about the history of Anapa and photos of the main attractions with a description. </p><p>  The city of Anapa is considered the sunniest in Russia.  The number of sunny days per year reaches 280. The famous Anapa beaches stretch over 40 kilometers.  Anapa is a place that is suitable for a beach holiday, active pastime and the healing process of children and adults. </p><p>  The article below will examine interesting facts about the history of the city of Anapa and photos of its original and remarkable places. </p><h2>  How to get to Anapa </h2><p>  You can get to Anapa by train, which goes to Vityazevo station.  The distance from the railway station to the city center is 15 km, which can be overcome by regular bus or taxi. </p><p>  Anapa has an airport that accepts flights from all over Russia.  The distance between the airport and the city center is also 15 km. </p><h2>  A Brief History of Anapa </h2><p>  According to archaeological excavations, the first people appeared on the territory of modern Anapa more than 10,000 years ago. </p><p>  During excavations on the territory of the current city, the remains of settlements, cemeteries and treasures were found.  Things found on the territory of modern Anapa make it possible to say that the predominant occupation of local residents at that time was agriculture and cattle breeding.  In addition, people actively made ceramics and processed metal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The history of Anapa begins its calculation for many millennia BC, when the city of Sindik appeared on the Black Sea.  The city was actively developing as a major seaport.  Subsequently, Cindic was renamed Gorgippia.  Gorgippia was a major trading center and even issued its own coins. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coins of Gorgippia" class="if uuid-2824026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2824026.jpg"></div><p>  The beginning of the 13th century was marked by the construction of a fortress on the territory of modern Anapa.  She got the name "Mapa."  In 1475, the fortress was captured by the Turks.  It is in this year that the history of the city of Anapa begins.  In place of the old fortress walls, the Turks built a new fortification, inferior in size to the previous one.  The history of the name of the city of Anapa comes just from here: the Turks called their new fortress just like that - Anapa. </p><p>  An interesting fact is that the fortress passed into Russian possessions peacefully under the Adrianopol Treaty, which was signed in 1892. </p><p>  In 1866, Anapa again receives the status of a city that has become entrenched forever. </p><p>  It is not surprising that in a short period of time the city turns into a resort.  The unique climate and excellent location attract families from nearby cities to relax. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The history of Anapa as a developed tourist center dates back to <span>1900:</span> it was at this time that the first Beregovaya sanatorium was built on the territory of Anapa. </p><h2>  Archaeological Open Air Museum </h2><p>  In addition to the beautiful beaches and the azure sea, in Anapa and the surrounding area you can observe a large number of attractions that every guest of the city must see.

Immediately after construction in 1837, the church was visited by Emperor Nicholas I. During the Crimean War, the building was destroyed, but 20 years later it was rebuilt again.  In the Soviet period, the church building was used as the house of pioneers. </p><p>  Now the temple is completely restored.  Services are held there daily.  A Sunday school for children and adults is organized here, as well as a library in which you can find many books telling about the history and sights of Anapa. </p><h2>  Promenade </h2><p>  The visiting card of the city is Central Embankment, where there is a large amount of entertainment for vacationers.

It was installed in this place in 1898, but was completely destroyed during the war.  The lighthouse, which guests of the city can see today, was built in 1955 on the steep bank of the Cape Anapa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa lighthouse" class="if uuid-2824001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2824001.jpg"></div><p>  From the observation deck located near the lighthouse, incredibly beautiful views of the sea open.
