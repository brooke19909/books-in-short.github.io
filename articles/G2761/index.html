    <p>  This prestigious and beautiful Turkish resort Kemer, the photos of hotels which potential customers love to consider, has its own special charm.  Beaches made of smooth pebbles or light sand, picturesque bays, pine or eucalyptus thickets - this is not a tourist paradise.  In general, the prices of hotels in Kemer are 3 stars, 4 or 5, which are quite affordable for Russians. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The resort is divided into the city itself and the many villages surrounding it.  Most hotels located in the resort area are located far from the beach, for example, Hotel Golden Sun 3 *.  However, on the first line you can find many suitable options for different types of recreation.  These are Valeri Beach 4 *, Grand Gul Beach Resort, Sultan's Beach and many others. </p><h2>  3 star hotels Kemer </h2><p>  Not everyone can afford regular trips to the expensive fives of Turkey.  Moreover, tourists always have an irresistible desire to spend a vacation inexpensively, but with comfort.  In this case, the best choice will be 3-star Kemer hotels - a budget vacation option. </p><p>  Of course, vacationers will have to choose longer and with great care.  Indeed, in comparison with higher-class hotels, the ‚Äúthree stars‚Äù have worse rooms, and the territory is not so green and large, and the food is not always ‚Äúvaried‚Äù, although tasty.  However, it is worth remembering that rest requires the sea, the sun and not necessarily the most chic room for sleeping.  Moreover, in more luxurious hotels for additional services that guests often do not even use, sometimes you have to completely overpay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Golden Sun 3" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/476317.jpg" width="600"></div>
