    <h2>  Appearance of the device </h2><p>  Let's start with an earlier version of the device, with its appearance. </p><p>  Sven Royal 2 speakers (user reviews can confirm this) are characterized by a first-class level of design and the highest quality materials used in the decoration of the case.  It can be noted that the front panel of the speakers is covered with a special <span>piano lacquer,</span> and this, as experts note, is not a typical characteristic for audio devices of the corresponding class. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the speakers, the manufacturer also paid great attention to the quality of the materials from which they are made.  So, for example, tweeters are made of silk, which allows them to provide the highest quality sound reproduction.  However, the speaker user should be careful when handling the corresponding components.  The silk speaker can be quite easily damaged by careless exposure. </p><p>  Low-frequency components of the corresponding type are polymeric.  According to the manufacturer of the Sven Royal 2 device, these speakers are also characterized by exceptional manufacturability and outstanding acoustic qualities.  As part of the <span>low-frequency speaker dynamics</span> there is also an element for phase equalization, due to which the level of sound distortion is reduced when playing melodies. </p><p>  In the back of the device‚Äôs case there is a button for turning on the speakers, a connector for connecting them to the device on which sound is reproduced, special terminals through which one speaker is connected to another.  Here is the outlet of the bass reflex pipe. </p><p>  On the front panel of the Sven Royal 2 speakers are the keys that control the audio system.  In order to adjust the frequencies, you must press the Function button.  If necessary, you can reset the device to factory settings: to do this, press the specified button, and then hold it for 3 seconds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Sven Royal 2 speakers are shipped in branded boxes.  In total, there are 2 speakers, 1 active, and the second passive.  Also in the box are: </p><p>  - signal cables; </p><p>  - acoustic cable; </p><p>  - warranty card; </p><p>  - user's manual. </p><p>  It can be noted that the cables supplied with the speakers allow you to connect audio devices to them in a fairly wide range: these can be computers, players or other sound sources that do not have a built-in amplifier.  In general, the speaker design corresponds to a two-band format, characterized by phase-inverted acoustics. </p><p>  The Sven Royal 2 circuit includes a group of capacitors with increased capacitance, as well as a transformer classified as torroidal, with high power.  The phase equalizer allows, according to experts, to significantly improve the characteristics of the speakers, in terms of amplitude-frequency parameters.  In addition, the corresponding hardware component can reduce the level of distortion, as well as expand the directivity spectrum of the sound device. </p><p>  The left column of the device is active.  In its structure there is an amplifier, as well as a power supply.  The device control unit is fully digital.  It has an LED, as well as 3 buttons that are used to adjust the sound volume, as well as adjust the frequencies.  According to experts, this design is characterized by very high reliability and is in many ways superior to analog solutions for adjusting sound.  It should be noted that in practice, using the Sven Royal 2 speaker configuration scheme with 3 buttons has nuances.  It may not be easy for an untrained user to use the appropriate tool. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  We will study the main characteristics of the Sven Royal 2 device. The device has: </p><p>  - an output power of 40 W; </p><p>  - tweeter with a diameter of 25 mm, woofer - 165 mm; </p><p>  - resistance of 6 ohms; </p><p>  - magnetic shielding function; </p><p>  - a supply voltage of 220 V; </p><p>  - support for the frequency range from 35 to 20,000 Hz; </p><p>  - dimensions that are 210 x 305 x 397 mm; </p><p>  - weight of 16.9 kg. </p><p>  In general, the main features of the device allow you to use it not only at home, but also in some cases as an element of the studio infrastructure.  Sven Royal 2 speakers, the technical characteristics of which we have reviewed above and can be rated as the most competitive in the segment, are thus an affordable and universal solution. </p><h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  How do users rate the Sven Royal 2 speakers in terms of the quality of the sound they play?  In general, the corresponding functionality of the considered devices is characterized exclusively positively: the speakers perfectly reproduce both high and low frequencies.  In this case, the sound is reproduced at a sufficient level of its volume. </p><p>  In general, the columns allow you to play almost any melody.  Sven Royal 2.0 speakers are especially competitive when listening to classical symphonic music.  The speaker, which is large enough in diameter, allows for the reproduction of bass with excellent quality by means of the speakers in question. </p><p>  At the same time, users and specialists do not observe any noticeable noise.  The Sven Royal 2 speakers make noise only if the corresponding sounds are provided by the sound recording.  Of course, much depends on its quality.  Using equipment at the level of the speakers in question definitely requires a sound recording with a fairly high bitrate.  The same can be said about the hardware part of the infrastructure used to play tunes.  The speakers in question can be connected to equipment within the widest range. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, it is important that the capabilities of the players allow you to use the technological advantages of the devices in question.  If this is a PC, then its sound card should be at the level, if not studio, then in terms of basic characteristics comparable to it. </p><p>  Of course, the device must also be configured in terms of setting the optimal frequency parameters.  However, the design of the columns provides all the necessary components to solve this problem. </p><h2>  Sound Control: Nuances </h2><p>  So, 2 buttons located on the right, in the general case, are responsible for increasing or decreasing the sound volume.  But if you press the Function button 2 times, then the LED located on the sound control panel will change color to orange (initially it is green), and 2 other buttons can be used to adjust low frequencies. </p><p>  In turn, if you press Function 3 times, the LED will change color to red, and using the 2 buttons on the right, you can work with high frequencies. </p><h2>  Connecting third-party devices: what to look for? </h2><p>  Both speakers, which are part of the speakers, have screw terminals that allow you to connect third-party devices using an speaker cable, which has a large cross-section.  That is, we are talking about the fact that the user has the opportunity to connect the Sven Royal 2 speakers to powerful professional audio equipment.  But you should not experiment with the device: you should connect it only to the infrastructure that has already been tested.  Of course, if the main modules of the device are worn out, and the only prospect to continue using the speakers will be a rework in the passive of Sven Royal 2, then in this case you can try to use the device in atypical modes.  But while the speakers are functional, you should adhere to standard formats for building the infrastructure for reproducing sound. </p>

    <p>  According to experts, the speakers in question are characterized by the reproduction of pure, very clean bass - at the level of a studio subwoofer.  At the same time, it is recommended to install speakers on special racks: this will reveal their greater potential in terms of ensuring high quality sound reproduction than when placing devices simply on the floor. </p><h2>  Royal 2 speakers: expert ratings </h2><p>  So, the <span>speaker system</span> from Sven in the Royal 2 modification refers to multimedia acoustics, which allows for the reproduction of the highest quality sound while maintaining the optimal frequency balance, as well as at a sufficient volume level.  The device is universal: it can be connected both to a computer and to professional sound equipment.  The refinement of Sven Royal 2 in terms of selecting the optimal settings for frequencies is carried out using a convenient digital control panel (although it takes some time for the inexperienced user to master it). </p>

    <p>  Many industry publications that write about audio equipment have recognized the Royal 2 speakers as one of the best solutions in their segment.  Experts agree with such estimates.  The solution from Sven has excellent potential in terms of playing melodies in any genre, their design is at the level of top solutions. </p><p>  Therefore, it is not surprising that Sven decided to continue further technological development of the product.  The result of this work was the release of columns in the updated Royal 2R modification.  What are the main advantages of this solution?  How does it differ from Sven Royal 2 speakers?  An overview of the capabilities of the updated modification of the corresponding device is later in the article. </p><h2>  Royal 2R device: main advantages </h2><p>  It is worth noting that externally the speakers in the modifications of Royal 2 and Royal 2R are not much different.  So, in the newer version, the speakers have more massive walls of the front of the case.  They are covered with polished varnish.  <span>The speakers of the device</span> as a whole are presented in the same structure that characterizes the corresponding hardware components of the previous column modification.  Sound control is carried out using three buttons, as in the Royal 2R version, the principles of their use are the same. </p><p>  Probably the main advantage of the Sven Royal 2R speakers over the previous modification of the device is the presence of a remote control.  It was not included in the delivery package of the older version.  This remote control is made of frosted plastic, has comfortable rubber buttons.  Its functionality almost repeats the one that is available when the control panel is activated. </p>

    <h2>  Royal 2R speakers: specifications </h2><p>  Consider the key characteristics of the updated column modification.  The device in question has: </p><p>  - output power, which is 50 watts; </p><p>  - a tweeter speaker with a diameter of 25 mm, made of silk, broadband - 165 mm, polymer; </p><p>  - frequency range from 35 to 25,000 Hz; </p><p>  - housing made of high quality fiberboard; </p><p>  - a power transformer belonging to the class of toroidal; </p><p>  - magnetic shielding function; </p><p>  - installed compensating filters; </p><p>  - 2 stereo inputs of switched type; </p><p>  - dimensions 210 x 397 x 306 mm; </p><p>  - mass, which is 16.9 kg. </p><p>  Thus, the capabilities of the considered version of the device are slightly superior to those that characterize the previous modification of the device.  In particular, they are more technological in terms of frequency and power, but these are important characteristics of the speakers.  The build quality of the device is characterized by experts as exceptionally high - both at the level of external hardware components, and from the point of view of the electronic component. </p><p>  Let us now examine what the effectiveness of using the hardware resources of the device in question is in practice - based on tests conducted by experts. </p><h2>  Royal 2R speakers: expert testing and evaluations </h2><p>  If we talk about playing tunes at low volume, then sound transmission in the corresponding mode is characterized by deep transmission of vocal frequencies, clear reproduction of instruments, high quality bass playback.
