It attracts wonderful beaches, many places where you can have a great time, wonderful restaurants, unique sights and, of course, the opportunity to choose the perfect hotel for your stay.  We suggest you stop your attention at Grand <span>Faros Hotel 4 *</span> Standard.  Marmaris will surely appeal to those who have never been here and will not deceive the expectations of those who are already familiar with it.  And the hotel will provide the most comfortable stay here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Again, the <span>Grand Faros Hotel</span> 4 Standard is located in Marmaris, but not in the city center, but on its outskirts, surrounded by orange orchards and olive groves, behind which the mountains begin.  From here, to the center of Marmaris, where the main tourist attractions and dozens of shops are concentrated, is only 3.2 km away.  Many tourists prefer to overcome them on foot.  Such a walk takes about half an hour.  About 100 meters from the hotel is Mustafa Kemal Pasha Street, one of the main streets in the city.  Intensive traffic of vehicles, including minibuses and buses, is carried out along it.  Therefore, those guests who do not like to walk have the opportunity to cheaply and quickly get to the center of Marmaris by public transport. </p>

    <p>  The hotel's shortcomings noted in most reviews: </p><ul><li>  far from the sea; </li><li>  shuttle provision only three times a day; </li><li>  lack of children's animation; </li><li>  not all rooms are renovated; </li><li>  poor soundproofing of rooms; </li><li>  the presence of warm water in the shower only a few hours a day; </li><li>  no Russian-speaking staff. </li></ul><p>  Bottom line: this hotel is perfect for those who plan to relax quietly, away from the noise of entertainment centers, bars and discos.  For young people and families with children, it may not be very comfortable here. </p>
