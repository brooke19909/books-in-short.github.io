Now it‚Äôs hard to imagine your existence without a refrigerator, TV, <span>microwave</span> or coffee maker.  A few years ago, the main reason that prompted us to acquire one or another item was the desire to equip our home with the latest technology.  Currently, we strive to become the owners of not only the necessary, but also useful equipment.  Therefore, consumers often face the following questions: "Which brands of refrigerators are the most reliable? Is a gas stove better or induction? Which multicooker is more functional? What is the difference between <span>a cyclone type vacuum cleaner</span> and a regular <span>vacuum cleaner</span> ? What are the advantages of a coffee machine and a coffee machine?"  In this article we will talk about which brands of refrigerators are the most reliable. </p>

    <h2>  Criterias of choice </h2><p>  It‚Äôs unlikely that you can choose a good technique that meets all the necessary requirements if, when purchasing vegetables in a store, you somehow suddenly and accidentally decide to opt for this equipment.  Like any other category of home appliances, refrigerators have their own selection criteria.  Therefore, before acquiring the latter, it is necessary to obtain complete information on the desired parameters.  The first requirement consumers place on refrigerators is reliability.  The second is durability.  And of course, the price. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Global manufacturers of household appliances and their competitors </h2><p>  In order to get an answer to the question of which brands of refrigerators are the most reliable, you can turn to specialists who annually compile ratings of household equipment.  The list of manufacturers of excellent home appliances is changing annually: someone is losing ground, someone is rising.  However, almost all brands of reliable refrigerators are presented under the same brands from year to year.  These include Bosch, LG, Ariston, Whirlpool, Samsung, Sharp and others.  Often among the competitors of European giants that produce household equipment, one can also find domestic manufacturers.  By the way, experts note the increased quality of the products of the domestic Atlanta.  However, the German concern Liebherr holds the palm among all competing companies.  This company, without a doubt, can answer the question: ‚ÄúWhich refrigerator is the most reliable?‚Äù  This is a technique manufactured in Germany at the plants of this organization. </p>

    <h2>  German concern Liebherr </h2><p>  This brand has been on the market for more than fifty years.  Since 1954, the people of Europe have enjoyed using Liebherr refrigerators.  It is this company that still owns the lion's share of the European refrigeration equipment market.  The reason for this is hidden in the development of the engineers of the concern.  Back in 1966, the FrostSafe system was opened in the company's laboratories, which left the competitors of the organization far behind and put Liebherr in first place among manufacturers of refrigerators. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__7qr"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__7qr"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__7qr"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__7qr"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__7qr"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that the engineers of the organization have always chosen the direction of their development in accordance with the requirements of people.  So, in the early 80s of the twentieth century, the whole society began to discuss plans for the conservation and restoration of nature.  In this regard, Liebherr also emphasized these parameters.  The concern began production of new models of refrigerators with improved thermal insulation, which allowed to reduce the amount of electricity consumed.  And after ten years, the company became an innovator in the production of equipment, whose work is based on a complete closed cycle.  Since then, environmental friendliness has been the main parameter that distinguishes Liebherr refrigerators from their competitors. </p>

    <h2>  New functioning system </h2><p>  However, not only these properties are the main criteria on which buyers of equipment of the German concern rely.  If you look into the history of the company, you can find a remarkable fact.  The NoFrost system was first developed and implemented by Liebherr.  Already followed by other world brands. </p><p>  At the end of the twentieth century, the first refrigerators equipped with the NoFrost system and the energy consumption class ‚ÄúA‚Äù left the conveyors of the German manufacturer.  In simple terms, thanks to the successful work of the company's engineers, we now have a great opportunity to be content with high-quality equipment with low resource use. </p>

    <h2>  A variety of models of a high price category </h2><p>  Liebherr is also the first manufacturer of refrigerators in the world whose interior shelves are made of tempered glass.  Scientists have proven that this material, in comparison with other analogues, is the most environmentally friendly and safe for humans. </p><p>  At the moment, the company's lineup has a huge number of options.  Here, wine cabinets, refrigerated display cases for shops, various freezers and others found their place.  However, home appliances of various modifications and sizes are most popular. </p><p>  That is why many people who are faced with the question: "What reliable refrigerator to choose?"  - Without a doubt give preference to equipment Liebherr.  The household appliances of this concern are durable, high-quality and practically do not break.  The only negative point is the high price. </p>

    <h2>  Bosch, Electrolux, Sharp and Zanussi - premium equipment </h2><p>  With the question ‚Äúwhat brands of refrigerators are the most reliable of the more affordable models‚Äù, we turn to the personal experience of consumers and the opinion of experts. </p><p>  Among the premium models, the equipment of the well-known manufacturer Bosch can be distinguished.  The company produces a huge number of reliable, energy-saving and stylish options, among which each potential consumer can choose equipment in accordance with the requirements. </p><p>  On one line in the ranking with Bosch, the Swedish brand Electrolux has settled down.  It is slightly inferior to German competitors.  The main negative aspect of the operation of refrigerators of this brand is the noise emitted during operation. </p><p>  Slightly overpriced due to the brand, Zanussi equipment is endowed with the price.  The rest is excellent quality, reliability and a long <span>warranty period.</span>  Japanese rival Sharp offers consumers great refrigerators at more reasonable prices.  A huge plus of this brand is the presence of a wide selection of diverse designs of manufactured equipment. </p>

    <h2>  Available and Common Options </h2><p>  As for the models of mass demand, it can be difficult to figure out which brand of refrigerator is more reliable.  One of the best options for home will be Samsung equipment.  Excellent quality, excellent design, excellent customer service and a huge variety of designs make this company's equipment especially attractive to customers. </p><p>  Indesit is slightly inferior to the manufacturer described above.  And the point here is not at all in the technical specifications.  Silent, multifunctional and energy-saving - they have a narrow design range. </p><p>  Brands such as LD, Whirpool, AEG cannot boast of a well-functioning customer service. </p><h2>  Other analogues </h2><p>  High-quality models of the economy class include domestic and some foreign manufacturers.  Atlant, VEKO, Stinol, Saratov offer customers a wide selection of options at affordable prices.  At the same time, some <span>models of these</span> companies are in no way inferior to equipment with a brand name.  If you do not want to overpay for the name and presence of incomprehensible functions, you should pay attention to the technique that does not "bite" at its cost.  It is worth remembering one more thing: everything will ever break, even a famous brand.  Therefore, an important factor in the choice will be the availability of the company's customer service near your home. </p>
