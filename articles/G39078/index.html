In addition, the baby begins to wield his fingers and can work with small details.  But making a younger preschooler roll balls and sausages from plasticine is not so simple, so you need to find your favorite object (animal, toy, bird, fish).  Today we‚Äôll talk about how to mold a cat from plasticine. </p><h2>  Basic rules for sculpting a cat </h2><p>  Regardless of how old the child is, you need to sculpt every detail, paying attention to the baby's small elements: paws, head, ears, eyes, nose, mustache, tail, stripes or spots on the wool.  Also use colors that are close to the real colors of the animals.  To do this, take a modern <span>mass for sculpting,</span> which allows you to create the desired shade by kneading different tones, as in paints. </p><p>  How to make a cat from plasticine: </p><ol><li>  Knead plasticine and make a long sausage for the body and legs. </li><li>  Cut the sausage from two sides with the help of the stack in half, forming two legs.  Please note that the middle must be whole - this will be the torso. </li><li>  Bend the resulting sausage and adjust the legs. </li><li>  From another plasticine you roll a ball for the head, separately make triangular ears, round eyes and nose, thin mustaches in the form of sausages. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to mold a cat from plasticine" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/340390.jpg" width="500"></div></li><li>  You immediately stick ears and all parts of the muzzle on your head. </li><li>  Next, attach the head with all the details to the body. </li><li>  Make a tail out of the sausage and attach to the other end of the body. </li><li>  If necessary, you can make strips of plasticine in a different color and attach to the trunk and tail. </li></ol><h2>  How to mold a cat from plasticine to a child yourself? </h2><p>  It is difficult for a three-year-old child to work with plasticine, especially to roll small balls, attach parts, while the baby makes sausages easily.  Therefore, the younger preschooler can make a lying cat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  First roll up a thick sausage for the body and head. </li><li>  Bend the sausage slightly in the form of the letter "C".  Please note that your body lies on the modeling board, so the paws are attached to it and to the body. </li><li>  Then make round paws and attach on four sides. </li><li>  Attach the tail, which you make from a thick sausage. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to mold a cat from plasticine" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/340389.jpg?1392964935029" width="600"></div></li><li>  Make triangular ears: roll small balls and form an angle from one end.  Attach them to the head. </li><li>  Next, roll small balls for eyes, nose and attach to the muzzle. </li><li>  You can roll strips of sausages on your body that you can flatten with your fingers. </li></ul><p>  As a result, the baby learns to roll balls, flatten plasticine, connect parts.  Five-year-old children according to this scheme can freely dazzle the animal themselves. </p><h2>  How to mold a plasticine cat to an older preschooler? </h2><p>  Complicate the task.  For example, you need to stick four paws to the body at once, draw fingers on them or form spots or pads on them from plasticine of a different color.  You can dazzle a cat in motion: it bends, washed, laps milk, goes. </p><p>  How to mold a cat from plasticine with a complication of the muzzle: </p><ul><li>  Roll the ball for the head.  In place of the ears, stretch it a little like a petal. </li><li>  Make triangular ears with a notch and attach to the head. </li><li>  Stack down on the middle of the ball, forming a horizontal line. </li><li>  In the middle of the line you make indentations for the eyes. </li><li>  Roll white balls and insert into the eye cavities.  Make small black pupils and attach to the white balls.  Please note that the position of the pupils on a white background allows you to form the direction of view. </li><li>  Make a white oval and sculpt in the middle under the line where the mouth should be. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a cat out of plasticine" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/340388.jpg?1392965013656" width="410"></div></li><li>  Roll two white circles and lay next to each other under the eyes and above the mouth, forming cheeks. </li><li>  On them in the middle sculpt a black nose. </li><li>  The body with paws and tail is done in the same way as in the first example. </li></ul><p>  Now you know several ways to mold a cat from plasticine.  In this case, you can use matches, toothpicks to attach the paws, tail and head to the body.  You can take copper wire instead of antennae, beads - instead of the eye and nose.  Show your child that the same cat can be done in many ways.  In this case, children broaden their horizons, develop their imagination and creative skills. </p>
