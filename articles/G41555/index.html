  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotels Thailand Pattaya - City Coast</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Pattaya is a resort city on the east coast, at a distance of 165 kilometers from Bangkok, southeast of the <span>capital of Thailand.</span>  In Pattaya, which is one of the most significant tourist centers of the country, more than five million tourists come every year.  A lot of guests come to the country from Russia, and last but not least they are attracted by their comfort. Hotels in Thailand Pattaya is glad to meet its guests with warm smiles and affectionate comfortable beaches. </p><p>  While walking around the city, you somehow do not believe that once, long before my birth, Pattaya was a tiny village in which ordinary people lived, the main occupation of which providing food and clothing to their families was fishing.  But in 1960, several wealthy families from Bangkok organized a resort in this village with excellent beaches, and gradually a modern city was built on the site of the village with good opportunities for very stormy entertainment.  Now Pattaya is a resort city for families, and there is a place for children too. </p><p>  The cost of living here is low, and the level of infrastructure is close to the western one, so in Pattaya there are so many tourists from Russia, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, and most of them come here recently with whole families. </p><p>  All my trips, both to Europe and to <span>Southeast Asia,</span> I organized independently, without buying ready-made tours.  This decision came after the very first (and the only, it just so happened) visit to a <span>travel agency.</span>  Having made sure that in travel agencies I can‚Äôt get exactly what I need, that if I purchase a tour I will be constrained by my standards framework, I decided to do everything on my own, especially since I‚Äôve got information about sights and everyday life in different countries enough peace to prepare for the trip properly. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At first, on forums and tourist sites, I examined the reviews of Pattaya hotels, as it turned out, it has a great variety of hotels both in the center or nearby, and on the outskirts of Pattaya.  I chose the Welcome Jomtien Beach hotel, inexpensive, but quite decent.  Now I can bring something new to the reviews of hotels in Thailand. Pattaya has many hotels, and many of them are located in the center.  The location of the hotel is almost in the center and bribed me.  In fact, Jomtien Beach turned out to be quite dirty, although not as bad as other beaches in the center.  Despite the not quite sterile cleanliness, there are many vacationers on the beach, and families with children love to be here, all thanks to the excellent opportunities for practicing water sports.  But I often crossed by ferry or boat to the <span>island of Koh Lan,</span> where both the water and the sand are very clean and transparent.  It was very interesting to sail on a glass bottom boat and look at the corals from above. </p><p>  At one time in the Maldives, I received an international diver certificate and a dive book, then I also made twelve dives in Egypt.  So, after the Maldives and Egypt, <span>diving in Thailand</span> seemed rather boring, so this time I made only three dives - this turned out to be enough. </p><p>  The hotel itself turned out to be a fairly modern eighteen-story building with a rather expressive look.  382 rooms, of which 82 are representative, are royal apartments.  So, there is nothing particularly good, but nearby is a center with bars, discos and vibrant nightlife.  If someone is interested in the opportunity to spend cultural time in the city, then you can‚Äôt imagine a better hotel.  If someone loves silence, comfort, a clean beach and the opportunity to spend the whole family with children, you can recommend the Ambassador City Jomtien Inn Wing, the largest and most remote. </p><p>  But this is not all Thailand hotels. Pattaya has many more different hotels.  When choosing, I advise you to keep in mind the following feature of Pattaya hotels: the closer the hotel is to the center, the worse the beach is with it and the better and more spectacular entertainment. </p><p>  This is Pattaya. Reviews of tourists say that the main <span>attraction of Pattaya</span> is the beaches.  But not everyone is ready to have fun and expose different parts of the body to the sun for days.  Hotels in Thailand Pattaya is no exception, can only serve as a place where a tourist can spend the night, nothing more.  In the afternoon, a tourist rarely stays in a hotel, except in case of illness ... </p><p>  The <span>nightlife</span> of Pattaya is also very interesting. Reviews of many tourists say that you can have a great time in night bars, massage parlors, discos.  So hotels in Thailand Pattaya generally looks very noisy and quite exotic at night. </p><p>  On my trips, I‚Äôm more interested in the real, living life of the country and its real cultural and historical values.  I was very interested in visiting fishing villages, I also went to the small town of Bang Pong, visited a crocodile farm, saw an elephant show and much more. </p>
