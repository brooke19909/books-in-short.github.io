They are so picturesque that in order to admire the scenery that opens from them, almost a million tourists come to the country.  In 2006, they were recognized as one of <span>Ireland's</span> most popular <span>attractions.</span>  This is the most famous natural landscape of the Green Island.  We can say that along with Guinness beer these cliffs are one of the recognizable brands with which Ireland is associated.  Let's take a virtual trip with you and get to know this natural wonder. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cliffs mohair ireland" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1711416.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Cliffs of Moher (Ireland) are located in County Clare.  This is the west coast of the country.  Traditionally, this area is called Burren, and administratively - Liscannor.  It is known for the fact that here archaeologists have found many ancient burials.  Near the cliffs there are many medieval castles or their ruins.  There are also interesting caves for cavers.  In the immediate vicinity of the cliffs, in 2007 an original and environmentally friendly tourist center was built.  Outwardly, it looks like a round hill covered with green grass.  In some ways, it resembles the hobbit houses from Peter Jackson's epic ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings‚Äù.  No wonder the international jury awarded him a special award as "unprecedented before." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cliffs of Moher (Ireland): how to get there </h2><p>  To get here, you need to go from Dublin to the north.  Will have to cross almost the whole country.  And it should be said that this is a considerable segment of the path.  For example, if you are in your own or rented car, and we will be counting from the <span>Dublin airport,</span> then the road will take you five hours in both directions.  Therefore, you need to move along the highways - M6 and M4.  There are paid sections on these roads, so get ready, in addition to gas costs, to spend an extra 15 euros.  If you are without your own transport, then there are two options for you.  The first is to go express to Galway and catch a tourist bus there, which will take you directly to the cliffs of Moher (Ireland).  A photo and an interesting story will be provided to you.  The second is to take the tourist bus in Dublin and do the same.  In both cases, the price will be approximately the same - about 45 euros. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cliffs moher ireland how to get" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1711441.jpg" width="469"></div>

    <h2>  Geological structure and history </h2><p>  Cliffs of Moher (Ireland) are a cliff.  This is a cliff that formed under the action of the surf.  Rocks consist mainly of black shales and sandstones.  Here you can see sections of different breeds.  They were formed three hundred million years ago.  Geologists call this time the Upper Carboniferous period.  By the way, the shale slabs from these cliffs were used by locals to build hedges around the fields.  On them you can still see the prints of fossil creatures.  And the current form of the cliff took about six thousand years BC and, as they say, they still remember the first immigrants from the continent.  Once there was an Irish fort called "Moher."  From him got a name and rocks.  But during the wars with Napoleon, the British destroyed this fortress and built a signal tower instead.  And another legend connects the cliffs with the suicide of the Druids, who allegedly, not wanting to recognize the victories of Christianity in Ireland, rushed down from the highest cliff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cliffs moher ireland description" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1711407.jpg" width="600"></div>

The spread of heights on the cliffs ranges from <span>120 m</span> on the stone island of Heads Head (Head of the Witch) to 214 m (a point eight kilometers from the O'Brien Tower).  The latter is an observation deck, built in the 19th century.  Even then, tourists began to visit such an attraction as the cliffs of Moher (Ireland).  A description of such travels can be found in memoirs of the eighteenth century, for example, in notes by John Loyd.  Sir Cornelius O'Brien (a local nobleman and, incidentally, a descendant of one of the Irish kings) erected this tower in 1835 in order to better contemplate the landscape.  They also say that he wanted to impress female visitors.  In fine weather, you can see the hills and valleys of Connemara, the Aran Islands and Galway Bay from here.  In order to get here, you need to pay a few euros. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cliffs of moher ireland photo" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1711415.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Who lives here </h2><p>  Cliffs of Moher (Ireland) are mainly a home for birds.  Twenty species live here.  A total of ornithologists calculated that about thirty thousand individuals live on the rocks.  On the cliffs lives one of the largest populations of rare birds such as the <span>Atlantic puffins.</span>  But petrels, loons, gulls, cormorants also feel great here.  In 1989, the rocks were declared a conservation area.  If you want to watch the birds, come here from April to July.  This is just the nesting period.  On the paths along the cliffs there are special telescopes that allow you to consider everything in detail.  Of plants, those that can cling to cracks in the rocks are common - wild herbs and flowers, mosses, liverworts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cliffs moher ireland info" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1711434.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <h2>  Cliffs of moher in culture </h2><p>  Irish legends did not pass this cliff.  The most ancient story, telling about the hero Kukhulin, says that a local witch named Mal fell in love with him.  The Irish hero wanted to run away from her and jumped from one stone to another.  But the witch was not so dexterous, could not resist, fell down and died.  These rocks with their bewitching appearance and some kind of magical aura attracted poets, writers, artists, and in our time, filmmakers.  For example, shots of the films ‚ÄúPrincess Bride‚Äù, ‚ÄúHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince‚Äù, ‚ÄúLeap Year‚Äù, as well as clips of the group ‚ÄúYu Tu‚Äù were shot here.  But these rocks have a dark tint.  People are said to come here who want to take their own lives.  But on the other hand, journalists claim that many rock victims actually die simply by negligence, coming here in foggy and rainy weather.  Many of them are extreme sportsmen who ride on the edge of the cliff on bicycles.  No wonder in "Harry Potter" the rocks are shown as the place where Voldemort hid part of his soul. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cliffs moher ireland reviews" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1711769.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cliffs of Moher (Ireland): traveler reviews </h2><p>  Most tourists coming to Dublin do not want to limit themselves to sightseeing in the capital.  Irish nature and history make for them a truly spectacular sight.  But all this can only be seen in the province.  And even if you decide to travel around Ireland, these rocks are included in the list of must-see.  Romantically inclined people and lovers of unusual landscapes and stunning photographs especially like it here.  Together with the rocks, tourists recommend stopping by at Dangwire Castle, on the bay.  Costumed balls a la the Middle Ages often take place there.  Travelers also noted the tourist center, which overlooks the cliffs of Moher (Ireland).  Information about these rocks can be obtained here in full and in an accessible form.  In addition, there are cafes with panoramic windows and a souvenir shop inside the center. </p>
