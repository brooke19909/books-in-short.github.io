If yesterday Apple and Samsung could be called the undisputed industry leaders, today other manufacturers are catching up with them.  One of them is the relatively young, but already well-known Xiaomi company, which came to us from the Chinese market.  She intrigued many users of mobile gadgets with her devices, which brought the company unheard of success.

    <h2>  Similarities to Apple </h2><p>  Let's start, of course, with the main difference between the products of this brand, which lies in the excessive resemblance to the “apple” technique.  This is evidenced by a lot of factors: glossy color, texture of plastic, soft rounded shapes.  Outwardly, it can sometimes be very difficult to distinguish where the Xiaomi MiPad is and where the Apple iPad Mini is.  Due to this, of course, the Xiaomi tablet receives a certain bonus in the eyes of the buyer, which is expressed in the attractive appearance of the device.  And already at the moment of choosing a gadget, this factor plays an important role. </p><p>  In addition to appearance, the <span>Xiaomi MiPad</span> tablet is <span>also</span> characterized by excellent usability.  This includes finishing materials, as well as the overall placement of buttons, their quality of work, and the like.  In all respects, as users note in their reviews, the device is ahead of even some Samsung tablets, despite Apple cloning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Own OS </h2>

    <p>  Xiaomi developers, inheriting the traditions of the great “apple” corporation, went even further.  On devices, they also began to use their operating system.  In truth, it is based on Android.  The only thing that developers have changed is the graphical shell (redrawing the design).  And everything would be fine, but visually it is very similar to the device on iOS 8: icons are used here in the same style as on the iPad.  Again, buyers like it, because the interface is much better than the same basic versions of Android.  For this reason, the devices are in demand among a wide audience of customers. </p><h2>  Low cost </h2><p>  Finally, another factor determining what made the Xiaomi MiPad tablet successful is price.  Apple devices cost about $ 600-700, and their counterpart (if you take into account the appearance) will cost only $ 200.  Moreover, there are rumors that the company is working on the release of a new model of an even cheaper device, the cost of which will be $ 100.  If the novelty really lives up to expectations, Xiaomi may become the second Apple.  By the way, the company earned such a title in the gadget market a couple of years ago. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, the fact that the company produces inexpensive tablets does not mean their poor quality or the presence of any noticeable shortcomings, as is often the case with other Chinese devices.  No, on the contrary, it seems that Xiaomi is working hard to improve its models, equipping them with the most advanced processors and optimizing the rest of the stuffing.  Due to this, the maximum speed of the tablet, its high-speed operation and excellent response are ensured. </p>

    <h2>  Revolutionary approach </h2><p>  Another positive aspect that is present in the activities of Xiaomi is the original approach.  They don’t use the classic methods of bringing phones and tablets to the market, but constantly experiment with how to make the next device, which will become popular in the future.  As an example, we can mention the mentioned tablet at a price of $ 100, or, for example, the launch of a new powerful phablet on the market;  or introducing a gadget with two operating systems, and so on.  All these products are risky in the sense that they can bring both success and failure for the company that produces them.  However, here, obviously, they are not afraid to experiment - and Xiaomi only grows its presence in the market over time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Models </h2>

    <p>  There are relatively few types of devices, by the way.  The most famous is the Xiaomi MiPad 16GB tablet (White, Pink, Blue or Yellow - depending on the color).  He is strikingly reminiscent of the iPad Mini.  Many probably don’t know that the company is already preparing for the presentation of other models - the 9-inch Xiaomi MiPad One, budget (for $ 100), Mi Note and Mi Note Pro phablets.  They will obviously be positioned as <span>competitors to the iPhone</span> 6. In addition to all of the above, there are also rumors about the development of a major device for games and the work of designers.  Xiaomi tablet (10 inches, most likely, is the optimal screen size for such a gadget) can allow you to enter the segment of professional devices, where now there are Apple's Air Pro and Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro.  What awaits a young, but ambitious <span>Chinese company</span> in such a competitive market, time will tell. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2>

    <p>  Even if we talk about only one model - MiPad, which is most widely represented on world markets (for example, they are officially sold in our country), then it has something to brag about.  In particular, the first is the most powerful NVIDIA Tegra K1 processor, which makes the tablet one of the most high-performance on the market.  Further, a high-quality display on the IPS-matrix with a resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels can be noted.  In addition, the developers equipped the model with a sufficiently capacious battery (6700 mAh), which is enough for a couple of days of active work.  There is also a powerful main camera (8 megapixels), a metal case, a 3G module and a host of other options that make the Xiaomi tablet a worthy competitor even for Apple. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Recommendations from those who already use the device, you can find a large number.  Given the characteristics of a <span>tablet of Chinese</span> origin, it is easy to guess that people praise its abilities, noting the performance and quality of the device at the highest level.  Indeed, many users are advised to purchase a Xiaomi tablet.  The reviews that online shops often do for their customers also show the authors' admiration for the gadget.  Many even call the MiPad an all-in-one solution. </p><h2>  Prospects </h2>

    <p>  Now it’s hard to say what the next devices from Xiaomi will be.  The tablet, the reviews of which we cited above, is really a great choice if you are looking for simplicity, quality work, reliability.  It can also be a good option for users who do not want to spend too much on buying a new device: the price of the MiPad is quite acceptable, even when compared with other middle-class tablets on the market. </p><p>  And in the future, the company may release something else new!  For example, if you are not satisfied with the screen size or the implementation of MiPad, you can wait until the release of a new model.  The next Xiaomi tablet will appear very soon, especially if you buy it not in our country, but via the network at foreign auctions or in catalogs.  Perhaps in some countries there are already alternative models of this manufacturer that will interest you.  The most important thing is that they are all inexpensive tablets, implemented at the highest level.  This made them popular. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The question of today's article is whether to buy a Xiaomi tablet.  Well, obviously, we answered him.  It was enough to simply give a number of characteristics, an overall assessment of the reviews about the model and the grandiose plans of the company, warmed up by overall success.  Yes, indeed, it is worth buying products of this brand.  If you do not know which Android device to choose, take Xiaomi.  This is an excellent value for money, proven by millions of purchased devices around the world.  Such a gadget will serve you for a long time faithfully, and at the same time you will not feel any discomfort due to a weak processor or poor-quality display.  Even on an outdated (by the standards of the company) MiPad, you can absolutely freely play the most bulky games in the best quality.  At the same time, a pleasant appearance, good ergonomics of the device and high-quality materials of the case will allow you to enjoy interacting with the device every day.  So why not get this tablet? </p>

    <p>  There are not many similar solutions on the market: either they cost the same, but offer much less functionality, or they are more expensive products from promoted brands.  The Chinese Xiaomi offers its golden mean - the way a manufacturer of technology should ideally position itself - minimum prices with maximum quality of work. </p>
