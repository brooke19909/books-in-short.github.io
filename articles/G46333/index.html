    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Marco Polo is a traveler who has made a huge contribution to the development of science and geography in general.  He easily learned the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof those countries where he stayed for a long time (Mongolia, China).  His travel notes later became a valuable source for mapping the region.  The emperor of the Celestial Empire trusted the entrepreneurial youth so much that he ordered to accompany the princess on her journey.  This is what became the greatest <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãvoyage</span> in the history of that time.  As many as fourteen ships took part in it, and it ended in success. </p><p>  The biography of Marco Polo tells not only about the successes of the brave traveler, there were black stripes in his life.  Having left Venice in 1271, he returns to his homeland only in 1295.  But then the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãon the water</span> fought with Genoa, and during one voyage, Marco goes to prison.  To pass the time, he begins to tell his cell mates about his adventures.  These stories were so interesting and vivid that even the guards listened to them.  And then many townspeople began to come to hear fantastic stories firsthand.  A native of Pisa, composer of <span>chivalric novels</span> Rusticiano, decided to write on paper these entertaining stories.  And so the famous ‚ÄúBook of Marco Polo‚Äù appeared, filled with the subtle remarks of an experienced traveler. </p><p>  The biography of Marco Polo still fascinates us.  After all, traveling then was not only very long and tiring, but also dangerous.  However, despite the difficulties, the brave Venetian notes the beauty of the landscapes, describes the customs of the countries, retells the traditions.  Having come out of conclusion, Marco continues to work on a book, which many of his contemporaries considered an ordinary invention.  However, the next generation of sailors and discoverers confirmed the words of the merchant.  And after reading this work, <span>Christopher Columbus</span> came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa sea voyage to Asia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marco Polo Traveler" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/290219.jpg" width="500"></div>
