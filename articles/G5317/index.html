The village is located 225 kilometers from the capital of the state of Cairo.  The city has more Mediterranean features than eastern ones.  It is very ancient and was founded in 332 BC.  To this day, an ancient, original layout has been preserved.  And these are long and clear lines of the main streets, which are located parallel to the sea coastal line.  The rest of the streets are not long and intersect at right angles. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="31.2000924" data-lng="29.91873869999995" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/8/2/5/2825.png"></div><p>  The area is famous for its magnificent and snow-white beaches (over 32 kilometers), mild winters and pristine nature. </p><h2>  Geography and climate </h2><p>  The country is partially located in northeast Africa and on part of the Sinai Peninsula (Asia).  About 96% of the state‚Äôs total area is covered by desert, and the remaining 4% is the Nile Valley. </p><p>  The climate in Alexandria is characterized as Mediterranean.  In winter, it rains moderately at an average temperature of +16 degrees.  Summer is hot, with temperatures from +30 degrees.  The hottest season is from July to September, during this period there is almost no rainfall. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The city of Alexandria in Egypt is an ancient settlement founded back in 332 BC.  Although numerous sources give conflicting evidence about the year the city was founded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to one version, it was Alexander the Great who drew the outlines of the village with millet grains, since he did not have chalk at hand.  Then birds flocked to this pattern, pecking almost all the grain, which was regarded as good news, that is, the city would flourish. </p><p>  After the construction of Alexandria for a long time was the capital of the Egyptian state.  It was here that all spiritual life was concentrated.  From this city began the Christianization of the whole country and the simultaneous persecution of the Orthodox. </p><p>  Already in the 7th century, the city came under the rule of the Arabs.  Since that time, a recession has begun.  The second heyday came in the 19th century.  Muhammad Ali was able to connect the city with the Nile, erecting the Mahmoudiya Canal.  Today, there are many monuments of Muslim and ancient culture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient Egypt" class="if uuid-2442103" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2442103.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Alexandria in Egypt is a huge number of monuments, and one of the most important is the Foros lighthouse.  Yes, nothing was left of this great building of the 3rd century BC.  However, in 2015, Egyptian authorities decided to erect a prototype lighthouse on a historic site.  The second attraction that has glorified the city throughout the world is the Alexandria Library.  The main fund of the library was lost in 273 AD, the rest was later plundered and burned.  In 2002, a new library structure was erected. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Alexandria Library </h2><p>  Today it is an ultramodern building erected in 2002.  Indeed, it is difficult to imagine the history of Alexandria in Egypt without a huge fund of manuscript books.  It was in this library that manuscripts of sages from around the world in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãand written in different periods of the development of civilization were preserved.  In ancient times, access to all works was absolutely free for both the rich and the poor.  All expenses for the maintenance of the library were borne by the state treasury.  Over the course of several centuries, the collection of manuscripts survived many fires, and as a result, almost all the works were destroyed. </p><p>  The modern library also contains a huge and priceless collection of manuscripts, and the walls are decorated with quotes from ancient sages.  Even the modern fund has more than 500 thousand manuscripts, access to which is open, and more than 7.5 million works in the repository. </p><p>  According to tourists, this is an entertainment for an amateur. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.egypttoursportal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexandria Library" class="if uuid-2442032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2442032.jpg"></div><h2>  Quarter of Anfushi </h2><p>  It is in this place that you can find out what Alexandria was like in Egypt.  This is the burial place of ancient rulers.  All tombs are made of rocks, on which ancient inscriptions are carved.  Those who are not superstitious people can not only look at the graves on the surface, but also go down the steep stairs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  According to travelers, you should still go down, where on the walls you can see unique ancient images of the gods.  And at the entrance to the main tomb there are two sphinxes guarding them.  According to some reports, it is here that one of the famous emperors is buried, but there is no scientific confirmation of this fact. </p><p>  The quarter itself is characterized by an interesting and specific infrastructure.  There are many restaurants and cafes where you can have a tasty meal and, most importantly, inexpensively. </p><h2>  Museum of Royal Jewels </h2><p>  If you came to Egypt, to Alexandria, then you should visit this museum.  It is located within the walls of an old mansion, which contains a magnificent collection of jewelry of the most ancient dynasties that have ever lived in this territory. </p><p>  The building itself is an interesting attraction, as it covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout four square kilometers.  Against the background of walls with a calm and even modest decoration, magnificent precious products shine.  It has collected more than 11 thousand exhibits, some of which are absolutely priceless. </p><p>  According to tourists' reviews, it is better to visit the museum in the morning, when the sun practically "plays" with every stone and it seems that all the jewels come to life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="edition.cnn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Royal Jewels" class="if uuid-2442065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2442065.jpg"></div><h2>  Catacombs of Kom al-Shawkaf </h2><p>  This is another attraction of the city of Alexandria in Egypt, which can not be visited.  Scientists agreed that underground Roman burials appeared around the 2nd century AD.  These are as many as three tiers of burials.  However, today the bottom two are flooded with water. </p><p>  To get down, you have to go down the spiral staircase to a depth of 30 meters.  Then long and narrow corridors begin, along the way there are halls with niches, where there are funeral urns.  Memorial feasts were once held in the first room to the left of the central rotunda. </p><p>  All chapels are decorated with inscriptions and drawings, and the entrance is ‚Äúprotected‚Äù by Anubis and the dragon, having the head of a dog or monkey, debates on this subject are still relevant.  Some people are buried in special wells, and some in the corridors, in the rocks. </p><p>  Feedback from experienced tourists suggests that it is impossible to understand the people of what culture were buried here, there are Christian, Greek and Roman styles.  Everything is very mixed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Catacombs of Kom al-Shawkaf" class="if uuid-2442055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2442055.jpg"></div><h2>  Al Mursi Mosque Abu Al Abbas </h2><p>  This mosque is considered the most charming not only in the city of Alexandria in Egypt, but also throughout the world.  It is located in the same quarter of Anfushi.  It was built in the XIV century.  Over the course of many centuries, the building was rebuilt many times, re-planned, therefore, it is quite difficult to say that it looks the same as at the time of construction.  The walls of the mosque are 23 meters high, and the largest minaret is 73 meters. </p><p>  According to traveler reviews, if you plan an independent visit, then in search of a mosque, focus on the Kite Bay fortress and Palm Alley. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prin-lume.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mosque of Alexandria" class="if uuid-2442080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2442080.jpg"></div><h2>  Kite Bay Fortress </h2><p>  Of course, once in Alexandria (Egypt), you should definitely visit this fortress.  This is a magnificent and magnificent representative of the architecture of the XV century.  A fortress was built during the reign of Sultan Qutbey.  But the most interesting thing is that the building was erected on the spot where the <span>Alexandrian lighthouse</span> once stood out <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="serviceinegypt.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kite Bay Fortress" class="if uuid-2442057" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2442057.jpg"></div><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  But rest in Alexandria (Egypt) is not only a visit and sightseeing.  This is another opportunity to soak up the warm sun on beaches that span more than 30 kilometers.  The city itself is the most modern and Europeanized in all of Egypt after Cairo. </p><p>  The most popular in this city is Sidi Abdel Rahman Beach.  Here on the coastline are villas and hotels, and the beach itself is in the bay, where the unusually warm and clean sea.  Rest is suitable for children, as the descent into the sea is gradual.  In addition, it is sand, delicate and beautiful, from which you can mold the Egyptian pyramids.  However, it should be remembered that this is also confirmed by the reviews of visitors that all the beaches in this part of the coast belong to hotels, so it‚Äôs just not possible to swim here. </p><h2>  Agami and Hannoville Beach </h2><p>  These two beaches are also among the most popular on the coast.  They are located about one mile from each other.  The infrastructure is well developed here.  Not far from Hannoville is another popular Sidi Kreir beach.  This is almost 3 km of pure sand, although the entrance here is paid.  According to the reviews of tourists, you should not save if you want to relax from compatriots and tourists from other countries.  Naturally, this is only a small fraction of the beaches where you can have a great time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youm7.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexandria Beach" class="if uuid-2442089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2442089.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to settle </h2><p>  There are many hotels in Alexandria in Egypt.  And for every taste and budget, from five-star to hostels. </p><p>  One of the most famous in the whole world is Sheraton Montazah, a hotel with well-deserved five stars.  This is a fifteen-story building on the shore of a city beach.  Even Russian tourists leave only positive reviews about this hotel.  All conditions are created here to relax.  A breakfast buffet is provided. </p><p>  But in Egypt, in Alexandria, there are places where a budget tourist can feel great. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The view from the hotel" class="if uuid-2442095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2442095.jpg"></div><p>  Transit Alexandria Hostel is very popular.  Here for little money you can get almost all the conditions that will allow you to relax.  There is a laundry room and a kitchen.  You can live with children.  It is important that smoking is not provided for places to stay.  The cost of accommodation is about $ 15 per day (about 900 rubles). </p><p>  Naturally, these are extremes.  In the city there are many places for settlement, located in the middle price segment, where breakfast is provided, and hotels are located on the coastline, in the city center and on the outskirts, where tourists with any wallet size will find refuge. </p><p>  Egypt and the city of Alexandria is a unique opportunity to combine a visit to ancient sights with excellent rest on the beautiful coast.  However, for a short period of time to understand the beauty and historical value of the city and country probably will not work, you will have to come here several times. </p>
