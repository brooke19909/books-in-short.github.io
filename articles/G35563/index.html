Located on the picturesque bank of the Irtysh, the village with surrounding land is included in the resort area of ​​local importance and is considered a healing corner.  The relict pine forest and birch forests located in Chernoluchinsky create a special microclimate that has a beneficial effect on the state of health. </p><h2>  Settlement history </h2><p>  The modern resort "Omsk - Chernoluchye" is relatively young and was founded only in the 1950s.  The village got its name from a nearby village with the same name ( <em>currently it is part of the Novotroitsky rural settlement, the population is 249 people</em> ), founded back in 1670. </p><p>  The name of the village is associated with the area where it is located.  The steep bend of the Irtysh River ( <em>bend</em> ) was called by the locals the "Black Bow".  Thus, the village at the bend received an adapted name. </p>

    <p>  The usual suburban village of Chernuchuchi did not work.  Beautiful nature and a healing microclimate became the reason for the appearance of rest houses, children's and adult health camps in the district, and in 1962 the area received the status of a local resort and appropriate protection (a ban on deforestation, hunting, and the placement of industrial enterprises). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Infrastructure and Features </h2><p>  Currently, Chernoluchinsky is the administrative center of the village of the same name, territorially included in the Omsk municipal district.  As of January 2017, the area of ​​the village is 680 hectares and 1,510 people are constantly living within its borders.  64% of residents are of working age, but only 34% are economically active (work or self-employed). </p><p>  Infrastructure facilities operate in the village to meet the needs of the local population.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  Middle School of General education. </li><li>  Children's sports school. </li><li>  Kindergarten. </li><li>  The feldsher-midwife station. </li></ul><p>  Also in Chernoluchinsk there are 4 cafes, 2 bars, 10 saunas (baths), 2 pharmacies and more than 10 retail stores.  And this is without taking into account the services and goods that provide <span>the recreation center "Chernuchuchie</span> - Omsk". </p><h2>  Features of transport communication </h2><p>  The status of the <span>recreational zone</span> entails not only the environmental protection of the Omsk-Chernoluchye resort, but also a special road regime applicable to resort areas from June 1 to August 31.  During a massive summer vacation, the movement of cars on the Omsk-Krasnoyarka road (regional road) and the entrance to the village are limited.  In fact, a special access control regime begins to operate in relation to the resort at this time, which is monitored by representatives of the Siberian Cossack Military Society (since 2015). </p><p>  The ban on entry is associated with the decision of the Administration of the <span>Omsk region</span> to limit the number of vehicles in the recreation area, so as not to worsen the environmental, transport situation and avoid injuries on the roads.  The latter is especially relevant, because every year Chernoluchinsky becomes a place of mass children's leisure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To get to the resort area by private car, its owner needs to get a special pass.  The document must be obtained from the village administration or the Administration of the Omsk region.  Black-registered car owners receive passes immediately.  Other people need to wait for approval - 5-6 working days. </p><p>  The restriction of entry does not apply to emergency vehicles, cars that deliver medicines to the settlement, food products, as well as passenger buses. </p><p>  Quite a popular question is how to get to Omsk and Chernuchuchy.  Motorists can get to the resort, following the Krasnoyarsk tract.  The left branch subsequently bifurcates into roads leading to Chernoluchinsky and Krasnoyarka. </p>

    <p>  Arriving in forest recreation is also possible by public transport.  From Omsk, Chernoluchye is located 48 km to the north-west.  Regular buses of Omskoblavtotrans JSC go daily with an interval of 2-3 hours along the routes Omsk - Chernoluchye or Omsk - <span>Russian Forest Sanatorium.</span>  In the village, the bus stop is the station located at 7, Torgovaya Street, Building A. </p><h2>  Places of rest: list and review of prices </h2><p>  In the resort area of ​​the village of Chernoluchinsky, there are 15 active recreation centers and 2 more similar institutions at the beginning of 2017 are under construction.  They are located both within the settlement and beyond its borders, have a different territory and the volume of services provided. </p>
