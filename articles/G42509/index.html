    <p>  The Khatsun memorial complex (Bryansk region) is located on the territory of the modern Verkhopolsky rural settlement belonging to the Karachaevsky district of the <span>Bryansk region.</span>  An unremarkable, gradually dying place, of which there are thousands throughout Russia.  However, the real story is happening not only in capitals and megacities, but also in such small settlements. </p><p>  The name itself - "Hatsun" - has been known since the mid-nineteenth century.  This term at that time meant a small forest tract with a gatehouse located in it.  In the 20s of the last century, with the establishment of Soviet power, a small village arose on the site of the tract, the inhabitants of which were mainly engaged in logging. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Currently, only eight people live here, almost all of them are very <span>elderly.</span>  The Khatsun memorial complex for this settlement became an opportunity to preserve not only itself, but also the memory of those terrible events that unfolded here in October 1941. </p><h2>  Black October 1941 ... </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hatsun memorial complex Bryansk region" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/850529.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><p>  ‚ÄúKhatsun‚Äù is a <span>memorial complex, the</span> photo of which can be found in almost any album dedicated to the Great Patriotic War.  Its creation is associated with the events that occurred in this settlement on October 25, 1941. </p><p>  In the fall of the 41st, the German Wehrmacht, straining all its forces, was eager for Moscow.  One of the directions of their offensive passed through Bryansk, around which fierce battles unfolded in September-October.  The city was continuously subjected to powerful bombing, which is why a significant part of its inhabitants was forced to relocate to the nearest villages.  One of such villages was Hatsun. </p><p>  On October 24, a small group of Red Army soldiers, who made their way to their surroundings, entered the battle with three Germans escorting prisoners of war.  Two escorts were killed, but the third, despite being injured, managed to escape.  As the surviving residents of Hatsuni later recalled, everyone understood that a punitive operation was inevitable, so in the evening almost everyone left the village.  On the morning of October 25, most of them returned to the village to visit the cattle and carry away the necessary things.  Subsequently, the memorial complex ‚ÄúHatsun‚Äù became their monument. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The atrocities that cannot be forgotten </h2>

    <p>  A German punitive detachment surrounded Hatsun at dawn on October 25, 1941.  All who wished to enter calmly passed, but no one could leave.  The first victim was six-year-old Nina Kondrashova, who was stabbed with a bayonet knife right in her bed.  Her neighbor Nina Yashina was nailed to the gates of her house after she had found some thing that had previously belonged to the Red Army. </p><p>  But the Germans were not going to limit themselves to individual terror.  With the help of stocks and bayonets, all the inhabitants, among whom were not only adults, but also children who did not understand anything, were gathered in one place.  At first, machine-gun shots rang out, after which machine guns started to work.  318 people were killed, and all buildings, including sheds and a well, were burned.  For edification, residents of neighboring villages were not allowed to bury the decomposing bodies; they lay on the streets for two weeks.  Only seven people managed to survive (in many ways completely by accident). </p><h2>  Memory saving </h2>

    <p>  Khatsun is far from the only village in the Bryansk region that such a terrible fate awaited.  In total, during the occupation in this region, more than nine hundred rural settlements were destroyed, thousands of residents were executed or deported to Germany.  All over the world they know the fate of the Belarusian Khatyn, but many Russian villages were waiting for an equally terrible fate. </p><p>  Talk about the need to perpetuate the memory of those executed in Hatsuni began almost immediately after the liberation of the Bryansk region from Nazi invaders.  However, the real realization of this idea began only in 1977.  The Khatsun memorial complex was planned as a whole series of structures that were supposed, on the one hand, to show respect for the dead, and on the other, to become an educational tool for future generations. </p><p>  Not all ideas were fully implemented, therefore, until the end of the 2000s, Hatsun was considered by many as not a very good copy of Khatyn, especially since their names are very similar.  Much has changed since the coming to power of V. Putin. </p><h2>  Hatsun Memorial: Rebirth </h2>

    <p>  Restoration work in Hatsuni began in 2009.  At the same time, not only old facilities were reconstructed, but a whole series of new ones were created.  As a result, the complex now includes a small operating chapel, a museum with an exposition dedicated not only to the memorable events of October 25, 1941, but also to other Nazi atrocities in occupied land, a <span>mass grave</span> with the remains of the deceased inhabitants. </p><p>  A particularly painful feeling for all guests is caused by visiting the memory wall, designed by the <span>famous sculptor</span> A. Romashevsky, and inspecting 28 steles with <span>plaques</span> placed on them <span>.</span>  The central place in the complex is occupied by an obelisk dedicated to Soviet soldiers - participants of the most bloody in the history of the war. </p><p>  At the opening of the memorial complex was attended by a very impressive delegation, which included representatives of Russia, Germany, Belarus, Ukraine and some other countries.  The Russian delegation was led by Vladimir Putin, which was an excellent advertisement for this place.  If before many did not know that there is a memorial complex called ‚ÄúHatsun‚Äù and how to get to it, no one could say, now there is simply no end to those who want to visit the complex. </p><h2>  Event in honor of the 70th anniversary of Victory </h2>

    <p>  After the reconstruction, ‚ÄúKhatsun‚Äù became one of the most important objects participating in various commemorative events.  Usually they are dedicated to Victory Day and Memorial Day on October 25th.  So, in preparation for the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Great Victory, another event was held at the Hatsun memorial complex.  04/18/15, the governor of the Bryansk region A. Bogomaz opened a solemn meeting held as part of the action "Immortal memory of generations." </p><p>  During this event, which was attended by almost all the leaders of the region and the district, medals were awarded to the most worthy residents of the Karachayevsky district.  The meeting ended with the laying of flowers and a festive concert. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúKhatsun‚Äù (memorial complex): how to get from Bryansk </h2><p>  The ever-increasing popularity of the memorial site led to the fact that special bus tours from Bryansk were organized.  At the same time, you can also get here on your own: it is enough to come from Moscow by train to Bryansk, and then by bus to Verkhopolsky settlement.  Buses run almost every day from morning to evening. </p>
