    <p>  Against the background of currency fluctuations, many are interested in the question: ‚ÄúWhat are the interest on deposits in foreign currency?  Most banks will be pleased to offer customers to open an account in particular currency.  The maximum percentage on foreign currency deposits does not exceed 3% per annum.  It should be noted that Sberbank, unlike the others, does not offer interest calculation.  Income is calculated from the exchange rate.  It is important to consider that the price of selling foreign currency and buying money by a bank is significantly different.  In this connection, it is better to open an account for a long period.  The maximum percentage on deposits can be obtained by opening a multicurrency account.  Money in this case will not lose in value.  That is, there is no dependence on the exchange rate. </p><h2>  Ruble deposits </h2><p>  Perhaps the most common type of contribution.  Every citizen of Russia in one way or another came across them.  The lowest deposit rate on call.  Note that it is at this rate that income will be calculated in case of early closure of the remaining types of accounts. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  1. Sberbank is ready to accept public funds not only in rubles.  Currency and metal accounts are provided.  Moreover, the range of foreign currency deposits is very wide.  The bank covers all segments of the population, allowing everyone to choose a deposit according to their requests.  Although the stakes are not so high, there is the possibility of choosing the most optimal account option. </p><p>  2. VTB24 does not lag behind Sberbank.  The conditions for concluding a contract are approximately the same.  However, the rates on foreign currency accounts are higher.  Each client will find a suitable type of deposit. </p><p>  3. Gazprombank does not have such a wide selection of products.  There are only 6 types of deposits, but interest rates on them are slightly higher than those of the above institutions.  The maximum percentage on deposits is 7. </p><p>  4. The Agricultural Bank has more stringent conditions for opening an account.  Profit is accrued only at the end of the contract, there is no way to replenish.  Although the rates are much higher compared to other state-owned banks.  They can reach 10.2%. </p><p>  5. The Bank of Moscow does not abound in a variety of deposits, but it boasts a flexible approach to customers.  It is worth noting that opening an account here is more profitable for those who have a large amount of money. </p><p>  6. ‚ÄúRussian Standard‚Äù, thanks to its proposals, does not lag behind Sberbank and VTB24.  The investor will find a deposit here that will satisfy his requirements.  The maximum percentage on deposits is 10-12.  However, there is no capitalization, and the conditions are more stringent for the client. </p><p>  7. ‚ÄúHome Credit‚Äù was also able to take its place in the ranking of banks that offer high yield deposits.  The term for concluding the contract is at least one year.  There is the possibility of capitalization, partial withdrawal and replenishment.  The bank is ideal for most people.  The rate can reach 12 percent per annum. </p><h2>  How to choose a deposit </h2>

    <p>  When choosing a deposit, you must carefully study all the conditions for calculating income.  For example, of the two accounts with the same terms and rates, the most advantageous is the one where monthly capitalization is provided.  Capitalization is the calculation of interest not only on the initial contribution amount.  In this case, income is accrued on previously paid interest and additionally paid funds.  It is very beneficial for all customers. </p><p>  For the convenience of customers, many banks put up all offers on sites where you can not only familiarize yourself with the conditions, but also roughly calculate the yield of the deposit.  Deposits with the possibility of replenishment are suitable for those who decide to open an account for a short time.  It is also desirable that there is a capitalization of interest.  The more often capitalization occurs, the more profitable the client.  If the choice is made, then you should immediately contact the institution, as the bank, at its discretion, may make changes to the conditions.  However, this does not apply to the concluded contract. </p><p>  To date, the classic conditions of the deposit are the most advantageous.  Such conditions include a large rate without the possibility of replenishment and withdrawal of funds.  In this case, the client needs to forget about the existence of savings for a predetermined period. </p><p>  Good conditions for opening an account can be obtained during seasonal promotions, which in recent years are more and more.  These promotions are held before the holidays.  Such contributions are in most cases short-term.  The total term of the contract does not exceed three years. </p><h2>  The risks </h2><p>  A banking institution is affected by the economy as a whole.  And with the latest developments in this area, many investors are worried.  The Central Bank has begun a mass check of all organizations for accreditation at the Deposit Insurance Agency.  If the bank does not have such a document, then soon the Central Bank will revoke the license.  The funds that were stored in the bank will still be returned to the owners, but this will take some time. </p><p>  To avoid this, you should carefully study all the documents of the bank or consult with a lawyer.  In addition, do not give in to the first impulse to open an account at a high percentage.  Important: stable and reliable banks do not offer prohibitive interest on deposits. </p>
