What are the advantages and disadvantages of collaboration?  What is Svyaz-Bank in general?  All this will be described later.  In fact, to understand all of these issues is not as difficult as it seems.  Especially if you carefully study the reviews left about the organization.  Only they will be able to talk about facts about which the company will never tell either visitors or applicants. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Svyaz-Bank is a financial organization.  It offers the population a variety of banking services.  Already by one name it is clear that Svyaz-Bank is the most ordinary bank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="communication bank reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1548101.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is universal.  The organization provides a complete list of banking services.  And it pleases the population.  <span>Svyaz-Bank receives</span> positive <span>reviews</span> from visitors for its versatility.  Need a <span>loan?</span>  <span>Mortgage?</span>  Need to open a <span>deposit?</span>  <span>Svyaz-Bank</span> will come to the rescue! </p><p>  But is it worth contacting this organization?  What do customers and employees think about it?  How fair is the firm?  Are these scammers? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54"></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Scale </h2><p>  Svyaz-Bank receives positive reviews for its size.  The fact is that the company has been operating for a long time.  Company branches are available in many cities of the country. </p><p>  The fame and size of a financial institution inspire confidence in customers and job seekers.  One gets the impression that Svyaz-Bank is not a fraudster.  This is the conclusion that many people initially came to know about the organization.  But is it really so? </p><h2>  License </h2><p>  It‚Äôs hard to answer.  Especially taking into account the fact that some customers and employees indicate that they are going to take away the license from Svyaz-Bank.  Some opinions generally emphasize that the process has already begun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="communication bank license revocation" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1548100.jpg"></div>
      <br>

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Believe in such statements is not worth it.  Today, Svyaz-Bank is fully operational.  No revocation of licenses.  Moreover, it is not planned.  Therefore, the reliability of opinions indicating the revocation of a license from a financial institution is in great doubt. </p><h2>  Deposits </h2><p>  Now a little about how customers relate to certain services from Svyaz-Bank.  The most common contributions.  A financial company, according to some reviews, offers favorable conditions for cooperation.  You can always pick up the contribution that is most suitable for certain services. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk"></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  True, <span>Svyaz-Bank</span> receives mixed <span>reviews</span> of deposits.  Some proposals are doubtful, some conditions can be replaced by similar ones, but with other banks.  Workers sometimes do not know the details of opening and servicing open deposits.  All this repels. </p><p>  But in general, there are no significant complaints.  All conditions prescribed in the contract are fully respected.  The only thing some clients complain about is that when opening a deposit, the terms of service are not those that, for example, were written on the billboard.  Therefore, in order not to raise unnecessary questions and claims, it is recommended to carefully study the contract when opening a deposit.  There are written all the details of cooperation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="communication bank employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1548099.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Loans </h2><p>  What else do they say about a company called Svyaz-Bank?  Car loan reviews are mixed.  In the same way as regular loans.  What do customers most often talk about? </p><p>  Many emphasize that the term for approving an application from Svyaz-Bank is short.  And it pleases.  There is ordinary paperwork.  She does not surprise anyone.  Nevertheless, it is recommended that you carefully study the terms of the loan.  Some clients say that after signing the contract and issuing a loan, it turns out that the interest rate is higher than promised.  For example, instead of 19% - 45% (according to some reviews). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj"></sjdiv></div><p>  Accordingly, some accuse the organization of fraud.  Sometimes documents are checked for a long time, and then denied loans for unknown reasons.  Similar situations occur, although not too often. </p><p>  But at the same time, Svyaz-Bank also receives positive reviews for loans.  If you carefully study all the conditions of cooperation, then there will be no thoughts about any fraud.  A financial company does not deceive its visitors.  Just some features of lending and other services are not disclosed aloud.  You can read about them in the contract. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="communication bank customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1548102.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Mortgage </h2><p>  What kind of company does a <span>mortgage</span> receive from a company called <span>Svyaz-Bank</span> ?  Mortgage lending is another popular service that many consumers use.  What are the pros and cons? </p><p>  Customers say that the mortgage in the bank really takes place.  It is approved not too long, but not fast either.  Some employees do not understand documents at all before sending a request to Moscow, to the head office.  This makes people in limbo. </p><p>  In some situations, it is even noted that the decision to issue a mortgage at the last moment is canceled.  Svyaz-Bank employees say that approval has occurred, you can look for an apartment for purchase.  People find real estate, and then a mortgage refusal comes from Moscow.  Even the reasons do not explain. </p><p>  Sometimes there are reviews regarding the mortgage with statements such as ‚Äúpricked with a mortgage‚Äù, ‚Äúdeceivers‚Äù and so on.  But the organization has positive aspects.  For example, you can quickly apply for a mortgage online.  And some clients say that they did not have problems with mortgage lending at Svyaz-Bank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bond bank mortgage reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1548105.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About service in general </h2><p>  What do customers generally say about the company under study?  How good is this organization?  "Svyaz-Bank" customer reviews earn mixed.  Quite often, claims are expressed for the work of technical support and employees in offices.  It takes a lot of time to resolve contentious or problematic issues.  This is the main complaint. </p><p>  The remaining opinions are standard - someone complains about high interest rates on loans and mortgages, some claim that Svyaz-Bank is a bona fide financial company.  The corporation also has attentive employees who, before sending an application, for example, to obtain a loan, will double-check documents several times.  It is also possible that visitors will have to communicate with rude and unfriendly, inexperienced staff.  Such people also meet. </p><p>  Only there is no evidence of either negative reviews or positive ones.  One can only guess how Svyaz-Bank is a good and conscientious organization.  What do subordinates themselves say about the company as an employer? </p><h2>  As an employer </h2><p>  Opinions are also divided here.  It is impossible to say with confidence that Svyaz-Bank receives only positive feedback from employees.  Most often, negative opinions are left.  However, it is now difficult to find a company in which employees have no complaints about the bosses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="communication bank deposit reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1548103.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The negative speaks out for a busy work schedule, lack of career growth, as well as for constant refining, which do not pay at all.  Low salaries and debts of the employer to subordinates also take place. </p><p>  Of the positive aspects of Svyaz-Bank, they note: fully official employment, work in comfortable conditions, social guarantees, work experience in the banking sector, work team. </p><p>  Punishment, if you believe what Svyaz-Bank receives reviews, is also available in the company.  These are fines.  They are superimposed by the leaders for the slightest mistake.  And for the entire shift.  Therefore, making money in a corporation is very problematic.  It is not necessary to be guilty of something, just relate to the shift in which the problems occurred. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="communication bank car loan reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1548104.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Svyaz-Bank is not the best place to find a job.  It is suitable for stress-resistant people who do not plan to move up the career ladder.  A stable small income in the organization can be received.  But no more than that.  It should also be noted that in some cities, Svyaz-Bank receives extremely negative feedback from subordinates.  And so the bank is on the black list of employers. </p>
