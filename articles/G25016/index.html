Many of them symbolize various aspects of life, are symbols of art, love, trade, productivity and war. </p><p>  Currently, there were more than 50 <span>ancient Greek gods,</span> but not all of them went down in history, like the great Zeus, Aphrodite, Hades and other divine inhabitants of Olympus.  Each god, according to myths and legends, defended the Earth from various catastrophes and monsters. </p><p>  The main Greek gods: </p><p>  Zeus is the most powerful and great Greek god, the son of Rhea and Kronos.  Kronos, according to legend, did not leave his children alive, fearing that they would start a war against him, and devoured them, but the mother of Zeus Ray was able to save Zeus and hid him.  When Zeus grew up, he found strength in himself and rebelled against Kronos, forcing him to return his brothers.  Together they entered the battle with Kronos and the Titans for supremacy over the whole world.  After Kronos was overthrown, the brothers divided their possessions, so Zeus left heaven for himself, Poseidon the sea, and Hades became the ruler of the underworld. </p><p>  Poseidon is the brother of the great Zeus, he is equally powerful, although he is subordinate to his brother.  Its symbol is the famous trident.  Poseidon is the lord of the seas, but at the same time he is often referred to the cult of the bull or horse, it is also believed that he is the patron of fishing. </p><p>  Hera - she is both the sister and wife of Zeus.  All gods honored Hera, despite her jealousy, according to myths, Zeus was very loving, so Hera pursued her rivals and severely punished.  She is considered the goddess of women and the goddess of a clear sky over her head.  The most famous of her children are Hephaestus and Ares. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Artemis is the goddess of the hunt.  Artemis is the daughter of Zeus and the goddess Summer.  She is considered the patroness of livestock and wildlife.  She is also called the <span>goddess of fertility.</span>  According to legend, it was believed that she blesses the wedding, the birth of children and marriage. </p><p>  Aphrodite is the goddess of love and beauty.  It was created from the foam of <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãwaves.</span>  And according to the narratives of "Illada", she was the daughter of Zeus and Dione.  The children of Aphrodite were Harmony and Eros. </p><p>  Apollo is the sun god in Greece.  He was the <span>son of Zeus</span> and Summer.  He was considered the god of harmony, art, spiritual activity, music and singing.  Very often Apollo was portrayed with a lyre in his hands, which he received from Hermes. </p><p>  Ares is the Greek god of war.  He is considered one of the main <span>Olympic gods.</span>  Son of Zeus and Hera.  Usually he was portrayed with a spear in his hands.  Ares was a handsome and courageous god, but at the same time very mean and cruel. </p><p>  Hermes - was the patron saint of all travelers and the messenger of the gods.  He was the son of Zeus and the mountain nymph - Maya.  Hermes from an early age was distinguished by cunning and extraordinary dexterity, and some even considered him the patron of cheating. </p><p>  Dionysus was the god of vegetation and winemaking.  He was the son of the famous Zeus and the daughter of the Theban king Semela.  Dionysus always brought people joy and strength.  He traveled to different countries and cities, and he was always accompanied by a crowd of singing and dancing satyrs and maenads. </p><p>  Prometheus - was the nephew of Zeus and the son of a titan Iapetus.  He is considered the patron saint of fire, crafts.  He taught people how to cook, make fire.  After that, people were no longer a herd, they lived in houses, were engaged in crafts.  Many Greek gods were enraged by this, as soon as they understood who did it, Kronid ordered to find Prometheus and to tie him to the high mountain of Ararat, where according to legend, the thief sent every day pecked the liver of the great god. </p><p>  These are not all Greek gods, but the most striking of them, the memory of which is still alive today.  In addition, ancient Greek mythology is reflected in many Hollywood films that amaze with their beautiful special effects and the authenticity of what is happening. </p>
