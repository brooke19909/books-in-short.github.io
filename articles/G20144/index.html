This technique is more and more common.  Bank plastic allows you not to take a trifle and not to think about getting change - a certain amount of funds for services and purchases is simply debited from the account.  Very comfortably.  And so today we will find out how to find out the balance on the card of Sberbank.  What are the scenarios in practice?  How to act in a particular case?  The answers to all this and not only will be necessarily discovered below.  With proper preparation, the processes will not cause any problems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="finansytut.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM balance check" class="if uuid-2371698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2371698.jpg"></div><h2>  Ways to solve the problem </h2><p>  How to find out the balance on a Sberbank card?  There are many ways to deal with this kind of task.  And customers decide how to act. </p><p>  Here are some well-known techniques for checking plastic balance: </p><ul><li>  making a purchase; </li><li>  sending SMS request; </li><li>  USSD command processing; </li><li>  viewing information in an ATM / terminal; </li><li>  study of data in online banking. </li></ul><p>  In reality, everything is much simpler than it seems.  But for some options you have to pre-prepare.  About all this and not only we will tell further. </p><h2>  Turning on the Mobile Bank </h2><p>  Everyone can find out the balance of a Sberbank card via SMS.  But first, he will have to connect an option called "Mobile Bank".  With its help, you can turn the phone into a convenient organizer to control your bank account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="finansytut.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Check balance via SMS" class="if uuid-2371701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2371701.jpg"></div><p>  At the moment, the connection of the service is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Through an ATM.  It is enough to find the appropriate service in ATM from Sberbank, and then follow the instructions on the screen. </li><li>  By phone call.  The client needs to call 8 800 55 55 50 and wait for the operator to respond.  After that, it is required to announce your intentions and name the requested data. </li><li>  Online.  For this reception, the Sberbank Online service is used.  After authorization in the system, the line "Mobile Bank" will be in the "Personal Account" of the user.  If you click it and select "Enable", and then follow the prompts, you can activate the option in a few minutes. </li><li>  By contacting any branch of Sberbank.  You need to have a passport and a phone with you.  A citizen writes an application for connection and waits for a notification about the completion of the procedure. </li></ol><p>  Perhaps this is all.  Now you can easily find out the balance of the Sberbank card via SMS. </p><h2>  SMS requests and invoice </h2><p>  Let's start with this option.  It does not require any special knowledge and skills.  A citizen just needs to write a message and send it to number 900. After the actions have been taken, a letter will be sent in response with the amount of money on the plastic attached to the number. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  SMS should look like this: balance.  Just one word that will help you easily cope with the corresponding task. </p><p>  Important: instead of the specified phrase, you can use the commands - 01, balans, ostatok, balance. </p><h2>  Messages and several cards </h2><p>  But what if several cards are tied to one number?  Is there any way to find out the balance of a Sberbank card? </p><p>  Yes.  SMS requests are still relevant.  The main thing is to activate Mobile Bank service in advance.  And know how to act in a particular case. </p><p>  Want to know the balance of a Sberbank card by phone?  SMS requests will help to cope with the implementation of ideas.  It is necessary, as in the previous case, to form a message in the established form, and then send it to 900. </p><p>  If a pair of plastics is attached to the number, you will need to write an SMS of the type: code_word last_4_digits_cards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sbank-gid.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Requests" class="if uuid-2371696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2371696.jpg"></div><p>  Important: code words are ‚Äúbalance‚Äù and so on.  You can use any word from the previously proposed instructions. </p><h2>  USSD help requests </h2><p>  But this is only the beginning.  There is another scenario.  It helps to answer the question of how to find out the balance on a Sberbank card without messages.  But mobile banking for the start will still have to be connected. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In order to see the balance on the map, you need: </p><ol><li>  Enter the phone in dialing mode. </li><li>  Print request * 900 * 01 #. </li><li>  ‚ÄúRing‚Äù command. </li></ol><p>  All that remains now is to wait for a response message.  Within a few seconds, the subscriber will receive a letter in which the remainder of the card and the number of the corresponding plastic will be written. </p><h2>  USSD and several cards </h2><p>  By analogy with SMS requests, we consider a method of obtaining data on one of several cards attached to a mobile device.  This is a pretty simple task.  And it is not much different from the previously proposed team. </p><p>  How to find out the balance of a Sberbank card from a phone?  To do this, dial * 900 * 01 * YYYY # on the mobile device, where YYYY is the last 4 digits of a particular plastic.  It remains to click on the "Call Subscriber" button and wait.  Usually the answer comes in a few seconds.  And only occasionally have to expect balance sheet data for a couple of minutes. </p><h2>  Application and card data </h2><p>  Particularly advanced customers can make transactions with cards through a special application - "Mobile Bank".  It works only after connecting the corresponding service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="finansweb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Mobile Banking" class="if uuid-2371703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2371703.jpg"></div><p>  Balance check provides: </p><ol><li>  Login to the application.  It will have to be initialized in advance on the mobile device. </li><li>  Selecting the "Card operations" block. </li><li>  Click on the line "Check balance" / "Request balance." </li><li>  Confirmation of the procedure. </li></ol><p>  It is done.  The result will be familiar - a message from mobile banking with data on the account of a particular card will come to the phone.  Quick, easy and convenient! </p><h2>  Connection to Sberbank Online </h2><p>  How to find out the balance of a Sberbank card via phone?  We dealt with this issue.  Is it possible to act differently?  It has already been said that you can use Internet banking for this idea.  But first you have to connect it. </p><p>  It is allowed to do this: </p><ol><li>  Personally at an ATM or terminal.  You will have to act as in the case of mobile banking - the client finds the appropriate command in the ATM menu, and then follows the instructions on the display.  At the ATM you can request one-time data to enter Sberbank Online. </li><li>  By contacting the staff of the Sberbank branch.  In this case, you need to transfer a mobile phone and bank plastic for a while.  Sberbank office employees will quickly connect the option. </li><li>  Through the Internet.  This technique is almost never used in practice.  A citizen needs to go to the main page of the Sberbank Online service and click on the "Register" button.  By filling out the form of the established sample and confirming the procedure, a person will easily acquire mobile banking. </li><li>  By submitting an application for connection to the office of Sberbank.  You must have a passport, card and mobile phone with you.  A request form will be issued locally. </li></ol><p>  These are all possible methods of solving the posed problem.  But how to find out the balance on a <span>Sberbank card</span> via the Internet? </p><div class="photo" data-original="debetcardsinfo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Request Confirmation" class="if uuid-2371699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2371699.jpg"></div><h2>  Using Internet Banking </h2><p>  To do this, use the Sberbank Online service.  With its help, each client can manage finances on the cards.  For example, monitor transactions or make payments.  Balance check also takes place. </p><p>  Instructions for checking the balance on bank plastic will look like this: </p><ol><li>  Log in to Sberbank Online. </li><li>  Log in to the service and enter the verification code.  He will come on a cell phone. </li><li>  View information on the screen. </li></ol><p>  Usually, by default, the main banking page opens, on which all the person‚Äôs cards and their balances are displayed.  If there is no information, you can see it in the "My Account" section. </p><h2>  Make payment </h2><p>  How to find out the balance of a Sberbank card via SMS?  900 is the number that you will have to work with when implementing ideas.  It is from him that SMS with data on the balance of funds comes. </p><p>  Some people prefer a different approach to solving the problem.  When connected to mobile banking, a person receives alerts about operations with an account.  Therefore, you can simply pay with a card for a purchase or service.  After that, a notification will be sent to the device with the size of the amount debited for the transaction and with the balance of funds.  This is one of the easiest options. </p><h2>  Refill </h2><p>  Similarly, customers can top up a plastic account.  For example, through an ATM.  It is enough to select the section "Card Transactions" - "Deposit" in the appropriate machine.  Next, banknotes are inserted into the ATM and the procedure is confirmed.  In a couple of minutes, the money will be transferred to plastic.  As a result, an SMS will be sent to the citizen with information about the transaction and with the remainder of the money in the account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="100i1kredit.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank ATM - menu" class="if uuid-2371700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2371700.jpg"></div><h2>  Checking at an ATM </h2><p>  And there is another alignment.  How to find out the balance on a Sberbank card?  For example, a person can use payment terminals from Sberbank or their ATMs.  There is a corresponding function. </p><p>  It is proposed to act as follows: </p><ol><li>  Insert a bank card in the selected machine and start working with it. </li><li>  In the main menu, click on "Operations with the card." </li><li>  Click on "Check / request balance". </li><li>  Indicate how information is displayed.  For example, "Display."  You can print the data on the check. </li><li>  Press the control responsible for confirming the operation. </li></ol><p>  Just a few minutes - and the job is done.
