The canonization of the chieftain Peter Kalnyshevsky</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Petr Kalnyshevsky <strong>is the</strong> famous chieftain of the Zaporizhzhya Sich, who was the last in the history of the Cossack republic to hold this high position.  For the exploits accomplished during his lifetime, this man, after the Holy Synod of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church considered the report of the Synodal Commission for the Canonization of Saints, was canonized.  Righteous Peter Kalnyshevsky is commemorated on November 13 in a new style, on the day of his death.  How did this man live, and what miracles performed by him during his life, served to the fact that he was canonized?  We will try to give the answer to this question in the article. </p><h2>  The beginning of life </h2><p>  Kalnyshevsky Petr Ivanovich was a native of the village of Pustovoitovka, which is located in the <span>Sumy region</span> (Ukraine).  The year of his birth is 1691. Unfortunately, the history of his childhood and youth is practically not preserved.  The facts about his early years are confirmed only by the recollections of eyewitnesses and stories that people passed on by word of mouth. </p><p>  It is only known that he was born in the family of a Cossack foreman.  Soon, his mother was widowed, and Peter at the age of 8 came to the <span>Zaporizhzhya Sich.</span>  Whether this is true or legend is not reliably known.  How exactly he got into the shelter of the Cossacks is also not known. </p><p>  In Zaporozhye, Petr Kalnyshevsky received his first education, it was a school at the church.  It should be noted that at that time, education had a huge role in the future career of any Cossack.  In Zaporozhye, several schools were opened at the churches, where classes were held by representatives of the clergy. </p><p>  It is certain that he began his military career as a simple squire.  Before becoming a ataman, he was also a field colonel from 1752 to 1761, and a military esaul in 1754, and a military judge from 1763 to 1765. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Kalnyshevsky was a very talented commander, a fearless warrior, a cunning politician;  he knew and was able to.  Therefore, it is not surprising that he was soon awarded a new military rank - Lieutenant General. </p><p>  Kalnyshevsky was well known at the Court.  More than once he was the head of the Cossack embassies both to Peter I and to Catherine II. </p><p>  1762 was a turning point in his fate - Kalnyshevsky was chosen as the ataman of the cat. </p><h2>  First atamanism </h2><p>  Peter Kalnyshevsky, whose biography is rich in events of a historical scale, was elected ataman more than once.  His first elective position was called so: "Koshey ataman - helmsman of the whole army."  For this position, the Cossacks chose a head among the most brave and wise experience elders. </p>

    <p>  For the first time, Kalnyshevsky stayed ataman quite a bit.  His authority among the Cossacks was very great.  Catherine II dismissed him from this post as objectionable to the government. </p><h2>  Second Atamanism </h2><p>  Pyotr Kalnyshevsky was so respected in the Cossack army that the Cossacks were not even afraid to break the decree of the tsarina.  Contrary to the will of Catherine II, the Cossack foreman again chose him as her ataman.  It happened in 1764. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should be noted that, as an ataman, Kalnyshevsky actively developed cattle breeding and agriculture in Zaporozhye.  He wanted to increase the number of people in this area and for this he helped peasants who fled from their masters.  With his support and participation, the Cossacks very often raided the Tatars, freeing their fellow countrymen from captivity.  Subsequently, the chieftain allocated land for them in Zaporozhye. </p><p>  Thanks Kalnyshevsky soon Zaporizhzhya steppe acquired many new villages.  Petr Kalnyshevsky himself became one of the richest people in Ukraine.  He was the owner of many villages and farms, fields and pastures, had a herd of thousands of cattle. </p><p>  Kalnyshevsky went down in history as a well-known philanthropist.  Churches and temples in several Ukrainian cities and villages were erected with his money. </p><h2>  Kalnyshevsky and Catherine II </h2><p>  Catherine II played a huge role not only in the fate of Kalnyshevsky, she had a hand in the destruction of the whole Zaporizhzhya Sich.  But this will be discussed later. </p><p>  In the meantime, it is known that at one time Kalnyshevsky, being part of the delegation of the Cossacks to the court, took this opportunity to get acquainted with the Russian aristocracy and establish diplomatic relations with useful personalities. </p><p>  This led to the fact that over time Kalnyshevsky Petr Ivanovich became one of the richest and most influential people in Ukraine.  As an ataman, he was even invited to the coronation of Catherine II. </p>

    <p>  His performance really liked and was noted by the tsarina, but this did not affect her decision to remove Kalnyshevsky from the position of chieftain of the Cossack army (we are talking about the first dismissal of Kalnyshevsky).  One version of this historical event says that the queen did not like the very zealous settlement of the lands of the Zaporizhia Sich by the ataman of the cat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When Kalnyshevsky was elected for the second time, by order of the tsarina, a special investigative department was even created to investigate the reasons for such impudent disobedience to the royal court.  Who knows how this investigation would end and how many goals would ‚Äúfly off the block‚Äù if not for the war between Russia and Turkey. </p><h2>  Russian-Turkish war </h2><p>  The royal court understood that the Cossack army could provide significant assistance in the victory over the Turks, moreover, the Cossacks were assigned a decisive role in this war.  Catherine II had no choice but to ‚Äúclose her eyes‚Äù to the arbitrary selection of Kalnyshevsky by the Cossacks; she was forced to come to terms with the fact that her will was not fulfilled. </p><p>  This led to the fact that, having a huge influence, as well as wealth, Kalnyshevsky invariably remained a ataman of the cat until the last day of the existence of Sich.  Every year for 10 years, he was chosen as the chieftain. </p>

    <p>  And in the war of Russia with Turkey, the Cossack army showed itself only from the best side.  The queen was very pleased and granted the military rank of lieutenant general to the ataman.  In addition, the chieftain Peter Kalnyshevsky received the title of Knight of the Order of the Russian Empire - Andrew the First-Called. </p><h2>  Sich: the end of the story </h2><p>  The Cossacks were serviceable soldiers; they supported Russia in the war with Turkey.  But at the royal court, the attitude towards them was purely negative: Cossacks were considered rebels.  While Russia was threatened by the Tatars, the Zaporozhye army was tolerated and accepted, but after the signing of a peace treaty with the Crimean Khanate, the empress decided to get rid of the Cossacks.  Prince Potemkin was issued a decree on the destruction of the Zaporizhzhya Sich.  So, in May 1755, the governor of Potemkin Tekeli surrounded Sich with his troops. </p>

    <p>  When guns were pointed at the Cossacks, they were introduced to the empress‚Äôs decree, which stated that Sich was a threat to the whole empire.  But the tsarina wished to be fair, remembering the help that the Cossacks provided in the war with the Turks, she offered those who wanted to stay in Sich to leave the military craft and do farming. </p><p>  At the Cossack Council, which was headed by Kalnyshevsky, it was decided to avoid bloody resistance.  Indeed, more recently, the Cossacks fought shoulder to shoulder with the Russians against the Tatars. </p><p>  This decision served as the fact that Sich was completely destroyed and ceased to exist. </p><h2>  The fate of Kalnyshevsky </h2><p>  Kalnyshevsky Peter Ivanovich, whose biography has made a new round, was captured and delivered directly to St. Petersburg.  The former chieftain was judged by a military college.  For disobedience to government orders he was found guilty. </p><p>  Now historians put forward the version that the reason for everything was that Kalnyshevsky wanted to become the founder of a completely new Sich, where the Cossacks and the whole foreman would be loyal only to him. </p><p>  Kalnyshevsky, who at that time was 85 years old, was sentenced to death.  Potemkin himself tried to ensure that the punishment was replaced by the old ataman at the life-time exile in the Solovetsky Monastery. </p><h2>  Solovetsky Monastery </h2><p>  Potemkin‚Äôs troubles gained strength, and Pyotr Kalnyshevsky, the last ataman, was determined <strong> </strong>  to jail for especially dangerous <strong> </strong>  villains, which was located on the territory of the <span>Solovetsky monastery.</span> </p>

    <p>  Since the chieftain was considered a particularly dangerous criminal for the entire Russian Empire, he was deprived of the right to communicate and correspondence.  So, Kalnyshevsky was imprisoned for as many as 25 years. </p><p>  While the other prisoners of this monastery were guarded by 2 escorts, Kalnyshevsky was assigned 4. He was allowed to leave the prison only 3 times a year, on major religious holidays: Transfiguration of the Lord, Christmas and Easter.  These days, he attended services. </p><p>  It should be noted that Potemkin and Catherine II still waited for the 85-year-old man to repent.  Considerable funds were allocated for its maintenance, he was even considered an honorary captive.  However, the proud koshova never, during her time in exile, filed any petition with either the empress or her heirs.  Moreover, having good health, he survived both Potemkin and Catherine. </p><h2>  Exemption </h2><p>  Pyotr Kalnyshevsky was 110 years old when the grandson of Catherine decided to release him.  The former chieftain was invited to choose for himself a place for further residence.  Having such a venerable age, the old man, although he was already blind, still remained with a clear mind.  He simply expressed his gratitude for the release (notice, not without a certain amount of irony) and expressed a request for permission to live in the place to which he was so accustomed for 25 years of imprisonment. </p><h2>  Kalnyshevsky: attitude to religion </h2><p>  Being a ataman, Kalnyshevsky was very religious.  Near himself, he liked to keep monks, he listened to the advice of spiritual mentors. </p><p>  During his lifetime, he was the initiator and builder of multiple temples.  With his money, many churches acquired new church utensils. </p>

    <p>  As a prisoner of the Solovetsky Monastery, he distinguished himself by his piety and humility. </p><p>  After his release, Kalnyshevsky lived another 2 years.  In 1803, he was buried near the Transfiguration Cathedral, on the territory of the monastery.  Unfortunately, the place of burial of the valiant ataman in its original form was not preserved, because in the 30s of the last century the prison was renewed again in the territory where the ataman was, but this time for the enemies of the country of the Soviets. </p><p>  Since at the burial place of the chieftain the prisoners simply planted gardens, the grave was razed to the ground.  Over time, a tombstone was found and restored indicating that Kalnyshevsky was buried on this land. </p><h2>  Petr Kalnyshevsky: canonization </h2><p>  Grateful descendants do not forget the great chieftain.  At the place of his burial a monument was erected with the image of a koshev face. </p><p>  On November 13, 2015, Kalnyshevsky was canonized thanks to the initiative and efforts of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church under the Moscow Patriarchate. </p><p>  From now on, St. Peter Kalnyshevsky is revered on the day of his transition to another world - November 13.  According to the traditions of Orthodoxy, a special prayer and icon with the face of a saint were developed. </p>
