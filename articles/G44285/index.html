    <p>  Reminds Nokia 7280 anything, but definitely not a phone.  Appearance can be confused with an MP3 player, this is facilitated by the location of parts and a small display.  The company's designers did their best. </p><p>  The <span>Nokia 7280</span> mobile phone is made of several components.  The case uses suede, metal, rubber, fabric and ordinary plastic.  Such a cocktail cannot be found in other devices.  Even modern smartphones cannot match the variety of materials with 7280. </p><p>  Adds zest and layout to external details.  Intriguing is the complete absence of a keyboard, as well as tags with the logo of the company, made of matter.  Suede inserts are located on the front and side panels.  This solution allowed to protect the speaker and add convenience when working with the device. </p><p>  The controls are made of metal.  The plate covering the card slot is also made of a similar material.  Actually, all metal parts perform an aesthetic role, but rubber - a protective one.  There is only one fabric element, <span>this is a label</span> with the name of the company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A curious design feature was the screen.  When using the device, it does not stand out, but in standby mode, the display instantly turns into a small mirror.  This feature adds elegance to this little miracle. </p><p>  At the bottom of the device is a charging connector, a headset and a microphone.  There is also a place for the strap.  The upper part is empty at first glance, but the indicator is located here.  Almost the entire upper part starts to blink when receiving messages.  The backlight not only notifies about missed events, but also adds futurism to the design. </p><p>  The left side has become a haven for SIM cards, infrared and speaker.  Behind the camera, closed with a lid.  The controls, display and earpiece are located on the front side. </p><p>  Despite the unusual appearance, the device received the most familiar shortcomings.  The red insert scratches quickly.  Problems are not spared and the display device.  Fingerprints instantly appear on the mirror screen.  This indicates the absence of any coverage.  Glossy body elements also need constant cleaning. </p><p>  7280 users will receive not only a stylish device, but also a lot of problems.  Have to clean the case literally every day.  However, for the sake of such an unusual device, it is worth sacrificing something. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The cell phone Nokia 7280 received a miniature screen, only 30 by 16 millimeters.  Although the size does not cause much enthusiasm, it is quite sufficient to work with the device.  The user can easily read as many as five lines of text. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The device received 104 by 208 pixels, which provides good screen quality.  Naturally, the pixels are noticeable, but this does not cause much discomfort.  Improves the impression of excellent brightness and 65 thousand colors.  For a device released in 2004, the specifications are pretty good. </p><p>  There are also noticeable shortcomings in the Nokia 7280. The angle overview leaves much to be desired.  With a slight tilt, the image is noticeably distorted.  The sun will also become a problem for the user of the device.  The display fades very much in bright conditions. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  How to do without a camera in such an amazing device.  Nokia 7280 received a "peephole" with a matrix of 0.3 megapixels.  Now it is impossible to surprise with such a camera, but in 2004 it looked pretty good.  Pictures have a resolution of 640 by 480 pixels.  Accordingly, the quality of the photos leaves much to be desired.  In 7280 there is no possibility of video recording, which is quite logical with a 0.3 megapixel matrix. </p><p>  The camera is protected by a movable cover.  However, the glossy part near the camera still suffers from scratches.  A significant problem is the grains of sand that fall between the lid and the camera, which interfere with smooth movement. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The duration of the work will not particularly please users of the Nokia 7280. Battery characteristics indicate the presence of only 700 maH.  This capacity is only enough for 3-4 hours of active use of the device.  In standby mode, the phone can last several days. </p><p>  The most gluttonous in the Nokia 7280 is the display and communication.  The only solution may be to <span>replace the battery,</span> but for this you need to disassemble the device. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Specifications Nokia 7280, in contrast to its appearance, is not surprising.  The device received only 52.4 megabytes of native memory.  Not very much even for an outdated device.  The lack of a flash drive slot and a small amount of memory, unfortunately, does not allow using the device as a player. </p><h2>  Functionality </h2>

    <p>  For the user of Nokia 7280 will be available access to the Internet using GPRS tenth grade.  There is also the ability to transmit data via infrared. </p><p>  The device has an MP3 player, but the small amount of memory will not allow you to enjoy a large number of songs.  The installed FM player improves the situation a bit.  Also, the device is equipped with a voice recorder. </p><h2>  Delivery set </h2><p>  Together with an extraordinary phone is no less unusual equipment.  Nokia 7280 kit includes instructions, a headset, charging, a case, SIM cards, a tool for removing a card. </p><p>  Headphones are made in the usual style for the company, but have a leather insert under which a button is sheltered.  Naturally, the headset is stereo and provides high-quality sound.  The stranger was the charger.  The massive adapter has a bag in which the entire cord is hidden. </p><h2>  Disassembly </h2>

    <p>  If it is necessary to replace the battery or the OK button, the user can perform all the actions on his own.  Disassembling the "Nokia 7280" is quite simple, and the process begins with the fact that the card slot is removed.  Then you need to remove the movable cover.  After that, the back panel snaps off.  Now the user can remove the front side of the device. </p><p>  Once you get rid of the case, you need to snap off the clips holding the phone‚Äôs battery.  When you remove the battery, you can begin to disconnect the camera loop.  After that, clips snap on the sides of the device.  The phone is split into two halves, and then the screen cable is disconnected.  Now you can remove the panel with connectors and speaker.  By pressing on the display, it can be pulled out of the grooves.  Lastly, the board and the camera of the device are removed. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Owners primarily liked the appearance of the Nokia 7280. The design review notes unusual even among other models of the manufacturer.  We paid attention to a huge variety of body materials.  Although the phone is not very functional, it will definitely emphasize the user's image. </p><p>  A positive quality is the ease of disassembly.  Almost every owner is intuitively able to replace the battery or another part of the device. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  Most of all, a small amount of memory upsets the device.  Having a slot for a USB flash drive, the phone could be used as a player.  But 52.4 megabytes in the bud have cut off the ability to use an MP3 player. </p><p>  Also a painful place is autonomy.  Only 3 hours of conversations force the user to recharge the device. </p><p>  A bad camera also does not cause positive emotions.  Of course, you should not expect much from the 2004 device, but with the same success, you could completely abandon it. </p><p>  For owners of 7280 typing will be a real feat.  The necessary letters will have to choose a joystick.  Most likely, you can forget about the function of messages or stock up on great patience. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Nokia phones have always surprised fans with their unusual appearance.  In 7280, the manufacturer even surpassed himself.  Of course, the device is not suitable for everyone, but it certainly will be a great addition to the style. </p>
