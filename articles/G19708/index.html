It is notable for the fact that it is not so far from Bangkok, where most international flights arrive.  The distance between cities is only 160 kilometers.  Pattaya and Hua Hin are two seaside resorts where residents come to swim and sunbathe on weekends.  The second city is traditionally considered a place of respectable family vacations.  But Pattaya attracts young people.  And she, as you know, does not like to resort to the services of tour operators and prefers to travel on her own.  Therefore, one of the most common questions asked by tourists is how to get from Bangkok to Pattaya.  There are a lot of ways, and we will consider them here.  Let's start with the arrival. </p>

    <h2>  Bangkok Airport - Pattaya: how to get by taxi </h2><p>  Many tourists prefer to live in the capital for one or two days.  This is a great way to relax from a long flight, acclimatize to the time zone and climate and see the sights of the capital.  But if you can‚Äôt wait to plunge into the warm waters of the <span>Gulf of Thailand,</span> you can go straight from Suvarnabhumi Airport. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Alas, the only way to get from Bangkok to Pattaya at night is by taxi.  In the arrivals hall (second floor of the airport) you will find racks for ordering a car.  Prices - from two and a half thousand butts.  If you go outside, you will see a long row of cars waiting for riders.  A polyphonic chorus of taxi drivers will meet you.  Here prices start from two thousand butts, and with the ability to bargain, you can bring them down to 500 butts.  But if you go up to the fourth floor of the airport, to the departure lounge, you can conspire with the taxi driver who has just dropped off passengers for only a thousand baht. </p>

    <h2>  Online Transfer </h2><p>  This method is suitable for those who want to make a minimum of effort and for the price, as they say, will not stand.  Everything is very civilized: you order a car through the Internet.  If you wish, even a luxury car. </p><p>  At the exit to the arrivals hall of Bangkok airport ‚ÄúSuvarnabhumi‚Äù you will be met by a driver with a sign on which your name will be written.  He will take your luggage, put him in a car and with a breeze deliver right under the door of a hotel in Pattaya.  Pleasure is not cheap, but no troubles.  You won‚Äôt have to worry about being late for your flight.  This option is worth considering if you are traveling with a family with small children.  Poor things have suffered enough for an eight-hour flight.  If you are interested in the question of how to get from Bangkok to Pattaya at night, then an online transfer will be one of the few answer options. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Tourist bus </h2><p>  Now the next option.  Although we are considering ways to get from Bangkok to Pattaya on our own, it is not worth discounting travel agency services.  After all, most of our fellow citizens go to Thailand on permits. </p><p>  So, we leave the airport and look for parked beautiful buses with the words "Natalie Tours", "Coral Travel" or "Tez Tour".  In each of them <span>there is a guide girl who</span> speaks Russian.  For 200 baht, she will allow you to ride with other tourists.  This option is good if you travel alone (maximum two), because buses are served based on a certain number of passengers.  If you get a rejection from one girl, go to another.  There are a lot of tourist buses, and somewhere you are lucky.  For 200 baht you will not only get right to your hotel, but also listen to interesting information along the way. </p><h2>  From the airport to Pattaya by public bus </h2><p>  Get down to Airport Level 1.  Between gates 7 and 8 you will see the ticket offices of buses plying in various directions.  There are many companies, they provide various services.  You can take a ticket for 124 baht and you will be taken to Jomtien Street, a seaside resort.  They travel for a long time due to frequent stops on the way at Bus2, Bangkok-Pattaya. </p><p>  How to get to the place more quickly and comfortably?  Use the services of Bell Travel Service.  Cars of this company depart from Gate 8 of the First level of the airport.  In just 200 butt you will be delivered by air-conditioned bus to Pattaya North Street, and there they will transfer to a minivan to your hotel.  Travel time will take about two hours.  Buses from this company depart from Bangkok Airport six times a day.  There is a bus station ten minutes from the main terminal, where a free shuttle runs every quarter hour.  Cars from other companies start from there. </p>

    <h2>  Bus from the city of Bangkok </h2><p>  If you decide to spend the night, or even live in the capital, then your opportunities to get to the seaside resort are increasing.  There are two bus stations in Bangkok.  Ekkamai is located next to the eponymous underground station.  From here there are buses to Pattaya every half hour.  The first flight leaves at five in the morning, the last at 22.00.  From the second bus station - Mo Chit - cars also depart at half-hour intervals.  Make sure that the bus is an express train, otherwise the travel time will not be two, but all four hours.  In order not to go to the outskirts of the metropolis, use private minibuses.  Get off at Victory Monument metro station.  There you will see the platform, cluttered with tables.  Locate the Bangkok Pattaya sign. </p><p>  How to get to the resort with this strange <span>mode of transport?</span>  Buy a ticket from a Thai for 90 baht.  When the time comes (in 15-20 minutes) passengers are collected and seated in a white minivan.  In Pattaya, the minibus makes three stops.  Therefore, you can go to the resort that you need. </p>

    <h2>  How to get from Bangkok to Pattaya by train </h2><p>  Rail service is the cheapest way to travel around the country (not counting the hitchhiking, of course).  However, trains run very rarely, or rather, once a day, and even then on weekdays.  But the price of 40 baht for the third class and 80 for the first one is attractive, so you should consider this method of getting from Bangkok to Pattaya by train seriously.  Departure takes place at 6.55 from Hua Lamphong Main Station.  This is the metro station of the same name.  Travel time is three and a half hours.  The train arrives in Pattaya at 10.30.  <span>The railway station</span> in this city is located on Sukhumvit Road. </p>
