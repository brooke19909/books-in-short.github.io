    <h2>  OSNO: taxes </h2><p>  Many entrepreneurs, trying to minimize the burden and simplify accounting work, choose special taxation modes.  However, in such cases, entities must comply with a number of requirements established by law.  Otherwise, by default, they will be recognized as a common taxation system.  What amounts are payable to <span>extrabudgetary funds</span> and to the budget under the OSNA?  It: </p><ol><li>  VAT.  The total rate is 18%.  For certain product categories, 10% is established.  Export is carried out without VAT. </li><li>  Deductions from income (20%). </li><li>  <span>Corporate property tax</span> .  It is calculated at a rate of 2.2% of the cost of fixed assets on the balance sheet. </li><li>  Personal income tax - 13%. </li><li>  Contributions to the PFR, FOMS, FSS.  They make up 30.2% of the salary fund. </li></ol><p>  Depending on the specifics of the activity, transport, land and other fees may also be imputed.  For IP on OSNO, the following mandatory payments are established: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  VAT. </li><li>  Personal income tax. </li><li>  Personal property tax. </li><li>  Local fees. </li><li>  Mandatory extrabudgetary contributions. </li></ol>

    <p>  The calculation of each <span>type of tax is</span> carried out according to a certain scheme, regulated in the relevant legislative acts. </p><h2>  Accounting for expenses and income: cash basis </h2><p>  One of the first events that is carried out when changing the simplified regime to OSNO is the formation of the base of the period.  In this case, it is important not to re-account expenses and income.  In other words, if some revenues and expenses have already been recorded earlier, then there is no need to reflect them again when the system changes.  The legislation does not provide for any special procedure for the formation of income-expenditure items for those enterprises that will use the cash method on the basic basis.  This means that fundamentally nothing will change for such companies. </p><h2>  Accrual method </h2><p>  Those enterprises that will use this option in determining costs and revenues have established a special procedure for the basic tax liability.  This follows from Art.  346.25 Tax Code.  The revenue includes receivables that were generated during the use of the simplified regime.  The fact is that the cost of delivered but not paid services or products was not included in them.  Unclosed advances that were received in a special mode do not affect the base.  All prepayments, therefore, are included in the base for the simplified tax system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Costs </h2><p>  They include the amount of outstanding payables.  For example, products were received before the special regime was changed to general, and payment was made after the establishment of the OSS.  This means that the value of inventory should be taken into account in the process of determining budgetary deductions for profits.  This is due to the fact that enterprises using the simplified regime use the <span>cash method.</span>  Costs payable should be reflected in the month in which the transition is made from one taxation regime to another.  These requirements are established in paragraph 2, Art.  346.25 Tax Code.  Prepayments issued during the period of simplified taxation are debited after the establishment of the general tax expense.  Reporting is made after the counterparty closes the advance payment and fulfills the obligations. </p><h2>  Important point </h2><p>  It should be said separately about intangible assets and fixed assets.  There will be no problems when these facilities were acquired and used by the enterprise during the period of simplified taxation.  In this case, all expenses will already be debited. </p>

    <h2>  VAT </h2><p>  It is necessary to take into account that when switching to OSSO from the simplified tax system from January 1, the company becomes the payer of this tax.  From the first quarter, thus, VAT is charged on all relevant transactions.  Special rules are provided for services or products that are sold in advance.  There can be three options: </p><ol><li>  The advance was received in the previous period, and then there was an implementation.  In this case, VAT is not charged.  This is due to the fact that over the past year the enterprise was on a simplified system, and the fact of the transition to the OSNO does not matter here. </li><li>  The advance was received in the previous period, and the implementation took place after the establishment of the general regime.  In this case, VAT is charged on the date of shipment.  You do not need to do this in advance. </li><li>  The receipt of prepayment and implementation occurred after the transition to OSNO.  In this case, VAT is charged on advance payments and on shipment.  When tax is included upon the fact of sale, the previously established one from prepayment can be taken for deduction. </li></ol><p>  If the sale was carried out without advance payment, and the shipment was after the transition to OSNO, VAT is charged.  If the delivery took place on a simplified system, then, accordingly, the company was not a payer.  Therefore, VAT in this case is not charged. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="basic taxes" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1056451.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Input VAT </h2><p>  In some cases, a property tax acquired on a simplified system may be deductible after the transition to the basic tax system.  This is allowed if the cost of production was not taken into account in the calculation of deductions.  For example, this may relate to contract work and materials purchased for capital construction, which the company did not have time to complete, being on a simplified system. </p>
