Why can not combine the concepts of patronage and sponsorship?  Because they sponsor the artist in the name of business strategy, receiving advertising in return, which means profit.  A philanthropist is a person who sacrifices art, science, health care, education at the behest of the heart and most often remains an anonymous person.

    <p>  <strong>Charity and spiritual development of society</strong> </p><p>  The appearance of <span>Christianity in Russia</span> was the beginning of patronage of arts - 988.  One of the main commandments - love for one's neighbor - encouraged people to charity of the poor, which at first was expressed in the simplest forms of help to the ‚Äúpoor and miserable."  They handed out food and clothes, much less often - money, built housing, treated for free.  Before the great <span>church holidays,</span> the princes themselves, and later the kings, secretly visited prisons, shelters, hospitals, where they "targeted" helped those in need.  After 1551, when the <span>Stoglavy Cathedral was held,</span> charity passed into the hands of the state, into a system of public charity.  Peter's times especially strengthened the state‚Äôs concern for the population.  Hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages were opened.  Moreover, the main sources of maintenance of state institutions of such a plan have always been private donations.  Peter himself donated a third of his salary.  The monastic inhabitants were taught crafts, and the income from their work went also to charity. <strong><br></strong> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In the 19th century, private charity truly became all-encompassing: under its supervision, libraries, museums, exhibitions, art galleries, schools, hospitals, and charity homes for orphans and the elderly work.  Russian philanthropists, whose charity did not allow their names to remain anonymous, remained forever in the history of our country.  The Tretyakovs, Bakhrushins, Mamontovs, Morozovs, Schukins, Prokhorovs, Botkins, Naydenovs - not to list all.  A philanthropist is already a <span>family value,</span> which has become a necessity for maintaining mental health.  Merchants of patronage of the whole dynasties worked for the benefit of their people.  An example is the family of Siberian merchants Sibiryakov, who built many not only theaters, but also churches that supported the formation of Russian poetry, in particular, one of the fathers of Russian literature - Gabriel Derzhavin.  But the main contributions were made to science - thanks to the Sibiryakovs, the Northern Sea Route was being studied. </p>

    <p>  The first philanthropist in this family is also Savva, but he was born in 1770 as a serf of the landowner Ryumin.  Thanks to hard work for a long twenty-three years, he bought free himself and his children, after which he opened a silk-weaving workshop.  The famous Morozov manufactory - velvet, calico, chintz of the highest quality - and without charity would glorify the name of the Morozovs for many centuries.  But it was precisely this patronage that this family lived.  The most famous Savva Morozov is the founder of the Moscow Art Theater, a friend of Stanislavsky and Gorky, a gifted chemist and a man of the broadest soul.  The working conditions at his factories were not better than others, in addition, he built free dormitories, hospitals, baths, and parks for his workers for his workers. </p><p>  Savva's fundamental idea is the distribution of part of the profit among workers.  The most amazing thing was that it was Morozov who gave money for the publication of the Bolshevik newspapers Iskra, Novaya Zhizn, and Fighting, transported typographic fonts unattended, and even hid fugitive revolutionaries from the secret police.  The son of Savva - Sergei - helped the <span>Stroganov School, the</span> artists Polenov and Serov, established the Museum of Fine Arts on Volkhonka (Pushkin Museum).  The daughter of Varvara built the first cancer clinic on <span>Maiden Field, the</span> Turgenev library, reading room, almshouse and school in Tver.  A patron is a family man. </p>
