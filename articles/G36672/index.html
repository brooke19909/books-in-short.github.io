    <p>  <span>The hippie movement,</span> which appeared in the 60s of the last century, returned the beads from oblivion, a bauble boom began.  "Children of the Sun" preferred to hang their clothes with all kinds of ornaments made with beads.  Even during the wedding, the newlyweds exchanged not rings, but baubles. </p><h2>  Bead Trees - The Basics </h2><p>  Now beadwork is still relevant.  And, in addition to baubles, many find for themselves weaving bead trees.  Before you begin beadwork, you will need some necessary items: fishing line, needle, hooks, knitting needles and the beads themselves.  It is best to weave a tree of beads on a non-slip surface.  The table for this is covered with a napkin or tablecloth. </p>

    <p>  Beadwork is produced according to the schemes.  It is recommended to start with the lightest and then gradually reach the difficult ones.  This is a difficult matter, but how then bead trees look beautiful!  A bead to a bead, glass beads, even sequins - with due imagination, all this is perfectly combined with each other.  It is only important to make sure that there will be enough material.  Beads are suitable for weaving any ornament, but beginners are still recommended to opt for weaving a flower. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Weave flower </h2><p>  You will need the following material: scissors, wire and beads.  The bead is threaded through the wire and fixed.  In subsequent rows, the number of beads increases by one.  After five beads appear in one row, they will need to be reduced.  Such weaving provides flower symmetry. </p><p>  The core should be made of large beads.  The weaving of the flower ends with the union of all the petals with the middle bead. </p>

    <p>  If desired, the elements of the flower can vary: increase the number of beads or change the core. </p><h2>  Start weaving a tree </h2><p>  A bead tree will require the same items and green beads.  A loop is made on the wire, located 15 centimeters from its end, then beads are strung on it.  A tree of beads and wire should have several leaves that are woven of 4 beads.  Then 5 more similar wires are twisted. </p><p>  When 6 wires are ready, 3 of them are twisted into one.  Do the same with the remaining wires.  Then <span>the tree trunk</span> should be painted in brown paint, and the branches should be straightened. </p><p>  The base is ready, and any leaves on the tree can be made. </p><h2>  Bead Heart </h2><p>  An original gift to a loved one can be a heart-shaped tree made of beads.  It weaves quickly enough.  In order to make this tree of beads with your own hands, you will need: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Two colors of beads.  It is important that the shades are compatible. </li><li>  Two types of wire: thin and thicker. </li><li>  Thread floss.  The color must be selected in accordance with the shades of beads. </li><li>  The stand on which the tree will fit.  You can use a glass or a small pot, all that is at hand. </li><li>  Sequins with which you can decorate the stand. </li></ul>

    <p>  We begin to create a tree.  First you need to take a thin wire and twist on it 7 loops of beads.  The loops are placed at the same distance from each other, and each should contain 5 beads. </p><p>  Then each such wire is twisted into a twig.  So you need to do a lot of them.  About 25 branches for each tree. </p><p>  Next, you need to twist large ones from small branches.  You should take 5 branches and combine them into one common.  It turns out already 5 large branches for a tree. </p><p>  Each such twig is wrapped with a mouline thread of the corresponding color.  It is important that the thread lies evenly and looks whole. </p><p>  Now you need to form the tree itself.  We take the wire thicker and attach branches to it so that we get a tree.  The trunk is also wrapped with floss thread.  When it is ready, it should be bent, giving the desired shape.  We do the same with the second tree. </p><p>  We twist the lower parts of both trees and fix in the prepared stand.  If a foam cylinder is at hand, then the trunks are fixed in the center.  If the cup or pot became a stand, then the trunks should be fixed with plaster.  When it dries, the structure will be stable. </p><p>  Decorate the stand with decorative sequins.  The heart tree is ready. </p><h2>  Bonsai tree </h2><p>  Consider how to create another tree of beads.  A master class on bonsai will talk about this.  To work, you need round frosted green beads, two wire options: thin and thick, for branches and trunk.  You will also need scissors, a small flower pot, a bandage, a band-aid and plaster. </p>

    <p>  Before proceeding directly to the manufacture of wood, you need to prepare some details.  First you need to cut pieces of thin wire with a length of 40 centimeters in the amount of 90 pieces. </p><p>  Beads of 8-10 beads are strung on each such wire, and then a loop is twisted.  In total, 7-9 such loops should be made on the segment.  When the desired number of loops is ready, the bump is curled.  The result should be 90 cones. </p><p>  All cones are twisted into small bundles of 2-3 things.  Each resulting twig needs to be wrapped with adhesive tape. </p><p>  Form the crown.  Several others need to be attached to the beam, forming a magnificent crown from them.  Then they begin to assemble the tree branches.  Everything is held together with a band-aid. </p><p>  After the formation of the crown we make the trunk.  Here you will need a thick wire.  The crown is attached at one end, and on the other you need to make a support loop.  Using adhesive tape we attach the remaining branches.  To make the trunk thicker, you will need to wrap it with a bandage. </p><p>  Now it is time to plant our tree.  Gypsum needs to be halved with water.  A tree of beads is lowered into a pot and poured with prepared gypsum.  You need to make sure that the tree is stable. </p><p>  Gypsum is frozen, the tree stands firmly, it's time to finish the trunk.  Plaster covers the branches and the trunk itself.  To simulate the roughness of the bark, you can use an old toothbrush. </p><p>  When the trunk is ready, the pot is again filled with gypsum and decorated with pebbles.  A couple of days after drying, the trunk is covered with acrylic paints, and then with two layers of varnish.  If you want, you can decorate the pot. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The tree made of beads will be an excellent gift for the closest people.  They can decorate the house, giving your interior a zest and comfort.  Bead trees, photos of which are presented below, are created very easily, do not require large material costs, and at the same time they will be a wonderful gift for any occasion. </p>
