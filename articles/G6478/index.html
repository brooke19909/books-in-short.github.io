The sights of the <span>United States of America</span> will surprise even the most discerning travelers, dreaming of a new meeting with historical places immediately after the trip. </p><p>  It is impossible to talk about all the interesting corners of a huge country, so we will focus on cultural and natural sites, which have long been considered the hallmarks of the United States. </p><h2>  History of the monument </h2><p>  When it comes to America, the Statue of Liberty is the first association that all people have.  This is the most famous building in the country, recognized as a national monument since 1924.  An interesting story is the creation of a giant sculpture 46 meters high. </p><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãerecting the monument belongs to the French historian de Laboulay, who 150 years ago proposed to give America a statue as a <span>symbol of friendship</span> between countries.  The young sculptor Bartholdi, inspired by Delacroix's famous painting ‚ÄúFreedom Leading the People to the Barricades‚Äù, traveled to the United States to determine the location of the future monument. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Statue of Liberty Monument" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1198655.jpg" width="375"></div>

Taking as aide the future creator of the Eiffel Tower, engaged in the installation of the strongest structures, Bartholdi created in 1884 a monument to the Statue of Liberty with the money of the French-American society. </p><h2>  Symbol of america </h2><p>  The first viewers of a 200-ton female figure with a torch in an outstretched hand were the French, admiring the work for three months, after which it was officially transferred to America.  It is known about 214 flights carrying the statue in parts to Liberty Island (Bedlow), where she met all the ships with immigrants. </p><p>  In 2012, the monument, which locals call ‚ÄúLady Liberty,‚Äù was closed for reconstruction.  The whole year there was a repair work, after which the statue acquired modern elevators and security systems.  Now everyone can easily climb the spiral staircase leading to the crown of the statue with seven rays. </p><p>  It is recommended to buy tickets for visiting the symbol of America, included in the UNESCO heritage lists, in advance, since up to 20 thousand people wish to admire the statue on the day.  Be prepared for a thorough personal inspection to prevent terrorist attacks. </p><h2>  Disneyland </h2><p>  The first Disneyland in the world, opened in 1955, is a huge amusement park and real attractions of the United States of America, where tourists from all over the world seek.  An unforgettable family holiday center, built for children, is loved by people of all ages.  There you can feel like a child and visit the colorful castle of Sleeping Beauty, visit the small island of Peter Pan, plunge into the adventure world of Indiana Jones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of the united states of america" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1198656.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is with amazing care that the fairy-tale world of children's cartoons is recreated, filled with incredible attractions and colorful parades.  What could be more beautiful than a meeting and joint photos with your favorite characters, familiar from childhood? </p><h2>  Thematic areas </h2><p>  Annually, the already vast territory of the entertainment complex expands.  Now she directly represents ‚ÄúDisneyland‚Äù and Disney‚Äôs California adventures for entertaining kids, a separate adult relaxation area with souvenir shops, specialty shops, numerous restaurants and three luxury hotels where you can stay with the whole family.  You can move from one <span>theme park</span> to another on an old train by rail, laid across the entire Disneyland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disneyland california" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1198676.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the evening, the sky is painted with bright lights of multi-colored fireworks, for the sake of a delightful play of fire and music it is worth lingering in an amusement park until its closure.  A fantastically beautiful show will delight in the scope of not only children, but also those who are not used to wonder at the wonders of their parents. </p><h2>  Grand Canyon </h2><p>  The most impressive sights of the United States of America are not always created by human hands.  The Grand Canyon, located in <span>Arizona,</span> is an excellent example of the erosion of the Colorado River, which has crashed into limestone on a nearby plateau for centuries. </p><p>  The ancient rocks of slates and granites lying at the base of the natural monument are painted in reddish color and formed about two billion years ago.  The muddy waters of the Colorado River with a suspension of sand and clay have the same shade. </p><h2>  National park </h2><p>  In 1919, a national park was created here, annually hosting more than five million tourists a year.  <span>The Grand Canyon of</span> Colorado is an amazing natural miracle that looks from afar as a flat surface, and only at the very edge of the plateau is a gorge with a bewitching depth that expands annually expanding.  Travelers love to photograph the abyss of the canyon, after washing the rocks filled with the most bizarre relief forms in which everyone guesses something different. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Colorado Grand Canyon" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1198667.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Surprisingly, the canyon changes color depending on the lighting: dark colors are replaced with the appearance of the first rays of the sun with iridescent pink and bluish shades. </p><p>  The sights of the <span>United States of America</span> amaze foreigners with majesty and entertainment.  You can talk about memorable corners for a long time, but it is best to try to see with your own eyes what will remain in your memory forever. </p>
