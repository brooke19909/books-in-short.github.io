The first ‚ÄúWinter House‚Äù is a small two-story, wooden building.  In his place, subsequently, Governor Menshikov built a stone house and donated it to Peter the Great's wedding. In 1720, the Winter Palace was completed, in which the imperial family moved from a summer residence.  Four times the Winter expanded and rebuilt.  For this, homes and plots were bought along the Neva embankment.  The last - fifth option was completed already under Catherine II, who led the final layout and interior decoration. </p><h2>  State Hermitage Museum </h2><p>  The State Hermitage occupies almost all the premises of the Winter Palace.  More than 400 halls and galleries host one of the most extensive and rich exhibits in the world.  The Hermitage began with the collection purchased by Catherine II, which consisted of approximately 300 paintings by Flemish masters.  Initially, it was placed in separate chambers, hence the name Hermitage (a secluded place).  In Germany in 1769, a collection of Count Brill of 600 paintings was acquired.  The backbone of the collection was completed with the acquisition by Baron Croz of paintings by Titian, Rembrandt, Rubens and other famous Renaissance masters.  Catherine II also acquired antique statues and various stone products for the Hermitage.  She ordered paintings from contemporary artists and acquired several libraries, including Voltaire and Didro.  After the death of the empress, only the catalog of paintings was 3,996 copies.  The heirs continued to replenish the collection, and Nicholas I made the Hermitage a public museum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather in St. Petersburg in October" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1448379.jpg" width="550"></div>

In October, navigation on the Neva was not yet completed, and small boats and numerous pleasure boats scurried along the river.  At this time, the city becomes like Venice and you can conduct a tour by exploring the promenades and bridges, which are the highlight of St. Petersburg along with palaces and mansions of the nobility.  More than three hundred city bridges, 218 of which are pedestrian, are thrown across the Neva, and numerous canals give a special charm to the city.  When planning walking tours of the city, it is worth considering that the weather in St. Petersburg in October is often rainy and the temperature drops to zero degrees.  Therefore, you should choose the appropriate outerwear, have waterproof shoes and take an umbrella. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go to St. Petersburg in October" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1448377.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The most famous bridges: </p><ul><li>  The widest is almost a hundred-meter Blue Bridge, which is a continuation of St. Isaac's Square. </li><li>  And also three more color bridges similar to each other are thrown across the Moika River. </li><li>  The first three permanent bridges include Blagoveshchensky, Liteiny and Troitsky. </li></ul><p>  Three suspension bridges are decorated with sculptures: </p><ul><li>  Bank bridge - griffins. </li><li>  Lion Bridge - animals matching the name. </li><li>  The most recognizable Anichkov bridge is decorated with four non-repeating equestrian compositions. </li></ul><p>  Even in order to see these bridges it is worth coming to St. Petersburg.  In October, night city tours are also held, during which you can see the famous building of bridges.  Of the drawbridges, the number of which is 21 units, 13 currently operate, including the Palace Bridge, Peter the Great Bridge and the Finland <span>Railway Bridge.</span>  This is an unforgettable sight in a variety of neon lights and spotlights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in St. Petersburg in October" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1448396.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Country Tours </h2><p>  During an excursion to St. Petersburg in October, a more extensive program may include country trips for the whole day: Pavlovsk, Gatchina, Kronshtadt, Tsarskoye Selo.  Country residences, palaces, fortresses and park ensembles which will not leave travelers indifferent.  The trip to Peterhof will certainly be the most significant. </p><h2>  Museums of Peterhof </h2><p>  Peterhof Palace Complex includes park ensembles of the Upper Garden, Lower Park, several palaces and residences. </p><p>  The construction of the <span>Grand Peterhof Palace was</span> begun by Peter I. The history of its construction began in 1714.  The first building, the Upper Chambers, was designed by architects I. Braunstein and J. LeBlanc.  It included several halls for receptions and banquets, as well as the imperial bedchamber.  This small palace became the summer residence of the imperial family and a venue for entertainment balls and masquerades.  The expansion and reconstruction of the palace was continued by Empress Elizaveta Petrovna.  The work, led by architect B.F. Rastrelli, lasted from 1745 to 1755.  After the reconstruction, the small summer residence turned into a huge magnificent palace, surrounded by many fountains and sculptures.  Its interior also impresses with its luxury.  Built on the model of Versailles, the Grand Peterhof Palace is not inferior in beauty and grandeur to the most famous castles in Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="October concerts in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1448387.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the very shore of the Gulf, Peter I built his favorite suburban palace, which he called Monplaisir (from French ‚Äúmy pleasure‚Äù).  For the project, architects used the designs of the emperor himself.  The layout and decorative finishes are made in the Dutch style, which is why it is sometimes called the "Dutch House".  Small cozy rooms and utility rooms emphasize Dutch restraint and neatness.  The rooms and galleries are decorated with a collection of Western European paintings, and the Oriental-style Lacquer Cabinet is equipped for a valuable collection of Chinese porcelain.  The office window offers views of Kronstadt and St. Petersburg. </p><p>  The farm palace got its name from the pavilion at the dairy farm.  Repeatedly rebuilt, expanded and turned into a full-fledged dwelling of the family of Emperor Alexander III, and later his son Nicholas II. </p><p>  During the construction of Peterhof, it was necessary to provide guest rooms for noble people and delegations.  This function was performed by the Marley Pavilion and Palace.  According to rumors, he got his name from the residence of Marly-le-Roi, in which Peter I visited with the French kings. </p><p>  The Palace-Museum "Cottage" was built for the family of Nicholas I in the Gothic style.  At the same time, a Gothic chapel was built nearby, which became the house church of the imperial family at the summer residence. </p><p>  The Benois Family Museum is housed in one of the maids of honor, designed by N. L. Benois.  And also organized the exhibition "Sovereign Fun", telling about the mass holidays in Peterhof, and the museum "Playing Cards". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="October exhibitions in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1448374.jpg" width="600"></div>
