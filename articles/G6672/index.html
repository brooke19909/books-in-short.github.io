    <p>  One of many such structures is the Temple of St. Sergius on Ryazanka.  It attracts tourists with architecture created by the hands of modern architects.  This amazingly beautiful complex consists of two temples - Sergius of Radonezh and Vvedensky.  In addition, it is the House of the Clergy, which now operates the School of Ringer and Sunday School. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  At the end of April 2000, the constituent assembly of the initiative group of believers decided to create a parish in honor of Sergius of Radonezh and ask the city authorities to allow the construction of a <span>new church</span> on Ryazanka.  Great work was done, and as a result, at the intersection of Okskaya and Ryazan Avenue, the Moscow authorities allocated the necessary land, and Archbishop Arseny consecrated it.  Fortunately, the project quickly got sponsors, who, in combination, also became builders - the TEN group of companies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Temple construction </h2><p>  In 2003, work began on the construction of one of the two planned temples of the complex.
