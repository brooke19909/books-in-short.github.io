Lermontov: biography</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Only 4 years after the death of Pushkin that shocked Russia, a duel took place between M. Yu. Lermontov and retired major Nikolai Martynov.  As a result, the poet was killed, and the second participant in the duel escaped with a three-month arrest and church repentance.  Although <span>Lermontov‚Äôs</span> last <span>duel, which</span> ended in his death, took place more than 175 years ago, disputes over whether N. S. Martynov really shot the man who shot the gun into the air, i.e., committed the murder, still do not subside. </p>

    <h2>  Origin </h2><p>  In order to better understand the motives of the actions of a person whose bullet put an end to M. Yu. Lermontov‚Äôs short biography, one should learn about his origin. </p><p>  So, N. S. Martynov was from Moscow nobles.  His grandfather made a fortune from wine farms, that is, for a fee he acquired the right from the state to levy a tax on drinking establishments, which he was extremely successful in.  At the end of the 18th century, it was believed that aristocrats should not be engaged in such matters.  However, Mikhail Ilyich, although very shy of his business, as they would say today, nevertheless wished his son to continue his business, as it provided a steady income.  He called him by a name uncharacteristic for the people of his class.  Thus, Nikolai Solomonovich Martynov, whose nationality immediately after the death of Lermontov became the subject of speculation, is undoubtedly Russian. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Parents and childhood </h2><p>  Martynov's father Solomon Mikhailovich Martynov rose to the rank of state councilor and died in 1839.  His wife <span>Elizabeth Mikhailovna</span> came from a Tarnovsky noble family.  In total, the Martynov family had eight children: 4 sons and 4 daughters.  They, especially the boys, received an excellent education, had enough money to feel at ease among the golden youth, and were distinguished by their attractive appearance. </p><p>  Nikolai Martynov was born in 1815 and was only a year younger than Lermontov.  From childhood he had a talent for literary work and began to write poetry early, imitating the famous poets of his time. </p>

    <h2>  Study </h2><p>  In 1831, Nikolai Martynov entered the School of Guard Ensigns and Cavalry Junkers.  Lermontov appeared there a year later.  The latter was forced to apply for exit from Moscow University due to an unpleasant story with one of the professors, but did not want to go to St. Petersburg, because there he was offered to start his studies again from the first year. </p><p>  The Nikolaev Cavalry School, in which young people ended up, was one of the most famous in Russia.  Only noblemen were accepted into it after studying at the university or in private boarding schools that did not have military training.  During their studies, Lermontov and Nikolai Solomonovich Martynov were engaged in fencing on espadrons more than once and were quite familiar with each other.  In addition, the poet was introduced to many members of the Martynov family, and Nikolai's brother, Mikhail, was his classmate.  Subsequently, they also wrote that one of the sisters of Nicholas even became partly the prototype of Princess Mary.  It‚Äôs known that Martynov‚Äôs mother spoke extremely unflatteringly about Lermontov for his stinging jokes, but her son was delighted with the poetic talent of his schoolmate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  After completing his studies, Nikolai Martynov was sent to serve in the then prestigious Cavalier Guard regiment, which in the same period was an officer of Dantes.  During the <span>Caucasian War,</span> he, like many representatives of his generation, volunteered for the front in the hope of becoming famous and returning to the capital with the ranks and military orders.  There, during a military expedition of a Caucasian detachment across the Kuban River, Nikolai Solomonovich Martynov proved himself to be a brave officer.  For military merits, he was even awarded the Order of St.  Anne with a bow, and he was in good standing with the command. </p>

    <h2>  Resignation </h2><p>  The circumstances were such that Nikolai Martynov could well hope for a successful career.  However, for the still unexplained reason, in 1841, being in the rank of major (recall that practically his peer Lermontov at that time was only a lieutenant), he unexpectedly filed a letter of resignation.  It was rumored that the young man was forced to do this, since he was caught cheating during a card game, which was considered an extremely shameful thing among officers.  In favor of such rumors, many cited the fact that Nikolai Martynov, who had sufficient financial means and connections, did not return to the capital, but settled away from society in Pyatigorsk and led a reclusive life.  Among the vacationers and local Russian society, the former major was known as an eccentric and original, as he dressed in the clothes of the highlanders and walked around with a huge dagger, causing ridicule from former colleagues. </p>

    <h2>  M. Yu. Lermontov in the Caucasus </h2><p>  By 1841, the poet had already become famous throughout Russia thanks to poems about Pushkin.  The troubles of his grandmother, who has an influential relative among the courtiers, allowed him to avoid a more serious punishment.  He was sent to the Caucasus as an ensign in the Nizhny Novgorod Regiment.  This trip did not last long enough, and soon he again shone in the capital's salons.  Perhaps everything would have turned out differently if it had not been for a quarrel in the house of Countess Laval with Ernest de Barant.  The son of a French diplomat saw an insult in the epigram, which, as he was told by his general acquaintances, was written by M. Yu. Lermontov.  During the duel, which took place near the place where Pushkin was mortally wounded, nothing tragic happened: the sword of one of the rivals broke, Barant missed, and the poet shot into the air.  However, it was not possible to hide the fact of the duel, and the poet was exiled to the Caucasus, although he made attempts to resign. </p>

    <h2>  Reasons for the duel with Martynov </h2><p>  From the Northern capital, the poet first arrived in Stavropol, where his Tenginsky regiment stood, and after a while went on short-term vacation in Pyatigorsk.  And friends persuaded him not to do this.  There he met many of his Petersburg acquaintances, including Martynov.  Evil in the language of Lermontov was extremely amused by the warlike appearance of the former classmate.  The latter long ago harbored a grudge against the poet, since he believed that he ridiculed him in his epigrams, in which the names Martysh and Solomon appeared.  Subsequently, the version according to which Martynov believed that Lermontov had compromised his sister was also considered as the reason for the duel.  The rivalry of young people over the favor of a French actress named Adele, who was on tour in the Caucasus, was also indicated. </p><h2>  Quarrel </h2><p>  Two days before the tragedy, its main characters met in the house of General Verzilin.  The poet‚Äôs future second and his longtime friend Prince Trubetskoy, as well as the wife and daughter of the owner of the house, were also present there.  In their presence, Lermontov began to let out taunts about the ridiculous highlander.  By a tragic accident, at these words, the music stopped, and they were heard by everyone, including Martynov, as always, dressed up in Circassian style.  As later recalled mutual acquaintances of Lermontov and Martynov, this was not the first time that the poet mocked a retired major.  He endured until it was possible to pretend that the jokes had nothing to do with him.  However, during the musical evening with the Verzilins, everything was too obvious, and the duel between Lermontov and Martynov became inevitable.  The offended "highlander" loudly declared that he no longer intended to endure ridicule, and left.  The poet reassured the ladies that tomorrow he and Nikolai Solomonovich would make peace, since "this happens." </p>

    <h2>  Duel Lermontov with Martynov </h2><p>  In the evening of the same day, Mikhail and Nikolai had an unpleasant conversation, during which a challenge to a duel was sounded.  The fight took place the very next day.  According to the generally accepted version, Lermontov was not serious about everything that was happening and shot into the air.  Thus, he further angered Martynov and got a bullet in his chest.  Since the doctor was not present at the duel, medical assistance was not provided, although she could hardly save Lermontov‚Äôs life. </p><p>  After the duel, Martynov was sentenced to deprivation of all rights of his fortune and demotion.  However, Nicholas II decided to limit the punishment to three months imprisonment in a guardhouse. </p>
