    <p>  The biography taught by all the schoolchildren of the <span>Third Reich</span> says that in 1889, on April 20, a male infant was born with Clara Gidler (the name was written incorrectly, then corrected). </p><p>  The family was not particularly distinguished by anything, although there was one oddity - the mother and father were related.  In order to get married, they even needed papal permission (they were Catholics).  Father, Alois, was not young, and passed away when the guy turned 14 years old. </p>

    <p>  The lanky youth grew pensive, somewhat lazy, his favorite pastime was walking.  It is hard to imagine that during these years he was thinking about the fate of the planet and the dominant importance of the <span>Nordic race,</span> especially since he had a serious passion - painting.  Attempts to learn how to become an artist were unsuccessful; at the Vienna Academy of Art, his abilities were not appreciated, comfortingly saying goodbye that an architect can still turn out of him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All these well-known facts do not give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat kind of person was Adolf <span>Hitler.</span>  <span>The biography</span> becomes interesting after the outbreak of World War II.  For a long time, Soviet and foreign historians developed the idea that the future Fuhrer was useless as a soldier, and received his iron cross by chance, quickly running away somewhere with a report.  In fact, he had three crosses - I, III, and III degrees with swords, which suggests that the corporal still had to fight, and not at the beck and call. </p>

    <p>  Trying to create the image of a stupid neurasthenic, historical scholars render <span>a disservice to the</span> world anti-fascist movement <span>.</span>  He was neither mediocrity nor a coward Adolf Hitler.  His biography continued in Munich, where he conducted campaigns among veterans on the instructions of the government.  At this work, his orator talent was manifested, and, apparently, it was in 1919 that he himself felt his ability to captivate the masses.  Then he met with the founder of the German Workers Party Anton Drexler.  The latter, having been defeated in a dispute with Adolf, was not offended, but invited him into a close circle of his comrades. </p>

    <p>  The following year, a new member of the party renamed and headed it.  The organization grew, stormtroopers in brown shirts marched through the streets, but so far have not touched anyone.  In 1923, Bavaria, impoverished by reparations and indemnities, was shocked by the military coup that General Ludendorff and Adolf Hitler tried to implement.  The politician‚Äôs biography could end after the suppression of the coup, which caustically called the "beer."  After a nine-month imprisonment (the term was 5 years, but he was ‚Äúsquandered‚Äù), the F√ºhrer of the German nation finally went free and found that everything he had created had collapsed.  The attack aircraft fled, there is no money, even brown shirts have nothing to buy.  A leader with a criminal record, who has established himself as a bully and a chatterbox, was not needed by anyone.  All that remained was a book written in prison and several faithful comrades who believed in National Socialism. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The story of Adolf Hitler as a politician at that moment opened its most mysterious page.  From somewhere, the Fuhrer suddenly had money, and considerable.  By 1930, the NSDAP was represented in the Bundestag, its ratings were higher than those of its main competitors (social democrats and communists).  Everything that happened next can be read in any history textbook. </p><p>  But there is another aspect of the life of this dictator - his relationship with the main woman in his life.  Everyone knows that Eva Braun and Adolf Hitler formalized their relationship just before suicide.  But not everyone knows that in fact they have been spouses since 1929.  (Beauty Eve was only seventeen when they met.) </p><p>  It is widely believed that Hitler forced his wife to drink poison.  In fact, no one was present at their suicide, so there is no one to refute or confirm this version.  It is possible that Frau Hitler poisoned herself voluntarily, just as the mistress of Duce remained standing against the wall at which he was shot.  <span>Clara Petacci,</span> not without reason, believed that she would be killed anyway and, obviously, she consciously chose a quick death.  Eva Brown-Hitler could have the same motives. </p><p>  All this information is unable to give any appeal to the image of the possessed Adolf.  They are important for another reason.  People should not trust politicians who make beautiful speeches and promise unearthly benefits only on the basis of belonging to a chosen nation.  Hell charm does not lead to paradise.  It leads, as it should be, to hell, where there is only horror and death. </p>
