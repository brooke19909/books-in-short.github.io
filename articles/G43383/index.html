Kilometers of beaches consist of sandy beaches, and underwater tourists await the inhabitants of colorful coral reefs.  Tired of relaxing on the coast, you can go to one of the many ski resorts.  The first time visitors to this country are very surprised by the contrast between the high temperature at the foot of the mountain ranges and the cold slopes covered with snow. </p><p>  Few people know that on the shores of this country there are more than 10,000 beaches, so it can be difficult to choose which beach resort in Australia to go on vacation.  It is comforting that all the cities, coasts and roads of the country are in excellent condition. </p><p>  Let's try to figure out where and for what impressions it is better to go to this distant Green continent. </p><h2>  Bright Cairns </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cruisemapper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cairns Coast" class="if uuid-2982560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2982560.jpg"></div><p>  It is a popular tourist destination on the east coast of Cape York Peninsula, attracting visitors from all over the world.  The resort is located on the shores of Trinity Bay, where the tropical jungle meets the blue waters of the Pacific Ocean.  You can swim and bask in the sun here all year round, the average annual temperature is +26 ¬∞ C, and the water in the ocean warms up from +19 ¬∞ C in July to +25 ¬∞ C in February.  However, the most comfortable period for a vacation at this resort in Australia lasts from May to November, when there is no risk of falling under heavy rain during tropical cyclones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Along the entire coast of the city stretches of sandy beaches surrounded by palm groves.  You can sit on the equipped civilized beach, but many guests choose wilder places, away from the hustle and bustle with nature.  The most comfortable, according to traveler reviews, are Ellis Beach and Trinity Beach. </p><h2>  Nature Parks and Waterfalls </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.viatorcom.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dentry National Park" class="if uuid-2982582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2982582.jpg"></div><p>  If the rest on the coast of the resort in Australia seems monotonous, you can go to the Rainforest Nature Reserve, a huge tropical forest with cascades of beautiful waterfalls.  And in the Dentry National Park, whose age is more than 135 million years, there is the highest waterfall in Australia - Wallaman.  The height at which the powerful stream of water continuously falls is 305 meters. </p><p>  Fans of outdoor activities will find the rafting across the turbulent river Talli interesting; the level of some rapids here reaches an extremely difficult one. </p><p>  And just forty kilometers from Cairns, in the Coral Sea, is a real paradise for fans of diving in Australia - the Great Barrier Reef. </p><h2>  Fairytale underwater world </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dive on the Great Barrier Reef" class="if uuid-2982641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2982641.jpg"></div><p>  This extraordinary ecosystem, created by living microorganisms and stretching for 2600 km, consists of individual reefs and islands.  The most interesting part of the Great Barrier Reef, the southern one, where it breaks up into separate sections, is sought by diving enthusiasts from all over the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is unlikely that it will be possible to describe all the wealth of the inhabitants of the underwater world that can be found while diving.  More than 1,500 species of fish live here, and sea turtles come to lay eggs on the southern reef islands. </p><p>  Sometimes divers manage to see a huge whale shark swimming away in the distance, and almost every underwater tourist has a chance to meet a big octopus or lobster.  In addition, all sorts of bright fish live in the reefs, from very tiny butterfly fish to a huge flounder more than two meters long.  Often in the waters of the reef you can find hunting killer whales and whales. </p><p>  Scuba diving enthusiasts need to know that the entire underwater area is a nature reserve and only certain islands are accessible to tourists.  The rest is under strict control, and only scientists can get there.  Before diving, guests are told that they can‚Äôt touch both the coral and the more mobile inhabitants of the depths.  Many underwater inhabitants are deadly poisonous or can cause injury to a careless person. </p><p>  If you do not want to dive into the depths of the ocean, you can admire the beauty of the Great Barrier Reef from the side of a pleasure yacht.  In the hull of such vessels, special observation windows have been made through which you can observe the fantastic underwater life. </p><h2>  Secluded islands </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Large group diving" class="if uuid-2982635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2982635.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, some of the islands of the Great Barrier Reef, such as Heron or Lizard, have some of Australia's most fashionable resorts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The best and most popular places for divers are located near the island of Lizard.  In its water area lies the famous Code Hole, where you can feed huge groupers.  These two-meter fish are accustomed to humans and have become almost tame.  From the island you can swim to the "clam garden" and admire the flocks of bright tropical fish. </p><p>  Or you can just swim in the crystal clear water of the Blue Lagoon that surrounds the island and enjoy the taste of the freshest seafood. </p><h2>  Fans of restless rest </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.adventurequeensland.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Traveling on the island of Freisen" class="if uuid-2982645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2982645.jpg"></div><p>  And for those travelers who do not like to sit in one place, a jeep safari on Fraser Island is suitable.  It is the largest sand island in the world with its unique ecosystem.  The entire west coast is covered with mangrove forests, and the east, facing the ocean - a huge sandy beach with a length of more than 100 kilometers. </p><p>  It is best to travel around the island with an all-wheel drive car, other vehicles will not be able to cope with the lack of roads.  This is due to the fact that sand dunes move around the territory, sometimes closing forests and roads. </p><p>  One of the unique attractions of Fraser Island are fresh lakes located in the depths of its territory.  In some of them, for example, in Lake Wabbi, whose depth is 12 meters, swimming is allowed. </p><p>  One of the few places on the sandy shore where you can safely swim in the ocean is called Champagne Pools.  Here, rocks and reefs form protected niches in which waves lift bubbles of water. </p><p>  Swimming in other places is not recommended for two reasons: sometimes the current forms dangerous whirlpools, and there are no lifeguards on the coast.  And the two largest tiger sharks in the world were also caught near these shores. </p><h2>  City with shining skyscrapers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gold Coast Surfing" class="if uuid-2982650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2982650.jpg"></div><p>  According to travelers who value the comfort and benefits of civilization, it is best to choose the Gold Coast for a vacation in Australia.  It is one of the largest cities in the country and a recognized center of world tourism and shopping. </p><p>  In recent years, the city has become one of the world's most elite resorts, it offers fashionable hotels, shopping centers and chic equipped beaches.  It is amazing that the beach of white sand stretches to the horizon. </p><p>  Not surprisingly, it is in the Gold Coast in Australia that the Surfers Paradise beach is located, considered the best surfing spot in the world.  The ocean does not disappoint, there are always high waves.  When choosing a place for swimming, you need to pay attention to the color of the flags next to the beach: red means that it is better not to go into the water, and yellow means that swimming is not recommended. </p><p>  In addition to beach activities, you can visit the Sea World aquarium and watch shark feeding.  Here, a huge collection of marine inhabitants has been collected, and the aquarium is not in vain considered one of the largest in the world. </p><h2>  Breathtaking Skating </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.snowskool.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Skiing in australia" class="if uuid-2982658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2982658.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the fact that the mainland is always warm due to its proximity to the equator, there is enough snow on the slopes of mountain ranges. </p><p>  Most of Australia's ski resorts are concentrated near the Great Dividing Range in Victoria.  However, one of the most popular resorts, Perisher Blue, is located in the Snowy Mountains (New South Wales). </p><p>  This place is famous for its lifts, there are about fifty of them, and this provides quick access to several mountains at once.  Actually, this is a network of lifts, using which you can ride all day on different slopes of different peaks.  New slopes, new views, new sensations - worth a visit here! </p><p>  The most difficult routes are fenced with a bright grid, the borders of the slopes are marked by noticeable plastic poles.  The resort has many pistes of varying difficulty, experienced skiers can even go down the night track.  And for children and beginners there are special theme parks in which you can practice. </p><h2>  Famous falls creek </h2><div class="photo" data-original="travelrightway.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fall Creek Resort" class="if uuid-2982666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2982666.jpg"></div><p>  The mountainous part of Australia differs from the same areas on the northern continents by the absence of conifers.  Here, only evergreen snow eucalyptus grows, among the curved trunks of which skiers sweep. </p><p>  The maximum height of the mountains does not exceed 1800 meters, and the base village is located at an altitude of 1600 meters.  From here 15 lifts deliver guests to numerous slopes.  Of the 92 slopes, about a third belong to the category of difficult routes, and a dozen tracks are suitable for inexperienced skiers. </p><p>  In the ski season (from June to September) it is always crowded, the town accommodates 5,000 visitors, and it is better to reserve campsites in advance.  And when summer comes in Australia (the period from November to April), guests are much less.  So, lower prices for equipment rental and more free tracks. </p><p>  The advantage of the resort can be considered high quality snow cover and excellent service.  At the rental point, equipment will not only help you determine the size, but they will also definitely specify which skis are needed: for simple driving on the highway, extreme or jumping.  A large number of warm cafes with excellent menus will help to return the energy spent. </p><h2>  Travel Tips &amp; Reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Road signs in australia" class="if uuid-2982765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2982765.jpg"></div><p>  Holidays in the resorts of Australia - quite a costly pleasure.  Despite this, the majority of tourists vacationing in this country are enthusiastic about the beauty of nature and the level of service.  However, when visiting Australia, you need to follow simple safety rules. </p><p>  You should not go into the water in places indicated by red flags. </p><p>  In this country it is unusually hot, so you need to protect yourself from the sun as much as possible.  It is imperative to use a protective cream with a high level of skin protection and wear a hat and clothing made from natural fabrics. </p><p>  No matter how you want it, you should not go barefoot here: in Australia there are really poisonous snakes and spiders.  And because of sharks and crocodiles, you can not enter the water in unverified places. </p><p>  There are large distances between settlements, it is better to travel with a rented car.  Australia has very good roads and many campsites where you can relax.  Just need to look carefully so that the kangaroo does not jump on the road! </p>
