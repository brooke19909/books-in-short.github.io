  <section class="page js-page"><h1>October Square of Yekaterinburg. From the Exile Sloboda to Yekaterinburg City</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Oktyabrskaya <span>Square in Yekaterinburg,</span> which can rightfully be called the embankment, is a favorite place for youth to spend time.  The spacious territory allows extreme sportsmen to gather here.  Rollers, skateboards and bicycles are the favorite means of transportation along the city pond.  But the area is interesting for both less-speed citizens and for city guests. </p><h2>  The exile settlement </h2><p>  That is what this place was once called.  Outskirts, where people settled, who came to work in the Ural factories.  Maybe they were immigrants, and possibly convicts.  Factories needed any workforce. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.8426219" data-lng="60.59446209999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/6/6/7/11667.png"></div><p>  Yekaterinburg developed rapidly, and soon, already at the beginning of the 19th century, the Exiled settlement became not the outskirts, but the center of the city.  The area was already considered prestigious, wealthy merchants and industrialists now settled here.  Constructed shops and benches, opened various workshops. </p><p>  After the revolution, this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city gradually fell into decay.  In the once rich houses, in communal apartments, the townspeople lived, the housing stock deteriorated.  Construction sites bypassed the exile settlement.  Only the names of local streets have changed.  They sounded proud and modern: the October Revolution Street, the February Revolution Street, the embankment of Workers' Youth. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  October Square in Yekaterinburg </h2><p>  In the early 1970s, a draft of the new square of the city was developed.  According to the architects, she had to carry a cultural and administrative burden.  It was decided to place a complex of structures on the shore of the pond, for which it was necessary to demolish the dilapidated housing stock.  The model prepared for the demonstration of the complex displays the building of the Regional Committee of the CPSU, the Drama Theater, and a well-equipped embankment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.svrpk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Government House" class="if uuid-2961318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2961318.jpg"></div><p>  Today, all structures take their places not on project documentation, but on October Square in Yekaterinburg. </p><h2>  Famous objects </h2><p>  In Yekaterinburg, on Oktyabrskaya Square, 1 stands the famous 26-story building.  During the construction period, it was the tallest building in the city.  The administrative building of the regional party committee was erected.  Now it is the House of Government and Legislature of the Sverdlovsk Region.  The high-rise building, which the townspeople call the ‚Äúwisdom tooth,‚Äù adorns the modern city and defines the boundary of the square. </p><p>  The building of the Sverdlovsk Drama Theater balances the composition of the square.  It appeared only twenty years later, but harmoniously blended into the surrounding landscape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rutraveller.ru" data-author=": , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drama theatre" class="if uuid-2961287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2961287.jpg"></div><p>  A typical design was taken as the basis, but the architects finalized it taking into account local requirements.  Very quickly, the townspeople accepted the fact that the drama theater is located in the same place as the October Square in Yekaterinburg, and gave it a second name - Theater. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the 80s of the last century, a square was set up here.  The dominant was the fountain "Shar" - the work of V. Loskutov.  They completed construction in the late eighties, and he immediately revived the entire territory of the square and the embankment.  The work was awarded the prize of G.V. de Gennin, the founder of Yekaterinburg.  The fountain is a round platform - a bowl located in the recess.  In its center is a ball, to which wide steps descend.  The design as a whole is a bit like an arena.  A ball is the Earth washed by clean jets of water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rutraveller.ru" data-author=": , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fountain &quot;Ball&quot;" class="if uuid-2961288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2961288.jpg"></div><p>  Not surprisingly, the square has become the most visited holiday destination.  Here, sports enthusiasts, theater-goers, and those who want to sit by the cool water, and children jumping at the fountain find classes for themselves. </p><h2>  Yekaterinburg City.  The future of the city </h2><p>  The development of the exile settlement continues at the present time.  In the process of transforming Oktyabrskaya Square in Yekaterinburg, a design of the business center of the city was developed.  It is being built at the site of the demolition of the remaining dilapidated houses.  It will consist of five skyscrapers, the construction of one of them is being completed.  The good news is that with such grandiose plans, the architects managed to preserve several historical monuments of the Exiled Settlement. </p>
