Our compatriots became interested in this country not so long ago, but the enthusiastic reviews of tourists left after the trip become a kind of advertising that pushes other people to such a trip.  Many of our compatriots from buying a tour to Vietnam are deterred by the fact that it is quite difficult to find reliable information about hotels and its resorts.  Travel catalogs present holidays in this country as paradise, but experienced travelers try to find real reviews about holidays in any Vietnamese resort on the Internet. </p><p>  If you plan, despite everything, to go to this amazing Asian country, then we suggest you stay at Ocean Pearl Hotel 4 *.  Reviews about the hotel are few in number, because tourists from Europe and China mainly relax in it, however, our compatriots have already managed to love it.  In our article, we tried to collect the most relevant information about this hotel complex, which will help you decide on the choice of a tourist permit. </p>

    <h2>  Ocean Pearl Hotel 4 *: hotel description </h2><p>  The hotel complex, which we are talking about today, is considered one of the newest.  However, this distinguishes most of the hotels in Vietnam.  The fact is that tourism began to develop in this country not so long ago and provoked numerous construction projects.  Until now, tourists have come across resorts at the fact that the noise of construction vehicles is constantly heard around their brand-new hotels, and even at night, the sounds of work reach some rooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ocean Pearl Hotel 4 * is two nine-story buildings located opposite each other.  It is worth noting that the architects tried to make the hotel as interesting as possible by placing a large swimming pool with a relaxation area between the blocks.  It is separated from prying eyes by a wall, so no one will stop tourists from enjoying the gentle sun. </p><p>  Looking at the photos of Ocean Pearl Hotel 4 *, which are in large numbers posted on the Internet, we can conclude that the territory of the hotel complex is quite small.  But every corner of it looks well-groomed and pleases the eye with fresh greenery. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the Ocean Pearl Hotel 4 * does not position itself as a hotel complex, designed for families with children.  There are quite a lot of youth and couples of any age.  But still, our compatriots, at their own peril and risk, go to this hotel with the kids.  Later, they share their experience with other tourists, considering it more positive.  Therefore, we can recommend this complex for a family with a child. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  All tourist catalogs indicate that on the largest island of Vietnam is a four-star Ocean Pearl Hotel 4 *.  Phu Quoc is considered the center of the country's tourist life; new hotel complexes and various entertainment venues are being actively built here.  In the near future, most tourists from all over the world will come here. </p><p>  The direct location of Ocean Pearl Hotel 4 * is the town of Duong Dong.  At the same time, the hotel is in a very convenient place for tourists, from where it is quite easy to get to the main attractions of the island. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For example, Coco Bar, the most visited by guests, is located only five hundred meters from the hotel complex.  Those who want to get to know the life and culture of the local population closer can visit the Dean Kau night market.  Tourists reach him on foot in about ten minutes. </p><p>  Another popular tourist destination is the Kau Temple.  It is separated from Ocean Pearl Hotel 4 * by a distance of seven hundred meters. </p><p>  Our compatriots, who have already visited the resorts of Vietnam more than once, include the road from the international airport to the resort to the significant disadvantages of such a holiday.  Usually it takes at least three hours, in the case when tourists have taken care of an individual transfer, the time can be reduced to one and a half to two hours. </p><p>  Those flying to Phu Quoc will not have to spend long hours in transport.  Indeed, from the international airport to the Ocean Pearl Hotel 4 * (Phu Quoc) can be reached in just ten minutes. </p>

    <h2>  Territory and infrastructure </h2><p>  The territory of Ocean Pearl Hotel 4 * (Phu Quoc) is not too big.  By the standards of city hotels, it looks quite worthy, but those who are used to the vast territories of Turkish hotel complexes may be disappointed with the compactness of everything that surrounds them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main place where almost all the guests gather is the pool.  It is a rectangular bowl, hidden from prying eyes by a white and blue fence.  Around the pool, sun loungers and umbrellas are installed, between them groups of installations made of stones and green spaces are installed.  All this turns the hotel into a picturesque garden where you can spend your free time. </p><p>  There is one restaurant, a bar and a conference room for guests, where you can absolutely free copy the necessary documents or send a fax. </p><p>  In one of the residential buildings is a spa.  It offers hotel guests a fairly wide range of services.  In reviews of Ocean Pearl Hotel 4 * you can find information about wellness treatments, beauty programs and sauna access.  Some of these services are included in the price, while others are paid separately.  The price list is available at the entrance to the spa. </p><p>  Reception is open 24 hours a day.  However, the staff practically does not speak Russian.  Therefore, to resolve all issues with the hotel staff will have in English.  And be prepared for the fact that even English sounds a little peculiar in Vietnam, which can cause certain difficulties in understanding each other. </p><p>  At the reception there is a luggage storage room and a currency exchange office.  Most often, our compatriots on vacation prefer to change money exactly on the territory of hotels.  Many avoid communication in an unfamiliar language with bank employees. </p>

    <h2>  Room characteristics </h2><p>  We already wrote that the hotel complex was built not so long ago - only two years ago.  Therefore, you don‚Äôt have to worry about a battered room with old furniture. </p><p>  The hotel has a total of one hundred and sixty-nine rooms.  They are divided into various categories, this allows any of the guests to choose the most suitable apartments for themselves.  We give a brief description of all the rooms available in the hotel complex: </p><ul><li>  Double deluxe.  This apartment is for couples and has one large bed.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room is thirty-two square meters.  The room is equipped with air conditioning, safe, TV and minibar.  Every day it replenishes the supply of drinking water.  The bathroom has a spa bath, along with towels, a hairdryer, toothbrushes and toiletries. </li><li>  Superior double room.  Room size does not exceed twenty-four squares, so it can accommodate only two people.  The apartment can have one or two beds.  The room equipment is identical to the previous description, however, in this embodiment there is no spa bath. </li><li>  Double deluxe.  This number is fully consistent with the first option on our list, an additional bonus is the transfer from and to the airport included in the price. </li><li>  Double Suite.  The apartments have an area of ‚Äã‚Äãthirty-six squares, which provides for the placement of two people in one bed.  Room facilities are standard.  A bonus is a free shuttle service. </li><li>  Family Junior Suite.  Room size is thirty-six square meters.  The apartments have a separate living area.  The sofa installed here can serve as an extra bed.  The room has everything you need, including a spa bath. </li></ul><p>  It is noteworthy that almost all apartments are designed for two people.  Therefore, in some rooms the three of us will be quite crowded. </p>

Of the dishes included in the buffet concept, you can always choose something for yourself.  In the reviews, tourists write that, despite the small variety of dishes on offer, they are all very tasty and clearly prepared from fresh products. </p><p>  Around the hotel there are many cafes and restaurants where hotel guests have lunch and dinner. </p>

    <h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  I would like to say that traveling to Vietnam and staying in a four-star hotel cannot be a cheap pleasure.  So get ready to pay a significant amount of money for the tour. </p><p>  For example, two weeks in this hotel with a flight and breakfast will cost two travelers two hundred and fifty thousand rubles.  A similar tour, but for a week will cost a little more than one hundred thousand rubles. </p><p>  Some tourists prefer to travel on their own.  Therefore, separately book air tickets and rooms.  The cost of living in superior apartments starts from three thousand rubles per day, the maximum price for a room ranges from fifteen thousand rubles. </p>
