  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Novoulyanovsk, sanatorium "Volga open spaces"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As after a long illness, the country slowly returns to normal.  It seems that everything is already destroyed, everything is destroyed.  Only through the efforts of some enthusiasts was it possible to maintain the centers of social support for the population.  Especially for the most needy - the elderly.  The market is interested in serving young, able to pay well.  Those who survived the collapse of a great country remember well - not everything is measured in rubles. </p><h2>  Sanatorium "Volga open spaces" </h2><p>  There was a time when each large enterprise had a sanatorium or a rest house for its employees.  People could relax for free, improve their health.  Ulyanovsk cement plant on the banks of the Volga in Novoulyanovsk had its own <span>recreation center.</span>  The factory worked, produced high-quality cement, enterprises were built around.  Workers could rest at their base.  The new owners felt that they did not need a social program.  The plant should not just produce products, but bring them profit.  All <span>non-core assets</span> were transferred to the balance of impoverished municipalities.  The sanatorium, successfully working for more than 10 years, began to die.  He stood for 5 years without a rest.  Only thanks to the governor of the region and the persistence of the veterans, the enterprise was revived.  The center for the rehabilitation of veterans ‚ÄúVolga open spaces‚Äù was born. </p><h2>  Sanatorium Services </h2><p>  Today, 85 people can relax here daily, improve their health.  There are 16 more places for a day hospital.  With the support of the region‚Äôs government, a successful enterprise is operating that provides sanatorium-resort treatment of elderly citizens - the Volga open spaces. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.neizvestniy-geniy.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.neizvestniy-geniy.ru/cat/photo/peyzaj/1221036.html?time=1406216018"><img itemprop="image" alt="Silver Vacation Festival" class="if uuid-2506212" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2506212.jpg"></div><p>  Novoulyanovsk turned out to be a happy exception against the backdrop of general devastation.  Today, for a moderate fee, older people can get excellent medical services using the most modern domestic and foreign equipment.  There is a swimming pool, gym.  The specialists of the Volzhsky Prostory sanatorium provide qualified medical assistance and conduct rehabilitation measures of a psychological and social nature.  Organized high-quality food, including diet, good care for the disabled and older people. </p><h2>  Silver Holidays </h2><p>  Maybe the Ulyanovsk region has not learned how to build ceremonial facades over the years of timelessness, but managed to maintain good relations between people.  Since 2016, the Silver Vacations program has been successfully operating in the region.  When students begin to study, children's camps openly open their doors to the elderly.  Thousands of pensioners can relax in the camps and sanatoriums of Ulyanovsk, Novoulyanovsk, and the districts of the region - Cherkalsky, Veshkaysky, Melekessky. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ogauso-volprostory.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://ogauso-volprostory.ru/front/news/11651"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sports Winners" class="if uuid-2506209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2506209.jpg"></div><p>  The sanatorium ‚ÄúVolga open spaces‚Äù, as part of the program in the winter of 2018, also received project participants.  For three days, the festival participants actively communicated, met with leading medical specialists, mastered the technique of stretching, self-massage, a master class was held especially for participants in the volunteer movement, including in connection with major international events on the orientation system.  Volga Open spaces invited experts and festival participants to share their experiences, what problems a volunteer should solve, how to see who needs their help. </p><h2>  "Librarynight" </h2><p>  The program of stay in the sanatorium "Volga open spaces" is always full of activities.  Vacationers are not left alone, experts are doing everything possible to ensure that an elderly person spends time actively, receives a charge of health.  Given the age of residents, active events are replaced by calmer ones.  For many, they will remember participating in the annual All-Russian festival ‚ÄúBiblionoch‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="orient21.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://orient21.ru/photo/2010/08_11_ijulja_quot_volzhskie_prostory_quot/19"><img itemprop="image" alt="Creative meeting" class="if uuid-2506213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2506213.jpg"></div><p>  In 2018, the festival was held under the slogan ‚ÄúBook Magic‚Äù.  Vacationers with great pleasure attended creative evenings, took an active part in all events. </p><p>  Despite all the difficulties, the rehabilitation center continues to live and work actively. </p>
