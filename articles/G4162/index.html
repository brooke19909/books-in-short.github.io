Therefore, three stylish “A” series models released in 2015 aroused great interest.  In addition to one common feature - the aluminum case, they all differed both in the size of the display and in the technical characteristics. </p><p>  For example, the <span>Galaxy A7</span> was the flagship model with a 5.5-inch screen.  The Galaxy A5 has average performance and a five-inch display.  This time we will focus on the youngest model.  So what is a <span>Samsung Galaxy A3</span> SM A300F smartphone?  An overview of the main parameters and features of the device is given in the article. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The Galaxy A3 smartphone comes in a blue cardboard box with a capital “A” in the center.  The packaging is not very informative, but the main characteristics and features of the device can be read on its basis. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Having a look at the <span>Samsung Galaxy A3</span> SM A300F, the review should begin with its external data.  This is a rectangular metal case of the device.  Its back wall and side faces are completely made of aluminum.  True, it is painted, but this was done for the sake of a variety of color solutions for the Samsung Galaxy A3 SM a300f smartphone (Gold, Black and White).  The device is thin, hence its low weight, only 110 grams.  The aluminum case is comfortable for one hand and seems sturdy and reliable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The display part of the phone is fully protected by a special glass.  Above is the front module, speaker, proximity and lighting sensors, as well as the logo of the South Korean company.  Under the screen are standard controls in the form of touch keys.  The volume control button is located on the left side, and on the right is the device’s start button and SIM card slots.  Moreover, the upper slot can be left for a memory card. </p>

And at the top there is an additional microphone.  On the rear panel you can see the camera at 8 megapixels, an LED flash to the left of it, and a speaker to the right.  Under them is the same logo.

    <h2>  <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> A3 SM A300F Smartphone: Screen Capability Overview </h2><p>  The smartphone is decorated with a 4.5-inch display, created using the same Super Amoled technology.  Its resolution is 960 × 540 pixels (245 ppi).  Of course, if you use the device mainly for making calls, writing messages and the Internet, then this permission is more than enough.  But for advanced users this seems a little. </p><p>  But, despite the low pixel density, everything is in order with color reproduction and brightness.  Moreover, the brightness parameter has as many as 4 modes: “Adaptive display”, “Main”, “Photo Amoled” and “Movie Amoled”.  The first mode is very convenient, because it does an analysis of the level of lighting around and automatically adjusts the brightness. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The display instantly responds to touch, but recognizes no more than five touches at a time.  According to reviews, there are no complaints about the viewing angles, and information in the sun is read without problems. </p><h2>  <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> A3 SM A300F Smartphone: Features </h2><p>  The smartphone is launched by the quad-core Snapdragon 401 series processor. The Andreno 306 video chip is also used along with 1 GB of RAM.  So you do not need to expect very high performance from him.  Rather, it is at an average level, but it provides a longer period of work without recharging. </p>

But from the beginning of sales, many users have already managed to review their Samsung Galaxy A3 SM A300F.  Their reviews claim that some resource-intensive applications still work unstably.  Like it or not, 1 GB of RAM is not enough right now.

    <p>  The smartphone’s internal memory is only 16 GB, however, only 12 GB will be available to the user.  Fortunately, those who wish using the memory card will be able to increase it to 64 GB.  But for this you have to sacrifice one SIM card.  Quite an unusual decision was made by the developers.  It seems that it is typical only for models in this series. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Camera features </h2><p>  Continuing the review on the Samsung Galaxy A3 SM A300F (Black), it is worth mentioning the main camera of 8 megapixels, which makes good enough pictures.  This application provides a wide range of settings and preset modes.  For example, auto-contrast allows you to achieve the best quality pictures in bright light.  There are other modes, such as smile recognition, portrait panorama, night mode, twilight, against the light, text, etc. The additional camera (5 megapixels) is deprived of autofocus, but it also does good pictures. </p>

As for the quality of the video, it is very acceptable for amateur shooting.

    <h2>  Menu </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy A3 SM A300F (white) smartphone, which is currently being reviewed, is running Android 4.4.4, but nothing prevents it from being updated “over the air” later.  By the way, there is an interesting feature due to which the speed of loading content increases.  So he is able to do this simultaneously via wi-fi and 4G, splitting files into several packages. </p><p>  This device has several differences in functionality and interface from the Samsung A5 model.  For example, there is no mode for working in several windows, an application that measures the physical activity of the user - S Health, Dropbox service, children's mode, and behind the curtain you can not even look for quick launch icons.  Also, the device lacks a heart rate sensor and <span>a fingerprint scanner.</span>  In general, the software suite is significantly reduced here.  Although, Internet Security, AWAD and ANEWS are still there. </p>

But this is not something new to call, all this was implemented back in the Galaxy S4.

    <h2>  Phone features </h2><p>  In this part, we will talk about the "Phone Book", "Messages" and "Contacts".  For convenience, their shortcuts are located at the bottom of the main desktop.  If you go to the People tab, you can view information about specific subscribers.  Each entry can include several fields: phone number, last name, first name, email address, etc. To find the desired number, you can use the search bar or the alphabetical field on the right side of the phone book. </p><p>  During a call, the screen displays the photo, phone number and name of the caller.  Messages are in the public folder, but if you select a name in the phone book, you can read the correspondence specifically with a particular subscriber. </p><h2>  Multimedia features </h2><p>  What else to say about the Samsung Galaxy A3 SM A300F smartphone?  A review of multimedia features will answer this question.  The Music application, as usual, launches a player that is designed to play tracks and videos.  All major formats are supported: mp3, aac, aac +, amr, etc. All multimedia files are sorted by artist, genre and composer. </p>

    <h2>  Duration of work </h2><p>  For some reason, the Samsung Galaxy A3 smartphone got a 1900 mAh battery.  Knowing this, at first you expect that he will soon be discharged.  In fact, he showed himself to be no worse than devices with a more capacious battery.  The fact is that due to the increased technical process (28 nm), the processor power is less.  Hence the increased operating time without recharging.  In general, with an average load of 4 hours of talk, 2 hours of listening to music and 3 hours of Internet, it’s enough for about 18 hours of work. </p><p>  In addition, there is an energy-saving function, when activated, gray colors are turned on, due to which the screen practically does not consume energy.  Maximum mode reduces energy consumption by 80%.  Thus, in standby mode, the smartphone can last 2-3 days. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  What about the Samsung Galaxy A3 SM A300F?  The review showed that you should not expect miracles from this device.  Its advantages include a metal case, good looks, a bright display, a good camera and a hardy battery.  But there are also disadvantages that slightly overshadow the above advantages.  These include a small screen resolution, a simplified interface and a memory card missing a personal slot.  In addition, the device for such characteristics is quite expensive (13,000 rubles). </p>
