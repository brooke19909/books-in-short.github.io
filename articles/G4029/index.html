    <h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  For a long time there was an opinion that Iset got its name from the Issedon tribe that once inhabited the banks of this river.  There is, however, another version.  According to scientists, ‚ÄúIssedon‚Äù is the Iset River itself, and not the nationality.  In the Scythian language, "Isse" means "river." </p><h2>  Islands and settlements located along the shores of the lake </h2><p>  There are several small islands: Kamenny (formerly called the Ship), Krasnenky (formerly called <span>Monomakh‚Äôs Cap</span> for its shape <span>),</span> Solovetsky.  The following settlements are located on the shores of this lake: the city of Sredneuralsk, the villages of Murzinka (here, by the way, there is a <span>statue of Liberty)</span> and Koptyaki, the village of Iset.  Surrounded by mountains, Lake Isetskoye is waiting for its guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  This lake is very rich in fish.  It contains perch, bream, mackerel, pike, pike perch, ruff, tench.  Fish species such as <span>specular carp</span> and <span>grass</span> <span>carp are</span> also acclimatized <span>.</span>  Unfortunately, locals catch them with nets, so even zander and small perch are a desirable prey in many places. </p>

    <h2>  Dam and ancient sites </h2><p>  In 1850, construction began on an earthen dam at the source of Iset.  It was replaced with concrete only in 1946.  Due to this, the level of the lake has risen, reaching modern.  Sredneuralskaya GRES uses this water. </p><p>  Archaeologists along the banks of the rivers have found more than a dozen different sites of ancient people.  They date from the Neolithic to the <span>Iron Age.</span>  Ancient ocher paintings were discovered on one of the islands.  However, they were flooded with rising water levels in the lake. </p><h2>  <span>Holiday</span> Village Iset and the Solovetsky Islands </h2><p>  You are probably interested not only in terms of fishing and archeology, Lake Isetskoye.  Can I swim here?  The answer is yes.  A good place for this is the sandy cape Tolstik located on the west bank.  The Iset recreation center is located here.  Opposite it, in the center of the lake, are the <span>Solovetsky Islands</span> covered with a rare shrub and pine forest <span>.</span>  They were named so because in past centuries (the 18th and 19th centuries) a monastery was located here, in which the Old Believer monks lived.  Nothing is left of him today. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  If you plan to stay for a while while exploring Lake Iset, you can use the services of this recreation center.  Here there are cozy, warm buildings, as well as a sauna with a swimming pool, a dining room with 100 seats, a conference room with 50 seats.  You can also spend the night in Sredneuralsk, in a hotel located at: st.  Isetskaya, d. 6. </p><h2>  Wild holiday </h2><p>  You can still find places around this lake where you can drive close to the shore by car.  However, they are becoming less and less every year.  The administration of the villages, as well as local wealthy residents contribute to this.  In the village of Koptyaki, for example, they even blocked the entrance to the cemetery, which is located practically on the coast, with a barrier.  Many motorists used to go ashore on the way to it.  Local residents simply dig up some water entrances. </p><h2>  Sredneuralsky city beach </h2><p>  Those who are not interested in wild vacations can enjoy the equipped beach of Iset Lake.  Sredneuralsk is where you should go.  A popular vacation spot for residents of this city itself, as well as Verkhnyaya Pyshma and Yekaterinburg is the city beach.  This is a great place for lovers of cultural activities.  There are several cafes and piers, and not just a bare beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Lake Isetskoye in this place is very picturesque, you will surely enjoy your vacation.  Note that in the summer parking is paid. </p><h2>  Krasnenky Island </h2><p>  What else can Lake Isetskoye offer, a photo of which is presented in this article?  In the southern part of it, opposite the source of Iset and the dam, there is a loaf-like island called Krasnenky.  Its northern part ends abruptly towards the water.  It abounds with rock outcrops from granite.  Boulders ranging in size from 0.5 to 2 meters are strewn with the entire northern slope. </p><p>  Larch, birch and pine trees grow on the island.  The flatter is the south side.  There was once a beautiful birch grove, in the shade of which it was nice to relax.  However, since the early 1970s, vacationers began to harass her for firewood.  On the island now there are only a few pine trees, besides only on the rocks of the northern part, where it is difficult to get.  A valuable archaeological site is Krasnenky Island. </p>

    <p>  Here were discovered the remains of the <span>dwellings of ancient people.</span>  In the local museum of local lore of Iset (school number 7) there is a collection of clay shards and silicon arrowheads, which was collected by students. </p><h2>  Mount Tolstik </h2><p>  Where else can I go while exploring Iset Lake?  On the west bank of it, behind the village of Iset (its northeastern outskirts), there is a hill.  This is Mount Tolstik.  It got its name, apparently, from the word "fat man". </p><p>  The mountain rises in a large rampart over the Isetu River, forming a number of peaks, between which there are saddles.  The hill rises into Iset lake, forming here Cape Tolstik.  Since 1909, the southern part of the mountain has been developed by Iset granite quarry for crushed stone.  She has almost disappeared by now.  The same fate awaits in the future the middle peak.  In the 1970s, on the eastern shore of this cape, local schoolchildren and A. G. Peshkov, who led the campaign, found a ‚Äúleopard skin‚Äù - a new kind of granite.  A stone tent of this material, whose height is about 4 meters, is located on the top of the mountain.  It extends 30 meters from west to east.  The tent is more steep on the north side and flat - on the south. </p><h2>  Ship Island </h2><p>  At Cape Lipovoy, in the north-eastern part of this lake, Kamenny Island is located, whose height is 4-5 meters.  It was called the Ship before, because it resembled a medieval sailing ship with its outlines.  During the construction of the Sredneuralskaya GRES, in 1934, this island had to be blown up.  Today, only stone ruins are left of him, not at all like a ship.  However, thanks to the watercolors of Sheremetevsky, a teacher of the men's gymnasium in Yekaterinburg, the memory of how the island originally looked, still remained.  This picture was created at the request of Claire Onisy Egorovich, who worked at that time in the same gymnasium.  Sheremetevsky wrote it in 1908.  Modest Onisimovich, son of Onisy Egorovich, brought a copy of the painting in 1919 to the museum of the Middle Ural School No. 5, where it is located today. </p>

    <p>  On the island of the Ship in the years 1878-1879 were discovered by archaeologist M. Malakhov rock paintings of primitive people, painted in red.  A brief description of them was made in 1890 by N. A. Ryzhikov, a member of the Wole.  In 1914, sketches were made by V. Ya. Tolmachev.  This scribble can be attributed to the III millennium BC.  e.  V.N. Chernetsov, who published the drawings, noted the presence of several bird figures on them. </p><h2>  Mount Petragrom </h2><p>  4 km north of the village of Iset is Mount Petragrom.  It received its historical name in honor of the trustee of metallurgists, Peter the Thunderer.  According to the excavation results, even in the 2nd half of the 1st millennium, ancient people smelted copper in these places.  Masters of antiquity erected a real mining and metallurgical complex.  Mined ore was delivered to the rocks.  A mixture was prepared (a special mixture of crushed ore with animal bones and charcoal), and then placed in a melting furnace.  After this, the melting of the metal began, then it was poured into molds and then objects were processed (jewelry, spears, arrows, tips, etc.).  The metal products made here spread over vast territories - from the Yenisei to the borders of Norway. </p>

    <p>  Rocks are located on top of this mountain.  These are two-sided ridges, which are stretched in the direction from east to west.  The first begins with a rock, whose height is about 10 meters.  Then 2 other rocks follow, expanding upwards (height about 20 m) and reminiscent of giants in caps.  Admiring these curved columns, recesses and cracks, one involuntarily wonders how nature could create such a beautiful masterpiece from granite.  Then follows a rock about 30 meters high.  It is sheer on the north side, and more gentle on the south side.  This rock has many bizarre excavations, as well as small columns.  Spacious distances open from its top.  Maly Petrahrom Mountain can be seen in the south, Half Day in the west, Sagra Tolstik and the village of Sagra located at its foot in the north.  Further, the height of the rocks decreases, amounting to 3-4 meters.  They extend to the west for another 20 meters, and then break off. </p><h2>  Dam and Sogrinsky mine </h2><p>  A dam is a place where a river flows from Lake Isetsky. </p><p>  According to the data available today, ore was brought to Mount Petragrom from the Sogrinsky mine, known since ancient times.  It is located in the headwaters of the Sogra and Medyanka rivers (in their interfluves).  Sogrinsky mine is rich in iron and copper ores.  In a straight line from it to Mount Petragrom is only 9 km.  Sogrinsk mine today consists of several mines.  One of them, the deepest and largest, is flooded.  A small lake formed in its place.  Another, the depth of which reaches 7 meters, exists today.  You can go down into it.  Its trunk is fixed with wooden larch made of larch.  Logs are fastened with wrought nails.  Many ditches and pits complement the picture of this mine, and dump waste can also be seen here.  The remains of hearths and smelters are found throughout the territory.  Archaeologists have found here and piles of used ore, and metallurgical slag. </p>
