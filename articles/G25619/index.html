    <p>  The undoubted advantages of this hotel tourists include its proximity to the sea.

    <p>  The television in the hotel is satellite.  Guests are required to pay a fee for using the safe.  Of course, shower rooms are equipped in all rooms of this hotel.  Towels in the bathroom residents can use for free.  This hotel has earned good reviews from vacationers for the availability of spacious balconies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The ability to rent low-cost housing - that's why, among other things, vacation in Spain is very popular.  The prices for renting rooms in local hotels are about the same as in Goa and in Thailand.  For 100 thousand p.  You can rent a good double room for 10 days.  The Hovima Santa Maria hotel is no exception in this regard.  Rooms for rent here, depending on the category, can cost about 93-120 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Hovima Santa Maria Aparthotel: reviews of tourists about the housing stock </h2><p>  Opinion about the rooms of the hotel Hovima Santa Maria was very good.  Most vacationers find them comfortable, clean and tidy.  Clean the maids carefully.  The only thing - hotel employees do not wash the dishes in the rooms.  The residents themselves must do this.  Many tourists advise vacationers who have rented rooms in this hotel to bring a dishwashing sponge from home.  It is unlikely to find such an accessory in Costa Adeje stores. </p>

    <p>  Among the pluses of the complex, vacationers, among other things, include the presence of as many as three Russian TV channels.  But the televisions in most rooms of this hotel are, unfortunately, installed in the kitchen.  Therefore, it is unlikely that the guests will be able to watch the programs in the evening before going to bed, lying on the bed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Many residents of the complex believe that air conditioning is available only in expensive rooms as some of the hotel‚Äôs drawbacks.  The rooms are standard and economy equipped with fans.  The latter do not save from heat too well. </p><h2>  Facilities on site </h2><p>  The infrastructure in the hotel Hovima Santa Maria 3 *, according to most of its former guests, is developed relatively well.  On the territory of the complex, its residents can use: </p><ul><li><p>  free parking; </p></li><li><p>  currency exchange office; </p></li><li><p>  hairdresser. </p></li></ul><p>  This hotel also has its own laundry room.

However, unfortunately, the Wi-Fi at this hotel is pretty slow. </p><p>  If necessary, business people can send faxes from the hotel.  The hotel also has a large conference room.  Works in the complex and a shop. </p>

    <p>  Of course, guests of the hotel and in the pool can swim.  Spain in March, June, September - a vacation spot suitable just perfect.  The weather on Tenerife is excellent these months.  The pool at the hotel is outdoor.  And therefore, it only works during the holiday season.  In winter, water is drained from it. </p><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  As already mentioned, many tourists come to the Hovima Santa Maria Aparthotel 3 * with children.  For small guests there are many amenities.  For children, the hotel has a games room and a playground.  Also in the hotel there are as many as two paddling pools.  Parents, if necessary, can leave the child for a while with the nanny.  This service is paid separately. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Hovima Santa Maria Aparthotel 3 * has earned good reviews from guests not only because you can relax in well-equipped rooms here.  Provided for residents of this hotel and all kinds of entertainment.  For example, in the evening, vacationers can go to a disco, a fashion show or visit a colorful performance.  The hotel also has its own TV room.  For children, animations are periodically arranged at the hotel. </p><h2>  Infrastructure Reviews </h2><p>  The service provided to guests at the Hovima Santa Maria Aparthotel is considered by many tourists to be quite worthy.  Hotel staff praises most of its former guests.  The hotel staff is speaking, unfortunately, only in English.  However, one girl - the administrator Natasha - still understands the Russian language.  In any case, all the problems arising from the residents of the hotel staff are trying to solve quickly. </p><p>  The hotel pool is, of course, not visited by many guests.  After all, the Atlantic Ocean is within walking distance of the hotel.  A swimming pool becomes popular only when there is strong sea excitement.  Swimming in it, according to most residents of the complex, is quite convenient.  Free sunbeds near the pool are always available. </p><p>  The courtyard of the hotel, most of the guests considers quite beautiful.  The kindergarten is really there, but very small.  In fact, this is just a designer planting of several trees and flower beds.  Many tourists consider a certain drawback of the hotel to be the presence of huge cockroaches on its territory (which live mainly in this kindergarten).  Sometimes these unpleasant insects crawl even into the rooms. </p>

The food at the hotel, according to the residents, is not bad.  The portions at the local restaurant are always large.  So guests are never hungry.  Regarding the variety of menus, the hotel restaurant also earned good reviews from tourists.  The cooks of the restaurant are quite tasty.  The only thing - some former residents of the hotel complain that the dishes in the local restaurant are served cold. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  The Hovima Santa Maria Aparthotel 3 * is located on the first coastline.  To get to the sea, its guests can literally 10 minutes.  Unfortunately, this complex does not have a private beach.  Therefore, its tenants visit the public.  You can lie for free on your bedding on this beach.  For the use of showers, toilets and sun loungers, a small amount is charged. </p><p>  Some hotel guests also visit the beach in Los Gigantes with black sand.  It is located quite far from the hotel.  You need to go here by car for about 30 minutes. There is also a very beautiful Playa del Duc beach in a 15-minute walk from the complex.  The coastline here is unusually picturesque.  The color of the water in the sea, according to many tourists, is simply indescribable. </p><h2>  What is next to the hotel </h2><p>  Well-developed tourist infrastructure - this is certainly something for which a vacation in Spain is also valued.  Prices for goods and products on the island of Tenerife are relatively low.  In the immediate vicinity of the hotel there are many cafes and shops.
