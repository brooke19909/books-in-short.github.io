This happened with the geodetic term "reference point".  According to the definition, a geodetic benchmark is a mark or sign fixed at a specific point on the earth's surface.  The coordinates and height of this place are calculated by leveling with respect to a known and generally accepted value. </p><h2>  Level Height Systems </h2>

All the geodetic signs indicated on the maps of these countries are calculated according to the Baltic system of heights adopted in 1977.  In areas of the Far East, calculations are carried out according to the Okhotsk altitude system.  Its error relative to BSV is less than one meter.

    <p>  A footstock is a bar with divisions for determining the <span>level of water in a river</span> or other body of water.  Sometimes permanently installed footstocks, like reference points and reference points in geodesy, are used by scientists to observe changes in the water level in the seas, and the vertical movements of layers of the earth‚Äôs surface. </p><h2>  About Kronstadt footstock and sea level determination </h2><p>  Initially, a change in the height of <span>the water level in the</span> Gulf of Finland was noted by horizontal notches on the walls of canals and pools, on the surfaces of locks.  When a special service was organized in Kronstadt in 1777, water was monitored at the feet of the bottom of the <span>Obvodny Canal.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Long-term (since 1731) and regular notes, observations of fluctuations in the water levels of the Gulf of Finland were processed by the hydrograph MF Reineke in 1840. A horizontal line was carved out on the stone support of one of the bridges across the Obvodny Canal using the averaged indications he calculated.  After several decades, a metal plate with a horizontal mark was fixed at this level, which practically coincided with the zero reading of the foot rod. </p><h2>  Land-level transfer of land </h2>

    <p>  This level indicator was transferred to the mainland by leveling along the line of the St. Petersburg-Oranienbaum railway and ‚Äútied‚Äù with a mark-bolt to one of the buildings at the Baltic Station.  Since 1892, this bolt has been the main benchmark for all leveling measurements in the country. </p><p>  In 1946, a single system of coordinates and heights was introduced on the territory of the Soviet Union.  The initial level was taken to be the Baltic Sea level with a mark corresponding to zero on the Kronstadt footstock.  This is the reference point of the state leveling system.  From the <span>absolute zero</span> mark, heights and depths are calculated for all domestic maps and locations, orbits for spacecraft flights are determined. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Varieties of benchmarks in geodesy </h2>

    <p>  On the ground, the reference point is indicated by a pyramid-shaped structure made of stones, boards or metal tubes.  Depending on the destination, there are several types of benchmarks: </p><ul><li>  Centuries-old are distributed in accordance with a special scheme throughout the country.  They are installed according to the instructions in the given geographical points.  They are used mainly for scientific purposes. </li><li>  Fundamental are equipped along all leveling lines of the first class (between centuries) and along the most important lines of the second class.  The distance between the points is from 50 to 80 km.  They are laid exclusively in the ground in the form of reinforced concrete pillars and pylons.  Since the fundamental reference can only be used in certain cases, an ordinary reference satellite with accurate transferred data is installed near it.  It is used as a support for leveling 3 and 4 classes. </li><li>  Ordinary benchmarks are wall, rock and ground.  Fixed at a distance of 3.5 to 7 km from one another, these signs can be laid along all leveling lines. </li></ul><p>  The system of interconnected fundamental and ordinary reference points forms the GHS - the state geodetic network. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cartographic designation of geodetic signs </h2><p>  On maps, the reference point is marked with special icons.  They are distinguished as follows: </p><ul><li>  for astronomical points; </li><li>  for GHS items; </li><li>  for central points fixed in the territory; </li><li>  for points of filming networks; </li><li>  for points of the state leveling geodetic network. </li></ul><p>  All these points are marked on the real surface of the Earth with metal pyramids or ordinary benchmarks.  Geodetic centers indicating the location of the point are plotted on the map by coordinates, that is, as accurately as possible, with indications of elevations. </p><p>  What is a reference point?  Elevations included in the general geodetic network, barrows, hills, or detached buildings with spiers, towers, or bells are indicated by conventionally accepted combined icons.  GHS points in maps with a large scale indicate absolutely everything.  Astronomical points, which are landmarks, are indicated only in cases where they are the starting points in a given area. </p><h2>  Triangulation (reference) points, their installation </h2>

A mark cast from metal is embedded in the point itself, which is the center of the point.  The inscription on the last indicates the number and type of the item.
