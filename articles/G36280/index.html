    <h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Barbara Tourist Apartments is a fairly small hotel complex, designed for youth companies and families with children.  Most of the guests spend whole days at sea and return to their rooms only in the evening.  Therefore, during the day on the hotel there is practically not a single person. </p><p>  Barbara Tourist Apartments 2 * consists of several low-rise buildings that form a courtyard with a pool and a well-kept garden.  The hotel complex can be reached through several entrances.  They are not guarded, however, like the hotel itself.  It is worth noting that this is a hallmark of Cyprus as a whole and in particular Ayia Napa.  There are very few police officers, because theft on the island is not common.  Even merchants calmly leave their goods on street stalls, going about their business.  This feature is very surprising for tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel complex provides accommodation of guests in thirty-nine rooms.  Guests can choose from two categories, which we will tell readers about in the next section of the article. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Located Barbara Tourist Apartments in Ayia Napa.  This resort is considered one of the most vibrant and youthful in Cyprus.  However, the hotel is located in a fairly quiet area.  Tourists claim that the residential area where the hotel complex is built is one of the most remote from the sea.  Therefore, you will have to go to the beach for at least twenty-five to thirty minutes.  Many guests claim that the distance to the sea is at least one thousand meters.  However, rest does not spoil it.  After all, the road runs through picturesque streets planted with olive, orange and other trees.  And bright small houses complement the incredibly beautiful landscape. </p><p>  The beach closest to the hotel is Agia Thekla.  It does not belong to the most famous in the resort, but nevertheless it is very popular among vacationers.  Not only hotel guests gather here, but also locals who are attracted by clear water and crystal white sand. </p><p>  It‚Äôs not so long to get <span>from Larnaca</span> International <span>Airport</span> to Barbara Tourist Apartments - only thirty-six kilometers.  Typically, tourists take a taxi or arrange a transfer with the hotel complex.  If this is not possible, try to get to Ayia Napa by public transport. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that very close to the hotel there are numerous clubs and bars.  You need to go to them no more than ten minutes, this allows partygoers to save on a taxi during their nightly adventures. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Accommodations </h2><p>  The service at Barbara Tourist Apartments matches the two stars that it has.  Therefore, going here, do not expect a high level of service and a huge number of infrastructure facilities. </p><p>  The hotel complex has a large swimming pool with sun loungers.  Most of the time it is empty and only in the evening there are vacationers returning from the beach.  There is a bar by the pool where you can buy soft drinks and alcoholic cocktails. </p><p>  The reception has a luggage storage room where you can leave your things at an additional cost.  Since it is customary to move around in rented vehicles in Cyprus, convenient parking is available near the hotel.  There are always free places for car guests. </p><p>  There is one restaurant in the hotel complex that provides guests with meals according to different schemes. </p><p>  If necessary, tourists can arrange transfers with staff to anywhere in the island.  However, please note that the hotel staff does not speak Russian.  All questions you have to solve in English. </p><p>  In addition to cars, bicycles can be rented at a special point.  Ayia Napa is great for lovers of this pastime.  Bicycle paths are equipped here, and the views that open to the gaze of tourists can not leave anyone indifferent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  If you do not plan to leave the hotel often, it is better to look for another option for yourself.  Indeed, in Barbara Tourist Apartments there is practically no entertainment.  Of the available options, guests can choose to swim in the pool or play a game of billiards.  Moreover, the cost of the latter is not included in the price. </p><p>  I especially want to say about Wi-Fi.  In some months it is free, while in others it will have to be paid separately.  Moreover, each time the conditions for using the Internet change.  It is interesting that tourists who rested in Barbara Tourist Apartments in one season write different information about the rules for using Wi-Fi.  Therefore, be prepared for the fact that you will have to pay for this service. </p>

    <h2>  Barbara Tourist Apartments: Food </h2><p>  The hotel provides guests with several catering systems.  When booking a room, travelers can specify only breakfast or any other scheme up to all-inclusive.  However, even with the latter option, you will not see the buffet so beloved by the Russians.  The all-inclusive concept of meals includes √† la carte breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Therefore, our compatriots often prefer not to eat at the hotel.  They love to go to local restaurants for food and cook in the fully equipped kitchen, which is available in every room. </p>

    <h2>  Barbara Tourist Apartments: room description </h2><p>  Of course, the level of equipment of the apartments is far from five-star hotel complexes.  Visibly shabby furniture needs to be updated, and the rooms themselves "scream" about the need for repairs.  Here everything is arranged very simply and resembles an ordinary rented apartment.  However, everything you need for a comfortable stay in the room is still there. </p><p>  Guests can use cable TV, and this technology is quite modern.  But the guests have a lot of complaints about the air conditioner, it is old and noisy.  In addition, quite often it is difficult to adjust it to the desired temperature. </p><p>  Problems and arise with the discharge of water in the shower.  Often during washing, it stops passing into the drain and completely floods the floors in the bathroom.  In some rooms, water even seeps into the room.  There are also problems with hot water.  It begins to flow only six minutes after turning on the tap. </p><p>  Each room has a small balcony and a well-equipped kitchen.  It is often prepared by those guests who are trying to save on food.  The reviews provide information that some tourists take to these hotels some stock of products from home, and then just buy what they need at local shops.  Kitchen equipment allows you to cook a wide variety of dishes. </p><p>  The rooms are divided into two categories.  Some are one-room apartments, designed for four guests.  And others are more like a stylish studio that can accommodate three guests. </p><p>  Please note that some rooms also have a coffee machine.  This allows you to enjoy a morning cup of fine coffee without leaving your room. </p>
