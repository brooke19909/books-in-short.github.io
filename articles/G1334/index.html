It is clear that in an urban environment, the interior atmosphere in the rooms is far from optimal for health.  In particular, such an indicator as <span>air humidity</span> in urban apartments is often much lower than the values ‚Äã‚Äãcharacteristic of the atmosphere in nature.  Devices are appearing on the climate technology market with the help of which, according to manufacturers, they can significantly improve the environmental friendliness of the air inside the apartments in terms of its moisture content.  Among them is the Venta LW15 humidifier.  What are its features?  What do the owners of the device say about its practical effectiveness? </p><h2>  What is a humidifier? </h2><p>  Before studying the specifics of the Venta LW15 device, reviews of which are presented in a wide range on thematic online portals of the Internet, we examine the essence of the corresponding class of devices.

    <p>  In urban apartments, the air differs significantly from natural, in which there is an optimal percentage of moisture for people and animals.  According to many scientists, this indicator should be about 40-60%.  In the event that it is lower, then people living in the apartment may have various health problems, decreased performance, and fatigue.  Many researchers believe that the indicated humidity indicator in practice in a city apartment is very difficult to achieve due to the presence in it of various devices that actively drain the air - heating batteries, computers, electric lamps. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

That is, even taking into account the small dimensions of the device, its performance is sufficient to ensure optimal air humidity in modern apartments.

    <p>  There are some features of the device in a mode called ‚Äúair washing‚Äù.  Venta LW15 (user reviews characterize this aspect very positively) is equipped with indicators that show the current water level in the tanks.  If the device is automatically turned off, it means that the protection mechanism provided for by its design has worked.  You need to add water to the tank. </p><h2>  The principle of operation of the device </h2><p>  Let us now examine the actual principle of operation of the Venta LW15 device, reviews of which characterize it as a very useful and convenient device in operation.  Venta LW15 works, as we noted above, in two modes - humidification and air purification.  We study the specifics of both. </p><p>  As for the first mode, the Venta LW15 air humidifier (reviews by many experts characterize the technological solutions implemented in it as very effective) works on the principle of cold evaporation.  This approach avoids the formation of condensation, as well as plaque on objects that surround the working elements of the device. </p><p>  Air that enters the inside of the device using a fan enters the humidified drums.  Dust particles that are present in it settle on the surface of the plates.  The air itself, cleaned and moistened, again enters the room.  The dust remaining on the drums settles in a special tank.  Thus, both functions of the device work simultaneously - humidification and "air washing".  Venta LW15 (reviews of many users and experts in the field of climate technology confirm this) effectively solves two problems at once. </p><h2>  Management and maintenance </h2><p>  We will learn how the device is managed and how to properly service it.  <span>The</span> Venta LW15 <span>air</span> purifier incorporates <span>a control panel</span> with buttons illuminated by an LED.  The involvement of certain operating modes of the device is very simple.  As for the maintenance of the device, all that the user needs to do is regularly replenish the water used to humidify the air (its level is displayed on the indicator), and also periodically rinse the drums on which dust particles can settle.  Also, it is sometimes necessary to clean the tank in which dust accumulates. </p>
