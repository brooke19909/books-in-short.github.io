  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Potassium monophosphate, its characteristics and application features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Potassium monophosphate is a concentrated phosphorus-potassium fertilizer that is used to feed plants and is applied to protected or open ground with irrigation water.  In addition, this substance is used for <span>foliar top dressing.</span>  It should be noted that potassium monophosphate is included in the list of the most concentrated phosphate compounds used as fertilizers. </p><p>  Its high efficiency is explained by the fact that plants very well absorb pure chemical nutrients.  When potassium monophosphate is used to feed plants, an increase in yield is observed, and fruits and vegetables are characterized by better quality due to their more intensive accumulation of sugar and vitamins.  An important property of potassium monophosphate is its ability to increase the resistance of plants to various fungal infections. </p><p>  The composition of potassium monophosphate includes potassium in the amount of 34% of the total number of components, as well as total phosphates, the percentage of which reaches respectively 52%. </p><p>  This substance has the form of a powder of white or slightly yellowish color.  It is characterized by good solubility in water, so it can be used in drip irrigation systems to feed fruit, vegetable or ornamental plants, as well as vineyards growing on any <span>type of soil.</span> </p><p>  I must say that this substance can be used for the manufacture of solid and liquid mixtures of fertilizers, but it must be remembered that it cannot be combined with preparations that include magnesium or calcium. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that potassium monophosphate can also be used in the field of growing ornamental plants.  It allows you to achieve fast and long flowering <span>flowering plants.</span>  In addition, when using this fertilizer shoots mature better, and <span>ornamental trees</span> and shrubs tolerate winter better. </p><p>  In vegetable growing, this potassium compound is successfully used for the independent production of nutrient solutions, which are characterized by a high salt content and are excellent for <span>foliar top dressing.</span> </p><p>  Potassium monophosphate is often used in spring in combination with other fertilizers, which include nitrogen.  This improves root growth, especially after a dive or in case of transplanting.  The use of such top dressing after flowering or during the period when the plants are already bearing fruit significantly increases productivity, and the resulting product can be stored for a long time.  In addition, the <span>use of potassium monophosphate</span> contributes to the fact that fruit buds of the crop are effectively laid the next year. </p><p>  Depending on the purpose and period of use, the flow rate of the irrigation solution may vary.  So, when using this fertilizer in the early phases of plant development, it is necessary to prepare a solution at the rate of 5 liters per m2, for vegetable and flower crops from the beginning of the 6-leaf phase, at least 10 liters per m2 should be used, and the greatest amount should be used for watering trees or shrubs irrigation solution - 20 l per m2. </p><p>  It should be said that potassium compounds are important not only for efficient farming.  Potassium is an important element for the normal functioning of the human body.  So, potassium in the human body takes part in the work of muscles, heart, nervous system, regulates water metabolism and affects the general metabolism of substances. </p><p>  The rate of potassium in the blood is from 3.5 to 5.0 mmol / L.  With an increase or decrease in this indicator, hyper - or hypokalemia syndrome occurs, which are manifested by the corresponding clinical symptoms and require adequate medical intervention. </p>
