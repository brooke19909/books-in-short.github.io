Every child dreams of having such a toy friend to spend time with him and fall asleep in the same bed.  You can fulfill the dream of your child by not only buying a toy, but also making it yourself.  Moreover, the creation of my mother‚Äôs hands will be loved and more expensive than the store.  In order to create a beautiful toy, you will need very few things: just a couple of pieces of fabric, a rabbit pattern and a little imagination. </p><h2>  Best friend </h2><p>  A soft and cute toy rabbit can be the best friend for any child.  To do this, the craft must be made as cute and functional as possible, that is, not used for decorating fragile and small jewelry.  It is best to choose natural fabrics or fur for tailoring and decor.  When using fur material (especially natural), you should make sure that there is no allergy in the child. </p>

    <p>  The size of the future crafts can be different, depending on the age of the baby.  But many needlewomen advise making not too big toys so that they can be washed and dried quickly.  Also, you don‚Äôt need to sew a very small rabbit, because he will quickly get tired of the child.  Therefore, it is best to choose an average size of about twenty to thirty-five centimeters.  As for the clothes of a fairy-tale hero, it should correspond to the gender of the child, because not every boy will like a rabbit in a dress.  But for girls there are no restrictions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Toy style </h2><p>  Among the huge number of styles of toys, Tilda's crafts are especially popular.  The creator of this trend, Tony Finnanger, was able to embody the simplicity of forms and the graceful splendor of fabric dolls in her crafts.  Having received worldwide recognition for sophistication, all products under the Tilda brand are the favorite toys of many children.  One of the features of such toys are long arms and legs, as well as a minimal image of the outlines of the face.  Also in the collection of needlewomen there are rabbits.  The charming rabbit Tilda, whose pattern is placed below, is the most beloved exhibit of many people from among all the artist‚Äôs crafts. </p>

    <p>  When cutting toy details from fabric, it is necessary to take into account the fact that the pattern is depicted without allowance for seams, so you should make a small indent from the edges of about 1-1.5 cm.If this is not done, too narrow details will appear that can ruin the appearance of the craft. </p><p>  Also, the Tilda rabbit (whose pattern is placed in the article) is drawn on a small scale, which can be increased if desired.  As a filler, you can choose sintepon, holofiber or sintepuh.  As for the design of the face, you need to sew on two small beads in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe eye, and embroider the nose with a triangle, using thread for embroidery.  It will also be necessary to lightly brown the cheeks of the rabbit, using the blush.  It should be noted that the ears of a fashionable rabbit can be sewn in different ways.  In one case, they are cut from one material, and in the other, fabric of two colors is used.  As a rule, the inner side of the ears in this case should be made of multi-colored linen or cotton. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fluffy gift </h2><p>  No less charming and cute than a fabric one is a rabbit made of fur.  To create such a magnificence, it is best to choose short-haired fur that will not crumble.  A toy can be sewn in several ways, resorting to a combination of material and making completely fur.  In the first case, the head of the crafts is cut out of some soft fabric, and all other details are made of fur.  This version of the toy rabbit looks very beautiful and original.  The following shows a rabbit pattern made of fur, which is suitable for sewing both types of crafts. </p>

    <p>  Speaking about the design of the muzzle of a rabbit, it should be mentioned that very expressive eyes must be made on a fully furry toy.  Most often they use special <span>glass eyes</span> that look like real ones.  Making them yourself is very difficult, so you need to use purchased parts.  As for the combined craft, different eyes look equally charming on it.  They can be purchased, embroidered or made from beads and buttons. </p><h2>  Long-eared surprise </h2><p>  There are few differences between all toy rabbits, most often these are different types of material taken for sewing, as well as the shape of their ears.  Such a handmade product can have medium-length ears, erect ears, and also very long ears, which sometimes reach the height of the craft.  Below is a pattern of a rabbit with long ears, which any child will surely like. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rabbit pattern with long ears" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46256/1704905.jpg" width="564"></div>

    <p>  The toy depicted on the pattern can be sewn from various materials.  Therefore, it may look like crafts Tilda or as the above fur option.  In any case, the toy rabbit will turn out to be very beautiful.  Sometimes a soft wire is inserted into the ears of such products so that they can be lifted.  But most often long-eared rabbits are made with drooping and soft ears. </p><h2>  Desired scale </h2><p>  Very often it turns out that the rabbit pattern shown in the figure is not suitable in size.  Sometimes you want to sew a toy more, and sometimes less.  In this case, it is worth resorting to zoom in or out.  This is not difficult to do, you need to take a finished image of the parts, and if you need to enlarge them, then add a few centimeters along the edges of the product.  If it should be reduced, then you need to measure the pattern data with a ruler and draw it taking into account the changes, taking away a few centimeters at the edges. </p>

    <p>  When making such changes in the toy, it is necessary to take into account that the rabbit pattern is filed taking into account the proportions of the body of the craft.  Therefore, you do not need to draw images by eye, without having certain skills.  It is best to follow the recommendations of specialists, as indicated above.  If it is difficult to make a correct pattern on a regular album sheet, then you should use a sheet from a notebook in a cage or special paper designed for these purposes.  It will be much easier to draw details on it and make various roundings correctly. </p><h2>  Unusual stuffing </h2><p>  As a rule, for stuffing toys they use the same materials, it is a synthetic winterizer, synthetic winterizer or holofiber, as mentioned above.  But sometimes other fillers are used to give durability to the craft.  Most often, these are various cereals, which are pleasantly felt through the fabric.  Being completely natural, such ingredients will not harm the playing child. </p><p>  When using natural fillers, one must take into account the fact that cereals are heavier than synthetic packing.  Therefore, the pattern of the rabbit and the material for its sewing should be selected taking into account this nuance.  It should also be remembered that before using any cereal, it must be well-fried so that it does not deteriorate inside the craft.  Although this method of filling products is completely natural, but it has one big drawback - the inability to wash the toys.  Therefore, it is most often used for crafts that are used as decor for the premises. </p>
