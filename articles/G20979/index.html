  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Krasnoyarsk: photo with names and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Krasnoyarsk is one of the largest and oldest cities in Russia.  It is the economic and industrial center of Siberia.  A little more than one million people live in the city, and the settlement itself is located on both banks of the Yenisei River. </p><p>  Krasnoyarsk is famous for its sights, the city has many monuments, park areas and interesting architectural objects, 274 of which are listed in the cultural heritage of the Krasnoyarsk Territory and Russia.  Like most Russian cities, Krasnoyarsk was damaged in the XVIII century by fire, as a result of which the settlement was restored with stone structures, rather than wooden ones. </p><h2>  Paraskeva Chapel Friday </h2><p>  This 15-meter landmark of Krasnoyarsk was built in the 19th century.  The chapel is built of brick and has an octagonal shape, is located on Karaulnaya Gora and is a place of pilgrimage for Orthodox people.  The chapel and the Communal bridge are depicted on a 10-ruble note, therefore these two places of the city are known far beyond the borders of Krasnoyarsk.  Not so long ago, a new ritual was introduced.  Every day at noon a solemn salvo of a cannon is made. </p><p>  Earlier, a wooden chapel flaunted at this place, which, according to legend, was erected by a merchant who almost drowned in the river.  In honor of his salvation, he built it.  The new brick structure was created at the expense of the patron Kuznetsov Peter. </p><p>  The height of the chapel is 15 meters, the walls are 7 meters, the diameter of the building is also 7 meters, and a huge dome is installed on top.  The square in front of the chapel offers a magnificent view of the city. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can get to this place by buses following routes No. 11, 32 and 64. Get off at the Red Square or Muzkomediya stop, then walk up to the hill. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rba.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paraskeva Chapel Friday" class="if uuid-2358055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2358055.jpg"></div><h2>  Car and pedestrian bridge </h2><p>  This is the second attraction of the city of Krasnoyarsk, to which tourists are always brought.  Despite the fact that the bridge was built only in the 50s of the last century, it is distinguished by its original architectural style and its beautiful arches.  This is one of the most famous buildings of the Soviet period throughout the USSR and around the world, known as a vivid example of the Stalinist empire. </p><p>  The bridge consists of two separate reinforced concrete bridge structures.  The length of one bridge is 910 meters, the other - 410 meters.  Structures are separated by a dam across the Island of Recreation.  The bridge has 6 lanes, a total width of 23.4 meters, a height of 26 meters.  The length along with the approaches and the dam is 2.3 thousand meters. </p><p>  The bridge overlooks two squares: the Bridge on the right bank of the Yenisei River and the Theater on the left. </p><h2>  theatre square </h2><p>  This is one of the latest attractions in Krasnoyarsk.  It began to be built only after the construction of the Communal Bridge, to the 350th anniversary of the city.  Once upon a time there was Forest Square and Dynamo Stadium.  Now there is the Opera and Ballet Theater, the Krasnoyarsk Hotel, the river shipping company and the city administration. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Over time, a statue of Apollo and a musical fountain, a monument to Chekhov appeared on the square.  By the way, there is an interesting opinion that the writer at this place at one time was expecting a river crossing. </p><p>  Each year, the main city tree is set up in the square, surrounded by ice and snow sculptures. </p><h2>  Steamboat Museum "St. Nicholas" </h2><p>  This legendary landmark of Krasnoyarsk is moored in the Strelka area, on the banks of the Yenisei.  The ship was built by order and at the expense of A.M.Sibiryakov in 1886.  At one time, the ship was famous as the fastest ship on the whole Yenisei, could take on board up to 200 passengers. </p><p>  On this ship, Tsarevich Nikolai made a short trip, and in 1897, Lenin V.I. and his comrades sailed to the village of Shushenskoye.  In 1960, the ship was decommissioned, but the hull was preserved in the Podtesovsky backwater.  By the 100th anniversary of Lenin, the ship was restored and installed on the shore near Weinbaum Street.  Later, after 17 years, the ‚Äúmuseum on the water‚Äù was moved to the Strelka area on Peace Square, 1a. </p><div class="photo" data-original="proehal.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Steamboat Museum St. Nicholas" class="if uuid-2358059" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2358059.jpg"></div><h2>  Pokrovsky Cathedral </h2><p>  You can start by describing the sights of Krasnoyarsk with the fact that this is the oldest building in the city, preserved from 1744, when the first stone was laid.  This is a monument to the Yenisei school of Siberian baroque. </p><p>  Before the construction of the stone church, there were several wooden predecessors.  The temple was erected on the voluntary donations of the parishioners, they also carried out auxiliary work: they brought wood, sand, prepared stone, guarded building materials. </p><p>  The church was renamed several times, during the period of Stalinist repressions, the building was given over to a military unit.  In 1945, the temple was returned to believing citizens of the city.  When Khrushchev comes to power, new persecutions of the ministers of the cathedral begin.  A criminal case was even fabricated against father Eugene, and in the 60s the church was again closed.  Sculpture workshops open in the building.  Since 1978, the church has been used as an exhibition hall.  Only in 1989 the temple was again returned to the community.  The church is located on 26 Surikov Street. </p><h2>  Annunciation Church, photo with description </h2><p>  The attraction of Krasnoyarsk is located on Lenin Street, 15 (the intersection with January 9th Street) and is listed as a cultural heritage of federal significance.  The church has three unique features: </p><ul><li>  the church building has 3 floors; </li><li>  the third stone church building in the whole city, built at the beginning of the XIX century; </li><li>  construction was carried out according to the drawings. </li></ul><p>  The temple is a prime example of the architectural style of classicism and baroque.  In 1997, the building was completely restored and gave it its original appearance.  There is a convent at the temple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alliruk.livejournal.com" data-author=": alliruk, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Annunciation Church" class="if uuid-2358000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2358000.jpg"></div><h2>  Eiffel Tower and Big Ben </h2><p>  Photos with the names and descriptions of the attractions of Krasnoyarsk can be found in many presentation catalogs of travel agencies.  These are creations of modern architects. </p><p>  Krasnoyarsk Eiffel Tower is a reduced and exact copy of the Parisian.  The scale is observed in a proportion of 1:21.  The height of the building is 14 meters and 80 centimeters, that is, almost like a five-story house.  The tower was opened in 2007.  The initiator of the erection of the metal structure is the owner of a French restaurant located on the same Spring Street.  Naturally, the restaurant became instantly popular among residents and guests of Krasnoyarsk. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.0383296" data-lng="92.91257659999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/4/0/1840.png"></div><p>  Big Ben is on Weinbaum Street.  This is a huge tower with a clock upstairs, the appearance of which is as close as possible to the English Big Ben.  The diameter of the watch is 6.5 meters, and the total weight of the structure is 1.5 tons. </p><p>  The construction of Krasnoyarsk Big Ben began in the 70s of the last century, the opening of the tower occurred only in 2001. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnoyarsk Eiffel Tower" class="if uuid-2358022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2358022.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of the Transfiguration </h2><p>  It is not known for certain when Catholics appeared in Krasnodar, but in 1836 the first Catholic parish was established.  The first temple was wooden, there was no information left with a description.  A photo of the sights of the city of Krasnoyarsk has only been preserved in one copy. </p><p>  In 1903, the collection began on a stone structure.  The construction itself began only in 1910 and ended a year later.  At that time, the parish had 2,500 faiths, a library and a school, a charity and a small shelter. </p><p>  The building was created in the neo-Gothic style.  The length of the structure is 25 meters and the width is 14 meters.  On the facade on the west side there is a three-tiered bell tower, on the sides of the building - lancet windows.  The basement of the temple is made of granite, and the walls and arches are made of brick. </p><p>  For 43 years, since the construction of the church, it was the only Catholic church in the city.  In the 20-30s of the last century, the building was nationalized and transferred to the placement of cultural objects.  The last clergyman of the church was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and 2 years after the trial he was again brought to trial and sentenced to death. </p><p>  Subsequently, the building housed the Committee on Radio Affairs, the cinema complex.  And in 1978, the church was restored and the Philharmonic was placed in it, a concert organ was built. </p><p>  In 2012, they began the construction of a new building for the Philharmonic, after which they promised to return the church to the Catholics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.krsk.aif.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church and Xenza House" class="if uuid-2358037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2358037.jpg"></div><h2>  Priest's house </h2><p>  This is not to say that the photos of the sights of Krasnoyarsk are very impressive.  The house was built in the Art Nouveau style, and its facade imitates a medieval fachwerk.  The church with the priest‚Äôs house was erected in the complex.  Now it houses the administration of the Philharmonic and a music school.  The building is listed as a regional property. </p><p>  The house is located near the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord at the address: Dekabristov street, 22. </p><h2>  Museum Center "Peace Square" </h2><p>  This is not a very traditional sight of the city of Krasnoyarsk, but photos from here can be brought unique.  This is the largest exhibition complex in the Krasnoyarsk Territory and Siberia, where all the exhibitions are dedicated not to the past, but to the future.  The complex hosts presentations of contemporary art in Russia and Europe. </p><p>  The museum center is located on Peace Square, 1 and is open daily except Mondays.  The cost of entrance tickets is 150 rubles, video and photography are separately paid. </p><h2>  Park of Fauna and Flora ‚ÄúRoyev Ruchey‚Äù </h2><p>  Photo with the names of the attractions of Krasnoyarsk is also often found in booklets of travel agencies. </p><p>  The park is considered a symbol of the city, although it was opened only in 1999.  To date, a collection of animals of 700 species has been collected.  The only penguinarium in all of Siberia is operating on the territory, and the aquaterrarium is one of the largest in the entire Russian Federation. </p><p>  It is very interesting to see exotic animals in Siberian open spaces, especially in winter, when there is a cold in the yard.  The park is open to visitors year-round.  Many representatives of the fauna are listed in the Red Book. </p><h2>  Reserve "Krasnoyarsk Pillars" </h2><p>  This attraction in the Krasnoyarsk Territory is the most popular in all of Siberia. You can get to the reserve by regular bus from Krasnoyarsk.  It is located in the Eastern Sayan Mountains, on the right bank of the Yenisei River. </p><p>  In this place there are ancient rocks, whose age is already more than a hundred million years.  On average, the height of the cliffs reaches 500 meters.  There are 190 of them in the conservation area; they are all of different sizes and shapes.  This place is popular among climbers and climbers. </p><p>  The reserve was opened in 1925 to protect the area from uncontrolled felling of vegetation and illegal extraction of stone.  The total occupied area is more than 47 thousand hectares. </p><p>  There are three zones on the territory, with different security regimes: </p><ul><li>  3% of the territory can be visited by anyone; </li><li>  7% is a buffer zone, that is, you can enter here only by special permission; </li><li>  the remaining 90% of the territories are accessible only to employees of the reserve. </li></ul><p>  In the reserve, there are about 762 species of vascular plants, and the animal world is represented by 56 species of mammals.  A huge number of birds lives on the territory, about 200 species.  Approximately 250 thousand people come to the park to walk along hiking trails annually.  The total length of the walking paths is more than 67 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krasnoyarsk-inform.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reserve &quot;Krasnoyarsk Pillars&quot;" class="if uuid-2358066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2358066.jpg"></div><h2>  Stolbism </h2><p>  This phenomenon appeared precisely in the Krasnoyarsk Pillars reserve.  At the end of the 19th century, groups of rock climbing enthusiasts began to appear in this area.  They built near the rocks of the hut and lived in them for a long time.  Each individual group had its own ideological inspirer. </p><p>  By 1917, these people were already perceived as freethinkers, and in the 30s, persecution of them began.  After the Second World War, Colobism again revived, and in the 80s, persecution of these people again began, up to the destruction of their huts. </p><h2>  Attractions in the Krasnoyarsk Territory </h2><p>  In this corner of Siberia, a diverse landscape and many places where you should definitely visit. </p><p>  Biryusinsky caves are located near the village of Verkhnyaya Biryusa, along the M-54 Yenisei highway, in the estuary of <span>the Biryusa river</span> and the reservoir.  These are beautiful rock formations, alternating with steep climbs and sharp cliffs.  To date, there are about 70 caves, but it is reliably known that not all the terrain has been explored.  In the caves you can see stalagmites and stalactites, clear lakes and constantly dormant bats. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sib100.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Biryusinsky caves" class="if uuid-2358094" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2358094.jpg"></div><p>  The large Arctic reserve is more than four million hectares of almost untouched nature.  The park is located on the Taimyr Peninsula, including the waters of the Laptev and Kara Sea with islands.  Here you can see the polar nights and days, vegetation and wildlife in all Siberian diversity.  Tourists rarely come to the reserve because of the great distance from the settlements, however, only here you can see the ‚ÄúNarwhal Cemetery‚Äù and do birdwatching, diving in the Arctic Ocean. </p><p>  There are many more national reserves in the Krasnodar Territory.  This is Shushensky Bor, known for its many-headed ridge Borus.  Ergaki Nature Park, famous for its Stone Town, and others. </p>
