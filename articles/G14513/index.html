    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Five kilometers from MKAD is the city of Vidnoye, where, next to the village of Lopatino, this housing complex is located.  Getting by car is very simple - you can drive from Simferopol highway along Rastorguevsky, overlooking the picturesque surroundings, or along the M-4 toll road from the Moscow Ring Road.  On the Warsaw highway - only seven kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  Public transport is also quite convenient - you can use minibuses, of which there are several, or you can take buses to the nearest metro stations - Annino, Dmitry Donskoy Boulevard, Domodedovo.  Soon the city of Vidnoe will receive its own <span>light rail,</span> connecting Butovo, Shcherbinka and Moscow with it.  This will become the most convenient mode of transport for residents of the "Sovereign House".  Address LCD "Gosudarev House": Vidnoe, d. Lopatino, Leninsky district, Moscow region. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Construction is moving ahead of schedule, in the fourth quarter of 2016 everything should already be ready for delivery.  That is why housing in LCD "Gosudarev House" is in special demand.  The prices for apartments here are, of course, high, but quite adequate - after all, the area is beautiful, the environment is wonderful, despite the proximity of the metropolis, and the houses are built comfortable according to the new project.  First of all, it is a multifunctional complex, the infrastructure is developed.  Four blocks of LCD are equipped with every imaginable convenience for residents.  Apartment houses are built according to individual projects and consist of two types - monolithic-frame type and panel.  The facades are original - new architectural techniques were used here, combining style, adding unity to the ensemble, and this is a rather difficult task.  Already in 2017, schools and kindergartens will open their doors, although it is very possible that before the New Year, since construction is going ahead of schedule. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  In the Leninsky district is the village of Lopatino, which is part of the rural settlement Bulatnikovskoye.  In the west, the area adjoins the border of Moscow (Butovo), near - Warsaw highway.  In the north, the settlement territory also adjoins the capital - along the MKAD, in the east are Vidnoe and Leninsky Gorki, in the south of the ZhK it borders with the Podolsky district, in the south-west - with Voskresensky.  Transport accessibility in this area is very high.  In just ten minutes you can reach the <span>Annino metro station.</span>  LCD "Gosudarev House" is located between the busy highways of the region, close to the railway stations - Butovo on the one hand (Kursk direction) and Rastorguevo - on the other (Paveletsky direction). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you go by car, from MKAD (Warsaw highway) after three kilometers you need to turn left, under the arrow, towards Rastorguevsky highway, and drive past the Butovo Park residential complex.  Three more kilometers - and now the territory of the Gosudarev House residential complex.  How to get from MKAD on the highway "Don"?  Even easier.  After turning to the Rastorguevo railway station, go through the tunnel to Rastorguevskoe highway.  Drive through two villages.  Right behind them begins the Gosudarev House residential complex, but Lopatino is left behind. Of course, it‚Äôs much faster to get there by car if there are no traffic jams. On electric trains, the journey takes about half an hour. You can also take minibuses. From all three nearest metro stations, they move from with an interval of 10-15 minutes.When there is a light rail, there will most likely be no transfers on the way out of the city.In addition, there are plans to build another highway from Solntsevo through Butovo to Vidnoye. </p>

    <h2>  Housing Details </h2><p>  By <span>type of house</span> in the residential complex "Gosudarev House" (Vidnoye) of the DOMMOS series according to projects executed on the basis of the one hundred and eleventh series.  Large-panel reinforced concrete buildings of nine floors and with variable number of storeys - from seven to nine.  Partition walls are not partially installed, since an individual layout is provided.  Bathrooms are fenced to the full height, and <span>tongue-</span> and- <span>groove blocks are</span> single-row.  The electrical wiring throughout the apartment is not divorced, but a power supply device is installed, communications are brought to the apartment right up to the dashboard.  All this is so because the residents require it, because in the Gosudarev House residential complex the layouts are individual, as has already been said. </p><p>  One-pipe heating, top spill, heating appliances installed, as well as pipes with hot, cold water, a riser of the bathroom (without wiring) and a kitchen.  The loggias and balconies are glazed with two-chamber double-glazed windows (aluminum and plastic with five-centimeter insulation), for complete safety, a grille of about a meter high is installed.  Loggias and balconies have heating radiators; the exit to the balcony or loggia is glazed in one glass.  There are no floor screeds - except for the bathroom, where it is made with waterproofing.  Ceiling height - two hundred and seventy centimeters.  The elevator for each section is a cargo-passenger (six hundred and thirty kilograms).  In the Gosudarev House residential complex, the layout of public spaces is extremely convenient, there is a place for inventory and concierge. </p><h2>  Subsidies </h2><p>  Many people use state subsidies to buy housing, when the state in some way promotes the purchase of a private house or apartment to groups of people who need this help.  Existing state projects can apply for certain benefits if a monthly payment of utility bills is guaranteed.  Such a subsidy plan is not a loan, not an installment plan, and not a loan.  This is a one-time free aid, which is used only once and only for the purchase of housing.  Moreover, cash payments are not expected, purely cashless payments with a construction company or homeowners are valid, and only a certificate is issued that confirms the subsidy provided. </p><p>  Its amount does not fully repay the value of the property, but only a certain share, so you still need to have a supplementing cost to the full amount.  The commissioning of the ‚ÄúSovereign House‚Äù residential complex is planned for 2018, so there is time to get a hoot about such a subsidy, and just about this the company‚Äôs lawyers can give comprehensive advice.  And any time-tested real estate company can help in obtaining a subsidy, especially associated with the sale of their own real estate - new buildings.  The general contractor of the facility is the GVSU company, and it is she who directly carries out the construction of all buildings from the DOMMOS series. </p><h2>  General contractor </h2><p>  GVSU - The Main Military Construction Directorate is a holding company, which includes transport, manufacturing and, of course, construction enterprises.  Such a company depends to the smallest extent on third-party service providers and even materials.  In addition, the holding includes GVSU-Realty, which involves the independent sale of apartments and premises in newly built buildings.  GVSU has more than fifty years of history, so it is difficult today to find a company more reliable.  During the construction of this complex, even the transfer of power lines to the Gosudarev House residential complex was successful, components that are produced at our own enterprises ‚Äî doors, panels, windows and much more ‚Äî are used, craftsmen as part of the holding work at the construction site, for example, UNR-534, and our own construction equipment. </p><p>  Further, buyers have the opportunity to purchase an apartment from the direct general contractor who carried out the construction, and in this case it will be much cheaper.  The first phase of construction is thirty buildings, whose apartments are already for sale.  The keys to the owners of the first stage will be fully issued until July 2017.  In the near Moscow region, inexpensive apartments are not at all uncommon, but the success of the Gosudarev House residential complex is all the more great.  Customer reviews suggest that all apartments in this complex are much cheaper than any of their competitors. </p>

    <h2>  Pros and cons of ecology </h2><p>  There has never been a multi-story housing, most recently, the entire territory of the complex was state farm land, and accordingly it was used.  The comfort of future residents should be discussed, be sure to take this into account.  First of all, it‚Äôs expensive to be convinced that there are no chemically active wastes in the soil, because there were no industrial zones.  The coke and gas plant in the city of Vidnoye works, but it is located far enough - more than five kilometers to it.  With the transmission poles, which are quite a lot on the former agricultural lands, the issue seems to be resolved.  Everything would be fine, but both the infrastructure and the roads should be built from scratch, and therefore you will have to endure quite a long time until complete comfort. </p><p>  Judging by the status of the work, the Granel Development company will fulfill all the obligations to the interest holders, and the first stage will be ready even a little earlier than the deadline, settlement is planned for the end of 2016.  In the future, it is unlikely that a serious increase in housing prices in this residential complex will take place, since the competition is extremely high, there are many developers of budget housing not only nearby, but throughout the Moscow Region as a whole.  One cannot hope for the profitability of such an investment, but this is by no means a loss of capital.  Such housing is most often bought by young families; in the Gosudarev House residential complex, almost all of them are.  And they did not fail!  The place is quiet, the nearest suburbs, a forested area, the number of floors is excellent - up to nine, heated loggias and balconies.  A lot of advantages almost outshines the few disadvantages. </p>

    <h2>  Who to deal with </h2><p>  Apartments are sold by three offices.  These are Granel Development, the Bastion company and the general contractor - GVSU-Realty.  A potential buyer should choose, like an epic hero in front of a stone at a crossroads.  Granel Development manages the entire database of offers, and partner companies have the right to sell only some part of the apartments or sections.  This practically means one thing: an intermediary appears between the buyer and the developer, who formalizes the acquisition of real estate as a transfer of ownership.  It may well turn out to be not only cheaper, but also more profitable.  For example, Bastion works with a much larger number of banks on mortgage programs.  However, when assigning rights, other problems may arise, primarily force majeure, because only direct agents of transactions are protected by law, and intermediaries are second only. </p><p>  So, the <span>share agreement is</span> necessary for the purchase of an apartment in the residential complex "Gosudarev House" (the basis is the Federal Law 214).  For three days, the selected apartment can be booked even without any prepayment.  And after a deposit of forty thousand rubles has been paid, this apartment will be booked for a month already.  During this time, the bank will manage to get a mortgage, and social authorities will be able to transfer maternity capital or calculate the military mortgage.  The list of banks that accredited this facility is very impressive.  These are Zenit, Uralsib, Svyaz-Bank, Rosavtobank, Moscow Credit Bank, Globex, Deltacredit, Otkrytie, Vozrozhdenie, Gazprombank, Bank of Moscow, Raffeisenbank, Absolut Bank, VTB-24, Sberbank.  However, Inkommerts Bank offered the most favorable rate - 9.9 percent per annum.  In addition, it offers a variety of lending preferences, as it is a regular partner of Granel Group.  Representatives of these banks are present at the facility. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="d shovel" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1531649.jpg" width="316"></div>

    <h2>  Excursion </h2><p>  Customers - potential buyers - can take a tour of the new, already constructed buildings.  They are given a helmet, a pass, and after the group is typed, a detour of the site begins on a beautifully designed minibus.  Along the way, all the geographical features of the location of the residential complex are explained, which is not so simple: navigating in fifty buildings and ten infrastructure buildings is simply impossible without guides, after all, eighty-odd hectares in the Gosudarev House residential complex.  22 building, for example, is not so different from those around it, and if an excursionist there unnecessarily admires the view from the window (the park or the forest), it may subsequently be lost.  By the way, this sector has very interesting roofs, which will be described in detail below.  The only thing is the road separating the buildings, which will certainly lead to the Rastorguevskoye highway, will not allow the stragglers to remain in the unfinished building. </p><p>  Although the views from the windows are actually good.  Not all windows, of course, face the forest; there are also highways and neighboring houses.  The Gosudarev House residential complex is being quickly built.  The 13th building will be commissioned a little later, in mid-2017, and all the rest are brought under the roof, the facades are ready, the internal work is coming to an end.  There are two types of nine-story "panels" - Lime and Domus.  The difference between them is very small.  Only the heating system is fundamentally different - Lime with horizontal pipes, Domus with vertical pipes.  External differences are also cardinal - ‚ÄúLime‚Äù with plastered facades, and ‚ÄúDomus‚Äù - with tiled, imitating bricks.  Roofs with additional waterproofing, sandwich panels are covered with metal, on the slopes - an insulating membrane, funnels of the water drain are heated.  The roof frame is protected from fire and decay. </p>

    <h2>  Prices and layouts </h2><p> There are a lot of options in choosing economy class housing - from small studios to extensive three-room living quarters.  In the Gosudarev House residential complex, apartment prices are not at all high.  The most budget purchase fits into one and a half million rubles - for those who intend to create comfort in a twenty-three-meter studio.  However, there are studios without any crowding, but more expensive: on thirty-six square meters you can settle for less than three million rubles - 2,775,000, to be exact.  One-room apartments are not much different from such a studio, in any case, small ones of such an area.  There is more - forty-seven square meters will cost 3,471,000 rubles.  Two-room apartments are distinguished by a wide variety - these are thirty-seven square meter Euro-studios for 2,655,000 rubles, a lot of intermediate options to even the business class are not inferior in comfort to two-room apartments of more than seventy square meters at a price of 5,067,000 rubles.  Three-room options are also at very reasonable prices (we recall that there are only five kilometers to the Moscow Ring Road): from sixty-five square meters, which cost 4,117,000 rubles, to eighty-three meters for 5,751,000. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transferring power lines to the LCD sovereign house" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1531651.jpg" width="301"></div>

    <p>  However, the number of rooms in the residential complex "Gosudarev House" is very arbitrary, since there are no internal walls upon delivery.  So, the same thirty-six meters can become a studio, and even a two-room apartment.  Only bathrooms are separated, and the zones of corridors, kitchens, rooms and walk-in closets are very conditional.  But the communications are carried out completely and completely: water, electricity on the panel, heating.  Also, the balcony doors, two-chamber double-glazed windows and all radiators are installed by the builder.  Variation in layout is a big plus.  Most solutions are in Lime buildings.  The prices, however, are the same, only the number of storeys and directly the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment can affect the price.  The above prices are set by Granel Development, and it is quite possible to buy the same footage cheaper from GVSU-Realty or Bastion.  Both of these companies interest customers with a flexible system of discounts, motivate them with other advantages, and therefore are highly rated in comparison with their competitors. </p>
