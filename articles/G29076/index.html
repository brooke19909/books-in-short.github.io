The beaches here were once chosen by European and American hippies, who were attracted here by solitude, proximity to nature and the ability to live in the simplicity of morals.  Although since then a lot of water has flowed, including salty sea, and the resort has become a prestige </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goa north beaches" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/288872.jpg" width="389"></div>  A great place to relax, having acquired hotels, restaurants and all kinds of entertainment, life here is still inexpensive.  Tasty and cheap to eat, admiring the surf, and to budget in a good hotel - these are the chips that Goa North boasts.

    <p>  The beaches of this resort, on the one hand, are similar to each other, and on the other, each of them has its own specifics.  They are gray in color, since the sand on which vacationers are happy to sunbathe is of volcanic origin.  Their combined length is about thirty kilometers.  North Goa, whose beaches are often separated by rather high and sharp cliffs, abounds with picturesque lagoons, where you can enjoy life without interference.  Therefore, esoteric lovers, seekers of a pure spirit and other people who are tired of the bustle of modern life still come here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The coast of this resort begins from the famous Fort Tiracol. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Photo beaches of North Goa" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/288877.jpg" width="600"></div>  This beach is practically deserted, and by its state one can judge how the local places looked many years ago.  But not one such shore is in the resort of Goa North.  The beaches of Arambol and Morjim are also chosen by those who want to spend their holidays as calmly as possible.  However, the last coast is practically at the mercy of Russian tourists.  In coastal cafes there is no shortage of waiters, which can be explained without problems.  There is even a very popular, including among local authorities, Russian restaurant.  But Arambol has such a feature that its beach is long, and the sand is white.  Anjuna is the most ‚Äúparty‚Äù resort.  There are "fallen" clubs and famous parties are held there.  This coast is most often found in tourist photos.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches of north goa reviews" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/288878.jpg" width="300"></div>  The beaches of northern Goa are already becoming historical sites.  For example, Calangute, which once was a refuge exclusively hippies.  Now it has become an object of commercial exploitation.  However, it is quite easy to find cheap housing and food here, although to many it may seem too noisy, and its atmosphere can be intrusive.  Baga is suitable for children, in addition, there is a river that flows into the sea.  Beaches such as Candolim and Sinquerim are quiet, respectable, but have almost the same drawback: they are almost on the rocks, and it is very difficult to get to the water.  But there are practically no people there.  But one of the best beaches, most vacationers call Ashchem.  Although many still prefer Arambol.  These are the beaches of northern Goa.  Reviews about them are very diverse.  People have their own preferences.  Some people like pop-up beaches with a trans-party, others like Arambol's Saturday bazaars, and others are delighted with the solitude and indescribable sunsets of Ashvem.  In a word, even talking about the beaches of Goa, you can confirm the correctness of the saying that it is difficult to find a friend for taste and color.  Even when it comes to sea water and sand.
