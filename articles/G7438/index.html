  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to create a wifi hotspot</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, more and more new technologists have begun to develop, while communication technologists are not far behind and are moving forward.  One of these technologies has become Wi-Fi.  What is it and how to create a wifi access point?  We will try to answer all these questions now.  This technology will primarily connect not only computers to a single network.  Wi-Fi is equipped with all modern phones, it is present in laptops, and you can also purchase a portable transmitter for a personal computer.  In order to create such an access point at home, you must first install special drivers on your personal computer that support your receiver. </p><p>  Now everything is step by step and in order in the question of how to create a wifi access point for windows 7: </p><ol><li>  You need to download the new conectifi program and install it on your personal computer. </li><li>  You must go to the official website of the program and download add-ons for your router. </li><li>  Now you need to make sure that your <span>personal computer</span> has an active connection to the Internet. </li><li>  You need to enable your router in operating mode.  This is simple to do, you can press the power button on the router itself or, if it is already on, turn on the router in the <span>device manager.</span> </li><li>  Now install the recently downloaded conectifi program on your personal computer. </li><li>  When you install conectifi, the computer will ask you whether to install <span>additional equipment</span> or not.  Naturally, you must agree, because in this case this equipment is your router. </li><li>  Now you need to configure the program in the desired modes of operation. </li><li>  Next, you need to come up with the name of your access point and save it. </li><li>  You also need a password for your access point, which can consist of any Latin characters and must be greater than or equal to eight. </li><li>  That's it, now you can choose any connection you would like to distribute. </li></ol><p>  This convenient program will allow you to understand how to create a wifi access point, and integrate computers into a common system very quickly and without problems.  Now anyone with Wi-Fi receivers in gadgets can connect to your Wi-Fi access point.  Well, naturally, they need to know the password in order to connect to your access point.  Typically, this technology is used in universities or places where a large number of computers need to be combined into a single network.  Also, this very convenient option has appeared in many modern cafes or pizzerias.  You can sit on the Internet while drinking a cup of coffee.  And how to create a wifi access point in residential buildings?  For this, you can also use routers to connect computers to a common network.  The absence of wires and a very high connection speed guarantee good performance and limit the heap of unnecessary wires that only take up space.  Having a password in your access point makes wifi limited access for other users who cannot connect to your network.  In order to be able to connect to your access point, they need to have a wifi network key in the form of a password. </p><p>  In most developed cities, there are a huge number of created Wi-Fi access points.  You can open your laptop or phone with an existing receiver in any locality, and easily access the Internet.  No password is set at such access points, but speed has its limitations.  This is done for the convenience of users who need the Internet at the moment.  Basically, such access points are additional services in modern service centers and the service sector.  Download the program and configure your Wi-Fi access point, and then you can enjoy an Internet connection without having to wire and cable your entire house. </p>
