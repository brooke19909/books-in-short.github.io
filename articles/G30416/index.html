Since the individual learned to produce something in volumes exceeding the norm of his consumption, he began to change with other people.  But the inefficiency, and often the injustice of barter relations, prompted humanity to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating money.  The currency of different countries of the world is a phenomenon that originated a long time ago.  In the usual banknotes of different denominations, it did not transform very soon.  The transformation of money into new forms is still ongoing.  But all the same, for each country its monetary unit is a distinctive feature, a special symbol that serves as an indicator of the independence and uniqueness of the state. </p>

    <h2>  How many people - so many opinions </h2><p>  This phrase can be "replayed" as follows: "So many countries - so much money."  Although, to be precise, there are not so many currencies in the world.  Despite the fact that 251 states are officially recognized on the planet, not everyone has their own currency.  Why it happens?  The currency of different countries of the world often depends on many factors.  For example, whether this or that state is a member of economic or political unions, or whether it was previously colonial territory.  So, many <span>countries of the European Union</span> use one monetary unit, generally accepted for their association - the euro, and in countries that used to be subordinate to England, Spain, and France, the currency of overlords is still circulating. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, participation in a particular community of powers is not a prerequisite for abandoning the national currency.  For example, the UK - one of the main participants in the EU, did not give up its pound, which, however, is not surprising, because this currency is one of the backups in the global economy.  Other members of this union also went the same way - Poland, where the zloty is commonly used, Sweden with its own name crown, as well as Slovenia, on the territory of which the officially recognized Slovenian dollar, and Romania, issuing lei. </p><h2>  Currency symbol - why is it? </h2><p>  In the international classifier, each currency is assigned a special code and number.  This greatly simplifies the procedure for banking operations, various transactions and contracts.  The developed standards are recognized worldwide and are used in every country. </p>

    <p>  Writing all the currency symbols in one article is quite problematic, because there are quite a lot of them, but the main ones can be given in the form of a table.

They consist of several letters.  This is done in order to avoid confusion, because there are quite a few monetary units of the same name.  For example, the dollar is not only American, but also Canadian, Australian, Slovenian and even Liberian.  The same applies to the dinar, called Kuwaiti, Libyan, Thai and Tunisian, as well as the peso, actively rotating in the economy of Argentina, Cuba, Mexico, the Philippine Islands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  All monetary units have their own unique history.  The currency of different countries of the world is a special distinguishing feature of each power, its ‚Äúface‚Äù.  Money design is done at the state level.  For banknotes and coins, even peculiar beauty contests are held.  So, according to experts, the most attractive and aesthetic is the <span>Ukrainian hryvnia.</span>  More than 50 currencies participated in the competition, and the selection criteria were rather stringent.  Banknotes tore, crumpled, checking for strength.  In addition, the quality of the pictures depicted on the banknotes and the overall style were evaluated. </p><p>  Making money is the prerogative of the state, but dishonest businessmen are very fond of crafting fake banknotes.  Moreover, such a practice has existed for a very long time.  For example, American dollars - this is perhaps one of the most counterfeit currencies, according to statistics, in 1865 every third banknote in the United States was fake.  Although there is nothing surprising in this, because the first money in the country was made in the attic of the "Treasury" during the Civil War.  The difficult situation at that time clearly did not contribute to the observance of all the rules and security measures that apply to modern banknotes. </p>

    <p>  A special requirement that the currency of different countries of the world must meet is strength.  Standard bills are designed to be folded up to 4 thousand times, and the average life of a banknote is about seven years. </p><h2>  Global currency </h2><p>  People who are not directly related to banking and financial activities do not know what currency is valid in other countries.  For example, they are unaware that Morocco uses the dirham, Panama uses the balboa, and Brazil uses the cruzeiro.  Instead, practically all citizens of Russia have heard about the dollar, euro or pound.  Which currency in different countries of the world - actively used in other countries or not very popular - depends on how strongly developed the economy of a particular power.  The stronger it is, the stronger the national currency. </p><p>  There are countries in which, in a free (although not very honest and lawful) way, transactions and transactions are carried out not only in the country's currency, but also in the so-called world money.  First of all, these include the euro and the dollar.  Nowadays, amid the aggravated geopolitical situation, there is a lot of talk about creating a new currency that would not fuel the economy of individual countries.  The most ardent ideological creators of this promise are China and Russia, because their economies are developing quite rapidly, and the need to use <span>foreign currency</span> for international payments does not contribute to an equal situation. </p><h2>  Money - will humanity get rid of its influence? </h2><p>  Is it possible to imagine a person‚Äôs life without money as such?  I think no.  But even 50 years ago, no one could have thought that people would almost completely refuse to use real banknotes and coins.  But it happened!  Electronic payment systems, bank cards, online banking systematically and confidently push cash out of people's pockets and wallets.  This process is most pronounced in developed countries, where the financial system is developed at a very high level. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the so-called virtual money and currency of different countries of the world have recently been in constant confrontation.  Photos and articles in reputable financial publications describe this struggle in detail: who will be the winner?  The answer to this exciting question remains a mystery to everyone.  What is virtual money is unclear to many, but their creators persistently convince that they have a future.  Well, let's see. </p>
