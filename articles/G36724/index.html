All lakes of the region account for 7.8 thousand hectares. </p><h2>  Lake Borovoe </h2><p>  In the eastern part of the Moscow region, in the Noginsk district there is a large network of lakes that are contemporaries of the glaciation era.  Today, they are all at varying degrees of overgrowing. </p><p>  <span>Lake Borovoye</span> in the Noginsk region is surrounded by forests, in which there are many berries and mushrooms.  The pond itself "sheltered" many species of fish. </p><p>  The water in the reservoir is clean.  According to its hydrochemical composition, it is one of the cleanest in the region.  The lake belongs to the basin of the Timkov Lake Group.  The pond is located in the valley of the river Sherny. </p><p>  On the south coast are summer cottages, in the northeast - the village of Karavaevo.  The northern part is surrounded by a dense mixed forest. </p><p>  The deepest part of the reservoir reaches 20 meters.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lake is 12 hectares. </p><p>  Today, Lake Borovoye in the Noginsky district is leased by the Ministry of Defense to serve the recreation area. </p>

    <h2>  Geography and how to get </h2><p>  The lake is located 9 kilometers from the village of Noginsk, on the east side.  On the south side, at a distance of 2 km, is the Gorky highway.  Near the reservoir there is a settlement Bunkovskoe, the village of Karavaevo.  The <span>Big Moscow Ring</span> is located 14 km from the north-eastern side <span>,</span> and 10 km to the west in the small direction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to get to Lake Borovoe, Noginsk district?  There are several ways: </p><ul><li>  by bus No. 39, from the Noginsk railway station (from the Kursk station) to the village of Bolshoy Bunkovo.  Further northward to the Karavaevskaya factory, about 2 km.  Within walking distance (0.5 km) is the lake; </li><li>  by car, along the Gorky highway, to the village of Bunkova.  GPS coordinates: N55.87308 E38.59463. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Borovoe Noginsky district photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2139362.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Ichthyofauna and fishing </h2><p>  <span>Lake Borovoye</span> in the Noginsk region is rich in carps, breams, crucians, perches.  You can catch crayfish.  Previously, almost all reservoirs in the Moscow region could surprise even the most experienced fisherman with an assortment of fish.  There was a sterlet, a whitefish and even a sturgeon.  But the sewage from nearby plants and factories greatly polluted the water bodies of the Moscow region.  Periodically, measures are taken to improve the situation: </p><ul><li>  treatment plants of industrial enterprises are being modernized; </li><li>  the fight against poachers; </li><li>  a ban on net fishing has been introduced. </li></ul><p>  In addition, fry of various species of fish are periodically released into the waters.  The sufficiently large depth of Lake Borovoe in the Noginsky district is almost a 100% guarantee of catch.  There is always a good bite in any season. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many fishing enthusiasts come to this particular reservoir, due to the fact that there is night fishing here.  Shores covered with algae are decorated with lanterns, schools of fish are visible - this is a delightful sight not only for fishermen, but also for children who will definitely be delighted. </p>
