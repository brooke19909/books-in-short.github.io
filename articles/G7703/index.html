Tropical climate, good ecology, good service, plus democratic prices attract thousands of travelers here.  The resort capital of the island is Sanya.  This city on the south coast is full of shops, fashion boutiques, museums and all kinds of entertainment.  But many tourists say that in Sanya City itself is too noisy.  But on both sides of the city center extended resort areas.  Sanya has become an urban agglomeration, incorporating such bays as Dadonghai, Sanyavan and Yalunvan.  The last district is the most expensive.  It is built up with luxury hotels.  Fans of outdoor activities and tourists from Russia have chosen Dadonghai.  In this article we will talk about the Hyton Hotel Sanya 4 * hotel, which is located in this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSanya.  We built our description not only on the information provided by the hotelier, but also on the reviews of tourists.  But first, let's get acquainted with the resort where the hotel "Heaton 4 *" is located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hyton Hotel Sanya 4" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2110167.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Dadonghai, Sanya China </h2><p>  Why is this area so popular with Russian tourists?  Dadonghai is only two and a half kilometers from Sanya City, and if desired, you can walk there along the edge of the sea.  But in this quiet area there is no such clutter and noise as in the city center.  On the other hand, prices in Dadonghai are much lower than in neighboring Yalunvan.  From here it is also close to the western tip of Hainan, where all the attractions of the island are concentrated.  Dadonghai Beach (Sanya, China) is a two-kilometer strip of sand, arched by a crescent moon along the bay of the same name.  There is a kind of wind rose that attracts surfers.  But diving in Dadonghai is excellent.  Water, if the sea does not storm, is very transparent, with visibility up to 20 meters, and more than a hundred species of coral grow near the coast.  The reefs are inhabited by tropical fish and mollusks.  All this species diversity can be seen on the shelves of food markets, and in local restaurants and cafes.  Dadonghai is home to the most famous Sanya Park.  This is "The deer turned his head." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya China" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2110200.jpg"></div>
