Many years ago it was only a small village.  Today Khimki is an administrative-territorial unit that is constantly growing and developing.  Perhaps that is why the city is visited daily by a huge number of people.  Some come here on a business trip, while others come to work.  Both need housing.  True, not everyone can afford an expensive hotel.  Khimki hostels are always ready to provide city guests with affordable and decent housing. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.8956394725047" data-lng="37.44579661279295" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/9/0/5/3905.png"></div><h2>  Dormitory in the Firsanovka microdistrict </h2><p>  The issues of temporary residence are more interested in people who come to the city to earn money.  Due to lack of finance, hotels, even the cheapest ones, cannot afford them.  Rented apartments are also expensive.  In addition, it is necessary to draw up appropriate contracts.  And this requires additional time and financial costs.  For such guests numerous hostels of Khimki offer their services.  Moreover, there are a lot of them in the city.  The buildings are managed by the relevant organizations.  For example, the company ‚ÄúHospitable courtyard‚Äù offers those who wish to settle in a hostel located on Rechnaya street, 1 in the Firsanovka microdistrict.  This is a two-story building that can accommodate 265 people at a time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel Khimki" class="if uuid-2517499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11239/2517499.jpg"></div><p>  The rooms are quite comfortable and equipped with the most necessary furniture.  Each separate room must have: beds, wardrobe, bedside tables and a table with chairs.  Bed linen is changed once every two weeks.  On each floor there are toilets, showers, a kitchen, as well as a laundry room with a dryer.  A week of living in such an institution per person is 2800 rubles.  Given the conditions that the rest of the hostels of Khimki offer, this is quite acceptable and relatively inexpensive.  In addition, the building itself is located next to the train station and close to public transport. </p><h2>  Dormitory in the neighborhood Skhodnya </h2><p>  Very often, employers use hostel services to accommodate their employees.  For example, a group of builders travels to an object.  The company's management must provide people with accommodation for the duration of their work in accordance with the contract.  Khimki hostels often accept such collective applications.  For example, in the Skhodnya microdistrict, the Absolute company offers its customers accommodation in a convenient two-story building.  The building has only 11 rooms, which can accommodate 168 people.  This is relatively small by city standards.  In each separate room, depending on the specific application, from 8 to 20 people can simultaneously live.  The rooms have bunk beds, a desk, chests of drawers for personal items, a TV and a washbasin.  In the kitchen you can cook yourself.  To do this, there are electric stoves, microwave ovens, refrigerators and work desks.  After a hard day, people in the showers can wash and iron their clothes.  The minimum cost of living in such a place per person is 180 rubles per day.  For large collective applications, serious discounts are provided. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cheap hotels </h2><p>  People who come on a business trip still prefer to check into hotels.  In this case, it is desirable that the room was not 10, but 1 or 2 people.  What <span>hotels in Khimki</span> can be offered in this case <span>?</span>  The following hotels offer inexpensive accommodation with all amenities for their clients: </p><ul><li>  "Cher"; </li><li>  ‚ÄúThree hieroglyphs‚Äù; </li><li>  "Chestnut"; </li><li>  "Lighthouse" and others. </li></ul><p>  For those who want to live relatively cheaply in true comfort, the Aviator Hotel is ideal.  Visitors are offered single, double, triple and quadruple rooms.  In addition to a bed and a desk, each of them has a TV, as well as a private bathroom with all toiletries.  Guests are offered three meals a day in the hotel restaurant.  Those who wish can order breakfast in the room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap hotels in Khimki" class="if uuid-2517540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11239/2517540.jpg"></div><p>  A day's stay in such a hotel will cost the visitor about 2160 rubles.  This, of course, is more expensive than in a hostel.  But the conditions that customers offer here are worth it.  By the way, this is not the most expensive hotel in the suburbs.  It is quite accessible to ordinary business travelers. </p><h2>  Hostels Khimki </h2><p>  Recently, hostels have become very popular in the hotel business system.  These establishments are intended for temporary residence of clients with a small income.  Most often, the owners of construction companies use their services to place work crews.  People are offered accommodation in normal, comfortable conditions.  And for their employer it costs quite inexpensively.  Which is the best hostel in Khimki?  Here everything will depend on where this or that institution is located.  It should be convenient for people to get to work.  Among the most popular hostels of the city are: </p><ul><li>  "Comrade"; </li><li>  "Eagle"; </li><li>  "Absolute"; </li><li>  "Gangway"; </li><li>  "At the Youth." </li></ul><p>  Living conditions in them are almost the same.  For example, in the Tovarishch hostel located on Melnikov Avenue, there are 30 dormitory rooms for customers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.ihr24.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel in Khimki" class="if uuid-2517547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11239/2517547.jpg"></div><p>  The rooms have comfortable bunk beds, lockable wardrobes and a refrigerator.  For public use there is a kitchen, laundry, bathroom and a living room with a TV.  On average, living here one person per day costs 500 rubles.  For such conditions, this is not much. </p>
