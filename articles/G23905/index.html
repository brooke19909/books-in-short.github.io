He is surrounded by greenery.  Back in Soviet times, this place was famous for its <span>tea plantations.</span>  And still this culture continues to be grown here.  No wonder Chakvi is considered the capital of <span>Georgian tea.</span>  And here a real specialist began to grow these bushes here, who was discharged specially for this purpose from China back in the days of the Russian Empire.  Chakvi received the status <span>of an urban village</span> in the 50s of the last century, and became a resort not so long ago.  But over the literally last ten years, the leisure infrastructure has improved significantly, and more and more tourists from neighboring countries come to these places to spend their vacations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chakvi georgia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2157463.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Chakvi (Georgia) is located between other, more famous seaside resorts of the country - Cape Verde and Tsikhisdziri.  You can get to it from Batumi by shuttle vans.  Travel time is no more than a quarter of an hour.  Indeed, to Batumi from Chakvi is only 12 kilometers.  Minibus departs from the lower <span>cableway station.</span>  Ticket price - about one lari (21 rubles). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to live </h2><p>  In Chakvi (Georgia) you will be offered a variety of options for private rooms and apartments, which are rented to tourists on literally every corner.  In addition, there are about 20 hotels with all modern amenities.  The spread in prices is from 20 to 100 GEL (450-2150 rubles) per room per day. </p><p>  The largest and most popular hotels in Chakvi (Georgia) are Oasis and Champion.  The first of them offers tourists not only accommodation, but also three meals a day.  This, of course, is not "all inclusive", but the hotel is clearly striving to provide guests with some analogue of Turkish resorts, when vacationers are not only fed on the territory, but also entertained.  Many rooms in the hotel have balconies with sea views and panoramic windows, there are two pools.  Along the sea there is a path lined with palm trees.  In the private sector, the Seaside cottage complex right on the shore and the Palm Hotel are twenty meters from the water.  Everywhere very hospitable hosts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chakvi oasis georgia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2157460.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What to see and how to eat </h2><p>  There are no ancient temples or ancient fortresses in the village.  But the most interesting thing in the district is nature.  Tea and tangerine plantations, planting Japanese bamboo and eucalyptus groves simply beckon for a walk.  After all, the local climate is very good for rare tropical trees and bushes.  By the way, despite the high humidity, as is the case in the Caucasus, there are almost no mosquitoes in Chakvi (Georgia) due to the fact that all the surrounding areas are planted with exotic plants.  In addition, the village is easily accessible on foot to the famous Batumi Botanical Garden.  It‚Äôs just a kilometer and a half from its northern entrance.  If you live in a hotel with meals, then there should not be any problems where to eat.  Most private houses and guesthouses provide tourists with a kitchen with kitchenware.  And along the sea open cafe with a good selection of dishes.  There are, of course, traditional kebabs and khachapuri.  But most of all it is recommended to order grilled fish, preferably today's catch, with white wine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Chakvi Georgia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2157458.jpg"></div>

It is located in the north of the village, and it offers beautiful views of Batumi and neighboring capes.  The coast at the resort is mostly pebble.  Chakvi Beach shares with the neighboring village of Buknari.  The water itself has a small edge made of shell sand.  On the beach there are sun loungers and deck chairs, their rental is paid.  This pleasure is worth 1 or 2 GEL (21-42 rubles) for the whole day.  The length of the beach is about six kilometers.  The length of the coast and the climate make it possible to rest for the real "savages" who come with tents.  In season, there are a lot of them near the sea.  On the beaches there are even some places for camping.  True, there is one problem - the railway separates the beach from the village. </p><p>  The sea is clean, and even the waters of the rivers flowing into it do not make it muddy.  Despite the fact that this is a small <span>resort, a vacation</span> in Chakvi (Georgia) will hardly seem boring even to the most fastidious traveler.  In season, night discos and clubs, bars where they sit by companies until the morning open, and some establishments invite for billiards and bowling.  Maybe in Chakvi there are no entertainments of such scale as in Batumi.  But after all, and to go to this city is very close. </p>

    <h2>  Chakvi (Georgia): Travel Reviews </h2><p>  Travelers who have been here on vacation are increasingly leaving enthusiastic comments about this greenest resort in the country.  First of all, they note that the huge plus of the beach in the village is the lack of crowds to the people, which are a common thing for the Caucasus.  The beach is good, then not too clean.  An exception is the beach owned by the Oasis Hotel.  It is not only cleaned every day, but the pebbles there are very small, it feels like sand.  The railway by the beach is not too annoying, because trains do not run very often.  But there are no supermarkets in Chakvi.  Therefore, for big purchases you have to travel to Batumi or go to local small shops.  And there is not too much choice.  Those who want a secluded relaxation in the lap of nature love to go here.  In 2018, Chakvi is promised to be fully landscaped, and then it will probably be one of the best resorts for a relaxing, one might say, ‚Äúseal‚Äù vacation for families with children. </p>
