Reus - a city that surprises with its color</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A typical Catalan town, in which it is very easy to combine successful shopping and acquaintance with unique monuments, is not yet very popular among foreigners.  However, local authorities are trying to increase the flow of tourists, doing everything so that vacationers feel comfortable in a foreign land. </p><h2>  Calm and harmony </h2><p>  The Spanish Reus cannot boast of ancient history and a large number of architectural masterpieces, but this does not mean that there is nothing to see.  The second largest city in the province of Tarragona surprises with the special tranquility and pacification prevailing in the resort. </p><p>  A fussy settlement appeared in the XII century, but only after six centuries did it begin to develop rapidly.  Being the main commercial center of <span>Catalonia</span> for a long time <span>, the capital of</span> the Bais Camp region was second only to Barcelona in its economic importance.  But in cultural terms, until the XIX century, the city practically did not develop.  The Roman conquerors, and then the Spanish rich, were more attracted to neighboring cities than the colorful representative of Catalonia. </p><h2>  Art Nouveau buildings </h2><p>  We can say that relatively recently its main attractions appeared in the city.  Reus attracted the attention of a huge number of entrepreneurs who sought to surround themselves with luxury.  It was at this time that the appearance of the municipality in Spain began to change: beautiful buildings appeared, made in the modern architectural style - innovative and completely destroying stereotypes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="area approx" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1395055.jpg" width="600"></div>

Now there is even a special tourist route where vacationers will be able to see first-hand architectural sights.  Reus will surprise even the most sophisticated tourists with its masterpieces erected by talented architects. </p><h2>  Gaudi Museum </h2><p>  In 2007, one of the most unusual museums in the world opened, made of blue glass.  All of its exhibits are mock-ups of the fantastic creations of the brilliant architect Antonio Gaudi, who was born here in 1852. </p><p>  Tourists like that in a unique institution you can touch all objects with your hands to understand the plan of the great master.  An electronic guide, reviving near each layout, tells the story of the appearance of bizarre monuments created by Gaudi. </p><p>  Of particular interest is the <span>mirrored floor</span> with the interactive map of Barcelona on it.  The visitor swipes a finger at the marked icons and receives detailed information about each masterpiece designed by the architect in the form of a small film on the screen.  Moreover, tourists from Russia will not encounter difficulties in listening to the story, because most recently all the texts have been translated into Russian. </p>

    <p>  Perhaps no one will argue that the Gaudi Museum with unusual halls and exhibits are the main local attractions.  Reus is proud of the great architect who, unfortunately, did not build a single architectural monument in his hometown, and offers tourists a route related to the life of a closed genius. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The main temple of the city </h2><p>  The most ancient treasure of the resort is the Gothic cathedral, which is of great importance for the province of Tarragona.  The Church of St. Peter in Reus, which appeared in the XII century, was originally a modest structure in the Roman style.  Over time, the temple expanded and became the main religious building in which little Gaudi was baptized.  The fabulously beautiful building is adored by tourists who admit that the interiors of the temple are incredibly beautiful, as is its facade.  From the observation deck, located on a high bell tower, offers a wonderful view of the picturesque pearl of Spain. </p>

    <h2>  Central Square Prim </h2><p>  You can not ignore the main square, located in the historical part of the city.  A favorite place for walking of all tourists, decorated with baroque mansions, can be called an open-air museum.  Cozy square is a monument of antiquity where cheerful fairs are held on holidays. </p><p>  There is also a sculpture of General Prim, a famous military commander, whom residents paid tribute to. </p>
