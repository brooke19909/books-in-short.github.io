Despite this, you can find people who do not know the rules.  But no one wants to feel like an outcast in the company just because life has never provided an opportunity to play in Activity.  We will tell you the rules of the game below.  If you read everything carefully, you can surprise your friends with your quick wit. </p><h2>  The meaning of the game </h2><p>  If you have never seen Activity in your eyes, then you can vaguely imagine what you should do as a participant.  In fact, everything is simple.  In "Activity" there is a field with cells, as in many board games.  Teams compete, and if they win, then their chip moves, and if they do not succeed, the chip remains in place.  The rules of the game ‚ÄúActivity‚Äù are simple: you need to explain the word with the help of words, facial expressions and gestures, as well as through the picture.  The team whose chip comes to the finish faster wins. </p><p>  "Activity" is a cross between all the beloved "Crocodile", "Contact" and "Hat".  But only the process is more exciting, as the team game, which means there is a competitive moment. </p><h2>  Pantomime </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rules of the game activity understandable explanation" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2217576.jpg"></div>  The rules of the Activiti game are clear even to a child.  If the team gets into the cell of the field, where it is necessary to explain the meaning of the word without using speech, then you will have to show with gestures.  But there are many nuances.  In addition to the fact that a person does not have the right to open his mouth and make any sounds, he is also limited in how he will demonstrate the task.  The rules of the game prohibit the display of words by letters and numbers.  That is, you can‚Äôt write words with your finger in the air, and you can‚Äôt use your fingers to indicate objects that are in the room or outside.  If you show the countertop, then simply point to the table will not be possible.  But how to get out?  But this is not written in the rules.  Each person decides for himself.  You can jump, run, actively gesticulate, as well as help yourself with facial expressions.  The task of the team at this time is to guess the word.  Unlike the Crocodile, here you can‚Äôt be afraid that your friends, by bantering, will specifically ‚Äúpull the rubber‚Äù to look at the funny pantomime.  In "Activity" time for the demonstration of words is limited.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="activity travel game rules" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2217539.jpg"></div>  One of the methods of guessing, which is prescribed in the rules of the game ‚ÄúActiviti‚Äù, is an explanation using words.  Many like this option more than active pantomime.  But, as in the previous task, not everything is as simple as it seems at first glance.  Coexisting words cannot be used for explanation.  And it is precisely with this point that problems arise.  Very few people know how to consciously control their speech, and therefore often words that cannot be pronounced are broken off the tongue.  In this case, the move passes to another team.

    <p>  In unfamiliar companies, there is another unwritten rule.  More often than not, one of the players explains the word to his team, but everyone can guess in the open round.  So the amendment is that the concepts must be described by well-known facts, and not by personal memories.  For example, you cannot explain the word like this: "Remember, in the third grade you did dancing, so which ones?"  Few know this personal information. </p><h2>  Picture </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="activate everything possible game rules" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2217536.jpg"></div>  Considering the rules of the board game "Activiti", you can find a third way of explaining the word.  And it will be drawing.  When a player stands on the appropriate square on the playing field, he must explain the word with a pencil and a piece of paper.  And again, there are a few taboos.  Naturally, you cannot write words.  Yes, actually, in general, even depicting individual letters of the alphabet is prohibited.  And then what can be done?  Draw objects that are written on the card.  But not every company has professional artists.  This is the whole interest of the game.  It's funny to see how the person who took the pencil for the first time in five years is trying to portray a boar.  But if animals with grief can be drawn in half, then what about more complex concepts?  Break the drawings into several parts.  Let us examine the example of the word "seaman".  The first part of the word can be depicted as the sea, and the second - in the form of walking legs.  Putting these two parts together is definitely easier than drawing the whole concept.  By the way, it is not forbidden to use mathematical symbols.

And to make it more convenient to measure it, you just can not do without additional devices.  The hourglass is calculated per minute.  It is during this time that the player must have time to show his word. </p><p>  True, time will still have to be timed.  When all the teams are at the start, someone needs to start.  The daredevil pulls out a card and in 10 seconds must explain the word.  Only after that the team enters the game.

Everything is possible thanks to cards.  How do they look?  They are somewhat similar to ordinary <span>playing cards.</span>  Although there are many differences.  Cards for the game "Activity" have a boring one-color shirt, they are equipped with numbers.  This is not a serial number.  The number on the map shows its complexity.  The player must soberly assess his strengths in one way or another explanation and choose for himself a suitable option.  The difficulty level is only three.  The lightest cards are marked with the number 3, the most complex - with the number 5. 4 is an intermediate step.  For example, a player cannot draw, but he needs to explain the word in this way.  Then he can ease his task and pull out a card with the number three.  But if you need the word "tell", and a person knows that he is good at this, he can take the cardboard, which is marked with the number 5.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="activity rules for children" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2217528.jpg"></div>  There are many variations of the Activiti game.  But they are all united by the general rules of the game.  ‚ÄúActivity-travel‚Äù, the children's version of the game, ‚ÄúActivity for adults‚Äù, ‚ÄúActivity-code word‚Äù, you can list for a long time.  How many players can take part?  It is most interesting to play when there are a lot of people in a team.  But a lot - the concept is loose.  10 people - these are two teams of 5 people, and this is ideal.  Actually, Activity was invented as a game for a large company.  But it is not always possible to recruit 10 people.  The minimum number of players is three people.  This allows the family to spend the evening with joint antics.  For three people, the rules will be non-standard.  In this case there will be no teams.  Everyone plays for themselves.  But 4 people will be able to break into two teams.  In this case, the game is already going by all the rules.

All participants are divided into two teams.  The right of the first move can be played in different ways, for example, toss a coin or solve this issue by drawing lots.  The winning team selects one candidate, and this person in 10 seconds explains any word from any card.  The way a person will communicate is selected at the discretion of the player.  If his team guessed the word, then it goes forward.  The number of cells that you need to advance is easy to figure out by looking at the card shirt.  Now it‚Äôs the turn of the other team to do the same.  After the start is successfully overcome, the game begins.  Each of the team members in strict order demonstrates the word in the way that is shown on the cell of the playing field where the chip is.  The task number on the card must be sought there.  But the complexity of the card can be chosen independently.  Someone thinks that <span>you are going quieter, you will continue,</span> and some, on the contrary, are pulling difficult tasks all the time.  The chip moves across the field by the number of cells that is drawn on the back of the shirt.  But you can only move if the team guessed the word.  But if the players do not understand the vague explanations of a friend, the chip will stand still.  The team that comes to the finish first wins.

    <h2>  Children's Game Rules </h2><p>  As an attentive reader could already notice, all of the Activity games are very similar.  The tasks and their complexity are changing.  But the methods of explanation remain unchanged.  What is the difference between the rules of the Activiti game for children from the adult version?  In words.  In the children's version there are no complex concepts that sometimes show an adult as an impossible task.  All the concepts written on the cards will be familiar to the child.  And you can find a game in which instead of words pictures will be displayed.  In this case, preschoolers who do not yet know how to take part in the general fun.  Why, then, do we need a game where the child will not be able to learn new words, but will operate with already known concepts?  By showing animals, birds, and surrounding objects, children train imagination, logic, and acting. </p><h2>  Advice </h2>

For example, in a ‚Äúbattle by the rules‚Äù, when both teams have the ability to guess the same word, a player can intentionally take the easiest card.

    <p>  If parents play with children, then perhaps you should increase the time to demonstrate this or that task.  Therefore, you can turn the hourglass twice.  Then even the kids team will have a chance to win. </p><p>  Not always a difficult word can be explained in a minute.  This task will seem easier if you break the concept into parts.  Explaining a hydropower plant in one word will simply be impossible.  It is worth breaking this concept into three parts: to show water, electricity and a station.  Team members will be able to combine these words. </p>
