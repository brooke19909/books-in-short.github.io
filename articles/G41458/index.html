  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The election process in the Russian Federation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The election process is a concept that characterizes the activities for the preparation and implementation of elections.  It is carried out in several stages. </p><p>  The election process and its stages </p><p>  The first step is to compile lists of the electorate.  They include all citizens who have reached the age of eighteen.  Voter lists are compiled at the precinct commission, taking into account data transmitted by housing authorities.  A citizen can be included in the list in only one area.  The compiled lists are available for review not later than fifteen days before the election.  Every citizen has the right to refuse to be included in the lists.  He informs the commission about his unwillingness.  In addition, citizens may report any inaccuracies or errors in the lists.  This right can only be exercised before the vote count. </p><p>  The election process also includes the formation and approval of polling stations and constituencies.  The boundaries of the districts and the number of voting citizens are determined by the relevant commission, and approved by the relevant authority.  These actions are carried out no later than sixty days before the election. </p><p>  Polling stations are formed for the purpose of voting and subsequent vote counting.  Their formation is carried out by the head of local authority in coordination with the relevant commissions no later than a month before the election.  The formation of precincts takes place in accordance with local and other conditions, with the creation of maximum conveniences for voters, at the rate of not more than three thousand citizens at the precinct. </p><p>  The election process necessarily includes the stage of formation of commissions.  There is a special system that contains the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation, commissions of subjects, districts, regions, cities, municipalities, precincts.  The formation of this system is determined by the norms of law. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Election commissions are called collegial bodies in which decision-making is carried out by a majority of voters, and decisions are signed by the secretary and chairman.  The activities of these bodies are not dependent on state bodies or local government agencies.  Moreover, the implementation of the powers of election commissions is carried out with the assistance of the latter. </p><p>  Actions, decisions or inaction of collegial bodies and officials related to them that violate the rights of voting citizens can be appealed in court or to a higher collegial body. </p><p>  Not a single electoral process is complete without registration and nomination of candidates.  This stage is considered the main. </p><p>  Nomination may be by electoral associations.  It takes place at a conference or congress of a bloc of parties or parties. </p><p>  Nomination can be made by the voters themselves.  In this case, it is supposed to collect signatures on the application of the candidate.  There is also a form of self-promotion. </p><p>  Applying any type of nomination, the candidate demonstrates that he has the support of a certain part of society. </p><p>  The electoral process includes <span>campaigning.</span>  At this stage, the activities of <span>public associations,</span> citizens in the preparation and dissemination of a certain type of information are carried out.  The purpose of campaigning is to encourage voters to vote for or against certain candidates.  The dissemination of information begins on the day of registration. </p><p>  The next step is to vote.  This stage, of course, is considered the most important in the entire election process.  As a result of voting, some candidates will be eligible to participate in the next round or elective mandate. </p><p>  The election commission ensures secrecy of voting, registration, as well as the safety of ballots. </p><p>  The final stage of the election process is the counting of votes, determining the election results.  Results from all districts flock to the Central Commission.  She announces the results of the vote and publishes them in the media. </p>
