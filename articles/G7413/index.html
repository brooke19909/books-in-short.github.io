Innovations affected not only its size, but also its functions.  So, the creators managed not only to expand the phone book, but also to achieve a significant improvement in authentication security.  Today, such cards are massively used in small gadgets.  But most people who are forced to change their phone often do not want to change their familiar and familiar number.  Therefore, many of them are interested in <span>how to trim a SIM card</span> under a micro-sim. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to crop a SIM card under a micro sim" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40827/1167487.jpg" width="429"></div></h2><h2>  What are the main parts of a sim card? </h2><p>  In order to better understand how to trim a SIM card, you need to have at least a minimal idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat it consists of.  An ordinary SIM card consists of two parts - a SIM chip and a plastic plate.  The first is a metal core on which all information is stored.  For those who have an ordinary SIM card, it is very important not to damage this chip when cutting it.  The second serves as a decorative frame for the chip and does not carry any functional load.  It is she who is considered the very part that the mini-SIM does not need. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to cut off this unnecessary plastic and what is needed for this?  First of all, you should make sure that everything you need is at hand.  So, to trim the SIM card, you will definitely need: </p><ul><li>  sandpaper; </li><li>  stationery knife; </li><li>  pencil; </li><li>  accurate ruler. </li></ul><p>  If there is no <span>clerical knife,</span> it can be replaced with sharp scissors. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to trim sim card" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40827/1167491.jpg" width="533"></div></h2><h2>  Existing SIM formats </h2><p>  Today, in addition to the standard SIM cards, mini-, micro- and nano-SIM are actively used.  All of them are derived from the first SIM card, the dimensions of which were comparable to the size of bank cards.  One of the main reasons that prompted phone manufacturers to reduce the size of a SIM card is considered to be free space in the device itself.  Therefore, using the example of reducing the subscriber identifier module, you can get a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe evolutionary stages of mobile devices.  Using micro- and nano-sims allows you to free up additional space for more compact placement of elements. </p><p>  Traditional mini-sims are suitable for most phones released before 2011.  A micro-sim card can be inserted into more modern models, while a nano-sim is designed exclusively for iPhone 5 / 5s. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mini sim how to crop" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40827/1167496.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Clear definition of crop line </h2><p>  Before trimming a SIM card under a micro-sim, it is necessary to mark the cropping lines.  This can be done using an accurate ruler.  Around the chip, a 15x12 mm rectangle is marked and drawn.  In order not to accidentally damage the chip, a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãplastic is left around it.  Those who have a non-standard enlarged card will have to cut in the immediate vicinity of the edge of the metal plate.  In this case, you must be extremely careful not to spoil the SIM. </p><h2>  Removing the plastic cover </h2><p>  Before trimming a SIM card under a micro-SIM, it is worth getting manicure scissors with sharp thin blades.  They are ideal for trimming the plastic framing the chip.  You need to act, slowly and without making sudden movements.  Otherwise, there is a risk of damage to the card.  In the process of trimming the plastic casing, it is imperative to cut a small corner from the side that is on the previous map.  This is necessary so that the new SIM card fits seamlessly into the slot. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ordinary sim card" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40827/1167509.jpg" width="250"></div></h2><h2>  Trying and necessary correction </h2><p>  After successful completion of all the above manipulations, it is necessary to ‚Äútry on‚Äù the resulting card.  To do this, you need to put it in the slot of your phone.  After making sure that Simka is firmly in place, you can try to turn on the phone and wait until it catches the network of the mobile operator. </p><p>  If it turned out that the SIM card is a little too big and therefore does not fit in the slot, it can be slightly corrected with sandpaper.  Attempts to cut half a millimeter of excess plastic with scissors or an office knife can lead to the fact that the card will have to be simply thrown away, since it is unrealistic to rehabilitate a damaged SIM card. </p><h2>  Alternative methods for modifying an old map </h2><p>  For those who are interested in how to trim a SIM card under a micro-sim, but do not dare to do it yourself, you can offer one more option.  To do this, you just need to contact your mobile phone service provider with a request to replace the card. </p><p>  To do this, you will need to drive to the office of the company and, presenting your passport, pick up a new SIM card in exchange for the old one.  The new card is a standard mini-sim, which, if necessary, can be adapted for micro.  To do this, simply squeeze out a smaller card by pressing hard on the perforation applied at the edges of the micro-sim card. </p><p>  In case of replacing the old SIM card, not only the tariff plan, but also all your subscriptions are saved on the new card.  The previous card will be deactivated by the operator within 24 hours. </p>
