However, epic, that is, real, is significantly different from folk fantasy.  Of course, the events described in the legends are much exaggerated.  But scientists find confirmation that they have taken place in real life.  For example, in the caves of the Kiev Lavra lies cancer with the imperishable <span>relics of Ilya Muromets,</span> who lived during the reign of Prince <span>Vladimir the Red Sun.</span>  At the same time, Svyatogor also lived - a hero who repeatedly met with the winner of the Nightingale the Robber. </p>

    <p>  Ilya Muromets, Dobrynya Nikitich and Alyosha Popovich are the most famous three ancient Russian epic knights, the prototypes of which, by the way, were real people.  But the tales tell another man, no less revered.  This is the hero Svyatogor, whose biography is known mainly from epics.  What he was - is not known for certain.  After all, in the days when Svyatogor-Bogatyr lived, there were neither cameras nor television.  According to legend, he was a real giant: he could easily put another knight in his pocket, and even with a horse!  He also carried a casket with his beautiful wife.  The epics tell how the hero of our story met with Muromets, how they became twin, how Svyatogor got married (the moral is this: you won‚Äôt get away from fate) and how he punished the unfaithful spouse. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  According to epics, the hero lived on the high Holy Mountains (hence his nickname), but did not visit the cities and towns of Russia.  Why?  The Russian hero Svyatogor was above the forest, his head reached the clouds, When he was going on a road-way, the world shook, the rivers poured out of the banks, the forests swayed.  Mother Earth Cheese held it with difficulty.  Therefore, probably, he so rarely left his house and went to the people.  His strength was very great, and even arrived day after day.  But this was his curse, his torment: there was no other hero who could be compared in strength to a hero.  Therefore, he did not know where to put her, and in the end she killed him.  We can definitely say that Svyatogor is a supernatural being, therefore doomed to death in advance.  Confirmation of this is the coffin he found in the open field, which took the body of the hero and stopped his ordeal. </p><p>  According to one version, Svyatogor the hero is a descendant of the Lemurians, the giants who used to inhabit our planet.  Perhaps the last of a kind, therefore, stayed away from the <span>human race,</span> while treating it very friendly, although he did not understand it.  However, such a judgment remains only a hypothesis - without confirmation and refutation. </p>

    <p>  But some researchers believe that they found the hero‚Äôs last refuge.  The period of the war between the inhabitants of Russia and the Pechenegs includes the boyar barrow Gulbische near Chernigov.  The man buried in it (Svyatogor-bogatyr?), Although he did not belong to the princely family, was still very noble and important, as evidenced by the objects in the burial.  The weapons and things of the deceased are impressive.  Perhaps here lies the historical prototype of the glorious epic hero?  It is worth noting that the location of the mound also raises the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe veracity of the epics.  The cemetery is located on the Boldin Mountains, near the Holy Grove.  Weren't these rocks the home of Svyatogor? </p><p>  Be that as it may, it can be assumed that a man of great growth and great strength, so vividly described in the Slavic epos, really walked on Russian soil and did good. </p>
