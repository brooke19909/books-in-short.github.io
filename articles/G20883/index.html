Let's try to figure it out. </p><p>  This article not only tells in details about such a truly amazing place as Divnogorye (Voronezh region is fraught with many secrets and mysteries, but this reserve really deserves special attention).

The Voronezh region, which cannot be noted, is, in principle, famous for the names that are harmonious for any Russian person.

    <p>  The reserve is located at a distance of 10 km from the nearest regional center, on the right bank <span>of the Don River.</span>  In order to get there from Voronezh itself, it is necessary to overcome 80 km to the south. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is unlikely that anyone will dispute the fact that at the moment a favorite corner of local residents who for some reason cannot travel far from home is precisely Divnogorye (Voronezh region).  Rest here is to the liking of both lovers of active and adherents of passive pastime.  There are not so many guests yet, but statistics show that their number is only increasing from year to year. </p><p>  In general, the plateau is from May to October, and these months are considered the most favorable for excursions; more than 60 thousand people visit it annually. </p><h2>  How did the name </h2>

For many years now, the Voronezh region has been the subject of close attention of various kinds of scientists, mainly ethnographers and cultural scientists.  It was possible to establish that the territory received such a name for a reason.  This happened thanks to the chalk pillars of the remnants, which the locals called the "diva" (miracle).  For the first time, the name was recorded in writing in 1389. Ignatius Smolyanin, who accompanied Metropolitan Pimen, made detailed notes about the path traveled.

    <h2>  Property Description </h2><p>  Museum Divnogorye (Voronezh region) has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 11 km <sup>2</sup> .  From a purely geological point of view, it is considered unique because of the Cretaceous deposits that were discovered throughout its territory.  The highest point of the plateau is 181 m above sea level.  In this place, the modest <span>river Quiet pine</span> flows into the huge Don. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In summer, the earth‚Äôs surface in this place heats up quite a lot, and this factor, whatever one may say, prevents precipitation.  It is precisely because of this that it is so arid in the summer.  Inside the chalk layers there are voids that can be easily detected even by the sound of a person walking on the surface.  According to scientists, the result of drought can safely be considered inhibition of water erosion and a decrease in the likelihood of <span>karst failures.</span> </p>

    <p>  It was established that the composition of the chalk in the upper layer of the plateau is about 15‚Äì20%, in the lower layer, which has a thickness of 80 m, is 100%. </p><p>  In 1860, part of this territory was blown up.  This was done in order to carry out the necessary railway line.  Since then, vandalism and sheep farms have caused irreparable harm to the reserve. </p><h2>  Divnogorye, Voronezh region.  How to get to your destination </h2><p>  From Voronezh to the famous reserve you need to drive about 100 km, following the Don highway M4.  A little later you will need to turn right near the direction indicator to Liski.  Further, the drivers are already guided by the signs "Ostrogorsk", passing a large bridge over the Don River and moving along the main road.  Before reaching the <span>railway crossing,</span> you need to turn to the right.  Just in this place there is a direct pointer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Throughout the rest of the journey, no one will have to stop to ask a simple passer-by: ‚ÄúAnd you don‚Äôt know where Divnogorye (Voronezh region) is located?  How to get to your destination as soon as possible? ‚Äù  Everywhere there are markers of the road to the reserve. </p><p>  In addition, by rail from Moscow to the reserve there is the opportunity to get there by train.  True, after you have to transfer to the train. </p><p>  If necessary, spend the night in a hotel in the village of Divnogorye or in Liski. </p><h2>  Famous monument of architecture </h2><p>  It can be argued that, in general, our country is famous for its cathedrals, temples, and simply magnificent buildings known throughout the world.  Divnogorye (Voronezh region) is no exception.  The monastery, called the Assumption - is another confirmation of this statement. </p><p>  The construction is located 18 km from the city of Ostrogozhsk and 7 km from the city of Korotoyak, exactly in the place where the <span>chalk mountain</span> and unusual pillars are located.  Historians managed to find out that the monastery was founded around 1640 by hieromonk Joasaph and Xenophon.  In 1826, the building was almost completely restored, and a little later it was decided to replenish it with icons and property from the Ascension Korotoyak monastery. </p>

    <p>  Today, the main shrine of the Cathedral Assumption Church of the <span>Divnogorsk Monastery</span> is the Sicilian miraculous icon of the Mother of God, which is depicted on the throne with a baby.  Experts say that it was once performed in the Greco-Byzantine style.  Ordinary residents first saw the shrine only in 1092. According to legend, after the capture of Constantinople, the icon was transferred to Russia, and the Divnogorsky monastery already received it from its founders. </p><p>  In addition, inside the chalk pillar, on the upper slope of the mountain, there is a carved church of St.  I. Forerunner.  An altar rises above the building at a height of several steps.  The throne is carved in stone.  There is a cave on the right side of the entrance.  Here everyone can see the remains of the founders of the monastery. </p><p>  Those who follow south from this holy place for every Orthodox person will be able to look at another church, or rather, what is left of it.  Now there is only a chapel. </p><h2>  Natural monuments </h2><p>  The necropolis and the ruins of a medieval fortress - the Mayatsky settlement and the Mayatsky pottery complex - are still preserved in the reserve.  These ancient monuments date back to the 9th-10th centuries. </p><p>  Unfortunately, most of the chalk pillars were destroyed during the construction of the railway, but today there are 5 more such unusual natural monuments in Divnogorye that can be accessed by a special wooden staircase. </p>

    <p>  Visitors enjoy climbing Mount Shatrishche, located 7 km from the railway platform.  The Kazan Church was once located in this place.  Now it is abandoned, organized excursions are not conducted here, so only the most desperate travelers can visit such a mysterious place. </p><p>  In addition, not everyone knows that the Museum also includes the Cretaceous Canyon - a deep and winding ravine with sheer walls.  Bypassing it, you can perfectly consider the restored settlement from the time of the Salt-Mayak culture. </p><h2>  Flora and Fauna Divnogorye </h2>

A lot of time on its territory people were engaged in farming, mainly related to sheep breeding.  That is why the vegetation of the reserve was destroyed.  However, due to the fact that cattle grazing is prohibited here today, and the number of people has decreased significantly, the grass cover has already been partially restored.

    <p>  More than 250 species of petrophytic and xerophytic plants grow here.  Botanists of 40% of the vegetation of Divnogorye are classified as calciphytes (small lovers).  On the surface of the plateau, the Kozo-Polyansky breaker and gelatinous algae-algae are often found - plants that are considered quite rare in the Russian Federation.  In 1956, a forest protection strip of ash and maple was planted in the center of the plateau. </p><p>  Occasionally, on the territory of the reserve you can see the golden eagle and bustard listed in the Red Book.  There are also a lot of bee-evers and eagle owls, hares and foxes.  Bats live in crevices. </p><h2>  Local features </h2><p>  Many travelers argue that visiting Divnogorye is best in the warm season, when the heat is not yet felt so much.  For example, in May, June or early fall.  In the summer in the reserve it is stuffy, in winter it is cold and windy, therefore walks in the fresh air are unlikely to bring the expected pleasure. </p><p>  Both the administration of the museum-reserve and many regular guests claim that the April flood of the Don is a sight that is truly mesmerizing.  Floodplain meadows fill up with meltwater, and relict trees and grasses begin to bloom wildly. </p><p>  In winter, local residents and guests of the Voronezh region enjoy sledding from the mountains and organize real festivities. </p><p>  It is recommended to stay overnight at a local hotel, which not only meets all the requirements and requirements of modern travelers, but also has a spacious and 24-hour guarded parking lot. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention that during the tourist season in Divnogorye various exhibitions, festivals and concerts are held. </p>
