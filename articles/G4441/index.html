Most cities in Cyprus have many historically significant <span>monuments, attractions,</span> museums and parks. </p><p>  Nicosia - the capital of Cyprus </p><p>  Nicosia is located between two mountain ranges.  It is located in the center of the island and has no access to the sea and this is different from the rest of the major cities of Cyprus.  The main political and administrative forces of the country were concentrated here.  The city is divided into new and old.  In the old part, various architectural styles are presented, so that it acquires a special charm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus cities" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/274573.jpg" width="400"></div>  The influence of French, Turkish and Italian medieval styles is felt. <br>  It is noteworthy that along with the Catholic churches, you can see Turkish mosques.  The <span>Hagia Sophia Cathedral,</span> built in the 13th century, is amazing in its splendor, but the Arab Ahmed Pasha Mosque, which dates back to the 17th century, looks no less colorful.  In Nicosia, the Byzantine Museum houses icons of Cypriot artists.  You should also visit the local archaeological museum, which presents many of the antiquities of the island.

    <p>  Resorts in Cyprus </p><p>  One of the most attractive for tourists is the small town of Paphos.  And this is not surprising.  This stunningly beautiful city is included in the UNESCO list.  Its residents honor traditions, and there are so many attractions on the territory that it is hard to believe that they are located on such a modest square.  Even the names of streets and avenues themselves are fanned by a fleur of national traditions and history, which is worth at least Poseidon Avenue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="resort towns of Cyprus" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/274569.jpg" width="600"></div>  Near the city, in the small village, the ruins of the sanctuary of Aphrodite were found.  It is also believed that she came out of the sea waves near Paphos.  For tourists there are special zones.  From one beach to another can be reached by public transport.  Also from two points of the city by taxi you can get to Nicosia and <span>Limassol.</span>  <span>Limassol</span> is one of the largest cities in Cyprus and, in combination, its economic and financial center.  There are good beaches with gray sand, and in some places - pebble.  A good addition to the rest will be walks in ancient castles, visits to churches and cathedrals, as well as participation in local festivals.  This city practically does not sleep.  You can not say about the third largest city in Cyprus - Larnaca.  He, on the contrary, is quiet and unhurried.  An undoubted advantage of it is the presence of an international airport (most of the aircraft from Russia land here).  Some buildings have been preserved here since antiquity.  The Muslim-style port built by the Turks in the 17th century is very beautiful. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cities of Cyprus list" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/275318.jpg" width="395"></div>

    <p>  Ayia Napa is also one of the most comfortable resort cities in Cyprus.  There is everything for a fun outdoor activity.  <span>Water skiing,</span> diving, surfing.  In addition, the city has a very vibrant nightlife.  Ayia Napa clubs and discos attract young people from all over the world. </p><p>  Hospitable people, mild climate - this is what the cities of Cyprus are known for.  Their list is small, but in each you can spend an unforgettable vacation. </p>
