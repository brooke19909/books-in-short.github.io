Saki is located on the western <span>coast of the Crimean</span> peninsula, five kilometers from the sea.  Many people come to this well-known <span>balneological resort</span> to improve their health.  And really, mineral springs, healing mud, arboretum and magnificent nature - all this helps thousands of tourists not only from Russia, but also from the former CIS countries and Europe to come to Saki.  Crimea, the prices for vacations in which are becoming more and more stable from year to year, over the past two or three years has become a favorite vacation spot for many of our compatriots who previously chose several other destinations, for example, <span>Egypt or Turkey.</span> </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  There are several versions about the origin of oikonym.  According to one, the city was given the name of the Scythians, who once inhabited it.  According to the second version, “mud” is translated from Turkic as “saki”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Saki" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1282974.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The exact date of the appearance of the first settlement on the site of the city has not been established.  About twenty-five centuries ago, this part of the Crimean coast began to be actively inhabited by Greek colonists.  Some historians believe that it was from this time that the history of Sak began.  At the beginning of our millennium, the village was well known to the Romans, as evidenced by the numerous ancient coins found during excavations in the vicinity of the resort. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The mud from <span>Lake Saki</span> for medicinal purposes began to be used by people in the Middle Ages.  According to legend, he noticed the healing of local silt Chumak, who came to these places for salt.  When his heavily overloaded oxen got stuck in the coastal mud, he had to carry with them until the morning, stamping in slush with his sore feet.  However, on arriving home, Chumak was surprised to find that a long-standing pain that tormented him for many years had left him ... </p><p>  Since 1827, the county doctor S. Auger began to officially practice in Saki, doing exclusively mud therapy.  This decision was prompted by the results of those studies conducted by Russian scientists who revealed the chemical composition and unique healing properties of the mixture. </p><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  People come to Saki to plunge into a salt lake, which stretches for five kilometers near the village.  It appeared on the site of a river flooded about five millennia ago by the Black Sea, at the bottom of which clay, pebbles, silt and salt were gradually deposited.  The resulting mixture, as it turned out, has healing properties.  It is for the sake of this therapeutic mud that many come here to rest.  You can come to Saki in any season.  The mud here has a unique composition, in some respects it is even better than that in the Dead Sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather in Saki" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1282973.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Salt of local lakes in the Middle Ages began to be consumed: it is here that the famous Chumatsky Way runs along which the Cossacks used to go to Crimea for “white gold”. </p><p>  Another factor due to which many Russians choose a vacation here: tourists come to Saki to visit the slightly alkaline mineral springs.  Their water in its properties is not inferior to analogues from Essentuki or Truskavets. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Another natural resource that makes vacation here attractive is the weather.  In Saki, five kilometers distant from the sea and located in the coastal steppe climate, the average annual temperature is 11.2 ° C with a humidity of 77 percent.  Summer is usually hot here: in July, as a rule, the thermometer is held at +23.3 ° .  Winter, in turn, is mild.  The average February temperature does not fall below one degree of frost.  Weather in Saki is usually “greedy” for precipitation, but also “generous” in the sun, which shines over the region for more than two and a half thousand hours a year.  The swimming season here begins from the first days of June and lasts until the beginning of October.  During this period, the water warms up to seventeen degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="G.

    <h2>  What can be seen </h2><p>  People come to this resort not only for rest: many fly to Saki, judging by the reviews, in order to combine treatment with visiting local attractions.

    <p>  The best Saki sanatoriums are medical institutions named after N. N. Burdenko and them.  N. Pirogova, “Blue Wave”, “Tangier”, “Northern Lights”, “Yurmino”.  In the city there are many health resorts of various levels, ranging from the economy class to large medical centers.  Many come to rest in Saki, choosing hotels or pensions working on an all-inclusive system for accommodation.  As a rule, they all have a swimming pool, playgrounds, gyms.  Such popular sanatoriums as Poltava (Saki) offer service and accommodation, which are not inferior to those that modern medical centers can boast for a high-class holiday.  For the convenience of guests, meals here in high season are organized according to the "buffet" system. </p><h2>  Poltava </h2><p>  Many Crimean sanatoriums were built in Soviet times.  But today they are completely renovated and turned into unique hospitals.  Some of them, for example, Poltava (Saki), had at one time all-Union fame.  Today, the fame of this Crimean health resort has reached Europe.  People come here from Germany and Israel, from Canada and many other countries.  Annually, Poltava receives more than two thousand patients from far and near abroad.  She was awarded high awards both from domestic resort organizations and from European ones.  The cost of living with treatment in a double room (with meals) in the high season starts at one thousand eight hundred rubles per day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Saki Crimea prices" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1282969.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and beaches - a wonderful vacation </h2><p>  You can come to Saki at any time of the year.  Rest here is somewhat different from that offered by neighboring Crimean resorts.  The fact is that in Saki the sea beach as such does not exist, since the city is not located on the coast.  Therefore, those who want to leave the hotel in a couple of minutes to be on the beach are not recommended to go here.  You need to get to the sea by public transport, which drives off to the beach stop.  From Sak to the sea ten minutes drive. </p><p>  The closest is the central city beach.  It has a sand cover, it is fully equipped, admission is free.  In seven kilometers, near the village of Novofedorovka, there is another good beach.  But many prefer to go to the wild bathing area, located behind the children's camp.  Titova. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in saki" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1285858.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Things to do in Saki </h2><p>  I must say that there are not so many entertainments at this resort.  Therefore, it is more suitable for a calm and measured rest, combined with mud therapy.  Of course, there are places in the city where tourists can go to relax.  These are cafes, restaurants, casinos, billiards.  But for nightly entertainment and other "pleasures" you will need to go, for example, to neighboring Yevpatoriya.  Not far from Sak was built an entertainment complex called "The Sun."  On an area of ​​four and a half hectares, there is a 450-meter equipped beach, equipment rental, water rides, a diving center with professional instructors, sports grounds for aquabol or streetball, volleyball and paintball.  There are also bars and cafes offering dishes of national cuisines of Crimean nationalities, as well as the largest dance floor in Crimea, accommodating three thousand people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Saki sanatoriums" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1282970.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Guest houses are very popular with tourists.  Saki is a place where you can come, hoping for an economical vacation.  Guest houses here are surprisingly high level of service and reasonable prices.  In the private sector, as elsewhere in the Crimea, you can relatively inexpensive to rent a house that fully meets the needs.  This option is perfect for those tourists who come here on an economical vacation, in guest houses.  Saki, judging by the reviews, is a resort where everyone will find a room for their taste and budget.  And guest houses offer services similar to those in hotels or hotels, but at prices much more affordable.  For example, last summer for a stay in the "Golden Fish" in the high season (a double room with a kitchen, but without food, that is, you have to cook it yourself), they asked for a thousand rubles a day. </p><p>  In turn, guest houses located in the suburbs of Sak, on the first coastline, such as Zolotoy, Valeo, etc., cost a little more - from 1,500 to 2,500 rubles (without meals).  All of them have a patio, a shared kitchen and a bathroom (shared, on the floor or individual, depending on the category of the room). </p>
