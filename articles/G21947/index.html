    <p>  The impressions of the rest of many guests, according to them, are unforgettable.  According to tourists, Mysea Hotels Incekum 4 * is a wonderful hotel for families.  Many hope to return here again next year. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Mysea Hotels Incekum 4 * (photo presented in the article) is located in the village of Inzhekum ‚Äã‚Äã(100 km from the airport of Antalya, 22 km from Alanya, 2 km from the resort village of Konakli).  Refers to the type of country hotels, remote from large cities.  Beach, located on the 2nd line from the sea (the distance from it is 200-1000 m). </p><h2>  Attractions nearby </h2><p>  From Mysea Hotels Incekum 4 * are nearby: </p><ul><li>  Union Travel is 1.45 km from here. </li><li>  Sealanya is 2.2 km away. </li><li>  AlanyaFunSeaPark - 19.83 km. </li><li>  AromaticHeavenValley is 3.43 km away. </li></ul><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The convenience of guests at Mysea Hotels Incekum 4 * (Avsallar, Alanya) is ensured by the presence of: bars, restaurant, cafe / bar, outdoor and indoor pools, a conference room and a banquet hall, free Wi-Fi, an Internet cafe, an elevator, a hairdresser, a salon beauty, doctor, SPA-center. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  The youngest guests at the Mysea Incekum Hotel 4 * (Alanya) can spend interesting time: </p><ul><li>  in the children's pool; </li><li>  At the playground; </li><li>  at the kids club. </li></ul><p>  The restaurant also offers a children's menu and highchairs. </p><h2>  What do guests say about conditions for children? </h2><p>  I must say that vacationers do not always speak favorably about children staying at the hotel.  So, tourists write about the playground that, in fact, the shells installed on it cannot be used.  The whole is one carousel, the rest - swings, slides and stairs - all in cracks or completely broken. </p><h2>  For entertainment and sports </h2><p>  Guests at the hotel enjoy spending time at a disco, playing table tennis or beach volleyball, darts, volleyball.  In addition, they have the opportunity to do aerobics, take part in animation programs, listen to live music. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mysea hotels incekum 4 description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2053100.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  How do vacationers respond to animations? </h2><p>  In the evenings, the hotel hosts animations for children and adults.  All entertainment ends at 23.30.  Later, those who wish to continue the fun are provided with a drive to the night club.  From 24.00 on the territory is complete silence and peace. </p><p>  Many reviewers write that animation is provided in the hotel, but almost never.  Until 21:30, the animators are engaged in drawing with the children, etc. (paid), and when those wishing to pay for the services end, they begin to entertain the rest of the guests (until about 22).  The program of animators guests call boring.  Some tourists complain that there is nowhere to get out of the hotel, especially at lunchtime, when there is heat and you can‚Äôt go to the beach.  But mostly vacationers find something for themselves. </p><h2>  Free service </h2><p>  In the Mysea Hotels Incekum 4 * hotel (Turkey, Alanya, Incekum), guests can use the free services: fitness center, saunas, Turkish bath.  In addition, vacationers can play table tennis and darts for free, swim in the pool, take part in entertainment programs. </p><p>  The reviews contain information that some children swimming in the pool developed a rash and fever.  After that, the pool was cleaned, and many continued to swim there as if nothing had happened. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mysea hotels incekum 4 avsallar alanya" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2053072.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  At extra charge </h2><p>  For a fee, guests can visit the Turkish bath, use the services of a massage therapist, play billiards, go windsurfing, parasailing, scuba diving, go on a boat trip, go water skiing, canoeing. </p><h2>  General amenities </h2><p>  The list of common amenities provided by hotel guests consists of: room service, the possibility of using a conference room, doctor's services, non-smoking room, TV room, car rental, postal service, 1 indoor and 1 outdoor restaurant, bar, safe at the reception .

For a fee, a shuttle service is available, including an airport shuttle, fax / photocopying, and a 24-hour front desk.

Umbrellas, chaise lounges and mattresses for vacationers can be used free of charge. </p><h2>  How do guests say about the beach? </h2><p>  Vacationers in their reviews report that from the hotel to the sea a leisurely step can be reached in 3-5 minutes.  The beach is small.  In the high season, there is enough space on it exclusively for those who are not too lazy to come early and take a sunbed.  Many reviewers call the beach area dirty.  They note that tourists allow themselves to smoke here, show lack of culture.  Bags, bull-calves, glasses are scattered in the sand, although litter bins are everywhere, surrounded by stray dogs and sparrows.  The situation, according to vacationers, is aggravated by the fact that a small area is completely laden with sunbeds, which makes it difficult to clean up here. </p><p>  Water in the sea, the authors of reviews share, is quite warm.  Some find it even too much.  Depth is called suitable for children of any age.  According to holidaymakers, in these places the water is more saline than in the Black Sea (every 2 or 3 times), but it‚Äôs easy to get used to it. </p><h2>  Food &amp; Beverage </h2><p>  Food guests receive: </p><ul><li>  in the snack bar; </li><li>  in the restaurant ("buffet"); </li><li>  in the bar. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mysea hotels incekum 4 photos" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2053049.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Guest opinion on nutrition </h2><p>  Mostly guests call the food in the local restaurant varied, tasty and of high quality and thank the hotel team for the full range of services provided.  But in some reviews, the food in the hotel is called monotonous.  Although the authors note the presence in the diet of fruits and vegetables, desserts.  Soups cooked in the local kitchen were not liked by many.  The second usually serves pasta, rice, potatoes.  To them - chicken meat, usually boiled, with gravy.  From alcohol is vodka and sherry.  Juices and water are available to guests in unlimited quantities.  According to residents, the restaurant has a lot of broken dishes, with chips.  In addition, guests noted that it was not thoroughly washed: there were visible stains on the glasses. </p><h2>  Most Popular Amenities </h2><p>  According to reviews, most of all guests like this place: </p><ul><li>  free wifi </li><li>  transfer from / to the airport; </li><li>  beach (first line); </li><li>  family rooms; </li><li>  spa and wellness center; </li><li>  fitness center; </li><li>  the bar. </li></ul><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Mysea Incekum Hotel has 107 rooms.

The maid may not clean up the trash, even if an impressive amount has already accumulated.  When choosing a room, reviewers advise future guests to "be easier" and not look for flaws.

Among the minuses are the presence of weak Internet in the lobby and the lack of it in the rooms, crowding and dirt on the beach, poor-quality dishwashing in a restaurant, a broken playground.  The hotel is recommended as a budget option for accommodation of unpretentious tourists. </p>
