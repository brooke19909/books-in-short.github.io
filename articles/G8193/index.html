    <h2>  What is dominion </h2><p>  In history textbooks, dominions are states that in the 19th-20th centuries.  were part of the British Empire.  Joining took place on a voluntary basis.  Dominion countries before becoming status were dependent colonies, and became self-governing, while England was a sovereign state.  Dominions (former colonies) recognized the head of the empire of the ruling English king (queen) and obeyed the laws of England. </p><h2>  The history of the British colonies </h2><p>  The British state is a conquering country.  In the XIII century, England was a powerful power.  The state wanted to expand its own territory.  Then the country captured Ireland.  And in the 16th century, Newfoundland became part of the empire. </p><p>  In 1588, England defeated the Spanish fleet and subjugated America, and then Portugal.  The American city of Virginia was founded by the British, and New Amsterdam was renamed New York. </p><p>  Striving for independence, the English settlements in America conducted a successful liberation war, and England lost 13 colonies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In the <span>19th century, the British</span> government subjugated New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, and Australia.  Following them, China added to the list of colonies.  At the end of the century, England captured Cyprus, Egypt and the Suez Canal, Afghanistan and the vast territories of South Africa: Nigeria, the Gold Coast, Uganda, Kenya and others. </p><h2>  The history of the term "dominion" </h2><p>  In history, "dominion" is a term that appeared at the end of the 18th century, shortly before the start of the American Revolution.  Two authors - <span>James Wilson</span> and Thomas Jefferson - issued two independent brochures in which each of them examined the legislative power of England. </p><p>  According to the laws of the country, Britain could not create colonies because the inhabitants of the latter should have a legal representative.  Then the authors in their works put forward the idea of ​​creating parliaments in the colonies and giving the territories independence, but at the same time leaving them in the British Empire as dominant countries.  According to history, this proposal was accepted only in 1867, when the first dominion country, Canada, joined Britain. </p><h2>  What did dominion status mean </h2><p>  First of all, the status of dominion gave a high level of autonomy to the acceding state.  But also meant its dependence on the policies and decisions made in England. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The financial obligations of the colonies were less than those of the capital.  In the event of the bankruptcy of the subordinate country, any dominion or Britain could offer it to pay off the debt, but the dominion bankrupt in this case lost its autonomy and became completely subordinate to the state that paid the debts. </p><p>  The political system in the dominions was created in the likeness of the British state.  But, depending on the culture of the countries, the level of centralization of the local government was different, it was only in indirect control, while direct control was carried out by England. </p><p>  Each dominion created its own parliament and government, which was headed by an elected prime minister.  Parliaments and governments were accountable to the Governor General of Britain. </p><p>  At the same time, the governor-general of the empire was a direct representative of both the British government and the king (queen).  His authority was to appoint and dismiss government representatives in dominant countries.  This, according to history, was not limited by the decisions of the parliament, the power that gave the right to use the veto (ban) to all adopted laws. </p><h2>  Dominion countries </h2><p>  The list of dominant countries of the British Empire included about 50. The largest states are North America, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, India, Malta, Ceylon and others. </p>

    <h2>  British Commonwealth </h2><p>  The military power of England was growing, its territory was becoming more and more, and the relocation of the British to the colonial countries spread the English language throughout the world.  Thus, the role of British immigrants who moved to Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the <span>Union of South Africa</span> in creating a multi-million white population was huge. </p><p>  In 1887, a conference was held in London at which all aspects of the empire's new colonial policy were discussed.  The developed colonies (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the South American Union, Newfoundland, Ireland) became dominions and entered the so-called <span>community of nations.</span> </p><p>  In 1926, a conference of prime ministers of the British government and the governments of the dominions of England was held in Great Britain.  At the meeting, the Balfour Declaration on the equal membership of dominions and Great Britain was signed on the basis of dependence on each other in political decisions and fidelity to the crown. </p><p>  In December 1931, the status of the "British Commonwealth" was finally secured by the signed Westmin Statute. </p>
