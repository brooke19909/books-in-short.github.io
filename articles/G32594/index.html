The reporting plan contains information on the calculation period and the period for determining financial results.  It also indicates the forms of internal and external documents, a schedule for their preparation and presentation.

    <h2>  Structural features </h2><p>  The quantitative composition of the unit will depend on the size of the enterprise, the types of its activities and industry.  Of no small importance is the nature, volume and production technology, the number of other <span>structural units</span> in the company, their territorial location, the level of staff qualification, and so on.  Currently, in practice there are three types of accounting organization: </p><ol><li>  Hierarchical (linear).  In this case, all employees of the financial department report to the chief accountant.  This structure is usually used in small enterprises. </li><li>  Vertical (linear-staff).  In this case, intermediate controls are formed.  They are headed by senior accountants.  This type of structure is used in large and medium-sized firms. </li><li>  Combined (functional). </li></ol><h2>  Centralization </h2><p>  Of great importance in creating the structure of the accounting apparatus is the adopted procedure for the distribution of activities between specific areas of production.  Currently, two types of systems are widespread: centralized and decentralized.  The first involves the concentration of analytical and synthetic accounting, reporting, balance sheet in the main accounting.  In the divisions of the enterprise (in teams, workshops, on sites, in departments, etc.), the primary collection and systematization of information on ongoing business operations is carried out.  Information from the documentation is grouped in the relevant statements, reports of production and movement of material assets.  After this, the initial securities are sent to the financial department.  Here they are checked and processed.  The necessary entries are made in the respective accounting registers of the organization's sources of property.  Centralization of control over financial activities allows the most rational distribution of tasks between employees, using modern systems of mechanization and automation.  Such a system works effectively in small, medium and some large enterprises. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="organization property accounting" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1390971.jpg" width="300"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Decentralization </h2><p>  It lies in the fact that the tasks of individual units include not only the primary accounting of sources of formation of the property of the organization, but also the generalization of information on synthetic and analytical accounts.  The same departments make up the balance sheet and other financial documents.  After that, reports are submitted to the main accounting department.  There they are verified and reduced throughout the enterprise as a whole. </p><h2>  Pros and cons of the model </h2><p>  The main disadvantage of a decentralized system is the fragmentation of the apparatus, difficulties in applying a single financial policy and the introduction of automation.  This, in turn, leads to more expensive information.  Meanwhile, decentralization is necessary with territorial isolation, a variety of types of activities carried out at the enterprise, the introduction of collective forms of labor and payment.  Its undoubted advantage is the ability to keep records directly at the place of business operations.  The proximity of specialists to the objects of management contributes to the improvement of analytical, informational, control functions of the internal financial system.  The managers of the enterprise, in turn, have the opportunity to analyze and assess the state of the production efficiency management scheme, the marginal profit received in each division of the company.  It follows that the use of decentralization is determined by the application of the conceptual provisions of the marginal utility model, the input-output-output scheme. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accounting inventory of property liabilities of the organization" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1390972.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  At present, in practice, partial decentralization of the accounting system is quite widespread.  It lies in the fact that in the <span>structural divisions of the enterprise,</span> together with the consolidated documentation, postings are made.  In other words, analytical accounting is carried out, information is grouped and systematized, but the generalization of information is limited to the compilation of reports on production operations.  Partial decentralization is quite popular in companies where commercial (business) settlement with departments is applied.  At such enterprises modern models of organization of production, labor activity and its payment are being introduced.  In general, accounting is critical to the company.  Information allows you to objectively assess the condition of assets, the amount of material assets employed in production and in stock, the amount of debts to creditors.  Systematized, reliable and timely information provides an opportunity to analyze the economic activities of the company, to identify the most promising and unprofitable areas of work.  Based on the results, management can predict future activities.  For example, if the indicators are high, you can think about expanding the business and opening branches. </p>
