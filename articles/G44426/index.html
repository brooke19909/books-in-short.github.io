    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists for leisure, as well as visiting business and special occasions choose the hotel-park "Nemchinovka".  Reviews about this place contain a huge number of positive comments: </p><ul><li>  the rooms are very beautiful, and also a lot of living space; </li><li>  if you settle in two-room rooms, there will be a TV in the living room and in the bedroom; </li><li>  excellent wireless internet signal quality; </li><li>  incredibly beautiful view from the window; </li><li>  large well-groomed territory; </li><li>  good infrastructure. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Of the negative aspects, it is worth noting the following: </p><ul><li>  despite the fact that the hotel is located in a park area, its territory is quite noisy (and even closed windows do not save); </li><li>  there are no refrigerators in the rooms, and therefore you have to eat in the restaurant (which is quite expensive); </li><li>  in the bathroom there are no shelves for cosmetic and other accessories; </li><li>  the rooms have a smell of tobacco smoke (airing does not help, since it has already soaked into the furniture); </li><li>  very uncomfortable mattresses on the beds (after them the back is terribly sore); </li><li>  very weak pressure of water in the shower; </li><li>  double beds have too small blankets; </li><li>  breakfast is very modest for its price; </li><li>  the waiters in the restaurant are slow and, moreover, are not very polite to the guests; </li><li>  in many rooms, instead of a double bed, you are offered 2 shifted beds; </li><li>  there is no duvet cover for an extra blanket; </li><li>  drinking water is not provided; </li><li>  there are no utensils in the rooms (not even cups or ordinary glasses). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The hotel "Nemchinovka" is very popular.  This is largely due to the fact that it is located near the capital in a picturesque park area.  Many people come here to relax from the bustle of the city, and someone prefers to hold celebrations and business events here. </p><p>  It is worth noting the attractive concept of the ch√¢teau hotel, which meets high European standards and traditions.  However, the implementation is not entirely ideal.  There are some problems with the service, as well as with the equipment of the rooms.  In addition, due to the proximity to the carriageway, the territory is very noisy, which is a disappointment for guests seeking peace and quiet.  Nevertheless, if you consider this option as a venue for a celebration, then this is simply the perfect solution.  Here you will be rendered all kinds of assistance in organizational matters, as well as beautiful design and many related services will be provided. </p>
