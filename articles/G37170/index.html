The cost of the catch is either included in the price of the ‚Äúvoucher‚Äù, or paid separately, depending on the chosen tariff. </p><p>  Fishing "At Borodin" can bring a lot of joy.  After all, there are two whole ponds rich in various types of fish at the guests' service.  In addition, extremely polite and sociable employees work here, who will surely familiarize you with the rules and conditions of their stay on the territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Borodin fishing" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2369/463131.jpg" width="448"></div>

And even if you don‚Äôt have the necessary equipment, you shouldn‚Äôt worry, because on the territory of the base you can rent everything you need for successful fishing.  Here you will be offered a fishing rod and a landing net, you can buy lure and bait - there are worms, pasta for trout, maggots and much more on sale.  This is extremely convenient for those who do not have the opportunity to get it all in the city. </p><h2>  What fish are found in the lake? </h2><p>  Fishing "At Borodin", of course, paid.  But it‚Äôs worth paying for such a pleasure.  After all, you are given the opportunity to get a lot of different fish.  Naturally, crucians and carps are found here, you can catch a pike.  There are catfish, whitefish and cupid.  And not so long ago, trout and sturgeon were launched into the water.  By the way, you also have to pay for the catch.  And the price of a kilogram of fish directly depends on its type.  For example, a kilogram of sturgeon will cost 700 rubles.  But pike and catfish are cheaper - 400 rubles per kilogram. </p><p>  By the way, here you can exchange fresh, just caught fish for stockfish. </p>

    <h2>  How much is the pleasure? </h2><p>  In fact, fishing "At Borodin" will not cost so much.  It all depends on the amount spent on the basis of time, as well as the catch.  For example, 2750 rubles will cost you a day in the park.  At the same time, you can take no more than 15 kilograms of any caught fish with you - you will have to pay extra for the rest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If 24 hours is too much, then you can pay the second tariff (1750 rubles).  With this pass you can stay in the base for no more than ten hours and take with you about 7 kilograms of caught fish.  In addition, there is another option - you can pay 1250 rubles, which will give you the right to fish for five hours and take home three kilograms of catch. </p><p>  But the base offers another, no less convenient option, which is the best suited for those people who are limited in time.  This is an hourly rate.  An hour of fishing will cost you 200 rubles, which, you see, is pretty good, especially in the winter.  And, of course, you will have to pay separately for the ‚Äúbooty‚Äù. </p><p>  Of course, not every guest of the base is obliged to pay the full cost of the pass, especially if he himself is not going to fish.  There is a so-called guest voucher for people (in most cases these are women or children) accompanying the fisherman - it will cost 350 rubles.  By the way, children under the age of twelve can stay in the park with their parents for free. </p>

For violation of this rule, the visitor must pay a fine of 2000 rubles and give all the ‚Äúbooty‚Äù. </p><p>  Ponds are exclusively for fishing.  It is forbidden to swim at the base, turn on music loudly or make too much noise.  All questions can be discussed in advance (the database has its own website: luckyfishing.ru). </p>

    <h2>  Rest by the lake </h2><p>  Around the lakes there is a small park area where everyone can have a great time.  Naturally, you will also have to pay for such pleasure, but the prices here are quite reasonable.  A pass for one person costs 500 rubles, it makes it possible to stay at the base for 12 hours, but without the right to fish. </p><p>  Fishing "At Borodin" can become a real family holiday.  After all, the territory of the complex is equipped with spacious wooden arbors, where it is always nice to sit, enjoying nature, clean air and talking with friends. </p><p>  It is worth noting that you can use the gazebos only for a fee - 150 rubles per person per hour.  By the way, here you can rent barbecues and buy coal, which is very convenient.  On the other hand, it is strictly forbidden to fry caught fish at the stake, but for a small fee the base staff will prepare it for you. </p>

    <h2>  Winter fishing </h2><p>  It is immediately worth noting that in winter the fishing process in water bodies is organized no worse than in the warm season.  The owners made sure that visitors feel comfortable and confident.  In both ponds they fish from ice.  In addition, an aerator creates an open water mirror on a large lake.  Thus, you will have the opportunity to choose the method that you like best. </p><p>  What kind of prey should you expect in the winter months?  Mostly trout, perch and pike are caught here.  Again, the necessary bait or bait can be purchased on the spot.  By the way, experienced fishermen advise you to buy an hourly pass in the cold season, because daylight hours in winter are much shorter. </p>
