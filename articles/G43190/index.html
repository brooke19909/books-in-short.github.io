The exploits of Alesha Popovich and Dobryni Nikitich are described in many legends and reflect a whole layer of worldview of the period of Kievan Rus.  In this article, we will understand who these heroes are, and also find out what some of these heroes are famous for. </p><h2>  Epic heroes </h2><p>  In epics such words as ‚Äúhero‚Äù and ‚Äúhero‚Äù are mentioned.  Let's deal with their origin. </p><p>  Researchers have not yet reached a single agreement, so there are several versions.  The hero has similar sounding analogs in the Aryan language (‚Äúlucky‚Äù), in Mongolian (‚Äúbagadur‚Äù - ‚Äúdaredevil, brave horseman‚Äù). </p>

    <p>  The hero, presumably, comes from the verb ‚Äúto beat,‚Äù that is, it means ‚Äúwarrior‚Äù.  According to the second version, this is the word ‚ÄúViking‚Äù modified in the Slavic manner. </p><p>  The heroes are divided by researchers into two classifications. </p><p>  The first highlights the elders, younger and heroes of Kievan Rus.  The former include heroes personifying hostile forces to man.  These are Svyatogor, Mikula Selyaninovich, Polkan, Ivan Kolyvanovich, Samson and some others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The younger ones already have a human appearance, without the ability to change shape, unlike the elders.  These include Nightingale, Churila, Duke. </p><p>  The epic about Kiev heroes is based on the exploits of Alyosha Popovich and Dobryni Nikitich.  Also mentioned are Ilya Muromets, Mikhailo Potok, Ivan Gostiny son and others. </p><p>  The second classification is based on periods - the pre-Tatar period, the Tatar and Moscow.  In it, these same knights are located in a slightly different order. </p><h2>  Who is Dobrynya Nikitich? </h2><p>  The life and exploits of Dobrynia Nikitich are described in many epics.  It belongs to the period of Kievan Rus and is depicted as a serving knight under Prince Vladimir Krasno Solnyshko. </p>

    <p>  It is believed that he took the daughter of Mikula Selyaninovich Nastasya as his wife. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that among all the heroes of this era, he is in the closest relationship with the princely family.  He carries out not only military missions, but also diplomatic missions, and also collects and delivers tribute. </p><p>  In addition, Dobrynya often performs tasks that other heroes refuse. </p><p>  In popularity, he is in second place, after Ilya Muromets, and is often portrayed as his companion. </p><p>  Judging by the legends, Dobrynya early discovered in himself a "heroic fortress."  Next, we will get to know his merits, but the most distinguished are the three exploits of Dobryni Nikitich.  The battle with the Serpent, the battle with the Danube Ivanovich and assistance in the extraction of the bride to Prince Vladimir. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Origin of the image </h2><p>  Researchers of Russian epics are inclined to believe that this image is collective.  However, many argue that it is built on several prototypes of real historical figures. </p><p>  The main argument in favor of the high ranking of this hero is "veterancy", which is mentioned more than once in the songs.  With this word, our ancestors denoted courtesy, the ability to find a common language, a diplomatic gift. </p><p>  Judging by the epics, his father is Ryazan governor Nikita.  However, researchers of the Slavic epos believe that the prototype of Dobrynia was the uncle of Prince <span>Vladimir Krasno Solnyshko, the</span> brother of his mother, Malushi.  This governor was called the same as the <span>epic hero.</span> </p><p>  One of the facts that can prove the plausibility of the version is as follows: the chronicles indicate the forced baptism of Novgorodians, in some epics this moment corresponds to the time when Dobrynya Nikitich lived. </p><h2>  Fight with the Serpent Gorynych </h2><p>  The first feat of Dobrynia Nikitich has a plot similar to many legends of the ancient world.  The battle with the dragon, the serpent, the root cause of evil takes place in the myths of different nations. </p>

    <p>  So, what do we know from epics? </p><p>  Feeling the awakening power, Dobrynya began to "walk along the pole."  Once he told his mother that he wanted to go to the Pochayna River.  According to legend, she had an unusual property.  There were two streams in it, which moved in opposite directions and cut everyone who tried to swim across. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There, the hero meets the Serpent of Gorynych.  A battle ensues, and after the victory of the knight, the monster promises to never attack the Russian land and not rob the villages.  But according to the classical canons of the genre, the Serpent immediately violates the given word.  He abducts the daughter of the Kiev prince Vladimir Krasno Solnyshko. </p><p>  Further the hero is already acting on the orders of the ruler.  In general, the exploits of Alyosha Popovich and Dobrynia Nikitich are often campaigns at the request or request of the prince. </p><p>  Having received magical things from his mother (chain mail, a sword-treasurer, a mighty warhorse), the hero finds the serpent's den.  There he is confronted by younger dragons, whom he easily defeats. </p>

    <p>  The battle with Gorynych dragged on for three days.  When the forces had already left the knight, he heard a voice from heaven, which said that it was necessary to hold out for another three hours.  Having survived the battle, Dobrynya overthrew the monster, but almost drowned in his blood.  He escaped because the earth parted and absorbed everything. </p><p>  Further, he frees not only the princess, but also many of the children of the rulers of neighboring states. </p><h2>  Fight with Danube Ivanovich </h2><p>  This epic shows the confrontation between Kiev and neighboring tribes.  Danube - a tragic image in the Russian epic.  Once this hero served the Lithuanian prince, but, having fallen out of favor, he left for Russia.  The legend about the bride‚Äôs marriage for Vladimir also says that the Danube also takes away her sister Nastasya, whom she once had feelings for. </p><p>  But at the wedding, the warriors began to compete in archery, and the Danube accidentally killed Nastasya.  When he finds out that she was pregnant, he rushes to his saber.  Legend has it that <span>the Danube River</span> formed from his blood <span>.</span> </p><p>  Bylina, on the battle of this Lithuanian with Dobrynya, tells about the events that occurred before the match.  The plot is as follows.  The Kiev hero rode across the field and saw a velvet tent, on which was an inscription that anyone who approached him would die. </p><p>  Dobrynya chirped, drank wine from the tent and destroyed it.  He himself fell asleep at this place.  The returning Danube decided to punish the offender.  He woke the knight, and they fought for several days.  At first, all the weapons were chopped off, after which they fought hand-to-hand. </p><p>  According to one version, they were reconciled by a passing Ilya Muromets, according to another - they went to the court to Vladimir Krasno Solnyshko.  The prince, after hearing both, acquitted Dobrynya and put the Danube in the cellar because he threatened his hero. </p><h2>  Who is Alyosha Popovich? </h2><p>  The next most popular epic hero is Alyosha, the son of Popovich.  His father is considered to be a pop from Rostov Levonti, however, sometimes he is called Fedor. <br>  The story of Alyosha Popovich is mentioned in two epics, where he acts as the main character.  In the rest, he is a minor participant or is mentioned in passing. </p>

    <p>  If you do not take into account two legends about his exploits, basically this hero is a controversial, and often a negative character.  Many researchers draw parallels between him and Volga Svyatoslavich. </p><p>  Thus, the characterization of Alyosha Popovich, which emerges from the legends, does not quite correspond to the image of the ‚Äúhero of the Russian land‚Äù. </p><p>  The only epic in which this lame warrior who is not distinguished by great strength is shown in a positive role is the legend of his battle with Tugarin.  We will talk about it further. </p><h2>  Alyosha and Tugarin </h2><p>  A similar epic in content is about the battle of this hero with Skim the beast.  In fact, it reproduces exactly all the main points of the legend about the victory over Tugarin. </p>

    <p>  The plot of the legend is as follows.  Alyosha comes with his skillful and agile servant Yekim to Kiev to Kiev.  Here at the feast he meets Tugarin, who "lays his head on the princess‚Äôs chest."  Seeing the voracity and greed of the snake, Alyosha begins to make fun of him.  First, he compares the warrior with his father‚Äôs dog, which choked with bone and died of greed, later with a cow. </p><p>  Offended Tugarin throws a knife at him, but Ekim catches him on the fly.  Then Alyosha calls the enemy to the battle ‚Äúin the open field‚Äù. </p><p>  Judging by the epic, he wins with God's help and using cunning. <br>  At first Tugarin flew on ‚Äúpaper wings‚Äù, but Alyosha prayed in the temple and it started to rain.  After the serpent fell, the hero drove up to him and said: ‚ÄúWhy did you bring such a big strong with you?‚Äù </p><p>  When Tugarin turned around to see what the hero had in mind, the latter chopped off his head.  This scene shows the character of Alyosha Popovich: a warrior often achieved his goal not by force, but by cunning.  In some ways, his image is similar to that of Homer's Odyssey. </p><h2>  What do the researchers say? </h2><p>  If we consider the exploits of Alyosha Popovich, a summary of which can be found in many collections of epics, we will see some features of the image. </p><p>  On the one hand, researchers are inclined that the historical prototype of the hero was Rostovite Alexander Popovich.  Boyar, who was in the service of Prince Vsevolod, and later - with his son Konstantin. </p><p>  After Yuri sits on the throne in 1281, Alexander leaves for Kiev to Mstislav and dies in the Battle of Kalka. </p><p>  Studying the exploits of Alesha Popovich (a short summary or the full text of the epics), you can see his arrogant and contemptuous attitude towards Prince Vladimir and the Kiev nobility. </p><p>  Often he calls them "pimps," and these legends often portray extramarital affairs of the warriors with boyar, princely and voivode wives. </p><p>  This suggests that the exploits of Alyosha Popovich and Dobryni Nikitich are described in different periods of time.  When they meet in one epic, this only indicates the later origin of the legend. </p><h2>  The image of the heroes in culture </h2>

    <p>  The characterization of Alyosha Popovich, Dobrynya Nikitich, Ilya Muromets and many other heroes inspires many writers, artists, composers and directors. <br>  For example, Alyosha is depicted in the paintings of Vasnetsov, Vereshchagin, Vasiliev.  He is mentioned in the ballad of Tolstoy A.K. </p><p>  Modern cartoon creators also use this epic image. </p><p>  Speaking of Dobryn Nikitich, it‚Äôs worth adding to all of the above that an island in the Nordenscheld archipelago, a mountain in the Kuril ridge and several ships are named after him. </p>
