    <ul><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a bird feeder" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/283227.jpg" width="333"></div>  The simplest one looks like this: you will need, in addition to the container itself, wooden spoons with long handles.  In the bottle at different levels, make holes and insert spoons.  What is the principle of such a bird feeder?  From a plastic bottle, the grain should fall into a spoon.  Therefore, on one side of the hole, make it slightly wider.  And to a cup of a spoon beat a small plate on which birds can sit.  Jumping on it, they shake the bottle, and the food will spill out where it should be.  Through the funnel, pour the grain into the container and wrap the lid.  The last question is how such a bird feeder from a plastic bottle will be attached.  With this, it‚Äôs completely simple.  Tie a rope to the neck and hang the bottle in a convenient branch.  And so that in the wind it does not swing and does not frighten birds, the container should be tied to the trunk and fixed in one position.  Such a bird feeder from a plastic bottle will cost you inexpensively.  Therefore, they can be made in unlimited quantities and it is great to support our feathered friends. </li><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="drawing bird feeder" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/283225.jpg" width="250"></div>  Option two, <span>how to make a bird feeder</span> out of plastic.  On both sides should be cut wide "windows" with a height of 2 quarters of the bottle.  The walls should turn into ‚Äúcolumns‚Äù supporting the roof - top with a neck (close it with a lid).  From the bottom to retreat about a palm and a half, so that the poured grain does not fall to the ground.  And attach to the tree.  True, you can eat here only singly or as a couple.  Therefore, you need to make such items "bird catering" as much as possible.  Well, you have to replenish stocks much more often than in the variant proposed above.  What else can improve this device, so these are small holes that should be made in the bottom of the bottles.  Thanks to them, all the moisture that gets on the grain flows down safely.  And bird food will not be covered with a crust of ice, and it will be easy for birds to reach it. </li><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a bird feeder" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/283226.jpg" width="332"></div>  Someone, having decided to create a winter dining room for sparrows and titmouse, will begin to search the Internet for a drawing of a bird feeder.  For those who take plastic bottles for this purpose, such a serious preparation for anything.  Because the third option is also very unpretentious.  Cut the bottle lengthwise into 2 pieces.  Cut the shoulders near the neck.  Pick up a board with a length of 2 bottles.  Nail the resulting troughs to it, combining them into one.  You can build a low roof or visor.  Then the bird food will not get wet in the rain and will not be covered with snow.  And the board will give stability to the feeder, and it‚Äôs more convenient for the birds to crouch and nibble than on the tiny edge of the bottle! </li></ul><p>  As you can see, all ingenious is simple.  And if you really want to help the birds, then you can easily make a lot of feeding troughs, thanks to which you will save a single voiced friend from starvation.  Just remember the lines of the poem ‚ÄúFeed the Birds in Winter‚Äù, known since childhood, and you will understand how important this is! </p>
