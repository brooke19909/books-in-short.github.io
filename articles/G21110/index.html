In addition, meals can be arranged as a buffet.  Depending on the choice of tourists, alcohol or soft drinks may or may not be served.  A similar approach to food is a feature of the El Mouradi Hammamet Resort 5 * hotel (Tunisia).  Feedback from visitors suggests that our compatriots most often choose the all-inclusive system.  Of course, this is a very convenient option, as it allows vacationers to not think about food at all and completely relax.  The main restaurant of the hotel offers guests a variety of buffet meals.

Further on the hotel's schedule are lunch, time for snacks and dinner.  The evening meal ends at nine in the evening. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel has three more restaurants in its arsenal.  Their services can be used by registering at the reception.  After nine in the evening, a disco bar and a lobby bar are open.  In the daytime you can enjoy pizza.  Especially popular with tourists is the Moorish cafe, which welcomes guests until late in the evening.  In principle, the hotel has a well-established power system. </p><h2>  Hotel El Mouradi Hammamet Resort 5 *: reviews 2016 </h2><p>  Speaking of any hotel, you can summarize only after reviewing the reviews of vacationers.  No matter how even the best complex is positioned, the impression of tourists is exactly what you should pay attention to, since recently people often encounter dishonesty of tour operators, who deliberately miss out on some points that subsequently darken the rest.  Unfortunately, in this regard, the El Mouradi Hammamet Resort 5 * hotel is no exception.  Reviews about him are rather contradictory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="el mouradi hammamet resort 5 pegasus" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1417249.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel is located on the coast and has a pretty well-groomed area, which is simply nice to walk around.  At the same time, the bars and restaurants of the complex are for some reason common with the neighboring hotel, which causes complete bewilderment of the guests. </p><p>  To go to the sea very close, you only need to cross the road, on which you can rarely see transport, because this does not interfere.  As for the beach, there are always enough sunbeds, umbrellas and mattresses on it.  There are no problems with this issue.  The sand is small and beautiful, but it is noticeable that the coast is poorly cleaned, you can meet cigarette butts on the beach, plastic cups. </p><p>  According to tourists, before lunch the sea is very clean and beautiful, but in the afternoon the wind often starts, then the water becomes cloudy and loses its former attractiveness.  Poisonous jellyfish sometimes come into the sea, you need to be careful with them.  Stumbled upon such a marine creature, you can get burns.  In general, the coast is beautiful, and you can have a good rest on it, because this is what all tourists come here for. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  As for food, it does not differ in special delicacies, but it is quite normal.  Some complain that very little fruit is served, while others praise their vast selection.  Apparently, it all depends on the season.  Meat, fish are served regularly.  Sometimes it is difficult to find beef or chicken, because such dishes are quickly taken apart.  But overall, the food is pretty decent.  The desserts are especially delightful.  Tourists do not stay hungry.  Delicious dishes can be enjoyed at a la carte restaurants, but can be accessed by appointment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel El Mouradi Hammamet Resort 5" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1417255.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has a five-star status.  But, according to tourists, it does not fully correspond to this category.  The complex, indeed, does not differ in the luxury and gloss that are inherent in five-star establishments.  However, this is offset by fairly budget prices for holidays in it.  Therefore, it is better for demanding tourists, accustomed to beautiful interiors and good service, to find another place to stay. </p><p>  The rooms furniture is not new, old-style televisions.  On the territory there is a wonderful seawater pool, which can become an alternative to the open sea during those hours when it is windy on the coast.  Vacationers are very pleased with it. </p><h2>  Travel tips </h2><p>  According to tourists, children's animation works poorly, there are very few entertainment programs for kids.  But with adult activities, things are much better.  In principle, everyone can engage in something interesting.  Experienced tourists are advised to be careful about the choice of sightseeing tours.  There are quite a lot of them, because there is something to see.  However, you must be careful with the local barkers who are trying to get money from tourists, resorting to various tricks and tricks.  Affects the local flavor.  Try not to visit shops that do not have fixed price tags on the product, this is a trick thanks to which merchants skillfully deceive vacationers. </p><p>  It should be noted that the hotel is located in a good location - this is the tourist area of ‚Äã‚ÄãYasmina.  There are many beaches, Marina seaport with many pleasure boats and ships, a well-planned modern promenade with various entertainment venues, the new Medina, the Carthagoland entertainment center for children, city parks, diving centers, fountains, discos, restaurants, casinos, bars, golf clubs and much more. </p><p>  On the territory of the hotel there are shops where you can purchase everything you need, including souvenirs.  Definitely worth a look Tunisia is a beautiful modern city that is worthy of the attention of the country's guests.  A trip to the mountains on ATVs leaves a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãemotions and delight.  A must-have item in the entertainment program should be the fantastic beauty of Carthage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="el mouradi hammamet resort 5 tunisia reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1417258.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has a good spa, which you can visit and enjoy the treatments.  He delights the vacationers: where else can you enjoy your vacation so carefree?  The indoor pool of the complex is also noteworthy.  If you wish, you can visit two pools of the neighboring hotel, the territory between the complexes is not divided by anything and is perceived as one. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  In general, taking into account the above, we can conclude that the hotel may well become a good place to spend a vacation.  A large selection of entertainment, well-developed infrastructure, warm clear sea, fine sand - the key to a good vacation.  According to vacationers, the complex is consistent with a reasonable price-quality ratio, and therefore you can not pay attention to minor blemishes, but simply enjoy the rest and the sun at the El Mouradi Hammamet Resort 5 * hotel.  Pegasus or any other tour operator in the country will be happy to help you get a ticket to sunny Tunisia. </p>
