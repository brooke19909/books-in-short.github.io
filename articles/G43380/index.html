  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Beltelecom Smart Home service: overview, connection features and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, every person can be outside the walls of his house and know about his condition.  The Beltelecom company has implemented a unique technology that allows you to monitor ongoing events in the house.  The Smart Home service from Beltelecom is an economical and simple solution that provides the ability to manage security and resource conservation in the home.  Clients can independently manage an automated house that adapts to the wishes of the owners.  This service can significantly increase the comfort of living and the level of security. </p><h2>  The essence of the service </h2><p>  With the help of the Smart Home service, you can regulate electricity costs, as well as monitor housing.  The operator provides customers with 2 different types of connection: </p><ol><li>  Base.  This kit includes a control device and sensors that control the movement, smoke and opening / closing of windows or doors.  This software allows you to monitor the movement, smoke and open windows. </li><li>  Advanced.  A large number of sensors are added to the basic package, as well as devices such as a siren, video camera, smart socket, water leakage sensor, humidity and temperature sensor. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="internetofthingswiki.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beltelecom smart home how to connect instructions" class="if uuid-2670591" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2670591.jpg"></div><p>  Devices that are included in the basic package can be purchased independently.  As sensors actuators are video cameras.  They provide the subscriber with the opportunity to keep abreast of current events in real time.  For delayed viewing, you can save images and videos.  With the help of smart sockets, control devices connected to the network at a remote access.  The final cost of the service will depend on the number of connected devices.  Users are able to independently find the application and install it on their smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  System specifics </h2><p>  The principle of operation of the sensor for opening / closing windows and doors is quite simple.  Each action is recorded by devices, and information is promptly sent to the subscriber.  <span>The smoke detector</span> picks up the smallest smoke in the room.  Such a sensor is best installed in places with an increased risk of fire.  The motion sensor works at a distance of 2.5 meters and covers an area with a viewing angle of 180 degrees.  To cover a wider area, you can hang the sensor on the ceiling and point it at an angle. </p><p>  <span>Smart sockets</span> are a special layer between a regular socket and a cable.  They display in real time the power consumption of the connected device, and can also remotely de-energize and turn on.  The video camera is the most interesting element of the Smart Home from Beltelecom.  The gadget has a slot for a memory card, microphone, infrared light, Wi-Fi and speakers.  The user can remotely control the tilt and rotation of the camera. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geomarketing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect Beltelecom smart home" class="if uuid-2670556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2670556.jpg"></div><p>  Among the most interesting devices, users single out smart sockets and video cameras.  However, these system elements are not included in the basic package.  If the client does not use a certain device and does not pay for it, the sensor should be returned to the operator.  The system kit includes a subscriber controller, which is a wireless access point.  Its task is to combine all sensors and provide system control via the Internet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to connect Smart Home from Beltelecom </h2><p>  To connect the Smart Home system, users need to place sensors in their places.  You can work with this system only through the mobile application.  After starting the program, you need to find all active devices.  The user can adapt Beltelecom's Smart Home system for personal needs and requirements.  How to connect this service according to the instructions in such a way that it works flawlessly?  This question is of interest to many potential users of the system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tecaware.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beltelecom smart home service" class="if uuid-2670580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2670580.jpg"></div><p>  To activate the service, the following requirements must be observed: </p><ul><li>  high-quality Internet access of at least 64 Kbps; </li><li>  execution of the contract; </li><li>  receipt of equipment; </li><li>  the presence of a smartphone with the operating system Android or iOS; </li><li>  adding sensors to the program; </li><li>  script customization. </li></ul><p>  <span>The most common scenario is a notification of changes in sensor readings.</span> </p><h2>  Notification system </h2><p>  The user will receive signals on a mobile phone when detecting movement in a room, opening windows.  Alerts can be sent by e-mail or in the form of SMS from Beltelecom operator.  The reviews about the <span>"Smart Home" are</span> ambiguous, since the system has not been perfected technically.  In this regard, there are frequent malfunctions in the application. </p><h2>  System benefits </h2><p>  Beltelecom's Smart Home provides a high level of security and comfort.  The user can configure a <span>‚Äúsmart‚Äù outlet so that the kettle automatically turns on when the door open sensor is triggered.</span>  <span>In the same way, you can configure the switches in all rooms.</span>  <span>The user can control the mode of operation of the outlet for remote access from a smartphone.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hackster.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beltelecom smart home reviews" class="if uuid-2670554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2670554.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Beltelecom's Smart Home system will allow you to stay calm in the event of any emergency.</span>  <span>The user can activate the camera when the sensor triggers a movement.</span>  <span>Company employees replace defective sensors under warranty for free.</span>  <span>However, if they become unusable due to the fault of the subscriber, the cost of damaged devices will be charged from him.</span> </p><h2>  Brief conclusion </h2><p>  The Beltelecom Smart Home system is ideal for people who rarely appear at home or leave their children alone in the apartment.  Also, this service is suitable for owners of private houses and legal entities that have remote objects in their ownership.  It is possible to integrate the Smart Home system into the metering system for the consumption of water, heat and gas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pymnts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect Beltelecom smart home" class="if uuid-2670560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2670560.jpg"></div><p>  Today, the Smart Home system is a technically advanced solution only in theory.  Users often have problems with device compatibility and their subsequent connection.  Not every client can independently cope with this new product.  The company needs to refine the technology in order to turn homes into real smart homes. </p>
