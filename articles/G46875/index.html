Attractions that delight</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the oldest cities in the Russian North is Great Ustyug.  The first mention of this place can be found in the chronicles of the 8th century.  This period is significant because it was then that the advanced detachments of the Rostov-Suzdal principality stepped on the land belonging to the Finno-Ugric tribes.  Over time, the village grew and developed.  The territory of the modern city stretches for several kilometers on the left bank of Sukhona.  Here, in its original form, amazing temples and monasteries, houses of noble merchants of the 19th century managed to survive.  Those who decided to visit Veliky Ustyug, the sights will conquer with their originality and magnificence.  The main feature of the city is the fact that there are no wooden buildings.  Brick construction here began after a big fire in 1772. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="great Ustyug sights" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/221725.jpg" width="461"></div>

    <p>  What to see, having arrived in the city of Veliky Ustyug?  Photos of the sights of this settlement cannot fully convey the beauty of these structures, because interesting places are, first of all, temple buildings.  The central complex is the Cathedral courtyard.  The first place in this list is occupied by the Assumption Cathedral, the construction of the building of which dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.  At the beginning of the 17th century, the wooden structure was replaced by a stone one.  In the same period, the bell tower was attached.  During construction, strict monumental forms were sustained.  The rich interior decoration also pleases the eye: decorative carving, unique painting, stucco molding.  The main value of the cathedral is the iconostasis with carvings and ornaments.  Nearby is the Cathedral of Procopius the Righteous.  Its decoration is a carved gilded five-tier iconostasis. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of the great Ustyug" class="if" height="216" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/221712.jpg" width="283"></div>

Its construction was carried out in two periods.  The lower temple was originally erected (1739-1750).  This structure was elongated and resembled a ship.  In 1769, the second floor was added.  It is impossible not to mention the Trinity-Gledensky monastery, towering on a high hill in the place where the <span>rivers South</span> and Sukhona merge together.  The temple of Dmitry Salunsky, built in 1708, will also be interesting.  The architect supported the traditions of the 17th century.  The temple has a tented bell tower and a five-domed church. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Great Ustyug photo" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/221713.jpg" width="283"></div>

    <p>  But this does not end the temple buildings, which are famous for the Great Ustyug.  Attractions can be complemented by such a structure as the Church of the Semion of Stolpnyak, built in the middle of the 18th century.  This is the only such building in the city, where the architecture traces the baroque features of Western Europe.  A beautiful building is the church of Stephen the Great of Perm.  This structure appeared in connection with the release of the decree, according to which burials within the city were prohibited.  In the new cemetery, which was located outside the village, this church was built.  At the same time, the construction of the bell tower was carried out.  You can supplement the list with the Cathedral of St. Michael the Archangel.  No less magnificent is the Pentecostal Church of the Presentation, which managed to preserve the decor in the Baroque style.  The city‚Äôs unique building is the Ascension Church, whose windows are decorated with colored tiles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="great Ustyug sights" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/221710.jpg" width="283"></div>
