Tracking packages from China</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the advent of online stores selling cheap goods from China, users of the World Wide Web began to wonder how to send a parcel from China to Russia, how much it would cost, and how to make sure that the goods were on their way. </p><p>  In order to understand how the transportation of parcels goes, you need to find out how China's mail is organized, what kind of checks the cargo goes through, and how the service works during national holidays. </p><h2>  State Post of China </h2><p>  The National Postal Service of China was first mentioned in 1949.  Since that time, the network has grown significantly.  Throughout the country, there are about eighty-two thousand post offices, as well as about 230 sorting centers.  Every day, more than 860 thousand employees fill out and send packages. </p>

    <p>  To understand <span>how to send a parcel</span> from China to Russia, you need to understand how, from the point of view of the buyer, the Chinese postal service works.  The delivery speed is affected by many factors: sending time, location of the warehouse, mail congestion. </p><h2>  Receiving and sending parcels </h2><p>  To understand <span>how to send a parcel</span> from China to Russia, you need to find out how goods are delivered to post offices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are many sorting centers in China, but the largest are in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.  But only two of them - in Beijing and Shanghai - operate at maximum speed.  The location of sellers' warehouses also plays a large role.  Almost all packages are sent through two <span>airports: Shanghai</span> and Beijing. </p>

    <p>  The speed of sending depends on the seller.  Small suppliers personally pack each item and ship it to the post office.  In such cases, the dispatch may take several days. </p><p>  Large Chinese sellers involve logistics centers that are engaged in sorting and packaging.  Then the package is sent to the post office within a few hours. </p><p>  Further, the procedure is standard: sorting, registration and the beginning of transit.  Depending on how the mail works, you can track the package from China to Russia in just a few hours. </p><h2>  Tariffs </h2><p>  Often when making purchases in Chinese online stores, users see free delivery to almost anywhere in the world.  This does not mean that Chinese postal services do not charge for their work.  The seller just added the cost of delivery to the cost of the goods. </p><p>  It is worth considering that the tariffs for sending parcels in China are quite low.  Shipping a small package weighing one hundred grams will cost only 18 yuan.  For every additional hundred grams, another fifteen yuan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Sellers in Chinese online stores manage to keep prices low and due to the fact that China Post provides regular customers with good discounts.  Therefore, most of the cheap goods go for the cheapest type of dispatch: without a track number. </p><p>  Attaching a track number to a package will cost about $ 2-3.  This option can also be purchased on the store’s website for an additional amount. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, each postal service has its own rates.  You can get acquainted with them on the official sites. </p><h2>  Tracking </h2><p>  When sending parcels, an important item is tracking parcels.  “Russian Post” from China receives many shipments.  You can track the parcel on your native and Russian sites by the track number.  However, it is worth noting that Russian Post does not cooperate with all Chinese postal services. </p>

    <p>  It is much more convenient to find the location of the package on Chinese sites.  Each service has its own website, where you can enter the tracking number and get full information about the condition of the goods. </p><h2>  Transit Statuses </h2><p>  On its official website, it offers to track parcels by Russian Post.  From China, as from any other country, tracking a shipment is quite simple.  It is only necessary to enter on the website an individual set of numbers and letters in a special field.  Consider the main state of the items: </p><ul><li>  Collection - this status indicates that the package has arrived at the postal service. </li><li>  Opening - the package was delivered to the point of contact for further transit. </li><li>  Dispatching - preparing for export. </li><li>  Departure from outward office of exchange - the package has been processed and sent to the destination. </li></ul><p>  Further transit statuses fully describe the location of the package.  But many recipients are scared by just four letters: NULL.  These letters at the beginning of the status caused hundreds of questions.  But do not be scared.  NULL just means that the name of the operation does not have a translation into English. </p><h2>  Delivery terms </h2><p>  After the order on the site has been processed and paid, the user asks the question: how long does the package fly from China to Russia?  It all depends on the postal service. </p><p>  Almost eighty percent of all packages from China are shipped by China Air Post.  Due to the heavy workload, the packages go to Russia for a very long time.  More than seventy percent of all packages arrive in one month.  One and a half to two months is twenty percent of the parcels.  All the rest - in three months.  However, it also happens that a small packet may come after five months.  The lost parcel is located and continues on its way to the recipient. </p><p>  One of the fastest and cheapest shipping methods from China is Hong Hong Post service.  It is the least loaded.  Almost all goods arrive in one month. </p><p>  EMS will deliver any item in two weeks.  However, there is one drawback - this is a paid delivery. </p>

    <p>  DHL is one of the fastest and most expensive shipping methods.  It is usually used when sending valuable goods: telephones, laptops and other equipment.  But recently, the service often has customs problems. </p><p>  When deciding how to send a parcel from China to Russia and receive it as soon as possible, it is important to consider the time.  Like all postal services, in China there are periods when mail works to the limit of its capabilities: national holidays and the New Year period.  At this time, sending a parcel from China to Russia will be problematic.  Excessive workload significantly increases the delivery time. </p><p>  When sending or waiting for a parcel from China, it is important to remember that sometimes even goods with a tracking number may get lost and not arrive at the appointed time.  If this parcel was purchased in online stores such as Aliexpress and Ibei, you can open a dispute and return part of the money or the whole amount. </p>
