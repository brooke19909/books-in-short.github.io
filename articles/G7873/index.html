The main attractions of Germany with names, photos and descriptions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The standard of European lifestyle and impeccable order has always been Germany.  This amazing country with a rich history, outstanding representatives in the field of culture, art, magnificent castles and palaces attracts tourists from all over the world.  <span>The Federal Republic of</span> Germany, the sights of which we will present to you today, is a state that includes the history and traditions of such areas as Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony. </p><p>  This country can be compared with a mosaic - its individual elements sometimes seem completely incompatible, but at the same time they make up a whole and harmonious picture. </p><h2>  The main attractions of Germany </h2><p>  One can talk endlessly about interesting places in this country.  And in order to study in detail the sights of Germany, the description of which can be found in all advertising booklets of travel agencies, it will take a lot of time.  Therefore, today we will present to you the most, in our opinion, interesting places. </p><h2>  Brandenburg Gate </h2><p>  If the symbol of Paris is the Eiffel Tower, and Rome - the Colosseum, then the hallmark of Germany, undoubtedly, can be called the Brandenburg Gate, which are located in the capital of the country - Berlin.  This is perhaps the most recognizable landmark in the country.  Experts believe that it was with her that the Berlin special classical style in urban planning began. </p>

    <p>  The Brandenburg Gate was erected by order of King <span>Frederick William II</span> (1791).  Construction lasted three years.  The architect Karl Langgans led the work.  He is also the author of the project of this triumphal arch.  The front gate of the Acropolis in Athens became the prototype of the building. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The gates are in the center of the capital.  They are adjacent to the <span>Linden Alley,</span> connecting the former royal residence with an arch.  The height of the structure is more than 25 meters. </p><h2>  Reichstag </h2><p>  Many names of German sights are well known even to people who have never been to this country.  These include, first of all, the Reichstag. </p><p>  The construction of this building lasted ten years.  Before starting work, the project was approved as much.  In 1894, an unusually <span>beautiful building appeared</span> on the Republic Square, created in the Renaissance style and complemented by Baroque elements.  The main decoration was a glass dome, rare for that time. </p>

    <p>  During the war years (1945) the Reichstag was destroyed, Soviet troops made it a symbol of their Great Victory.  The flag of the Soviet Union was hoisted above the building, and commemorative inscriptions appeared on the walls (some of them have survived to this day). </p><p>  Full restoration of the magnificent structure began in 1961 and lasted three years.  The project was led by P. Baumgarten.  After this, there were some meetings at the government level and rather rare cultural events.  The Reichstag began to be used for its intended purpose after the reunification of the two parts of Germany (1990). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Neuschwanstein Castle </h2><p>  Tourists have always been of great interest to the Federal Republic of Germany.  The sights of this country are striking in scale and beauty. </p><p>  This unusual building is fascinating at first sight.  The fairytale castle, as if hovering over high and impregnable mountains, delights.  It was not built as a defensive structure, the kings did not hold feasts here.  Neuschwanstein Castle is the result of the fantasies of Ludwig II. </p>

    <p>  By his decree, the plateau of the rock in 1869 was lowered by eight meters.  An extraordinary architectural miracle appeared - a knight's castle made in the style of the Middle Ages. </p><p>  Its interior is luxurious.  One royal bedroom, made in the late Gothic style, was decorated for four and a half years.  Neuschwanstein looks like a kind of theatrical decoration, and, however, in some way is it, since it was created under the direction of a theater artist from Munich - Christian Jank. </p><h2>  Cologne Cathedral </h2><p>  Tourists often mistakenly believe that the main attractions of Germany are concentrated in Berlin.  This opinion is fundamentally wrong.  The Federal Republic of Germany, whose attractions are located throughout the country, is exactly what is interesting.  In any of its cities you can find unique masterpieces of architecture and art.  A striking example is Cologne Cathedral, bearing the official name of Saints Mary and Peter. </p>

    <p>  This cathedral is impressive with its building history, valuable Christian relics, and Gothic architecture.  It is created in a simple style.  Its towers, facade, unusual stained glass windows - all this leaves an unforgettable impression. </p><p>  Cologne Cathedral is considered one of the largest in the world.  Its length is 144.5 meters with a width of 86.5 meters. </p><h2>  Berlin Wall </h2><p>  Today, tourists are very popular attractions in Germany.  Photos of many of them often appear in popular magazines. </p>

    <p>  In the capital there is the world famous Berlin Wall.  This concrete fence, rising three meters, surrounded by barbed wire, stretched for one hundred and sixty kilometers.  It was not just a border between two German states.  In just one night, the wall divided thousands of German families into forty years.  It was erected in the summer of 1961, the wall fell in the fall of 1989. </p><p>  There are few surviving sections of the wall in the capital.  All of them are today a place of pilgrimage for tourists, some have turned into memorials.  The most important site is the "Eastern Gallery". </p><h2>  Hohenschwangau Castle </h2><p>  The sights of Germany, photos of which you can see in our article, impress with their luxury and grandeur.  This fully applies to the Hohenschwangau Castle, which is considered the most magnificent in Bavaria.  It is located in the small town of Schwangau in the south of the country.  Built in the middle of the XIX century as the residence (summer) of the royal family.  Here, solemn gatherings of nobles, balls were held, meetings were held with the royal family. </p>

    <p>  Alexanderplatz Square is one of Berlin's attractions.  In socialist times, it was the center of the city and its transportation.  And today, the square remains one of the most visited places in the capital of Germany. </p><p>  Until the XIX century, Alexanderplatz was used for military parades and at the same time was a market square where peasants sold livestock.  In those days, it was called Torplatz.  The square got its current name thanks to King William III, who ordered it to be renamed (1805).  This event was dedicated to the visit of Tsar Alexander I. </p><p>  The architectural ensemble of the square combines modern buildings and pre-war buildings.  Today, the square looks like a single composition of recently built buildings, the Red Town Hall and the ancient church of St. Mary.  Modern buildings are a high-rise hotel with panoramic platforms (123 m) and the famous TV tower Berliner Fernzeeturm, which has become the hallmark of Berlin (368 m). </p><p>  Tourists are always glad to meet the Federal Republic of Germany.  The sights of this country deserve a leisurely and attentive study.  Therefore, we recommend that you visit her as soon as possible. </p>
