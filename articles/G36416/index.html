And it is at sea resorts that it is possible to combine several areas of relaxation at once: a change of scenery, entertainment, excursions and the ability to improve health due to the healing power of salt water and fresh air.  Therefore, with the expectation of a large number of vacationers, the infrastructure of cities and villages along the Black Sea coast is constantly expanding and updating.  And one of the places worth visiting is the recreation center "Dawn" in Anapa.  This wellness center has for many years become a great vacation spot for visitors. </p><h2>  From the history of Anapa </h2><p>  The first historical references to the city of Anapa date back to the 15th century.  During this period, a Turkish fortress stood on the site of the modern city, which due to its position was considered impregnable.  Over the course of several centuries, Russian troops made a number of attempts to capture Anapa.  And during all this time the fortress changed hands several times.  Anapa then acquired the status of a city, then lost it again.  Several times the city was destroyed to the ground, and then rebuilt.  The last time this happened during the Great Patriotic War. </p><p>  The rich history has turned the area in <span>the Anapa region</span> into a source of valuable historical finds.  Many of them now constitute the exposition of the Museum of Local History. </p><p>  Since 1929, the Soviet government decided to turn Anapa into a children's resort.  And although work on the implementation of this project was suspended due to the war, since 1947, the full restoration of the city began.  During these years, the long-standing problem of local residents related to the low quality of drinking water was resolved.  To do this, from the Kuban River to Anapa, a water supply was made.  And since that time, 153 sanatorium-resort establishments have appeared on the territory of the city and nearby villages, so up to 300,000 people can rest on this territory at the same time.  One of the most popular in Anapa is the Zarya recreation center in Dzhemete.  There are no empty seats during the holiday season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center dawn Anapa" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/2128626.jpg"></div>
