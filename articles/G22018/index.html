    <h2>  Pickalbatros Sea World Resort 4 *: reviews of Russian travelers </h2><p>  An experienced tourist does not need to be convinced of the importance of choosing the right hotel in a particular country.  After all, the quality of rest and impressions from it will largely depend on how comfortable your stay will be.  Especially when it comes to hotel complexes operating on the ol inclusive system.  After all, often guests spend all day on the territory of the hotel, leaving it only for short walks in the surroundings or trips on excursions.  According to many travelers, not to be mistaken in the choice is, in many respects, getting acquainted with the reviews of real people who have already happened to stay in one place or another.  After all, former hotel guests are able to tell not only about the advantages, but also about the possible shortcomings of a hotel complex.  Therefore, you can pre-compile the representation as close as possible to the real state of affairs and decide whether the hotel in question is suitable for you.  As a rule, finding and studying reviews takes a lot of time.  In this regard, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized comments of our compatriots regarding their recent stay at Pickalbatros Sea World Resort 4 * (Hurghada, Egypt).  Running a little ahead, we note that almost all the reviews of Russian tourists are positive.  So, in their opinion, this hotel corresponds to the declared category and is worth the money spent.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  Our compatriots, according to them, were satisfied with the rooms offered to them in this hotel.  So, the apartments here, although not very spacious, but very cozy, they have everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Furniture and appliances are not entirely new, but all of good quality and in working condition.  The guests liked the very large and comfortable beds.  As for the technology, then if something suddenly fails, then after a call to the reception and a story about the problem, the malfunction will be quickly eliminated.  A big plus of the Pickalbatros Sea World 4 * hotel, which we are now reviewing, is called by tourists the availability of free wireless Internet access in all apartments.  To use Wi-Fi, you must take the password from the administrator at the reception.  Also, the advantages of rooms include excellent soundproofing, which is a rarity for hotels not only in Egypt, but also in many other countries.  So if you are accommodated in a room with windows overlooking the pool or amphitheater, then you should not worry about the fact that you can‚Äôt relax in silence.  It will be enough just to close the balcony door tightly. </p><p>  In their comments, some guests claim that they saw ants in the apartment.  However, most tourists did not complain about such a problem.  In addition, according to them, some vacationers themselves regularly bring food to their rooms that they do not eat and do not put in the refrigerator, which attracts annoying insects.  Therefore, experienced tourists are advised to eat only outside the apartment, then you will not have to complain about the presence of ants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  This item, judging by the comments of our compatriots, caused only positive emotions among the guests of Pickalbatros Sea World 4 * (Hurghada).  So, according to them, the maids here do an excellent job with their duties.  They clean the rooms in a quality manner daily, change towels if necessary, replenish supplies of personal hygiene products (shampoo, soap, shower gel, etc.), and also leave bottles with drinking water in the refrigerator.  Bed linen is updated a couple of times a week.  In addition, maids often construct amusing towels on their beds.  Also, some of our compatriots in their reviews expressed admiration for the honesty of the hotel maids.  So, according to them, they sometimes forgot to put quite large amounts of cash into the safe, leaving them in a conspicuous place.  At the same time, upon returning to the room, the guests noted that nothing was lost.  However, despite such stories, experienced travelers are still advised to be vigilant and hide valuables and documents in a safe during your absence in the apartment. </p>

    <h2>  Check in, check out </h2><p>  As tourists note in their comments, the check-in of newly arrived guests in the rooms of Picalbatros Sea World is in most cases carried out in accordance with the hotel‚Äôs internal rules, that is, after two in the afternoon.  Thus, if you arrive at the hotel in the morning, you can only get your room keys after lunch.  However, this is not a problem, because you can leave your things in the luggage room and go to a restaurant, bar, swim in the pool, sunbathe on a sun lounger or go directly to the beach.  When the check-in time is right, the hotel staff will take your suitcases to the apartments that are due to you, and you just have to take the key to the reception.  Also, according to some travelers, those who plan to arrive at the hotel late in the evening should not worry.  Indeed, in the main restaurant Pickalbatros Sea World 4 * (Egypt, Hurghada), a <span>late dinner is served,</span> ending only at midnight.  So you can grab a bite from the road right after arriving at the hotel. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, in accordance with the internal rules of Picalbatros Sea World, guests must vacate the occupied apartments by 12 noon.  If you plan to leave the hotel only in the evening, then if you wish, you can extend the room for several hours at an additional cost.  However, many refuse this option.  After all, you can leave things at the reception, and continue to relax by visiting the pools, the beach, restaurants or bars in anticipation of the departure time. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  This item often causes a lot of controversy and disagreement among tourists.  And this applies to hotels of various categories in various countries.  However, the Picalbatros Sea World we are considering can be called a pleasant exception to this rule.  Indeed, the vast majority of our guests who have been here claim that the food at the hotel is organized at a very high level.  According to them, it not only corresponds to the four-star category, but also sometimes surpasses it.  So, tourists assure that the cooks in the hotel are real professionals, and the administration does not skimp on the purchase of quality products.  As a result, guests of Pickalbatros Sea World (ex. Aqua Blu) 4 * have the opportunity to try a variety of soups, main dishes of meat, poultry, fish and seafood, a variety of salads and snacks, pastries and desserts, fresh fruits and vegetables.  Main meals are held at the main buffet restaurant.  Late dinner is also held here.  As a rule, a very small percentage of tourists visit it.  But many come in simply to take fruit or dessert. </p><p>  There is also a fast-food restaurant on the hotel‚Äôs private beach during the day.  If desired, travelers can dine right here without returning to the hotel. </p><p>  Picalbatros Sea World invites guests to visit √† la carte restaurants.  Here you can enjoy Italian, Chinese and Oriental dishes. </p><h2>  Beverages </h2><p>  There are several bars on site.  Here, tourists are offered a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, as well as snacks and ice cream.  Many of our compatriots greatly praise the bar located in the lobby.  According to them, excellent coffee is brewed here.  As for soft drinks, here they, according to tourists, as in most Egyptian hotels in this category, are powder.  You can take them yourself, filling the glasses from the machines.  Alcoholic drinks must be ordered to the bartender.  According to travelers, local beer, rum and wine are of good quality.  But not everyone liked the other drinks. </p>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Pickalbatros Sea World 4 * hotel is located on the second coastline, it has at its disposal a fairly large beach.  According to our compatriots, walking to it can be reached in 10-15 minutes by an unhurried step.  On the road you need to cross the roadway.  In addition, there is a regular bus service between the hotel and the beach.  So if you do not want to go ashore on foot, then you can use the free shuttle service. </p><p>  As for the beach, it is sandy, clean.  There are many sun loungers and parasols, a bar and restaurant.  The places here, according to tourists, are usually enough for everyone, especially if you come ashore immediately after breakfast.  Entry into the water is shallow, at the bottom - large pebbles.
