    <p>  Aventurine is a stone, referred to in some sources as heliolite, aventurine labrador, <span>sun stone</span> or aventurine <span>(feldspar) spar.</span>  It differs from other minerals with a flickering ebb, sparkling in the light of gold, red or green.  Real natural stone is quite rare in nature, because on sale you can often find glass pieces that imitate a real natural stone.  In the manufacture of fakes, <span>copper,</span> chromium, iron, <span>cobalt</span> <span>oxides</span> are added to the glass mass <span>, this</span> gives the glass an excess of sparkles and is a sign of fake. </p><p>  Aventurine is a natural stone, and a glass copy appeared in Ancient Egypt, but the secret of manufacture was kept secret.  Some sources claim that aventurine glass was accidentally discovered by Venetian glassblowers, and this is the sixteenth century. </p><p>  As for the natural color of natural aventurine, it can be white, honey, light gray, pink, terracotta, green and even cherry.  Blue aventurine comes from Austria, Spain is the birthplace of red-brown, and India is green aventurine.  In general, in addition to these three countries, Brazil, China, and, of course, Russia (the Urals) are also famous for the best adventurers.  A couple of centuries ago, the most beautiful examples of Russian adventurers adorned vases and candlesticks, glasses and handles of cutlery, not to mention the amazing female jewelry made.  Aventurine - a green stone looks very similar to jade.  The complexity of the difference leads to the fact that in stores often the first stone is issued for the second.  The centuries-old mining of aventurine in China has led to the fact that the mineral was called the imperial stone.  It was considered sacred, even the imperial seal was made of it.  In nature, this mineral is not always flawless in appearance: it can be iridescent, shimmering, simply luxurious, but it can also be nondescript. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Aventurine is a stone whose properties gave it the name of the sun, making it an ideal material for making jewelry.  Especially love him in Asian countries.  The hue of this gem depends on the natural impurities contained in aventurine.  Hematite particles, for example, give a reddish brown tint, while a greenish tint appears due to the fuchsite content. </p><p>  Natural stones have long been surrounded by a halo of mystery.  Magical powers were attributed to them, mystical stories were told about them.  Stones really have the power that nature itself gives them. </p><p>  But far from always people interpret correctly the abilities of stones.  So, for example, aventurine was once considered a stone that brings good luck in a card game.  This myth appeared due to the consonance of the name of the gem with the word adventure.  In fact, aventurine is a stone of love and happiness.  He is able to aggravate feelings, make emotions more vivid.  Sun stone gives a person confidence.  It maintains a state of joy and happiness, strengthens optimism and does not allow the soul to age.  This stone awakens fantasy, creativity in man. </p><p>  Aventurine harmonizes soul and body, maintains a good joyful mood, surrounds a person with a positive.  Strengthening the emotional state of a person, the stone is not intended for constant wear.  One lunar phase - this is how much you can wear a stone without taking it off.  Then the energy of the gem itself changes, which means that it must be left alone.  Aventurine (stone) is especially good for children and adolescents, whose independent life is yet to come.  It is good for people with an increased level of responsibility, suitable for restless people who are tormented by insomnia, or those who have painful memories in a dream.  Get a stone of love, and it will give you a lot of joy and happiness. </p>
