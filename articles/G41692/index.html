Previously, there was no such problem - when calling, live people answered.  But with the development of information technology, the realization of ideas has come to cause a lot of trouble.  The thing is that mobile operators have introduced self-service systems.  Thanks to them, citizens can listen to the voice menu and use it without the help of call center employees.  Nevertheless, this option does not please everyone.  And with a live operator, you also need to talk.  But how to do that?  Below will be presented the best tips and tricks for the implementation of the task. </p><div class="photo" data-original="beeline365.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Call the operator &quot;Beeline&quot;" class="if uuid-2459891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2459891.jpg"></div><h2>  Short number </h2><p>  How to contact the Beeline operator?  To begin, consider the simplest scenario.  This is a situation when a client calls from a mobile phone. </p><p>  In this case, you need to dial the free number 0611 and click on the "Call Subscriber" button.  As soon as a person hears a robot voice, you need to open the dial pad and click on "1" and then on "0". </p><p>  Sometimes customers are invited to listen to the entire voice menu.  After that, the caller will be redirected to the live operator.  It remains only to wait for his answer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Federal numbers </h2><p>  The previously proposed combination helps to communicate with the operator only from Beeline SIM cards.  Therefore, we further consider other options for the development of events. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tarif-operatora.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline Room" class="if uuid-2459890" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2459890.jpg"></div><p>  How to contact the Beeline operator otherwise?  You can call the federal number.  It is free and suitable for calls from both mobile devices and landlines. </p><p>  To communicate with an employee of a <span>Beeline call center, a</span> citizen needs: </p><ol><li>  Dial 8 800 700 0611 on your mobile phone. </li><li>  Click on the "Call" button. </li><li>  Wait until the conversation begins with the answering machine. </li><li>  Activate the "Tonal" option. </li><li>  Press the button "0". </li><li>  Wait for the robot voice again. </li><li>  Press "0" again. </li></ol><p>  All that remains now is to wait.  As soon as there are free operators in the call-center, the caller will be answered. </p><p>  Important: this combination helps to cope with the studied task from any phones. </p><h2>  In roaming </h2><p>  Quite often, the question of how to contact the Beeline operator directly arises while traveling.

The rest will have to pay according to the available tariff plans. </p><h2>  Phones for specific problems </h2><p>  But these are not all the opportunities prepared by the company under study.
