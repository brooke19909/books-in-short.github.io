To choose the best, you should study the reviews.  The Canon camera is recognized by many world famous experts as the best option for professional and amateur photography, so today we‚Äôll talk about this particular technique.

    <h2>  What attracts users? </h2><p>  The basic models should be discussed first.  Of course, the mass consumer is primarily attracted by their low cost.  For four to six thousand rubles in the market, you are unlikely to find anything better.  What do the reviews say?  Canon camera in this price range is a pretty decent technique.  Many novice photographers notice that they were looking for ‚Äúsomething on batteries,‚Äù since such a device is more suitable for long trips and outings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the low and mid-price range (from decent companies), such models are exclusively made by Canon, since all other manufacturers have focused on the production of cameras with built-in batteries. </p><p>  What else are the reviews talking about?  The Canon camera shows good shooting results even in automatic mode, which for beginners can also be crucial.  At the same time, the colors are bright and rich: these photos are not ashamed to use even when creating some kind of official presentations! </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="camera repair canon" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/459003.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  A little bit about repair </h2><p>  Alas, there is nothing special to say.  The reviews of professional photographers indicate that almost all parts of modern cameras are made of plastic.  So, any Canon EOS camera even of the highest price segment is equipped with plastic lenses, which, when dropped in the open state, are guaranteed to fail.  They are not subject to repair. </p><p>  It‚Äôs pointless to repair cheap models (which we will also mention), since the cost of this procedure is almost equal to the price of a new device.  Currently, the following issues can be fixed: </p><ul><li>  Matrix malfunctions. </li><li>  Failure of the mirror drive (the Canon Powershot camera often suffers). </li><li>  Flash failure. </li><li>  Display damage. </li></ul><p>  All these failures can only be fixed (!) In the conditions of service centers.  Having decided to "pick" the camera yourself, you automatically lose warranty and post-warranty service, so there‚Äôs no reason to risk it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Some negative points </h2><p>  Like other manufacturers, in the lower price segment, Canon pays attention exclusively to megapixels.  Neither the <span>type of matrix,</span> nor other important characteristics in the production of these models are so important.  As a result, the resulting images have a quality that is very far from printing. </p>

Over time, such optics become much more cloudy and scratched, as a result of which the quality of the photos becomes "none."  So you should buy such cameras only for the season or to visit countries that are not very prosperous or areas when it will not be too pathetic to lose equipment.

    <p>  Among other things, repairing Canon cameras of this class is simply pointless.  <span>The cost of restoration</span> measures may well exceed the price of the equipment itself.  In all other respects, cheap Canon devices are not much different from similar products from other companies. </p><h2>  Average price category </h2><p>  In this segment, the company's products most often occupy a leading position.  And this is not at all surprising, since for 12-25 thousand you get a wonderful camera, many of the capabilities of which are comparable to those for more ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù models.  Let's discuss all this a little more specifically.  Firstly, almost all of them even gather in Japan itself today. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This determines the high quality of both the assembly itself and the components.  All other companies have long been using the services of Taiwan or China, which leaves a certain imprint on the quality of products. </p><p>  Users note not only the excellent quality of shooting, but also the high speed of the latter.  What else do the reviews point to?  The Canon camera has excellent color rendering quality, the colors are very close to natural.  This allows us to recommend this technique for professional and semi-professional shooting, as the result in any case will be excellent. </p><h2>  Other benefits </h2>

If you use a tripod for shooting, then the videos are almost professional quality.  This has long been noticed by wedding photographers and other people whose work is associated with the need to make high-quality materials.

    <p>  So, those who bought a Canon EOS 600d camera report that the laboriousness of work is sharply reduced, and much more can be done in a day.  Of course, this greatly increases the amount of earnings. </p><p>  After all, with Canon cameras you can not take separate video equipment, since you will do all the work with the camera!  No need to carry a mountain of technology with you, which in the case of fast and dynamic filming is extremely important.  In addition, the company's engineers created an excellent noise reduction algorithm.  This is also important for professional photographers, since in this case you do not have to spend a lot of time on correcting the resulting pictures in graphic editors. </p><p>  Many photographers note that thanks to such qualities of the cameras, it is again possible to significantly reduce the time required for final processing of photos.  This makes it possible to edit more pictures, getting more money for it. </p><p>  Professionals note that when you activate the "burst shooting" mode, you need to use a memory card with maximum recording speed, since cheap varieties may simply not be in time.  Canon engineers recommend using only those drives that have been officially certified by the company for this purpose. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canon eos 3000" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/459000.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  Highest price category </h2><p>  It includes models whose cost is in the range of 50-200 thousand rubles (and higher).  Of course, this kind of technique is chosen very carefully.  Most often, there are only two candidates in this class: Canon and Nikon.  The percentage of purchases is approximately the same, but we are interested in the opinion of those who still prefer the products of the first company. </p><p>  What can a Canon camera offer, the price of which far exceeds the cost of a very advanced <span>gaming laptop?</span>  A lot!  To begin with, almost all of them have ‚Äúon board‚Äù a full range of functions that turn the camera into a full-fledged multimedia center, designed not only to create pictures and videos, but also to transfer them to other devices (Wi-Fi), as well as for their operational processing. </p><p>  Many photographers immediately warn that it is better to purchase additional battery packs to improve grasp.  So two problems are immediately solved: the camera lies better in the hands, and the operating time is significantly increased. </p><p>  Note that in this price category there is a wide selection of film cameras.  For example, Canon EOS 3000. This is the difference between the highest professional segment: photographers and artists prefer the film, since it has the most natural color reproduction today.  Like many years ago, Canon continues to be the largest company producing high-quality film, so that users do not have problems with consumables. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best canon cameras" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/458999.jpg" width="448"></div></h2><h2>  The best models </h2><p>  Now that we have reviewed the average reviews, it is time to cite as an example the most striking and frequently purchased representatives of each family.  As in the previous case, we will start from the lower price range, since such cameras diverge in the largest print runs. </p><h2>  Canon PowerShot SX150 IS </h2><p>  A cheap model, the cost of which rarely exceeds 3.5 thousand rubles.  Behind the discreet appearance, pretty good opportunities are hidden: the resolution of 14.1 MPix should not confuse you: in this model for the last time (apparently) we used an old and proven technology that did not spoil the <span>lens aperture.</span> </p><p>  Users also really like the good quality at low ISO values, the well-thought-out menu, thanks to which there is really quick access to all the necessary functions, as well as the survivability of the batteries.  As for the shortcomings, many photographers complain about the insufficiently convenient body shape (poor grip), the obsolete type of matrix, as well as the lens's predisposition to dirt. </p><p>  And now we are smoothly moving to the middle price range. </p><h2>  Canon EOS 600d </h2><p>  Since we mentioned this model above, we will continue to describe its characteristics based on user reviews.  What do photographers say?  Firstly, they note a magnificent 18MP sensor, high light sensitivity and shooting speed, which can reach almost four frames per second. </p><p>  In addition, the Canon EOS 600d received a beautiful anti-glare display, which made working outdoors a lot easier.  By the way, this camera is perfect for this kind of shooting, which has earned the widest recognition among biologists and naturalists. </p><p>  Given that its body is made of metal, polycarbonate and fiberglass, it can withstand even very severe tests.  Even after falling from a height of 1.5-2 meters onto a dirt road, the repair of Canon cameras of this model often comes down to sealing cracks in the case.  And that already says a lot! </p><p>  Finally, we will tell you about the representative of the highest price category. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canon eos camera" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/458998.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Canon EOS 7D Body </h2><p>  If we discuss the best Canon cameras, then this camera should definitely be one of them.  At a cost of 60 thousand rubles, she more than fulfills all the money spent on it.  The reviews indicate that the new 18 MPix sensor allows you to take pictures of amazing quality, and the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù auto focus selects the shooting mode as adequately as possible even in emergency conditions, when there is simply no time to ‚Äúaim‚Äù.  Thus, this option makes it possible not to miss a single more or less significant frame. </p>
