    <h2>  Information on tariffs and interest rate </h2><p>  <span>A microfinance organization has</span> divided its customers into several groups.  For each of them, based on feedback on CreditPlus, individual conditions are provided: </p><ol><li>  All new customers are assigned the ‚ÄúNovice‚Äù status.  For such persons, the maximum possible loan amount is 15 thousand rubles. </li><li>  For customers who have issued from 2 to 4 loans in the Internet service, the status of "Expert" is available.  It makes it possible to receive a loan of up to 20 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Persons applying for 5 to 10 loans become ‚ÄúPartners‚Äù.  They are provided with money in the amount of up to 30 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Customers who apply for and successfully pay more than 10 loans are assigned VIP status.  Such people also have access to the amount of up to 30 thousand rubles. </li></ol><p>  CreditPlus reviews also indicate that the site offers users several options.  The first of these is the extension of the loan term for a period of up to 15 days.  It is available to absolutely all customers.  The second option is to arrange loans through SMS messages.  Only 3 groups of clients - ‚ÄúExperts‚Äù, ‚ÄúPartners‚Äù and VIP, can use it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Loans to <span>microfinance organizations</span> are issued for up to 30 days.  The interest rate is determined taking into account several conditions.  The number of applications, the amount, the selected loan term is taken into account.  For example, during the initial application, the client is going to borrow from 1 thousand to 9.5 thousand for a period of 5 to 15 days.  Under such conditions, the rate will be 784.750% per annum.  In case of secondary circulation and registration of a loan under the same conditions, the rate will decrease to 730% per annum. </p><h2>  Bonus accrual </h2><p>  Loans from CreditPlus are beneficial for customers, because there is a bonus program in the online service.  Its essence is to accrue bonuses to the account of your personal account in the amount of up to 10% of the principal loan amount.  To receive them, one condition is required - timely repayment of borrowed funds. </p><p>  The bonus to the client account is received automatically upon repayment of the loan on time.  Accrued rubles may be used as follows: </p><ul><li>  withdraw to a plastic card, bank account or through payment systems to receive cash; </li><li>  spend on payment of the next loan. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Support service </h2><p>  In order for customers to be able to receive answers to emerging questions, ‚ÄúCredit Plus‚Äù has created a support service.  There is a hotline telephone to contact her.  Calls from all regions of Russia are free.  The support service employs qualified specialists.  They can advise on any issue and help to sort out the problems that arise.  The advantage of a support service is its work schedule.  Specialists are in touch 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  This schedule allows customers to quickly receive answers and advice. </p><p>  If it is not possible to call, you can send your question through the feedback form.  It contains 2 fields: in the first field, the client describes the problem, and in the second - indicates the email address.  It is to her that the answer comes in the future. </p>

    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Some customers have a good opinion about the CreditPlus service, because a microfinance organization working through the Internet has certain advantages.  Firstly, loans are issued as quickly as possible on the site.  Users only need to fill out a questionnaire, indicating in it reliable information about themselves, their work.  Income certificates, guarantors, collateral are not needed. </p><p>  Secondly, any citizen of Russia can apply to Credit Plus.  The region of residence does not play any role for several reasons: </p><ol><li>  The company does not work in any particular subject of our country.  MFIs do not have an office.  All applications are accepted through the CreditPlus website and by phone. </li><li>  Ways to get money are available to all people.  Payment systems work in all cities of the country, and almost every person has plastic cards. </li></ol><p>  Thirdly, CreditPlus offers a convenient and useful service - auto-prolongation.  Quite often, customers forget that they need to repay the loan.  When they remember the return date, they realize that they are facing an overdue period.  In such situations, CreditPlus does not spoil the credit history.  The loan is automatically extended by 10 days.  This service is paid.  The extension cost is 20% of the loan body. </p>

    <h2>  Microfinance Organization Criticism </h2><p>  Customers leave negative feedback about CreditPlus for several reasons.  One of them is associated with an age restriction.  A loan can only be issued to persons over 22 years of age.  Another reason for the appearance of negative reviews is that some customers do not receive money after approval of the application.  In such cases, the microfinance organization asks people to contact support. </p><p>  Users also leave negative reviews due to the fact that the company, in their opinion, is cheating in calculating bonuses (Cashback).  In fact, this is not so.  Bonuses are always accrued for timely repayment of the loan.  They can be absent only if technical problems arise on the site. </p><h2>  CreditPlus Debtors Reviews </h2><p>  Customers who did not pay the loan on time leave different reviews.  Some people testify that microfinance organization specialists are not very worried about delays - they call the phone number indicated on the questionnaire once a week or send an email to their personal e-mail. </p><p>  There are completely opposite reviews.  In them, debtors indicate that company employees behave unacceptably.  They constantly call with threats to bring to justice, start writing on social networks to friends, threaten to transfer the debt received from CreditPlus to collectors.  Specialists also refuse to installment and freeze interest. </p>

    <p>  In conclusion, it is worth noting that the percentage of approval is quite high in the online service CreditPlus.  MFI seeks to help people, provides funds for any purpose (to solve crisis problems, shopping, travel, entertainment).  But in some cases, customers are refused.  The reason for the negative decision may be the presence of a very bad credit history, the indication in the application form of inaccurate information about yourself, and the lack of positive motivation to repay the loan. </p>
