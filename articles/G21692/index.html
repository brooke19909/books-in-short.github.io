In 2000, he successfully graduated from the Moscow Art Theater School, having completed a training course under the patronage of <span>E. Lazarev</span> and D. Brusnikin and received the specialty of theater and film actor. </p><h2>  Carier start </h2><p>  His first appearance in cinema dates back to the same year - Ivan “appeared” in one of the episodes of the famous film “Brother-2” (remember the guy searching on the Internet for a reason to <span>travel to America</span> Danila Bagrova and his brother).  A little later, he played a small role in the film "Zoykin’s apartment", shot by <span>Valery Khlevinsky</span> and Lyubov Timofeeva.  The following year, he also starred in two films.  These were the opus of Leonid Maryagin “101st kilometer”, where I. Kokorin starred in one of the supporting roles, as well as I. Islamgulov’s action movie “Conditioned Reflex”. </p>

    <p>  In 2002, Kokorin Ivan continued his career.  In the next pair of films, he has become more visible.  In the film "Make Love" he got the role of an army sergeant, and in the film "Star" - the soldier Meshchersky.  The roles, although small, the so-called passing, nevertheless they helped our hero to advance in the cinema. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After all, films with more serious work of the actor went on.  So in the film by Bakhtiyer Khudoynazarov called "Shock" Kokorin Ivan perfectly played the role of the Mute, which is one of the three main roles.  The Kinotavr festival not only brought the main prize to the film - the Golden Rose, but also recognizability to the artist himself. </p><h2>  Career turnaround </h2><p>  The turning point in the career of Ivan Kokorin is considered to be the role in the famous film of Sergei Bondarchuk Jr., "The Ninth Company", where he played the role of Cast Iron.  After the release of the picture on the screen, our hero, as they say, woke up famous throughout the country. </p>

    <p>  Our hero is rightfully considered one of the brightest representatives of the sign of Lviv.  Among the traits of his character, one can distinguish not only restraint, but also his own dignity.  Even after meeting Sergei Bodrov Jr., who, as it turned out later, completely did not notice the novice actor, Ivan Kokorin did not give up.  He continued to make his way to Olympus Cinema.  And this, it should be noted, he is doing well. </p><p>  All the heroes played by him, whether it be a soldier, a hero-lover or even an ordinary user, have a pronounced character, which cannot but please the artist himself.  To date, he has starred in more than thirty films and television series.  The most popular of them are considered to be the roles of the escaped prisoner Lehi Lazar in the series “The Last Armored Train” and the role of Nicephorus in the television movie “I Will Wait”. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  In addition to the movie </h2><p>  Film actor Ivan Kokorin, <strong> </strong>  whose biography is quite well known to our viewers, does not forget the first part of his profession - the theater actor.  In 2014, he decided to implement a rather unusual project - at the head of the children's choreographic team, he decided ... to read fairy tales.  Despite the fact that the project was designed for a children's audience, parents who came accompanied by their children do not at all seek to leave the performance.  They look at the performance of the famous actor, as they say, holding their breath.  It turns out that the famous Cast Iron from the "Ninth Company" is a wonderful reciter.  His performances are gaining popularity and are often held with full houses. </p>
