  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bangkok hotels - affordable vacation in an ultra-modern city.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Something mysterious, almost unknown, but at the same time, the ultramodern state of Thailand inexplicably attracts millions of tourists every year.  The most popular vacation in Bangkok is the capital of Thailand, a city of ultra-modern architecture, represented by two-, three-story freeways and giant skyscrapers, contrasting with <span>Buddhist temples.</span>  A constantly growing civilization and an unattainably booming economy led to the formation of smog over the city, which colors numerous Bangkok hotels in a gray tint.  On the lower trestles of the city you can see many amazing things in the usual sense.  These are people almost on the go getting in and out of the bus, policemen wearing masked respirators and much more unusual for a European citizen.  You might think that the city is dirty, but it is not at all.  The streets are maintained in perfect cleanliness, in view of the special law in force here, which provides for the most severe fine in the amount of 60 US dollars for any garbage thrown to the ground. </p><p>  The territory of Bangkok is divided into several areas, among which the following are of particular interest among tourists.  In the Historical Center, located on the island of Rattanakosin, you can see the sights;  in Chinatown, visit the many shops offering the most unusual products;  in Silom - the modern city center, filled with offices of the largest companies, as well as the tallest buildings, the <span>most expensive hotels in</span> Bangkok were built;  in Siam Square - a shopping center that accommodates the largest supermarkets in the city, as well as small shops, you can profitably purchase souvenirs and other things you need for a tourist, and prices are much lower than in tourist areas.  Particularly noteworthy is Pratunam, which is considered the most popular tourist area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, including the most affordable, but at the same time having a good level of Bangkok hotels - most tourists from Russia settle here. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tourists leaving reviews of Bangkok hotels on various Internet resources confirm that the hotels in this city are characterized by an excellent price / quality ratio of service.  Indeed, the low cost did not lead to a drop in the level of hotels in Bangkok - almost each of them provides all the possibilities for comfortable accommodation.  The feature that characterizes almost all hotels in Bangkok is their small territories, but this is not such a significant drawback, against the background of obvious pluses. </p><p>  Locations can be found almost everywhere.  Most hotels are concentrated in the historical center of Bangkok, but they are also present in the Silom business district and Siam Square.  Of course, the Thais did not deprive Sukumvit, which is the center of nightlife and tourism in general, on this issue. Some of the best representatives of each class of Bangkok hotels are described below. </p><p>  FOUR SEASONS INTERNATIONAL HOUSE 5 * - one of the best hotels in Asia, superbly combining luxury and elegance of interiors, and traditional Thai motifs.  Upon arrival, the hotel immediately impresses with spacious halls, apartments, lots of antique objects and works of art ... The rooms are decorated with delicate <span>pastel colors that</span> give peace.  The ceilings and walls are decorated with silk panels and wallpaper, which are painted by hand.  The furniture is decorated with unique handmade carvings, harmoniously combined with brightly colored carpets.  One of the highlights of the hotel is its beautiful courtyard, which contains a small garden, a pond and fragrant <span>lotus flowers.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  ADRIATIC PPALACE BANGKOK 4 * </p><p>  The newest hotel, located at the intersection of Sukhumvit and Wireless, that is, in the heart of Bangkok.  This location determines the proximity to the most famous and popular shopping centers, which can be reached in just a few minutes.  This hotel is perhaps the best solution for both tourists and businessmen. </p><p>  ALEXANDER 3 * </p><p>  This hotel cannot but arouse interest in every guest of Bangkok.  The popularity of the Alexander Hotel is primarily due to its very convenient location, traditionally hospitable Thai staff, as well as excellent service.  The hotel is located in the Huamark district, from which easy access to many of Bangkok's attractions is represented by the Huamark Sports Complex, the University and the Happy Land Entertainment Center.  It takes 30 minutes to get to the city center and shopping centers.  The hotel infrastructure is represented by: a fitness center, sauna, <span>swimming pool,</span> tropical park, large conference rooms, three restaurants, two bars, karaoke. </p>

    <p>  Tourists can be advised to avoid ordering dinner at the hotel, otherwise eating in most cases will take place all alone.  Guests of Bangkok prefer to have lunch and dinner in restaurants and cafes, which operate in an incredible amount in the city.  Of course, Thai cuisine with its exotic dishes is another aspect that attracts tourists to Bangkok.  Here you can try dishes that are not available in any other place - you can say a real gourmet paradise. </p><p>  Tourists can visit Bangkok at any time, the hotels of the city are happy to welcome guests all year round.  Most tourists from our country prefer to relax in Thailand in the winter.  This is due to the dry season in the country during this period.  The prevailing cloudy weather, rarely accompanied by precipitation, makes it possible to appreciate the impressive beauty of the city and fully enjoy your vacation without thinking about the weather.  In winter, even the night temperature in Bangkok does not drop below 20 degrees Celsius.  Thus, the best time to relax here is the period from early December to late February. </p>
