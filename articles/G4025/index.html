And when the question is about personal care, we always try to choose <span>cosmetics</span> with a minimum content of systemic substances, whether it‚Äôs hand cream or bath products, laundry detergents or home cleaning fluids.  Now it‚Äôs fashionable and prestigious to use only natural products.  And even more so when we choose something for our children.  From the article you will find out who Olesya Mustaeva is.  The workshop (customer reviews are always positive) in a short time won her fame due to the quality of the products.  Well, now get comfortable and read! </p><h2>  The cost of natural cosmetics "Workshop Olesya Mustaeva": proven quality </h2><p>  Since there is a great demand for naturalness in our technogenic world, all companies that produce cosmetics follow fashion trends.  Of course, the cost of natural products is an order of magnitude higher than creams, gels, shampoos and other compounds with synthetic ingredients.  Nevertheless, demand does not fall.  Because we all understand: you have to pay for high quality. </p><h2>  Components of cosmetics, natural preservatives </h2><p>  Natural oils, various extracts from plants become active components of body care products, face, hair.  To isolate them from plants, scientists have developed special natural solvents.  They help to highlight the desired extract, while retaining the largest number of useful components.  This process is long and painstaking.  Like all natural products, such cosmetics cannot be stored for long.  But even here our scientists found a way out: extracts of some plants can serve as excellent preservatives, because even air can be a carrier of pathogenic microbes, from which cosmetic products become worthless. <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Workshop of Olesya Mustaeva" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32960/1187610.jpg" width="500"></div>

Naturally, unlike the natural analogue, synthetic will not bring anything good to the skin.  But a natural vitamin will prevent the aging of your skin by eliminating free radicals.  This is a true vitamin of youth. </p><p>  Lemon is also an excellent natural preservative.  Not citrus itself, of course, but its acid.  In addition to preventing spoilage and rotting of products, it is also used as a defoamer, diluent and pH modifier in cosmetics.  Of course, these are not all natural preservatives.  Everyone knows salt, honey, apple cider vinegar and many others.  In general, there is plenty to choose from. </p>

    <h2>  The naturalness of the products is everyone‚Äôs choice </h2><p>  For ourselves and for our loved ones, we try to choose only natural products and hygiene products.  The ideal solution is to dry herbs, buy honey, other products and do everything at home.  After all, then you can be completely sure that only natural raw materials are used.  And in those cases when there is no time to carefully approach the manufacture of the same face cream, you can trust the professionals, but only if you are sure of the quality of the raw materials.  After all, you can spoil a cream or scrub by adding at least one dubious product to it, whether it's essential oil or vitamins. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  High quality - high demand </h2>

    <p>  <span>"Workshop Olesya Mustaeva"</span> produces caring cosmetics for a wide audience.  The team painstakingly works on the manufacture of each type of product so that you can feel all the delights of natural care.  <span>Amla oil is excellent,</span> which is very actively used in the manufacture of cosmetics along with argan.  Floral waters replace tonics and moisturizers.  Shampoos and hair conditioners, body and face care products, cosmetics - "Olesya Mustaeva's Workshop" presents a huge assortment, you will have plenty to choose from. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of the "Workshop": everything is packed in a lightproof container, and this is no accident.  Such packaging protects against sunlight.  So, for example, flower water should only be stored in dark glass!  But there are unscrupulous companies selling a great tool in ordinary plastic.  Hydrolate, or flower water, is a by-product of the production of essential oils obtained by distillation.  That's just a side you can not name it!  This water retains all the beneficial properties of plants.  Today, rose and lavender hydrolytes are very popular.  Although, as previously stated, naturalness is prestigious, the "Workshop of Olesya Mustaeva" does not pursue cheap popularity.  On the contrary, everything is done here so that products are affordable and maintain high quality.  And also for the Olesya team it is important to produce not only products that are healthy and safe for the body, but also that do not harm the environment. </p>
