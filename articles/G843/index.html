Modern women are increasingly buying standard things and redoing them themselves by flashing a thing with a cross or beads.  Besides the fact that such clothes turn out to be fashionable, they also become exclusive, because by buying an ordinary inexpensive dress, you can make a masterpiece out of it, selling it can earn two, or even three times as much.  Embroidery on clothes looks bright, individual and expensive. </p><p>  Basically, this magic of transforming clothes from ordinary gray things into bright things is available to everyone.  To do this, it is enough to have the initial skills of cross-stitching and beads in the usual outline. </p><h2>  Patterned interior </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery on clothes" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39187/991404.jpg"></div></h2><p>  A few centuries ago, women sought to decorate the interior of the house with embroidered pillowcases, sheets, towels and even table napkins.  Cross stitching filled almost every home.  A well-educated girl was considered to be one who knew how to embroider, knit, cook.  Many ordinary women made a living by weaving and embroidering with a cross, stitch and other types of tablecloths, napkins, towels, bedding and clothes.  These items were exported to bazaars and fairs, where they were bought by wealthy citizens.  And skilled craftswomen were always provided with orders, since the desire to decorate your home and wear beautiful clothes was inherent in women at all times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Handmade embroidery </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch on clothes" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39187/995851.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Initially, cross-stitch on clothing, which was decorated with almost everything: women's and men's shirts, trousers, skirts and dresses, was very popular.  In those days there was no such clothing that did not have at least a few flowers executed with cross stitching.  Such things were considered ceremonial and wore mainly for mass celebrations.  Some needlewomen traded their products in local bazaars.  Buyers increasingly became ladies who did not have the desire and time to learn the craft of needlewomen. </p><h2>  Progress has come - popularity has gone </h2>
