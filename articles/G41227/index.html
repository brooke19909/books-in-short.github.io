  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Asocial behavior: how it manifests itself and what to do with it</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For normal health, people need to interact not only with individuals, but also with society as a whole.  So a person begins to feel himself a member of a group and better understands what his position in society is.  Formed knowledge of one‚Äôs position can be a conscious motivation in order to try to occupy the highest possible position in society.  But sometimes a person behaves socially wrong.  And such a course of action is called "antisocial behavior."  Let us consider in more detail what it is. </p><p>  In the West, even a special type of personality development is singled out.  We have not officially accepted this.  But our researchers and Westerners mean the same thing under the term "asocial behavior."  This is a destructive behavior characterized by latent or overt hostility and conscious aggression against others.  There are manifestations of varying degrees of severity.  Perhaps the whole thing is limited only to a violation of social rules, but it could be much worse.  Open disregard for the orders of official structures and <span>informal leaders,</span> unwillingness to recognize the rights of others, deceitfulness, and a tendency not to respect the rights of people around are all signs of the phenomenon of ‚Äúantisocial behavior‚Äù. </p><p>  He is diagnosed in the West in children from the age of three years.  If you do not pay attention to the fact that a child is inclined, for example, to torture a cat, over time it can reach people.  So in no case should you leave the propensity for violence unattended. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Asocial behavior can be overt.  It manifests itself in relation to brothers and sisters, parents, teachers and classmates.  Often at school age it takes the form of verbal abuse, a tendency to tease and beat other children.  And it can be hidden, that is, associated with disrespect for property, for example, theft, vandalism or arson.  <span>Social psychology of</span> antisocial behavior considers as a latent form its tendency to lie to a child in a situation where serious punishment is not expected, or the desire to secretly spoil other people's toys.  After such "kids" grow up, they often become clients of drug dealers and regulars in alcohol departments of stores. </p><p>  Girls in general are less likely to behave asocially compared to boys.  But they are prone to more sophisticated manifestations.  For example, they organize harassment of women of the same sex or provoke aggression of boys against each other.  Representatives of the stronger sex are more prone to open manifestations of socially incorrect behavior, to physical aggression. </p><p>  In many ways, the emergence of such behavior is associated with the relationship of parents in the family.  Often, destructive communication strategies in a child are associated with the fact that he protests in this way against <span>domestic violence</span> or the conflict of parents between themselves.  Sometimes these children show aggression against pets after they themselves are subjected to aggression by their parents or other children.  In many ways, the manifestations of improper behavior are hereditary, especially with regard to the child‚Äôs temperament and irritability.  Such children usually have low <span>cognitive abilities</span> and are often in contact with antisocial peers. </p><p>  Is there anything you can do?  Yes, a good psychologist can help to train a child to control his anger, understand his and other people's emotions, and find compromises in difficult situations.  Often help in this group exercises.  In severe cases, drug therapy is used, which reduces the incidence of impulsive behavior. </p>
