  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Zanussi Aquacycle 800: instructions, modes and benefits of a washing machine</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the ranking of sales leaders among washing machines in our territory, the model range of Zanussi is held at one of the top lines.  This is not surprising, since this is one of the most popular brands not only in Russia but throughout the world.  Buyers, first of all, are attracted by the most optimal correlation of the price policy quality and functional characteristics of washing machines, and the manual of Zanussi Aquacycle 800, the most popular model, allows us to conclude that the company met the expectations of women who are satisfied with the price-quality ratio. </p><h2>  Advantages of Zanussi Washing Machines </h2><p>  Among the many advantages of the whole range of washing machines of the Zanussi trademark, it is worth noting their special and to some extent even unique functionality.  All of them are equipped with such programs for possible wash options that take into account almost any case. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gumtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zanussi - quality washing machine" class="if uuid-3257118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84916/3257118.jpg"></div><p>  According to the instructions, the Zanussi Aquacycle 800 has a delicate mode (with it you can easily wash the most delicate fabrics that require extra gentle washing without fear).  This mode combines the functions of washing products with the least movement of the drum and the use of chemical detergents and the so-called hand wash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most frequently used quick wash mode, which is used by many housewives for daily work, has been improved and now combines the functions of gentle washing of products from cotton, linen and other natural fabrics, as well as from wool and knitwear. </p><p>  For convenience, after the ‚Äúspin‚Äù mode, some models were equipped with the additional ‚Äúeasy ironing‚Äù function. </p><h2>  Additional features: instructions for the Zanussi Aquacycle 800 washing machine </h2><p>  Zanussi practically eliminates strong creases or wrinkles on your washed laundry, even without much storing things in the machine before washing, due to its drum movement mode.  Also now you can manually adjust the optimal spin mode.  It should be borne in mind that the more revolutions the drum makes during spinning, the faster your laundry will dry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.appliancesdirect.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Machine control panel" class="if uuid-3257117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84916/3257117.jpg"></div><p>  As can be seen from the instructions, the Zanussi Aquacycle 800 panel is similar to any washing machine of other brands.  There are mechanical systems, rotary beacons, displays.  Expensive models are equipped with semi-automatic programs for deferred washing.  The machine is designed so that anyone can understand all the modes without special additional skills, following the instructions.  Zanussi Aquacycle 800 economically consumes water, consumes electricity without unnecessary energy costs, and washing powder and additional substances are not required especially expensive, since the washing technology itself already guarantees perfect quality. </p><h2>  Why exactly Zanussi? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.leons.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Washing machines for home" class="if uuid-3257115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84916/3257115.jpg"></div><p>  In the presence of models with both front loading of the drum and with horizontal.  Now they can even be placed in a kitchen set - built-in models are increasingly in demand. </p><p>  A unique invention from Zanussi engineers and designers is the tilted drum model.  This option provides improved washing quality as well as added safety. </p><p>  The developers have provided protection against failure of the washing mode (for example, due to overloading the drum with wet things or from a sudden power outage). </p><p>  Now, on each machine, a Fuzzy logic processor is installed, which significantly reduces the degree of vibration of the machine.  The instructions for the Zanussi Aquacycle 800 are attached to the product upon purchase. </p>
