Starting from a young age, we have been accustomed to the technologies behind the future.  Now more often you can meet a child with a tablet than with a toy that was popular with children of the 90s.  What kind of thing is it that is so good at occupying children and adults? </p><h2>  PCs go by the wayside? </h2><p>  A tablet is a portable device that is not inferior in functionality to a computer, and at the same time it is several times more convenient due to the rejection of the keyboard and mouse. </p>

    <p>  The entire control process takes place by touching the fingers of the screen of the device.  One of the key benefits is its size.  Compared to a <span>desktop computer,</span> control via the touch screen may seem a little uncomfortable for a beginner, but it‚Äôs worth a little use and you get used to this innovation. </p><h2>  And what about the price? </h2><p>  Today, the price of a tablet varies in a fairly wide range due to the fact that the devices differ in screen size, processor power and installed memory.  But, regardless of the configuration, they are all able to cope with a number of functions that a user usually performs on a computer: watching videos, surfing the Internet, viewing and editing documents, and so on.  Children are interested in this device because it can install many games on different topics.  Many parents are grateful to the tablet, because, having occupied the child with a modern toy, they can go about their business. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Stylus: many functions in one touch </h2><p>  On the gadget market, a tablet with a stylus on Windows is rapidly gaining popularity.

    <p>  The quality of some Chinese devices leaves much to be desired, but there are so-called nuggets among useless trash, which, despite their low price, can make any user surprised.  They have fantastic characteristics and huge functionality that each person can realize by force. </p><h2>  Cube iWork10 Flagship - breaking stereotypes </h2><p>  One such nugget is the Cube iWork10 Flagship.  If you are looking for an inexpensive, yet powerful enough tablet, then this is what you need.  By all characteristics, it is in the leading place, but if you see the price tag, you can fall into a stupor.  This device is available on both Windows 10 and Android 5.1, and the price difference is not large. </p><p>  The tablet meets us with a 10 inch high-resolution screen.  The look immediately falls on the wide frames at the edges, but they are compensated by a screen resolution of 1920x1200.  The picture is simply gorgeous, the colors are saturated and deep, and the viewing angle will not leave you without attention.  On the side of the device there are several outputs: a 3.5 mm headphone output, micro-USB, there is also a slot for a memory card.  The tablet is equipped with two stereo speakers and a connector for connecting a keyboard.  The power button is located on top paired with volume rockers. </p><h2>  Cheap and cheerful </h2><p>  Inside we are waiting for a fairly powerful quad-core <span>Intel Atom</span> X5-Z8300 processor with a frequency of 1.44 GHz, as well as a Gen8-LP10 graphics processor.  It provides the quality of the picture that users observe.  Together, this gives high performance, which allows you to surf the Internet without problems or even play. </p>

    <p>  For such a low price, you get 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage, which is currently a good performance.  If it‚Äôs not enough for you, then the device supports memory cards up to 128 GB.  The tablet is equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth - modules of the latest generations.  The only drawback of this model are the cameras.  Both are 2 megapixels, which is quite small by today's standards.  You will not get high quality pictures here.  What can not be said about the battery.  She was delivered here with a reserve (7500 mAh). </p><p>  According to the manufacturers, it should be enough for 6 hours of continuous operation or watching a video.  The most pleasant of the pluses is the support of a large number of video, audio, photo formats, as well as programs.  The Android version is equipped with a large number of interface languages, just change it in the settings.  On Windows, only Chinese and English are initially available, but you can download a special package to get the Russian language. </p><h2>  Need to use! </h2><p>  As a result, we get a good tablet with excellent filling, original design and a long enough working time, which will make most users admire.  This gadget can be purchased at many Chinese online stores. </p>
