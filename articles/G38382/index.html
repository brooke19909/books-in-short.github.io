Numerous travelers, plowing the whole world, are sure that they know such a corner, located far from all modern problems of civilization.  The indigenous people living in a virgin place really consider themselves the happiest, daily rejoicing at what they have. </p><h2>  Vanuatu: where is the wild pearl located? </h2><p>  An exotic <span>island nation</span> located in the Pacific Ocean near Australia stretches for almost a thousand kilometers.  Tour operators have relatively recently discovered for us this truly unique route with magnificent natural views, a chic underwater world and always friendly local natives.  And it is not in vain that the archipelago, consisting of isolated islands, of which about sixty are inhabited, is also called the country of smiles.  An amazing state, whose name translates as "eternal land", was formed as a result of volcanic activity at the bottom of the ocean. </p>

    <p>  And now in the territory where Vanuatu is located, often there are small tremors of 10 <span>active volcanoes that</span> do not cause special damage to the local nature.  The geographical location of the paradise is very interesting: on the one hand, the mountainous islands are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, on the other - by the Coral Sea.  But there are practically no rivers here, this feature is due to the tectonic origin of the porous soil of the lost world. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of discovery and independence </h2><p>  In the XVII century, the archipelago inhabited by the inhabitants of Oceania, where Vanuatu is currently located, was first discovered by a Spanish expedition.  A hundred years later, the English cartographer D. Cook began to conduct his research there, after which the territory was called New Hebrides.  At the beginning of the XX century, the authorities of France and Britain declare their rights to these disparate distinctive islands.  Indigenous people were forcibly taken to hard <span>work in Australia.</span>  Until 1980, a small condominium was the colonial possession of these countries, until the state of Vanuatu received its official independence and a new name.  The capital of the archipelago is the largest and most developed city of Port Vila - the main trade and economic center located on the island of Efate. </p><h2>  Island Identity </h2><p>  The small republic of Vanuatu, consisting of 6 provinces, has experienced several migration flows from countries in Asia and Europe, and now it is inhabited by 114 nationalities speaking a huge number of languages ‚Äã‚Äãand dialects.  Residents of an independent state live not only due to well-established agricultural activities in the villages, but also tourist routes.  The pristine paradise of Oceania has gained a reputation as a distinctive resort with tribes living there, leading a way of life that is far from the views of Europeans.  Selected leaders, whose word is law to all, often offer sacrifices to ancient spirits. </p>

    <p>  In the studied places of the archipelago where Vanuatu is located, Russian scientists found dolmens considered to be the main shrines - stone structures that conveyed to the leaders the desires of the departed ancestors.  They were also used in local religious rituals, which are still valid today.  Until now, the natives participate in ritual dances, portraying mythical creatures and spirits.  And the well-known drawings in the sand clearly reflect the beliefs of the inhabitants and ancient legends. </p><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tourist paradise </h2><p>  All the major islands of Vanuatu are curious by the variety of amazing sights created by nature itself, which are not found in other exotic corners <span>of the globe.</span>  This is a real tourist paradise in the tropics, memorable gorgeous views.  Efate Island is extremely popular with tourists.  The most beautiful lagoons, striking in the size of coral reefs, ancient ships, sunken in the depths, attract everyone who is keen on diving.  The incredibly clear water of the bay allows you to see frolicing fish at a depth of 50 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vanuatu islands" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1099625.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Not far from the capital of the Pacific state there is a whole cascade of picturesque waterfalls hiding in exotic tropical forests and have long been a favorite place for all tourists.  They say that the first rapids do not strike with magnificence, but the last, powerful 40-meter jets make you freeze with admiration. </p><h2>  Volcanoes and magic </h2><p>  The territory where Vanuatu is located is located in a zone with tectonic activity, so it is not surprising that travelers are interested in this unique side of the archipelago.  Here is the sacred volcano Yasur, which erupts for 8 centuries.  And this is the only place in the world, accompanied by small earthquakes, is available for visiting tourists.  The unusual island of Ambrim is famous for an ancient volcano.  In two huge craters, a red-hot lava splashes, solidifying with dark streams after ejection. </p>

    <p>  The inhabitants of the island are the only indigenous people who seriously engage in magical rites.  Local sorcerers professing ancient cults are considered the best forecasters, and all Europeans come here to find out their fate. </p><h2>  Submarine mail </h2><p>  The amazing state of Vanuatu is famous for the fact that the post office is under water near the capital.  The attraction is located at a depth, and it is impossible to get there without special equipment.  Having enjoyed plenty of underwater beauty, you can send waterproof cards, redeemed by special underwater embossing, to all ends of the globe. </p>
