    <p>  The option of investing all your funds in a deposit is also not entirely correct, since all the money will depend on the bank, which may ‚Äúburst‚Äù the next day.  In addition, the interest that banks offer on deposits, with a stretch, can only block the level of inflation in the country.  How to be? </p><h2>  We are looking for the right answer </h2><p>  For those people who have a streak of entrepreneur and are looking for the right answer to the question of where to invest 1,000,000 rubles to earn, an ideal option would be to open their own business or invest in someone else's business.  But far from everyone succeeds in doing this, and it is especially competent to build a working scheme according to which the invested funds will not only pay off, but also bring enviable incomes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In this article we will try to answer the question of where to invest 1,000,000 rubles to earn money by analyzing the current situation in the economy and the best business ideas of our time. </p><p>  If you think that you need to ask yourself such questions only after you really earn such an amount of money, then you are misleading yourself.  You always need to set a goal and imagine what you will do when you reach it.  Indeed, to earn a fortune is a thankless task and requires a lot of effort.  And it‚Äôs even more difficult to manage earned money correctly. </p>

    <p>  In addition, your cafe can move to a place where any holidays are held at this moment and, accordingly, there is a large flow of people.  Perhaps, mobile coffee is one of the best answers to the question of where to invest 1 million rubles to make a profit. </p><p>  If you manage to come up with some challenging idea, themes and cuisine in your institution, as well as to open several of these points, thereby covering large areas, then you will start earning soon. </p><p>  And you will find very few competitors, since this type of business in the Russian Federation is only at the stage of origin, which makes it even more attractive.  However, experts say that in 2-3 years, a wave of mobile coffee houses will already fill the large and medium-sized cities of Russia. </p><h2>  Not a new but changing vending business </h2><p>  So, we continue to review good ideas for business.  If you have not yet decided where to invest 1,000,000 rubles and earn, then be sure to consider a <span>vending business.</span> </p><p>  Unfamiliar word?  Remember the apparatus with sparkling water in the distant times of the Soviet Union.  The essence of the vending business is to place automatic devices that can serve passers-by in a particular area. </p><p>  Despite the fact that a similar type of business appeared in Europe in the 17th century, it is rather poorly developed in the Russian Federation and is mainly focused around coffee and shoe covers.  The full potential of this type of service is not revealed at all. </p><p>  A new trend is machines with healthy food.  Yes, you will not believe!  Coca-Cola and the chips that you can buy by throwing a coin in the machine are a thing of the past.  The modern world cares about the state of its health. </p>

    <p>  Imagine a network of special machines that help people eat healthy and healthy.  Given that low-quality products containing GMOs, preservatives and other harmful additives are increasingly appearing in today's stores, your business will flourish. </p><h2>  Install a minimum of 5 devices </h2><p>  If you like this type of business and, choosing <span>where to invest a million</span> rubles (1,000,000 rubles), you settled on vending, then consider the following nuances.  Beginners always think that by putting 1 device in a crowded place, they will be able to earn.  This is an erroneous opinion. </p><p>  For payback within 1-1.5 years, experts advise installing at least 5-6 machines.  Of course, crowded places are important for business, but you need to pick them up so that this crowd is interested in your products.  That is, passers-by should want to use such a machine.  It follows that in rich areas, private sectors, the placement of devices will be inappropriate. </p><p>  They should stand near and in business centers in which mid-level personnel work.  There should also be nearby places where you can exchange or withdraw money from the card to pay for the services of the machine. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the operability of the devices: if the client gives his money at least once, and the mechanism does not give him the desired product, then the person will never come to this place again for a purchase, having painted it in all colors before his relatives and friends. </p><h2>  Perhaps you should not give up the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãinvesting in a bank? </h2><p>  The above ways to make money with your money are certainly good.  They are built on the example of outstanding people who were able to earn their ideas not only on bread, but also on the whole kingdom. </p>

    <p>  But if you did not like them and you are still looking for how profitable it is to invest 1 million rubles in order to earn money, consider the deposit offers of banks.  Of course, you need to do this wisely.  But if you can skillfully place your funds in financial institutions, then you can earn money, while minimizing all risks.  How to do this, we will consider further. </p><h2>  Distribute money to several financial institutions </h2><p>  Never put all your money in a deposit in one bank.  In this case, you risk too much to be left without funds.  Experts advise dividing their finances into several parts (preferably at least 5) and, after analyzing the market conditions, put them on deposits in different banks. </p><p>  Moreover, the bulk of the money should be placed in financial institutions with a worldwide reputation or national (state) status.  Other commercial banks are much more often at risk of bankruptcy. </p><p>  For convenience, issue a plastic card, on which interest will be transferred monthly or at the end of the deposit term.  This method will not bring you superprofits, but it will keep your money safe and will allow you to earn at least a small but necessary penny. </p><h2>  There are many more ideas. </h2><p>  If you are thinking about where to invest a million rubles (1,000,000), the various ideas presented above will certainly come in handy.  However, do not despair if you have not found a suitable option. </p>

After all, if something else is not in the country, then either no one knows about it, or others have not yet managed to adopt the basics of business. </p>
