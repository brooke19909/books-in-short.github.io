Do you know what country Mount Athos is located in?  What is she famous for?  Who inhabits her?  We will try to answer these and many other questions now. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Now let's see where Mount Athos is located on the map.  On the northern coast of the Aegean Sea, in Greece, there is a peninsula of unusual shape, resembling a three-finger hand.  This is Halkidiki.  His easternmost ‚Äúfinger‚Äù, which stretches over sixty kilometers, is Athos.  From the east it is washed by the waters of the deep bay of Ierisu.  In the west, the Gulf of Singitikos bears its dark blue waters.  In the north is the isthmus of Xerxes, and nearby is the famous town of Uranopolis.  Pilgrims who are interested in Mount Athos (Greece) pass through it.  Its height is 2033 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is Mount Athos" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1020176.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  It is located in such a way that you can reach it only by sea, having bought a ticket for the ship next to Daphnia Bay, where the port is located.  From here, along the highway you should reach Karei (this is the administrative center of the monastic republic).  Since storms occur here quite often, pilgrims who know where Athos (the mountain) is located often choose a shorter route here - via Uranopolis.  And now let's move on to the most interesting - the history of this place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The history of Mount Athos </h2><p>  Since ancient times, the Athos Peninsula was inhabited by Greek tribes.  Through it passed all the main sea lanes that connected Greece with the East. </p><p>  Documentary evidence of the existence of small cities on the peninsula (which appeared 1000 years before Christ) has been preserved.  The works of the great historians of antiquity (Thucydides and Herodotus) mention the names of some of them, such as Olofikos, Fissos, Cleone, Dion, Apollonia, Acroafos.  The exact location of these settlements has not yet been established. </p>

    <p>  When the first ascetics arrived on Athos, the cities that were previously in their prime (the population was 10,000 people) were empty. </p><h2>  Athos - holy mountain </h2><p>  Since the inception of monasticism, the brothers quite often settled in the mountains and, thanks to ascetic activity, called these places holy.  They were in Egypt, Palestine, Asia Minor, Syria.  Most of them left either a few cloisters in which few monks live, or ruins of buildings that testify to the former greatness of these places. </p><h2>  Monasticism on Mount Athos </h2><p>  An ancient church tradition says that on Mount Athos, the Mother of God began to preach, who took this place under her protection. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It‚Äôs hard to say when the first monks appeared on Mount Athos.  Researchers believe that in the forests of the peninsula the first Christians took refuge from persecution.  The barbaric raids of the enemies, the constant persecution destroyed almost all the documents that could shed light on the initial stage of the life of the monastic republic.  Partially fill this vacuum with numerous traditions.  Naturally, they cannot serve as serious evidence for scientists.  Nevertheless, many researchers believe that the first monks of the holy mountain (Athos was just such a place) appeared during the time of Equal-to-the-Apostles Constantine. </p>

    <p>  If you believe the legend, Constantine the Great decided to build a new capital of the Roman Empire on the Athos Peninsula.  Work on drawing up urban plans was already in full swing when Mark, the bishop of the area, came to the emperor.  He told Konstantin that the Virgin herself chose this place.  The pious emperor abandoned his venture, in addition, he built three magnificent temples on Mount Athos in honor of the Virgin near the settlements, on the site of which today are Vatopedi and Iversky monasteries, Kareya.  Later they were destroyed by Julian the Apostate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Constantine sent the inhabitants of Athos to the Peloponnese.  There is another version that the emigration was carried out later by the emperor Pogonat. </p><h2>  "Women are not allowed!" </h2><p>  This is the main ban in force in the monastic republic since 422.  It was at this time that the daughter of the emperor Theodosius wanted to enter the <span>monastery Vatoped,</span> but she was stopped by a voice coming from the icon of the Mother of God.  From this moment, no woman was on the mountain. </p><p>  In the VII century, after the conquest of Palestine, Syria and Egypt by Muslim Arabs, the monks had to leave these lands.  Most of them moved to Athos.  The monks found refuge there were also pursued by iconoclastic emperors. </p><p>  Since the 9th century, this place has become one of the main monastic centers of the East.  The monks of Mount Athos took an active part in the work of the XVII <span>Ecumenical Council.</span>  At this time, Athos monasticism already had three forms of existence - skitsky, cinnamon (sociable), and hermit. </p>

    <p>  At first, the monks lived next to the laity, but by the 9th century the last farmers and shepherds left the peninsula.  In 883, Emperor Vasily I issued a decree in which he approved the peninsula as the place of residence of only monks.  It should be noted that Athos (the holy mountain) lives by the rules that have never changed, right up to our time. </p><h2>  Rev. Athanasius </h2><p>  This man laid the foundations of monasticism on Mount Athos.  St. Athanasius was distinguished not only by piety, but also by numerous virtues, but also by the outstanding abilities of the organizer.  The Great Lavra under his leadership became an exemplary monastery; dozens of monasteries were later organized in its image. </p>

    <p>  Young men from all over the world, finding out where Athos (the mountain) is located, went to the Monk Athanasius, wishing to receive spiritual instruction.  Both commoners and representatives of noble families got here.  2500 Athos monks came to the funeral service of St. Athanasius. </p><h2>  Golden Age of Athos </h2><p>  This period dates back to the 14th century.  The holy mountain began to bear spiritual fruit, its fame spread throughout Christianity throughout the world. </p><p>  Athos became the center of the Hesychast rebirth.  This trend developed in two directions: in seclusion and sociable monasticism. </p><p>  At this time, the sketes of John the Baptist and St. Anne appear. </p><h2>  Holy mountain in the 20th century </h2><p>  From 1910 to 1971 on Athos the number of inhabitants decreased significantly - from ten thousand to one thousand two hundred people, and their age reached an average of 55 years.  Many researchers believed that the end of Athos was approaching, projects were put forward to turn this holy place into a huge tourist center with a museum complex.  The elders and ascetics could not find young followers; there was a threat of ending the millennial tradition, which was passed down from generation to generation.  Huge monasteries and monasteries were depopulated and began to collapse. </p><p>  But unexpectedly, even for optimists, the unexpected happened - Mount Athos began to revive.  Today the number of monks exceeds 1800 people. </p>

    <h2>  The life of the monastic republic </h2><p>  Along the peninsula where Mount Athos (mountain) is located, twenty ancient monasteries are built on the cliffs, which are very reminiscent of medieval castles.  Each pilgrim is struck by their beauty and grandeur.  In addition, on the territory of Athos there are twelve monasteries, a large number of cells, huts and kaliv hermits. </p><p>  The charter of the monastic republic prohibits the founding of <span>new monasteries.</span>  Its territory is divided into regions.  Each of them belongs to one of the monasteries. </p><p>  This division is determined not only by property privileges, but also by legal obligations.  Each year, representatives of four monasteries draw up the law of the executive branch of Athos.  Every year they elect a representative who is a member of the supreme self-government body (Holy Kinot) of the monastic republic. </p><p>  On the holy mountain in its original form, the charters of communal life and hermitage were preserved.  Pilgrimage to the hermitages and monasteries is able to fill the heart with light and joy. </p><h2>  Monasteries of Athos </h2><p>  Today there are twenty monasteries on this earth.  Although the charter does not imply an increase in their number, if necessary, it is allowed to create new monasteries and cells. </p><p>  The monasteries on Mount Athos differ in a hierarchical system, determined not by the size of the temple or its wealth, but by the degree of influence and the time of foundation. </p><h2>  Great Lavra Monastery </h2><p>  This is the oldest building on Mount Athos.  It is also called the Lavra of St. Athanasius.  The foundation of the monastery dates back to 963.  It was organized by St. Athanasius.  The most valuable relic of the monastery is an ancient manuscript, which shows the names of the first monks, as well as the manuscript, in a gold frame, the Gospel, the personal cross of St. Athanasius. </p>

    <h2>  Zograf Monastery </h2><p>  Another oldest monastery of Athos.  According to legend, it was founded by three Bulgarian brothers, immigrants from the royal family.  In 1873, a monument was erected in the courtyard of the monastery on the spot where 26 monks met the painful death, burned alive by the Latins in 1276. </p><h2>  Monastery of St.  Paul </h2><p>  It is impossible not to say a few words about the monastery of St.  Paul, which is located in the southeast of Athos.  After Turkish repressions at the beginning of the 19th century, the inhabitants left the monastery and returned to it thanks to the help of the Russian tsars.  The monastery was built in the X century.  He was badly damaged during the fire of 1902. </p><h2>  Monastery of St.  Panteleimon </h2><p>  The cloister has another name - "Russik".  He appeared on Athos at the beginning of the XI century, when the first Russian monks came here.  In the XIX century, it totaled more than 1000 inhabitants.

    <p>  The most revered icons on Mount Athos with the image of the Mother of God are Portaitissa (Goalkeeper) and Gerontissa (Staritsa).  They can be worshiped in the monasteries of Iviron and Pantocrator.  Mount Athos lives as if out of time.  She does not seduce the temptations of the sinful life of the laity. </p><p>  Now you know where Mount Athos is - the mountain is mysterious and beautiful.  If you have a chance, by all means visit this amazing place. </p>
