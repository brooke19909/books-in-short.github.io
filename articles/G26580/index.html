City of Dubna</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Summer is the favorite season of the year for fishermen, when they can not only take the time of their passion, but also take a break from the bustle of the city, live in a tent, enjoy the surrounding beauty and return home full of strength and energy.  If at the same time there will be good fishing, then we can assume that the rest was a success.  Fishing on the Dubna River allows you to spend quality time doing what you love. </p><h2>  River Dubna </h2><p>  This river is one of the five largest reservoirs in the Moscow Region along with <span>Klyazma, Moscow,</span> Oka and Pakhra.  Being the right <span>tributary of the Volga,</span> it forms an arrow with it of stunning beauty, in which Ratmino is located - the former estate of the Vyazemsky princes.  Located in the immediate vicinity of the confluence of the two rivers, Kalitnikovsky Bor, in which old centuries-old pines grow, beautiful beaches with clean sand, excellent fishing places - all this makes travelers want to stay here longer. </p>

    <p>  Dubna - although the river is not wide (maximum distance of 60 m), is nevertheless known not only to fishermen and lovers of relaxation near the water, but also to kayakers.  Throughout the course of the course (167 km), its banks change, then narrow to 10 m, then move away when tributaries flow into it.  It winds and spills immediately into two areas - Vladimir and Moscow.  Depth also fluctuates: from 2 m at the junction of regions and up to 4 m after entering the Sister tributary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Like many rivers in the Vladimir region, Dubna is navigable, or rather, its part from the village of Berezhok to the mouth, which is 15 km.  It originates in this area, but ends the course 8 km from the Ivankovo ‚Äã‚Äãdam, in the Moscow region, at the confluence of the Volga. </p><p>  On this river are located: the city of Dubna, the villages of Berezino, Brykovy Gory, Ratkovo, the village of Verbilki and other small towns. </p><h2>  Tributaries of Dubna </h2><p>  The banks of the river are constantly changing their remoteness due to the presence of tributaries flowing into it.  Each time one of them flows into Dubna, it becomes deeper and wider.  Sometimes, at a distance of several kilometers, indicators can change.  For example, at the intersection with the Yaroslavl highway, the width is only 10 m, and when <span>the</span> Sulat <span>River</span> flows into <span>it, the</span> distance between the banks increases to 20 m, so that after some distance, near the village of Verbilki, it‚Äôs 30-40 m. </p><p>  If the Dubna River had no tributaries, it would most likely be shallow, not wide, and uninteresting for fishermen.  They feed it with their waters from the left bank: </p><ul><li>  The Kunya River, which is the longest in the Sergiev Posad region and "part-time" the left tributary of Dubna. </li><li>  Kubzha - a small river, has a total length of 14 km.  On its shore, there are such settlements as Karavaevka, Okoyemovo, Sudnikovo and Filippovskoe. </li><li>  The left tributary of Dubna - Vela - is well known to kayakers.  Its winding channel and fast current attracts both beginners and experienced athletes. </li><li>  Sister is another kayaking route.  With a length of 138 km and a flow so fast that sometimes the water ‚Äúboils‚Äù, it is a serious test for beginners. </li></ul>

The city of Dubna, in which it was built, was once part of the Rostov-Suzdal principality, which at that time belonged to the son of Prince of Kiev Yaroslav the Wise - Vsevolod Pereyaslavsky.  From the middle of the 13th century, the fortress passed from Tver to Moscow and back, until it acquired the status of oprichnina under Ivan the Terrible. </p><p>  Dubna acquired its title of city in the new history at the end of the 50s of the 20th century.  An urban settlement of Ivankovo ‚Äã‚Äãwas attached to it.  A strategic center for nuclear research appeared here, based on the basis of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Physics. </p>

    <p>  Since the time of Yaroslav the Wise, there are no antiquities left here, therefore the most recent sights were the Church of the Praise of the Mother of God, built in the Vyazemsky estate in 1827, and the church of the Smolensk Icon of the Mother of God, erected in 1891 in honor of the rescue of the inhabitants from cholera with the help of the saint icons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Today it is a small provincial town in which the leading scientists of nuclear physicists live and work. </p><h2>  Fishing in Dubna </h2><p>  Perhaps there are more fish rivers than this, well-known to fishermen of all stripes, but it becomes more and more difficult to find a free parking space on them every year.  Dubna (river) compares favorably with this, since the entire ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù holiday was concentrated on the <span>Ivankovo ‚Äã‚Äãreservoir,</span> 8 km from the place where it flows into the Volga.  At the disposal of fishermen and lovers of wild relaxation are cozy clean beaches surrounded by a pine forest near the estate of Ratmino. </p><p>  The same ‚Äúassortment‚Äù of fish is found in the river as in the Volga: catfish, bream, perch, roach, pike, dace, ide and chub.  These places were famous for a good catch back in the time of Peter the Great, and 50-60 years ago Dubna (river) was very stocked. </p>

    <p>  Due to the intervention of people in its course and the straightening of the channel to drain the Belsky swamp, located on the northern shore, the number of fish decreased.  Nevertheless, rarely does anyone leave without a catch.  The most fishy places are considered near the villages of Verbilki, Yudino and at the confluence of the Sisters and Dubna, near the village of Starikovo. </p><p>  Ice fishing is no less popular here, as ice grows from 50 cm to 80 cm by the end of winter. </p><h2>  Rafting on the Sestra River </h2><p>  Some kayakers prefer Dubna to its largest tributary - the Sestra River.  It is quite full-flowing, has several complex rifts, is winding and has a fast course.  It is especially suitable for practicing skills for beginners. </p><p>  If you go kayaking from the place where the river flows into <span>Lake Senezhskoye,</span> then in the area where it flows from it, there is a whole network of fishing ponds and Lake Endless, located in its floodplain.  It is small, but the depths are unprecedented, like beauty. </p><p>  All this distance the Sisters' water remains calm until the first riffles appear behind the Slobodsky bridge. </p>

    <p>  At the confluence <span>of the Yakhroma River, the</span> current increases significantly, and dangerous areas appear that do not allow kayaks to approach the opposite bank. </p><p>  Finishing the rafting is best after the confluence of the Sisters with the Dubna River in the Ratminskaya Spit, which is famous for its beauty, clean beaches and fishing. </p><h2>  Dubna Rafting </h2><p>  Rafting along the Dubna River is more suitable for beginners, as it is leisurely for most of its course, although it is very winding and often changes direction.  It does not have a level of complexity, so it is better to consider it as a way to relax on the water surrounded by beautiful nature. </p>

    <p>  The most picturesque places on Dubna are located at the confluence of the Veli River and to the village of Verbilki.  These lands are 80% covered with forests that are rich in raspberries, black currants, mushrooms and bird cherry.  There are convenient beaches for parking. </p><p>  A small disturbance of the water begins at the confluence of the Sisters and Dubna, after which it becomes truly full-flowing until it flows into the Volga. </p><h2>  Holiday house on Dubna </h2><p>  Tourists who prefer a comfortable rest on the water, are invited to the recreation center "Ratmino".  It is located 4 km from the city of Dubna in a very beautiful place surrounded by relict forest.  It offers 2 buildings with 160 beds with modern comfortable rooms. </p>

In the medical building, clients can undergo a course of electro- and phototherapy, heat and hydrotherapy, manual and mechanical massage. </p><h2>  Holidays in Dubna savage </h2><p>  If you choose a beach on the Dubna River for relaxing in a tent, then the place where it flows into the Volga will be the best option.  Everything here has to rest: both the sandy shores and the forest surrounding them, and some remoteness from settlements, which allows you to feel alone with nature, but if necessary, in which you can replenish your supplies or get medical help. </p>
