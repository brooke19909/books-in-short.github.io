The government develops and implements benefits and subsidies to support small and medium-sized businesses.  But any commercial activity requires investment of material resources.  For its expansion, it is most often necessary to purchase real estate.  Not always in the hands of the entrepreneur is such a large amount of money, and he is forced to apply for a loan in a banking institution.  In 2019, Sberbank offers several mortgage programs for businessmen at very attractive interest rates.  Let us consider in more detail all these proposals, find out how it is possible to get a loan, and what documents are needed for that. </p><div class="photo" data-original="360-solutions.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage for ip sberbank" class="if uuid-3177995" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3177995.jpg"></div><h2>  Mortgage for individual entrepreneurs in PJSC Sberbank </h2><p>  A bank can receive a mortgage both an individual and a legal entity, in particular, an individual entrepreneur.  In order to protect itself from an unreliable and insolvent client, Sberbank examines more carefully the application and documents from the entrepreneur, who, in turn, needs to prove his solvency.  Therefore, the list of documents for obtaining a mortgage for an individual entrepreneur at Sberbank necessarily includes documents to confirm the financial condition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First of all, you need to decide who the mortgage will be drawn up for: an individual or an individual entrepreneur.  The conditions and terms of issue will depend on this. </p><p>  Sberbank PJSC requires an individual entrepreneur to have a business life of six months and have a satisfactory credit history.  In some cases, the bank has the right to demand a guarantee from a family member of the entrepreneur or a third party. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage for mortgages in Sberbank conditions" class="if uuid-3177996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3177996.jpg"></div><h2>  Factors contributing to the approval of mortgages for entrepreneurs in Sberbank </h2><p>  These factors include: </p><ul><li>  If an entrepreneur works on a common taxation system, under such conditions the client is more attractive. </li><li>  There is a positive credit history in Sberbank, and information is taken into account not only on a mortgage loan, but also on any loans. </li><li>  The business of the potential borrower has no seasonal dependence. </li><li>  The company has been operating since registration for at least one year. </li><li>  Absolutely transparent income of the entrepreneur, confirmed by the relevant securities. <div class="photo" data-original="blog.outsource2india.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Mortgage Calculator" class="if uuid-3178000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3178000.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  From the above we can conclude: in order to approve a mortgage loan, an individual entrepreneur must confirm its financial stability for timely repayment of a mortgage debt and provide a full package of documents. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Conditions of mortgage programs for entrepreneurs </h2><p>  Sberbank offers its customers, individual entrepreneurs, the purchase of housing both for their own needs and for expanding the business.  But the mortgage conditions for private equity in Sberbank are a little tougher than for conventional mortgage programs.  Typically, the difference lies in the interest rate, which is 1-2% higher, as well as in the term of the loan, which is reduced to 15-20 years.  In some programs, the down payment amount is increased to 25%. </p><h2>  Residential Property Acquisition </h2><p>  Residential properties acquired under a mortgage loan include the following objects: a residential building, an apartment (both in a new building and in the secondary market), housing construction, suburban real estate, as well as a garage and a parking place. </p><p>  The general conditions of mortgage programs of Sberbank PJSC can be found in the table below: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Mortgage program </p></td><td><p>  Loan amount, rubles </p></td><td><p>  Date of issue </p></td><td><p>  An initial fee, % </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Housing under construction </p></td><td><p>  from 300,000 </p></td><td><p>  up to 30 years </p></td><td><p>  from 15 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Finished housing </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Support loan for families with children </p></td><td><p>  up to 8000.0 thousand </p></td><td><p>  up to 30 years </p></td><td><p>  from 20 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  To build a house </p></td><td><p>  from 300,000 </p></td><td><p>  from 25 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Out of credit secured by real estate </p></td><td><p>  from 500,000 to 10,000.0 thousand </p></td><td><p>  up to 20 years </p></td><td><p>  - </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Military mortgage </p></td><td><p>  up to 2,398 thousand </p></td><td><p>  paid by NIS personal account </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Garage or parking place </p></td><td><p>  individually determined </p></td><td><p>  up to 30 years </p></td><td><p>  from 25 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Refinancing </p></td><td><p>  from 300,000 to 7,000.0 thousand </p></td><td></td><td><p>  - </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  When applying for a mortgage loan at Sberbank, you can use social support measures, such as maternity capital or the Young Family program. </p><h2>  Commercial real estate purchase </h2><p>  Sberbank's commercial mortgage for private entrepreneurs is provided for the acquisition of non-residential buildings.

The loan amount may depend on the activities of the entrepreneur and the entity being located. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that mortgage rates for individuals in Sberbank start at 11% per annum, and for individuals they are lower.  The loan rate may increase by another 1% in the event of an entrepreneur’s refusal to insure his life for the period of execution of the mortgage transaction. </p><h2>  How to calculate repayment? </h2><p>  For a preliminary calculation of a mortgage loan, you can use the online calculator, with which you can get the following information: </p><ul><li>  what will be the sum of the total overpayment on the loan; </li><li>  what should be the minimum income level; </li><li>  what will be the size of the monthly payment. <div class="photo" data-original="premierprocessing.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage sberbank for ip rate" class="if uuid-3178001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3178001.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  To obtain such information, you must specify the amount, term, interest rate of the loan, date of issue of the loan and type of payment.
