    <h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  In Vincci el Mansour 4 * (Mahdia) more than 300 rooms.  And to start talking about the options available is a description of a single room.  The cost of living in it is about 52 euros per day.  Price may vary, depending on the season.  But this is not very much, given that the hotel serves all-inclusive guests. </p><p>  The apartments are decorated in a simple style without excess, but with marble flooring.  Inside there is a large bed, a safe, telephone, TV, good air conditioning and access to a private balcony.  There is also a work desk and a bathroom with a bath, shower, hairdryer, toilet, towels and free toiletries.  There is also a dressing room - everything you need for personal comfort.  By the way, all 1-bed standards are located on the ground floor, so they do not have balconies, but terraces. </p><h2>  Other apartments </h2><p>  Also in Vincci el Mansour Thalassa (ex. Riu 4 *) there are 2-bed rooms and bungalows.  These apartments are designed for two people.  In terms of conditions, everything is the same, only the price of a daily stay is about 75 euros.  But still, living together is more profitable than one. </p><p>  Apartment for three will cost 120 euros per day.  They are distinguished by a larger area and the presence of an extra bed.  The same can be said of family rooms for 2 adults and 2 children.  The price of daily living is 170 euros. </p><p>  By the way, there are also presidential suites, but, in fact, they differ from family ones only in name. </p><p>  The guests staying at Vincci el Mansour Thalassa 4 * assure that the rooms are good, well-groomed.  And what is especially surprising and unusual for hotel apartments is a separate bathroom.  The main thing is not to book connecting rooms if guests are not sent by the company (for which such an option is intended).  Because in this case you will have to suffer from good audibility.  Since, in fact, the connecting room is a single apartment, divided by an interior door into two rooms.  And if you want maximum silence, you need to reserve a room on the top floor and not overlooking the pool, since there are constantly entertaining noisy events. </p>

    <h2>  Important information </h2><p>  Tickets for the flight must be taken in such a way as to be at the hotel by 14:00.  Since it is precisely at this time that settlement begins.  However, in Vincci el Mansour <span>4 * (Tunisia, Mahdia)</span> , there are friendly staff.  If guests arrive earlier, they will be issued immediately, but only on condition that the room paid for by them is free.  And you will need to free the apartment before 12:30. </p><p>  Upon check-in, the guest will have to present not only an identity card, but also a credit card, the data of which he used when making the reservation.  The hotel accepts 6 different options.  These are ‚ÄúVisa‚Äù, ‚ÄúMaster Card‚Äù, ‚ÄúDiners Club‚Äù, JCB, ‚ÄúMaestro‚Äù and Discover.  It is important to use only your personal credit card.  Since the name indicated on the card must match the name in the ID. </p><p>  By the way, the hotel has no collateral.  There is a high level of trust in the guests.  So, for example, if you need a beach towel, then you do not need to leave a certain amount of dinar at the reception.  It is enough to write down the room number. </p><h2>  Guests on vacation </h2><p>  Most tourists had a pleasant experience with the Vincci el Mansour.  4 stars is really his level.  But the guests pay special attention not only to the service, food, and comfort of the rooms, but to the sea and the beach, to be more precise. </p><p>  It is incredibly clean here, even in the midst of the holiday season.  His condition is monitored by janitors, so it is very difficult to see the garbage here.  Tunisia cannot find such sand anywhere else: white, crumbly, as if semolina.  The sea is also clear, sometimes there are waves.  And a separate balm for the soul is that the beach is private, and only hotel guests can visit it. </p><p>  By the way, here you can not only swim and sunbathe, but also have fun.  Parasailing costs 50-60 dinars (about 1700 rubles).  You can still ride on the "bananas" or rent a jet ski. </p>

    <h2>  About staff </h2><p>  In Vincci el Mansour <span>4 * (Tunisia) an</span> excellent attitude to guests.  The staff is polite and welcoming.  In this case, no one begs for a tip - you can completely do without them.  Quality cleaning and daily, with the replacement of linen and towels.  People arriving late in the rooms are sure to have a surprise - a bottle of wine and a fruit basket.  Every day they give out one and a half liters of water with them. </p><p>  And the alcohol in the bars, by the way, is undiluted.  And his choice is diverse.  Bottles are often opened right in front of customers.  Bartenders know a lot of cocktail recipes, so you can feel free to ask them to cook something. </p><p>  By the way, the hotel has a Russian administrator who is always interested in visitors from Russia, whether everything suits them, if there are any complaints. </p><p>  Guests also talk about animators with pleasure.  The performances and shows are of high quality, bright and colorful, attract everyone to participate, but very unobtrusively.  In general, many people who have been here on vacation say that they even became friends with the animation staff, since they like to talk. </p><h2>  What else is worth knowing? </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the hotel is popular not only among lovers of beach holidays.  Many come here for the sights.  Well, tourists who have been here assure that it is better to book tours through the hotel operator, who is here every day.  There are very interesting and advantageous offers, for example, a 2-day sightseeing tour in the Sahara with an overnight stay in a 5-star complex.  Many people like sand dunes, the Eden Museum with a tasting of honey and palm juice, jeep and camel rides and much more.  In which case, the operator himself will tell everything and advise the most interesting options. </p><p>  It is also worth knowing that in Tunisia everything is bought for dinars.  This is logical, but many think that here, as in many other countries, you can pay the euro.  Currency can be exchanged at the hotel, the rate there is no less favorable than on the streets.  Just do not need to exchange large amounts at once.  Since back to dollars or euros, you can change everything only at the airport, where there is an unprofitable rate and huge lines. </p>

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  In general, the hotel receives only positive recommendations and reviews.  Which is not surprising, because everything is good in it, from helpful staff to food.  And the prices are quite affordable. </p><p>  It is best to come here in winter.  Firstly, the weather in the supposedly cold season is milder than in summer.  The sun is not scorching, water and air are quite warmed up.  Secondly, prices are half as much, including accommodation, since there are not so many tourists in Tunisia in the winter - after all, most have summer vacations.  And, by the way, for the same reason it is more spacious here both in a hotel and in a resort.  Lovers of silence are also advised to come in winter.  Since here at this time families with children who interfere with a peaceful rest do not rest. </p><p>  Inveterate travelers and amateurs will definitely like it here.  Numerous reviews are a direct confirmation of this.  As well as the fact that many people who have been here come back to rest again in the same place. </p>
