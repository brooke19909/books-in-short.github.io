Very close to us are the incredible beauty of the lake, the majestic gray mountains, stormy rivers and endless steppes.  You have no idea what we are talking about?  Of course, about Kazakhstan.  This country has the most powerful potential, which over time can take shape in the tourism industry, which has developed and brings significant revenue to the state budget.  But so far, tourism in Kazakhstan is in the initial stage of development, which, however, does not prevent our compatriots from coming to this wonderful and ancient land, which we will tell you about today. </p>

    <h2>  Why go to Kazakhstan? </h2><p>  But really, why?  After all, there are no modern resorts with hotels equipped with the latest technology, and attractions that are spread all over the world.  What can tourism offer in Kazakhstan to travelers from Russia and other countries?  Truly a lot. </p><p>  Kazakhstan is an amazing country located in Europe and Asia at the same time.  It is the ninth largest in the world and is one of the most unique states that can surprise with its traditions, ancient historical monuments and incredible natural beauties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another asset of Kazakhstan is its people.  Yes, yes, do not be surprised.  Wherever you come, you will be greeted with great hospitality and will show all local attractions with pleasure.  This is due to the upbringing that the inhabitants of this state receive from early childhood.  The fact is that, traditionally, Kazakhs are very welcoming people, ready with equal joy to receive a relative and a complete stranger in the house.  To many tourists who first arrived in Kazakhstan, it resembles an enchanted country from a children's fairy tale, where absolutely its laws of peace, kindness and cordiality reign, and nature helps people and guides them.  If you also want to feel this magic in your heart, then welcome to this amazing republic. </p><h2>  Kazakhstan: tourism statistics </h2><p>  Over the past five years, the country's leadership has been doing everything to develop the tourism industry.  The state has inexhaustible opportunities for international tourism in Kazakhstan to flourish and bring revenue to the country's budget.  This is facilitated by absolutely everything: the diversity of natural landscapes, the richest cultural heritage, historical monuments and the purest untouched corners of nature in which it appears in pristine beauty. </p><p>  Therefore, last year a little more than two billion rubles were allocated for the development of tourism in Kazakhstan.  This money goes to the construction of resort areas, infrastructure and the latest hotels that meet high European standards.  According to the government of the republic, every year the number of tourists choosing Kazakhstan as a place to spend their vacations increases by about fifteen percent.  And last year, this figure has already reached the level of five million people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Unfortunately, <span>domestic tourism</span> in Kazakhstan is developing at a slower pace than planned.  Kazakhs do not have high incomes to travel even within their own country.  This fact significantly reduces the dynamics of the industry.  Therefore, the main stake is placed on the development of tourism in Kazakhstan with the help of foreign citizens, and our compatriots are not the least in this category. </p>

    <h2>  Republic of Kazakhstan: tourism prospects </h2><p>  The prospects for tourism in Kazakhstan look pretty rosy.  Until 2020, it is planned to advance this industry into a priority area of ​​the country's economy.  To implement this plan, the positive experience of tourism development in Turkey, Egypt and Thailand is being studied.  On the example of these countries, one can see how positively the rapid development of this industry affects the entire sector of the economy. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Problems of tourism</span> in Kazakhstan </h2><p>  Despite the fact that tourism is the most dynamically developing industry in the country, there are a number of problems that have not yet been resolved.  We have identified the most basic of them: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Weak idea about such a tourism product as Kazakhstan.  All over the world very little is known about this state, even Russians are not very well aware of what you can get from a vacation in the vastness of this country.  Therefore, first of all, it is necessary to create a presentation that would make it possible to clearly declare itself on the market of tourism products. </li><li>  The development of tourism related industries.  It is known that tourism cannot be developed without raising other sectors of the economy to the proper level.  Tourists want to travel on good roads, live in modern hotels and eat in excellent restaurants with a wide range of dishes.  Unfortunately, in the near future, Kazakhstan will not be able to provide guests with the necessary level of comfort, since it is only at the initial stage of the formation of a competitive tourism industry. </li><li>  Contacts with foreign travel agencies.  The number of sold trips to the country directly depends on how much communication is established between travel agencies of different countries.  If the Russian tour operator does not promote the Kazakh product in its market, then, accordingly, our compatriots will not go to this country.  The same applies to other foreign powers. </li></ul><p>  Of course, this is not the whole list of problems in the industry of interest to us, but still we should not forget about the already voiced prospects for the development of tourism in Kazakhstan, which allow us to consider this country very attractive in the global tourism products market. </p>

    <h2>  Sights of Kazakhstan </h2><p>  There are many wonderful places in the country that are worth visiting during a visit to Kazakhstan.  It is quite difficult to single out the most important among them, but we nevertheless tried to create our own list of the most beautiful places of tourist value: </p><ul><li>  <span>Baikonur Cosmodrome.</span>  You can brag about the excursion to the cosmodrome upon arrival home, because not everyone is able to see this.  If you focus on the reviews of tourists, the spaceport leaves an unforgettable experience that is difficult to compare with anything. </li><li>  <span>Kaindy Lake.</span>  This tour is called a walk through a sunken forest.  Indeed, from under the water column several bare peaks of trees rise that froze over a hundred years ago.  This spectacle causes some kind of sacred awe and deep admiration for the beauty that has opened up to the look. </li><li>  West Bank of the Aral Sea.  Once the richest sea area now looks deserted and scary, the Aral Sea is slowly dying, like all life around it.  If you come here, you will get incredible sensations by observing this place, where once there were numerous military bases and fishing villages.  Many tourists believe that here you can make films about the Apocalypse. </li><li>  <span>Big Almaty Lake.</span>  This natural miracle belongs to the real property of the country and is one of the main strategic objects.  It is located high in the mountains and everyone who gets here remains forever subjugated by its turquoise waters, reflecting the incredibly clear sky pierced by mountain peaks. </li></ul><p>  One can talk endlessly about the sights of Kazakhstan, but it is better to see them with your own eyes. </p>
