    <p>  However, there should not be any special difficulties with this, since there is a whole arsenal of ways by which you can disable mobile access to the World Wide Web. </p><p>  It should also be noted that today many owners of MTS SIM cards simply do not realize the existence of unlimited tariffs for using the global network.  At the moment, an increasing number of mobile operators' subscribers choose free traffic, which is easily explained: as soon as a certain amount of money has been debited from your mobile account, you immediately begin to think about how to turn off the Internet on MTS.  Yes, mobile Internet is a convenient thing, but expensive.  Especially if you are in a roaming zone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, let's move on to the practical side of the question of how to turn off the Internet on MTS. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Ways to disable access to the World Wide Web </h2><p>  One of the most common ways is as follows: open the MTS official Internet resource, select the ‚ÄúHelp and Maintenance‚Äù section on its main page and click on it.  A <span>dialog box</span> will <span>open</span> and you will need to find the "Self-Service Services" menu, in which you will need the "Internet Assistant" tab. </p>

    <p>  In this case, you must tell the system the password for entry and your cell phone number.  Of course, many people know what a password is.  This is a certain combination of numbers and letters.  For the password to be identified by MTS specialists, it must be sent via SMS.  It should begin with the number 25, then you need to put a space, and then enter the password itself.  In the event that you enter the wrong password three times to enter the Internet Assistant menu, you will need to repeat the above operation. </p><h2></h2><h2>  At your service "Internet Assistant" </h2><p>  However, not everyone knows what the "Internet Assistant" is.  Meanwhile, it is a very convenient service that allows you to easily manage your mobile device, as well as the entire range of services provided by the mobile operator.  Using them, you can connect or disconnect, switch to another tariff, track your own cash balance, replenish it, and more.  It should be noted that the Internet Assistant service is also subject to activation and deactivation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, back to the question of how to disable <span>unlimited Internet on MTS.</span>  After you have entered the Internet Assistant, you just have to follow the instructions of the system. </p>
