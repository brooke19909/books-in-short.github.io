Japanese samurai: codex, weapons, customs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In modern popular culture, Japanese samurai are represented in the image of a medieval warrior by analogy with Western knights.  This is not a correct interpretation of the concept.  In fact, the samurai were primarily feudal lords who owned their own land and were a pillar of power.  This estate was one of the key in Japanese civilization of that time. </p><h2>  The origin of the estate </h2><p>  Around the XVIII century, those same warriors appeared, the successor of which is any samurai.  Japanese feudalism arose as a result of Taika reforms.  The emperors resorted to the help of the samurai in their struggle against the Ainu - the indigenous inhabitants of the archipelago.  With each new generation, these people, who regularly served the state, acquired new lands and money.  Clans and powerful dynasties that possessed significant resources were formed. </p><p>  Around the X-XII centuries.  In Japan, a process similar to the European one took place - the country was shaken by <span>internecine wars.</span>  The feudal lords fought against each other for land and wealth.  At the same time, imperial power was maintained, but it was extremely weakened and could not impede the civil confrontation.  It was then that the Japanese samurai received their code of rules - bushido. </p>

    <h2>  Shogunate </h2><p>  In 1192, a political system arose, which was later called the <span>shogunate.</span>  <span>It</span> was a complex and twofold system of governing the whole country, when both the emperor and the shogun ruled simultaneously - figuratively speaking, the main samurai.  Japanese feudalism was based on the traditions and power of influential clans.  If Europe overcame its internal strife in the Renaissance, then the distant and isolated island civilization lived for a long time according to medieval rules. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This was the period when the samurai was considered the most prestigious member of society.  The Japanese shogun was omnipotent due to the fact that at the end of the 12th century the emperor granted the bearer of this title the monopoly right to gather an army in the country.  That is, any other applicant or peasant uprising could not arrange a coup due to unequal power.  The shogunate lasted from 1192 to 1867. </p>

    <h2>  Feudal hierarchy </h2><p>  The samurai class has always been distinguished by a strict hierarchy.  At the very top of this staircase was a shogun.  Next came the daima.  These were the heads of the most important and powerful families in Japan.  If the shogun died without leaving an heir, then his successor was elected just from among the daimy. </p><p>  At the middle level were the feudal lords who possessed small estates.  Their approximate number fluctuated around several thousand people.  Next came the vassals of the vassals and ordinary soldiers without property. </p><p>  During its heyday, the samurai class accounted for about 10% of the total population of Japan.  Members of their families can be attributed to this same layer.  In fact, the power of the feudal lord depended on the size of his estate and income from him.  Often it was measured in rice - the main food of all Japanese civilization.  They also paid with warriors by literal rations.  For such a ‚Äútrade" even had its own system of measures and weights.  Koku equaled 160 kilograms of rice.  About this amount of food was enough to satisfy the needs of one person. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To understand the value of rice in <span>medieval Japan, it is</span> enough to give an example of a samurai salary.  So, those close to the shogun received from 500 to several thousand coca rice per year, depending on the size of their estates and the number of their own vassals, which also needed to be fed and maintained. </p>

    <h2>  Relations between Shogun and Daima </h2><p>  The hierarchical system of the samurai estate allowed feudal lords who served well to rise very high on the social ladder.  Periodically, they rebelled against the supreme power.  The shoguns tried to keep the daima and their vassals in check.  To do this, they resorted to the most original methods. </p><p>  For example, in Japan for a long time there was a tradition according to which daimy were to go to their master once a year for a reception.  Such events were accompanied by long trips across the country and high costs.  If daima was suspected of treason, the shogun could actually take his family member of his objectionable vassal hostage during such a visit. </p><h2>  Code Bushido </h2><p>  Along with the development of the shogunate, <span>the Bushido Code</span> appeared <span>,</span> sponsored by the best Japanese samurai.  This set of rules was formed under the influence of the ideas of Buddhism, Shintoism and Confucianism.  Most of these teachings came to Japan from the mainland, or rather, from China.  These ideas were popular with samurai - representatives of the country's main aristocratic clans. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Unlike Buddhism or the Confucius doctrine, Shintoism was an ancient pagan <span>religion of the Japanese.</span>  It was based on such norms as worship of nature, ancestors, the country and the emperor.  Shinto allowed the existence of magic and otherworldly spirits.  In bushido, from this religion, the cult of patriotism and faithful service to the state was first transferred. </p><p>  Thanks to Buddhism, the Japanese samurai code included ideas such as a special attitude to death and an indifferent view of life's problems.  Aristocrats often practiced Zen, believing in the rebirth of souls after death. </p>

    <h2>  Samurai philosophy </h2><p>  A Japanese samurai warrior was brought up by bushido.  He had to strictly comply with all the prescribed rules.  These standards applied to both public service and personal life. </p><p>  The popular comparison of knights and samurai is incorrect just from the point of view of comparing the European code of honor and the rules of bushido.  This is due to the fact that the behavioral foundations of the two civilizations were extremely different from each other due to isolation and development in completely dissimilar conditions and societies. </p><p>  For example, in Europe there was a well-established custom to give their word of honor when negotiating some kind of agreement between the feudal lords.  For a samurai, this would be an insult.  At the same time, from the point of view of the Japanese warrior, a surprise attack on the enemy was not a violation of the rules.  For the French knight, this would mean treachery of the enemy. </p><h2>  Military honor </h2><p>  In the Middle Ages, every resident of the country knew the names of Japanese samurai, since they were the state and military elite.  Few who wanted to join this estate could do this (either because of ingenuity, or because of inappropriate behavior).  The closedness of the samurai class consisted precisely in the fact that it was rarely allowed outsiders into it. </p><p>  Clanishness and exclusivity strongly influenced the standards of behavior of warriors.  For them, dignity was paramount.  If the samurai brought shame on himself with an unworthy act, he should have committed suicide.  This practice is called hara-kiri. </p><p>  Each samurai was responsible for his words.  The Japanese code of honor instructed to think several times before making any statement.  Warriors were required to be moderate in food and to avoid licentiousness.  A real samurai always remembered death and every day reminded himself that sooner or later his earthly path would end, so the only important thing was whether he could keep his own honor. </p>

    <h2>  Family attitude </h2><p>  Family worship in Japan also had a place to be.  So, for example, the samurai had to remember the rule of "branches and trunk."  According to customs, the family was compared to a tree.  Parents were a trunk, and children only branches. </p><p>  If a warrior disdainful or disrespectful to elders, he automatically became an outcast in society.  This rule was followed by all generations of aristocrats, including the latest samurai.  Japanese traditionalism has existed in the country for many centuries, and neither modernization nor a way out of isolation could break it. </p><h2>  Attitude to the state </h2><p>  Samurais were accustomed to the fact that their attitude to the state and the legitimate authorities should have been as humble as their own family.  For the warrior there were no interests higher than his master.  Japanese samurai weapons served the rulers to the very end, even when the number of their supporters became critically small. </p><p>  A loyal attitude toward the overlord often took the form of unusual traditions and habits.  So, samurai did not have the right to go to bed with their feet in the direction of the residence of their master.  Also, the warrior made sure not to aim his weapons at the side of his master. </p><p>  Characteristic of the behavior of the samurai was a contempt for death on the battlefield.  It is interesting that there are obligatory rites.  So, if a warrior realized that his battle was lost, and he was hopelessly surrounded, he had to give his own name and die calmly from the weapons of the enemy.  Mortally wounded samurai, before giving up the spirit, pronounced the names of senior Japanese samurai. </p>

    <h2>  Education and customs </h2><p>  The estate of feudal warriors was not only a militaristic layer of society.  Samurai were well educated, which was mandatory for their position.  All warriors studied humanities.  At first glance, they could not be useful on the battlefield.  But in reality, everything was exactly the opposite.  Japanese <span>samurai armor</span> could not protect its owner where literature saved him. </p><p>  For these warriors, a passion for poetry was the norm.  The great fighter Minamoto, who lived in the XI century, could spare the defeated enemy if he would read him a good poem.  One samurai wisdom said that weapons are the warrior‚Äôs right hand, while literature is the left. </p><p>  An important component of everyday life was the tea ceremony.  The custom of drinking a hot drink was spiritual in nature.  This ritual was adopted by Buddhist monks who thus collectively meditated.  Samurai even held tea drinking tournaments among themselves.  Each aristocrat was obliged to build a separate pavilion in his house for this important ceremony.  From feudal lords the habit of drinking tea passed into the peasant class. </p><h2>  Samurai Training </h2><p>  Samurai learned their craft from childhood.  It was vital for a warrior to master the technique of owning several types of weapons.  Fist fighting skill was also much appreciated.  Japanese samurai and ninjas had to be not only strong, but also extremely hardy.  Each student had to swim in a stormy river in full vestment. </p><p>  A real warrior could defeat the enemy not only with weapons.  He knew how to suppress an opponent morally.  This was done with the help of a special battle cry, from which it became uncomfortable with unprepared enemies. </p><h2>  Casual wardrobe </h2><p>  In the life of a samurai, almost everything was regulated - from relations with others to clothes.  She was also a social marker, according to which aristocrats distinguished themselves from peasants and ordinary citizens.  Only samurai could wear silk clothes.  In addition, their clothes had a special cut.  Mandatory was kimono and hakama.  Weapons were also considered part of the wardrobe.  The samurai constantly carried two swords with him.  They were plugged in a wide belt. </p><p>  Only aristocrats could wear such clothes.  Such wardrobe was forbidden to peasants.  This is also due to the fact that on each of his belongings the warrior had stripes showing his clan affiliation.  Such emblems had every samurai.  A Japanese translation of the motto could explain where it comes from and who it serves. </p><p>  Samurai could use any improvised item as a weapon.  Therefore, the wardrobe was selected for possible self-defense.  An excellent weapon was the samurai fan.  It differed from ordinary ones in that the basis of its construction was iron.  In the event of a sudden attack of enemies, even such an innocent thing could cost the lives of the attacking enemies. </p>

    <h2>  Armor </h2><p>  If ordinary silk clothes were intended for everyday wear, each samurai had a special wardrobe for combat.  Typical armor of medieval Japan included metal helmets and bibs.  The technology of their production originated in the heyday of the shogunate and has not changed much since then. </p><p>  Armor was worn on two occasions - before a battle or a gala event.  All the rest of the time they were stored in a specially designated place in the samurai's house.  If the soldiers went on a long campaign, then their vestments were carried in a wagon train.  As a rule, servants followed the armor. </p><p>  In medieval Europe, the main distinguishing element of equipment was the shield.  With his help, the knights showed their belonging to a particular feudal lord.  The samurai did not have shields.  For identification purposes, they used colored cords, banners, and helmets with engraved designs of emblems. </p>
