In addition to the fact that leading companies annually produce dozens of models, less well-known manufacturers are also trying to find their place in the sun.  The Oukitel U20 Plus model tried to break into the leaders.  She collected conflicting reviews, so it is worth attention. </p><h2>  About phone </h2><p>  Before us is one of the good models, which was unfairly thrown into a distant box.  It is clear that its unpopularity is directly related to the fact that inexperienced users do not trust unknown brands. </p><p>  But this behavior is completely unjustified, because each manufacturer was previously unknown, and then developed, gaining popularity.  Perhaps Oukitel is the future main competitor to "apple" gadgets or eminent "Koreans." </p><p>  Of course, to advise the user to look closely at unknown names is a thankless task.  A different approach is important here.  You need to carefully study the reviews and reviews of the owners.  Oukitel U20 Plus can be a great gadget for a picky buyer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oukitel u20 plus reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2020554.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The device entered the market at the end of last year.  You can immediately notice all the attempts to attract attention: copying famous designs, familiar details and popular ‚Äútricks‚Äù.  But the model can surely interest an inexperienced user who focuses on the multifunctionality and budget of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a result, we have a <span>good inexpensive phone</span> that received a 5.5-inch display and Sharp technology.  The screen works with a resolution of 1920 √ó 1080 pixels.  A good hardware, a popular fingerprint scanner and other surprises were placed inside it. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Of course, now no one is attracting the buyer with the box.  In addition, the phone is not the device that has ever done this.  Nevertheless, it is always nice to receive an acquisition in a quality ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù. </p><p>  Oukitel managed to do this.  They ship their device in a matte black box.  In front there is an image of the model in three colors.  On the side face is the model of the smartphone.  On the side there is also an indication of the main parameters, serial number and other information from the manufacturer. </p><p>  On the back of the package there are brief data on the characteristics of the model. </p><p>  The box has a familiar design - with a lid.  The phone was placed on a tablet, under which there is the rest of the equipment.  It is immediately worth noting that the device was packed securely and wrapped in a plastic bag.  This can significantly protect the transportation of the device. </p>

    <p>  If you get the phone out of the package, you can see on it a small gift from the manufacturer - a silicone case. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Under the tablet in the compartments is a charger, a USB cable.  There is an envelope with documentation and a paper clip to remove the SIM card tray. </p><p>  As a result, only good impressions and reviews were left from the configuration.  The Oukitel U20 Plus is securely packed.  All additional elements are made of quality materials, do not have pungent odors.  Silicone case is not cheap. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  In general, the design of the phone is typical.  It is impossible to say that he stands out with something special.  He collected a little bit from all the flagships: a rounded shape, beveled edges of the screen, a plastic case.  There is a dual camera at the back like an iPhone, on the cover there is a ‚Äúwindow‚Äù of a fingerprint scanner, like Xiaomi.  In front of the screen are touch-sensitive control keys, similar to those in the latest Lenovo models. </p><p>  So, in general, the brainchild of Oukitel looks like.  Despite the fact that most of the elements are taken from previously released flagship models, the device still looks good, stylish and expensive. </p><h2>  Essential elements </h2><p>  The front panel is a screen.  He got a diagonal of 5.5 inches and 2.5-D glass.  Above it was placed a front camera, a speaker, a notification indicator and sensors.  In general, nothing unusual. </p><p>  Three Oukitel U20 Plus control buttons were placed under the display.  Customer reviews were negative on their account.  Firstly, most models have long transferred these buttons to the screen itself.  Secondly, in this device the keys are not highlighted, although neatly displayed in front. </p><p>  You can immediately notice the transport film that protects the phone during the move.  If you remove it, we find another protective film.  It is a little short and does not overlap the entire display due to its curvature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The back cover is styled in metal.  Here the main character is a dual camera.  It is located in the upper left.  Next to her is a small LED flash.  In the middle of the top place is a fingerprint scanner.  It works well, without delay. </p><p>  Regarding the scanner, there are two points: its poor location and functionality.  Many users believe that transferring the sensor from the front mechanical button to the back cover is inconvenient, since then it is difficult to unlock the device if it is facing up.  Although, most likely, this is a matter of habit. </p><p>  Regarding functionality, on the contrary, I want to praise the Oukitel U20 Plus.  User reviews prove that the ability to assign several commands to the sensor is a huge plus. </p><h2>  Details </h2><p>  For some reason, the manufacturer decided to swap all the control elements.  Perhaps to show their originality.  In fact, they only caused a storm of indignation.  Everyone has long been accustomed to the fact that the left side is occupied by the SIM tray, and on the right are the volume and power buttons. </p><p>  In the Oukitel U20 Plus, the opposite is true.  But this is again a matter of habit.  You can complain about it for two or three days, a week, but after a month you will forget that it caused discomfort. </p><p>  Combined SIM card tray.  You can install two "SIM cards" or replace one of them with a memory card. </p>

    <p>  At the front end in the middle there is a connector for connecting the charger.  On the sides of it is perforation.  A microphone is hidden under one of them, and a main speaker under a second one.  The headset port has moved to the top. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Although the model is budget, it is clear that no one saved on the screen.  The smartphone Oukitel U20 Plus regarding the display received excellent reviews.  Firstly, it stands out for a successful screen size - 5.5 inches.  Secondly, he received an unusual HD-resolution for budget models, and works with 1920x1080 pixels (Full HD). </p><p>  Thirdly, the Japanese from the company Sharp, who are mainly engaged in the production of televisions, worked on the screen.  They created a good, bright, rich display without significant flaws. </p><p>  Before us is a multitouch that works with five simultaneous touches.  The sensitivity of the sensor is good, without braking and phantom clicks. </p><p>  If someone is not satisfied with the color calibration, it can be adjusted in the settings.  To do this, use proprietary software MiraVision. </p><h2>  "Iron" </h2><p>  Advanced users often pay attention to the technical component.  Of course, the appearance is great, but if we have in our hands a phone of unearthly beauty that cannot work without lags or errors, then why is it needed? </p><p>  Features Oukitel U20 Plus reviews received good.  Do not forget that we have a budget device.  It has the <span>MediaTek MT6737T</span> chipset on four cores with a frequency of 1.5 GHz.  The Mali-T720 Graphics Accelerator is a budget solution. </p>

    <p>  RAM is only 2 GB, some users may not have enough of this.  The internal is only 16 GB.  For those who do not need a second SIM card, it is better to get a "flash drive", since by 2017 this amount is already not enough for many. </p><p>  The specifications and reviews of the Oukitel U20 Plus let us know that in everyday tasks this model will work "with a bang."  It does not slow down, does not overheat and does not produce errors.  If you run resource-intensive software, then productivity will noticeably decrease.  Although no one canceled the game at the minimum or medium graphics settings. </p><h2>  Shell </h2><p>  Another reason for discussion is the software component.  Before us is a phone that works with the sixth version of Android.  The manufacturer from above uses the proprietary development of Bingo Launcher, which hardly anyone had heard of before. </p><p>  But in practice, the shell is not bad.  She has many features, interface add-ons.  But at the same time, it does not clog the system itself with unnecessary software.  There are all the necessary options.  You can get to any menu along the already familiar path. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Well, one cannot but mention the dual camera, because such a decision by the manufacturer is quite intriguing.  Before us are two modules.  One of them is a sensor from Sony IMX13 with a resolution of 13 megapixels.  Experienced users know that this module has long been on the market and has already managed to visit more obsolete models.  Aperture is its f / 2.0. </p><p>  The second sensor is only 0.3 megapixels.  The main task of this module is to blur, or rather, create the perfect bokeh. </p>

    <p>  To make it work, you need to take a picture in SLR mode.  After we focus on the desired object, adjusting the slider, adjust the blurred background.  This technology is used by most budget options that want to attract the camera with a double peephole, but cannot spend much on a high-quality lens. </p><p>  This technology does not work as we would like.  You need to try to make everything look as beautiful as, for example, in the iPhone 7 Plus. </p><p>  The front camera is ordinary, as in all modern devices.  Oukitel U20 Plus received good reviews on her account.  She takes pictures in a resolution of 5 megapixels, has a selfie add-in. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Here's a budget, but solid turned out a new device.  Despite the fact that for many of us there is a completely unknown manufacturer, the impressions after the review and reviews remain good. </p><p>  Owners note a successful appearance.  Before us is a thin, plastic, rounded body.  He got all the modern "chips" that are needed for those who are looking for a fashionable, but cheap device. </p><p>  The best indicator of this model was its price.  For only 6-7 thousand rubles, you get a complete set of modern functions.  Reviews about Oukitel U20 Plus are not only positive, there are also disadvantages. </p><p>  Among the advantages highlighted low cost, extended delivery, available fingerprint sensor, ‚Äúflexible‚Äù interface settings.  It is also important to say that the budget device was equipped with a 3300 mAh battery.  This should be enough for everyday use: a day and a half, the phone will definitely hold on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oukitel u20 plus specifications and reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2020552.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Also, many liked the fact that the case can be disassembled on its own.  All the details are not screwed tightly, which means that if some problems happen, and you have at least the slightest idea how to fix them, then you can do it yourself. </p><p>  Among the cons, a bad camera stands out clearly.  Clear business that she could not be magnificent for such cost.  Perhaps it was worth making it with one module, but better. </p>
