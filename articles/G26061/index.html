All of us are ever tired, and our body requires relaxation in order to accumulate new forces and energy necessary for life.  Each person arranges his leisure in his own way and every time he tries to do it in a special way.  Someone is interested in reading fiction, while someone is not averse to spending a couple of hours playing their favorite computer game.  Among these recreational facilities, one cannot fail to mention one more thing - a TV.  Indeed, this household appliance has always been the culprit of meeting friends, having a good family time out, or, finally, comfortable watching programs alone.  The above-mentioned qualities of the TV have not lost their relevance in today's days against the backdrop of the rapid development of computer technology and the Internet.  This is due to the fact that the technology of its manufacture has also stepped forward.  Now these devices are made with a large and flat display that transmits high-definition images, equipped with special software, able to connect to Wi-Fi and do much more.  Especially thanks to the new screens, these devices are becoming very attractive to customers.  We‚Äôll talk about one of them today.  This will be the LG 43uh603v TV. </p>

    <p>  Over time, engineers achieved better and better results, and these days have achieved incredible successes - so incredible that not all manufactured video materials can reveal the inherent potential of modern image transmission technologies.  Now we mean <span>4K resolution,</span> which means that the display matrix has a horizontal of approximately 4000 pixels.  Due to their such a large number of images, the image is very high quality, any of its roughness can only be seen under a microscope.  However, this is achieved only if the picture itself is in such a resolution.  Otherwise, you will get standard SD, HD or Full HD.  The TV under consideration has support for such (4K) technology, which distinguishes it from many modern models of these devices. </p><h2>  TV LG 43uh603v.  What does this name mean? </h2><p>  Almost all manufacturers of electronics call it somehow, hiding information in the corresponding letters and numbers.  Often such a set of characters is not clear to the buyer, so we should understand the decoding of the name "LG 43uh603v". </p>

Built-in applications allow you to easily control viewing, switch channels, and visit the Internet, for example, the well-known YouTube service. </p>

    <ol><li>  The type of TV is LCD, which means ‚Äúliquid crystal‚Äù.  This refers to the manufacturing technology of the screen itself.  The liquid crystal allows you to make the device flat with reduced power consumption and less harmful to the eyes. </li><li>  The diagonal is 42 inches or 109 cm. This parameter indicates the large <span>size of the TV,</span> so the viewer gets more pleasure when watching.  It is necessary to remember the minimum distance to the screen, which should be at least two meters, in order to maintain normal vision. </li><li>  Screen resolution - 3840x2160.  This data exactly corresponds to the 4K option, since it is in its presence that the display has more than 2,000 horizontal lines. </li><li>  Backlight - Direct LED.  It is an additional LEDs built into the screen and evenly distributed over its entire area, due to which an image of maximum brightness is achieved (very useful in daylight). </li><li>  Matrix - TFT IPS.  Today it is the highest quality matrix that allows you to save the image without distortion at any viewing angle. </li><li>  Acoustic system - two speakers with stereo sound and surround sound. </li><li>  Signal reception - DVB-T, DVB-T2, DVB-C, DVB-S2.  Simply put, the TV supports all modern digital signals, as well as those signals that are already outdated. </li><li>  Internet connection - Ethernet (RJ-45) and Wi-Fi.  All Smart TVs are capable of accessing the Internet, and our device is no exception.  The TV can be connected to the network via cable and wirelessly. </li><li>  Synchronization with other devices - DLNA.  This technology allows the device to communicate with extraneous electronic devices.  Thanks to this function, you can directly visit special TV folders from your TV directly from the TV screen with media files prepared, for example, on a computer or smartphone. </li><li>  Additional options.  These include a sleep timer, child protection, the presence of HDMI, USB, WiDi, Miracast, a headphone jack and the ability to mount the device on the wall. </li></ol><h2>  Reviews on the LG 43uh603v </h2><p>  In text form, this is difficult and almost impossible.  The <span>characteristics of the</span> LG 43uh603v ZE <span>TV</span> were discussed above.  The review of this appart is best viewed in the form of a video (note that some of them may carry the name "ze" at the end of theirs, which indicates a modification of the model).  On the Internet you can find a large number of creative works of technology reviewers on this topic. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  Like any other electronics, the <span>LG 43uh603v TV</span> also has advantages and disadvantages <span>.</span>  Owner <span>reviews</span> allow you to make a complete list of its pros and cons.  The first category includes the following provisions: </p><ol><li>  Image quality.  All buyers were satisfied with the bright, colorful and juicy picture transmitted by the display.  Here we can conclude that the device copes with its main task. </li><li>  Sound quality.  Completed with the latest speakers, high-quality 3D sound - all this has our LG 43uh603v 4K UHD TV.  User reviews tell us that not only the visual, but also the sound picture brings pleasure. </li><li>  The ability to access the Internet.  Right on the TV screen, you can surf the Internet, watch movies and TV shows online, visit your favorite video services.  Obviously, users cannot but like it. </li></ol><p>  There were practically no shortcomings, so the following list will be limited to two points: </p><ol><li>  USB port  Often you can hear complaints that it is the only one and is located behind, which makes access to it uncomfortable.  However, this is most likely a whim of buyers, rather than a flaw. </li><li>  The need for updates and settings.  It is so arranged that a new electronic device with existing software requires downloading its new versions on the Internet, as well as spending time setting parameters to your taste.  Unfortunately, there is no escape from this and therefore at first you have to tinker a bit, which is reflected in negative comments. </li></ol><h2>  LG 43uh603v.  Customer Reviews on 43 108 cm LED TV </h2><p>  On the day of 2017, this TV model is relatively young, since it was created in 2016. Therefore, not many people managed to express their opinion, however, among them, a sufficient number are gathered to be able to formulate an objective comment about customer ratings.  In general, user reviews about 43,108 cm LED TVs are very positive and the average score of 5 is about 4 rating units, with more than 50% of buyers setting a solid "five", 20% pointed to the "four" and "unit", the rest considered necessary to put the "triples" and "deuces".  This difficult situation should be sorted out. </p><h2>  What pleases users? </h2><p>  High image and sound quality are the main strengths of the LG 43uh603v LED TV.  Reviews on this subject literally overwhelm all the comments and make up 50% of the positive answers. </p><h2>  What disappoints users? </h2><p>  Now is the time to touch on the interesting 20% ‚Äã‚Äãof people who rated four.  Mostly those who were dissatisfied with 4K technology.  This is simply unbelievable, but sometimes a large resolution makes itself felt in a negative sense.  Firstly, as already mentioned, not all video content can have it, therefore, users have a mismatch between expectation and reality.  Thinking that now there will be an incredibly high-quality image, the viewer sees the usual quality simply because the broadcast video does not have 4K.  Secondly, this technology is quite new, therefore, it is very likely that in some cases it may fail.  Not particularly understanding what is happening, the viewer on the basis of such events speaks out negatively, which reduces the exposed score on a 4K ULTRA HD TV LG 43uh603v.  Feedback from users who rated ‚Äúthree‚Äù and ‚Äútwo‚Äù also indicates an incomplete understanding of 4K technology only in a more radical sense.  Comments with "unit" contain information about problems with the WebOS operating system and the operation of the TV itself.  As a rule, these are cases of factory defects or technical software errors. </p><h2>  Price category </h2><p>  When it comes to technically equipped and modern things, the question of price is always relevant.  It should be noted right away that high-quality televisions with a diagonal of 109 cm cost from 25 thousand rubles, and since our device has 4K and other additional options, the price tag goes over the line of 30,000 and amounts to approximately 32,500 Russian currencies.  This price is quite adequate for such a device with advanced quality today. </p><h2>  LG 43uh603v TV competitors </h2><p>  Alternative options on the home appliance market of this class can be offered to everyone by the well-known company SUMSUNG.  It produces truly competitive products, also made with the latest technology and incorporating the paths of modern technological progress.  Since SUMSUNG is a company that is constantly developing something new at a professional level, the prices of its TVs will be higher. </p><h2>  Whose product to choose? </h2><p>  If you want to save several thousand rubles, then, obviously, LG becomes the choice.  If you want to purchase a very high-quality device, you should contact SUMSUNG.  However, do not forget that in the first case, the user still gets quality with the newest options to date, embodied in the LG 43uh603v TV.  Customer reviews, prices - this first of all becomes the main argument in the acquisition of the device.  The rest depends on the personal preferences of the buyer and his attitude to manufacturing companies. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Thus, the TV is still one of the best ways to have a good time, relax and get the necessary information.  Scientific and technical thought allowed us to advance these devices to a new level of quality and capabilities.  One such example was the LG 43uh603v. </p>
