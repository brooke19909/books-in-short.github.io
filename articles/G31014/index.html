    <p>  One of the most interesting non-standard functions of the screens of home meteorological systems can be called the ability of some of them to turn into an electronic photo frame. </p><h2>  General principles for choosing home equipment </h2><p>  When deciding to equip your home, as well as office or warehouse space with a meteorological system, you should carefully consider the existing options and models offered on the market, and clearly define the list of tasks that the acquired weather station will solve.  How to choose a worthy device: first of all, you should pay attention to the technical characteristics, reliability and quality of the system, and only then to the decorative design and entertaining additions. </p><h2>  Things to consider when choosing a weather station </h2><p>  As a guideline for comparing different models and facilitating decision making, you can use this list of parameters: </p><ul><li>  Screen.  Its size and shape matter.  If you plan to place the display on a table or bedside table, a small screen will be enough.  However, for fixing on the wall you need a larger monitor, because stashes should be visible from a distance of several meters. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather station for home" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1080214.jpg" width="300"></div></li><li>  Number and range of sensors.  The most common models include 3-5 sensors that operate at a distance of 30 to 100 meters.  The characteristics usually indicate the maximum range of these elements under ideal conditions.  When installing, consider the number and thickness of walls, as well as other obstacles. </li><li>  The quality of the sensors.  Here you need to carefully study the information about the case material, tightness, water resistance and acceptable operating conditions of the devices.  Manufacturers always indicate the temperature range in which the home weather station with a wireless sensor will work without interruption. </li><li>  Type of autonomous food.  Among the existing options, the most practical are solar panels or another type of self-charging device, since in this case the owner is freed from the need to monitor and regularly replace batteries. </li><li>  Existence of protection against insects and animals.  This measure is relevant for residents of suburbs and rural areas. </li></ul><h2>  Rules for installing weather systems </h2><p>  To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the indicators of the home station, you should be responsible for its installation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="digital wireless weather stations" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1080217.jpg" width="405"></div>  There are several basic rules that are relevant for most models:

    <ul><li>  Sensors for measuring wind parameters should be located on the roof of the building. </li><li>  <span>Temperature sensors</span> must be protected from the effects of distorting factors: direct sunlight, heating systems, heated asphalt. </li><li>  It is necessary to take into account the role of walls and ceilings that impede the passage of the signal from the sensors to the device. </li><li>  The best option for the location of sensors on the territory of a private house can be considered the construction of special high supports for them. </li></ul><p>  With a rational approach to the selection, purchase and installation, a wireless home weather station will be an excellent assistant for every member of the family.  The combination of its many functions and stylish design can significantly increase the comfort level of any home or apartment. </p>
