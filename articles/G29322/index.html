The legendary Nokia returns to the mobile device market.  At the moment, the company is preparing the release of an ultramodern smartphone for Android with a dual camera from Carl Zeiss.  In the meantime, the manufacturer has released a number of very interesting devices of a lower level.  One of them is the Nokia 216 Dual Sim mobile phone.  Reviews about this device have both positive and negative sides.  What can be said about this gadget?  We will talk about this a bit later.  In the meantime, recall the basic information about Nokia. </p><h2>  A little bit about the company.  The origins </h2><p>  Strictly speaking, Nokia was founded back in 1865.  But then she was engaged in the production of paper and cardboard.  A little later, the manufacturer mastered the production of a variety of rubber products and some simple electronics.  But the company's work in the direction of high technology began only in the 80s of the last century.  Then Nokia decided to start producing computers.  But something went wrong with them, and the production (along with patents) was sold to the Japanese giant Fujitsu.  After that, the company came to grips with mobile devices.  And then their business went.  Proof of this is the many very popular phones from Nokia.  But Nokia 216 Dual Sim, reviews of which we will analyze a little later, is the brightest representative of quality products of the Finnish manufacturer. </p>

    <h2>  Continued development </h2><p>  I must say that the release of Nokia 216 Dual Sim, the feedback from many users about which are favored, marks a return to the glorious tradition of Nokia.  The fame of her phones boomed around the world.  And now the legendary manufacturer decided to return and surprise everyone again.  And this despite the fact that now it is very difficult to surprise someone with something.  But Nokia will succeed, because this company has behind it - solid experience in the manufacture of mobile devices and more than a century-long history of existence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design and appearance </h2><p>  Nokia 216 Dual Sim, the design reviews of which do not sparkle with positive comments, is strikingly unlike modern "shovel-like" smartphones.  This is a regular mobile phone, made in monoblock form factor and having a very modest dimensions.  On the front side there is a small LCD display, and below it is a physical (push-button) keyboard, which occupies the lion's share of free space.  Above the screen is a speaker for conversations and a front camera.  The case is made of plastic, it feels not very expensive.  But the budget device should be like that.  Moreover, the price of the 216th model is extremely moderate. </p>

    <p>  What has always struck Nokia phones is its amazing reliability and survivability.  It seemed that these devices can hammer nails.  And the 216th is molded from exactly the same test.  The case is tough and reliable.  All items fit tightly.  Nothing creaks anywhere.  In general, build quality is at the highest level.  At "Nokia" has always been so.  Judging by this model, we can safely say that the company decided to return in the form that was remembered by most users.  And <span>‚Äúunkillable‚Äù phones</span> are one of the pillars of this image. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A little more about design </h2><p>  On the back of the phone is the main camera, flash and music speaker.  The panel is removable.  Unusual speaker layout.  It is located directly under the camera.  Although in such devices it is usually located below.  But this is the "trick" Nokia 216 Dual Sim Blue.  Reviews from the owners of the device describe this feature negatively.  We will come back to this.  When using the device leaves only positive emotions.  He does not slip out of his hands and fits perfectly in any palm.  Phones from Nokia have always been famous for their ergonomics.  And this gadget is no exception. </p>

    <p>  A serious oversight was made in the design of the 216th model phones.  It concerns the color of the koprpus.  Along with the classic black and white devices, there is also a blue model.  This step of the manufacturers is not very clear, because, judging by the feedback from users, this color of the gadget for the most part does not attract them.  Moreover, many speak of this tone negatively.  It is hoped that the company's designers will heed the opinion of the fans and will not experiment with the colors anymore. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the technical specifications of the Nokia 216 Dual Sim Black.  User reviews say that the device copes with its direct responsibilities: calls and SMS.  You can‚Äôt count on more.  This is not a smartphone.  However, the phone has a 2.4-inch color LCD screen with a resolution of 320 by 240 pixels.  Also in the device there is a main camera of 0.3 megapixels.  Naturally, you cannot get satisfactory photos with such a camera.  Interestingly, the front camera has the same 0.3 megapixels.  And why was the main thing to do with similar characteristics? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Among other technical features, it is worth noting the presence of FM-radio.  This is a standard option in devices of this kind.  Also, the phone has many pre-installed applications that are completely unnecessary.  And there is no way to remove them.  And this can already be attributed to disadvantages, because the gadget already has a disastrously small amount of internal memory (16 megabytes).  This is a feature of Nokia and its S30 platform, which is already hopelessly outdated. </p><h2>  A little more about technical specifications </h2><p>  So, we continue to consider the mobile phone Nokia 216 Dual Sim.  Reviews of its technical characteristics and performance make it clear that we have an apparatus exclusively for work, although it has support for web interfaces, it is impossible to use all the delights of the modern Internet without 3G technology.  And from this a perfectly logical question arises as to the advisability of having a front camera.  Why is it needed, even if ‚ÄúSkype‚Äù cannot be installed on the device?  The device is also equipped with a Bluetooth version 3.0 transmitter and a slot for a Micro SD memory card.  The device supports flash drives up to 32 gigabytes.  Now the battery.  It has a capacity of 1020 mAh.  For such a phone, this is enough. </p>

    <p>  Some believe that the battery in the device is frankly weak.  Of course, he can not be compared with the Xeniums from Philips, but still the 216th is able to hold a charge in standby mode for as long as 576 hours.  And this is a lot.  The Nokia 216 Dual Sim Black phone, whose autonomy reviews do not shine with flattering epithets, nevertheless, copes well with this task.  No smartphone can compare with it in autonomy.  But the performance of smartphones is better. </p><p>  The Bluetooth transmitter has an interesting Slam option.  Its essence is that photos and music are transferred between two devices with such an option almost lightning fast.  And this is currently very important, because the speed of Bluetooth 3.0 is poor.  Exotic things like Wi-Fi and LTE are out of the question.  They are not here. </p><h2>  Positive phone performance reviews </h2><p>  Everything is not so simple here.  The fact is that the target audience of this device is people who value high-quality communication and nothing more.  That is, a discussion of performance boils down to how well the gadget copes with its direct responsibilities.  And here at Nokia everything is fine.  All owners note that the phone perfectly catches the network, even where many "smart" smartphones sit in a puddle.  Many users also liked the voice quality of the Nokia 216 Dual Sim.  Feedback on these features is extremely positive.  Powerful antennas, high-quality speakers and microphones, all this is part of the corporate identity of Nokia.  And the manufacturer, apparently, is not going to retreat from these canons.  What an honor and praise to him. </p>

    <h2>  Negative phone performance reviews </h2><p>  However, at the same time, the device does not cope well with such simple things as a "native" camera application or audio player.  This is affected by the lack of power and the outdated S30 mobile platform.  However, these options do not apply to the direct responsibilities of the device.  But there are those to whom such shortcomings spoil the overall impression of the device.  Also, many do not understand the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãinstalling a front camera in such a cheap and impractical device.  And here they are right.  Without this little chip, the phone would have cost less.  But the company decided to make just such a model Nokia 216 Dual Sim.  User reviews, however, suggest that the Finns made a mistake.  But this mistake is excusable.  Many modern manufacturers supply their gadgets with completely useless options.  This greatly affects the final cost of the product.  It‚Äôs good that Nokia hasn‚Äôt gotten sick yet. </p>

    <h2>  Positive feedback on design and appearance </h2><p>  The Nokia 216 Dual Sim phone is black, reviews about which are slightly better than about models of a different color, designed for unassuming people who do not care about design.  But there are "gourmets" who are looking for something unique in a regular "dialer".  And, oddly enough, they find.  So, many owners of this unit note a unique ergonomics.  All controls are positioned so that they can be used with maximum comfort.  By the way, the black model of the device received more positive comments than its color counterparts.  It is understandable.  A black phone looks more solid and stricter.  In addition, less dirty.  For Nokia it would be better to release a model in a red or yellow case.  Demand for it would be much higher than for blue. </p><h2>  Negative design and appearance reviews </h2><p>  There were those whom the design of the phone did not suit at all.  The phone is unlikely to suit the sophisticated user.  Also, many owners complain about a very inconvenient navigation joystick.  He works very badly.  And for people with thumbs, managing a phone is generally very difficult.  The location of other controls is also not pleasant to some owners.  However, what is required of the budget "dialer"?  The emphasis was not on design, but on reliability and quality of communication.  But different body colors - this is a good idea, but clumsily implemented.  Could be limited to classic colors.  Only one way out - do not buy a phone in a performance that was not to your liking. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined the mobile phone Nokia 216 Dual Sim.  Customer reviews about this device are very different.  However, everyone agrees that the device copes with its direct responsibilities (calls, SMS, communication) perfectly.  And this is his main merit.  For ridiculous money, the user receives a high-quality phone with a stable connection.  Even if the device is accidentally broken, there will be nothing wrong.  You can simply go and buy exactly the same. </p>
