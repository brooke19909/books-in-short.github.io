    <h2>  Confrontation between the fleets of the two powers </h2><p>  By the spring of 1714, Russia had taken possession of the entire south of Finland and a significant part of its central territory.  But land conquest alone was not enough.  To reach the <span>Baltic Sea</span> , victory was necessary over the Swedish fleet, which freely controlled its water area.  It was this task that was set by Peter I before the command of the Russian squadron. </p><p>  In June, there was a need to strengthen the forces of the garrison, guarding the port of Abu captured by Russian troops, which was an important strategic object.  For this purpose, a flotilla of ninety-nine rowing ships under the command of F.M. Apraksin was sent to the shores of Gangut.  It consisted of sixty-seven galleys and thirty-two scampaways (small vessels for transporting troops).  The Swedes were waiting for the appearance of Russian ships in this area, and they were intercepted by their entire navy, led by Vice Admiral Gustav Watrang, an experienced naval commander who studied military affairs to the finer points. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Gangut battle - duel of rowing and sailing fleet </h2><p>  Unlike the Russian rowing flotilla, the Swedes were armed mainly with <span>sailing vessels,</span> which created significant advantages, but at the same time made them dependent on weather conditions.  Among the ships of the enemy were three frigates, fifteen <span>battleships,</span> two bombardier galliots and nine large galleys.  Thus, on the side of the Swedes there was a clear superiority of forces, which made F.M. Apraksin retreat to Tverminna Bay and spend almost a month under the cover of its islands. </p><p>  Having received news of a trap in which the Russian flotilla fell, Peter I rushed to their aid.  The squadron headed by him left Revel and approached Gangut on July 20.  Wanting to remain incognito, the emperor hid his real name under the pseudonym of Peter Mikhailov.  Here, in the face of the enemy, he showed himself to be an outstanding naval commander.  The Gangut sea battle became a triumph of the Russian fleet thanks to the daring and original plan drawn up by him. </p>

    <h2>  The tactical move of Peter I </h2><p>  Using the geographical features of the peninsula, Peter I managed to tactically outplay the Swedish vice admiral.  He initiated the construction in its narrowest part, opposite the harbor, in which the Apraksin flotilla, the so-called reloading, was locked.  It was a two-kilometer long log floor stretching from one coast to another and allowing it to drag blocked ships on the other side of the peninsula into Rilax Fjord Bay.  The implementation of such a plan would free the flotilla from the blockade. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Having received this information from the scouts, Gustav Watrang immediately divided his forces into two parts and sent a naval flotilla commanded by Rear Admiral N. Erensheld to the Rilax Fjord.  His task included the destruction by fire of his artillery of the Russian flotilla during its passage through the isthmus.  The second group of ships, commanded by Vice Admiral Lille, was, according to his plan, to attack the main forces of the Russians.  This decision was quite logical, but nevertheless contained a mistake that became fatal for the Swedish fleet. </p>

    <h2>  Breakthrough of the Russian squadron </h2><p>  This division of enemy forces took advantage of the Russian emperor.  The weather on that day - August 6 - was calm, and the calm, as you know, deprives sailing vessels of their main advantage - maneuverability.  Thanks to this gift of fate, the squadron of Russian ships commanded by M. Kh. Zmaevich started a breakthrough and circled the Swedish ships on oars, standing with powerlessly hanging sails.  The Swedes could only look in a dumb rage at the elusive enemy, since the considerable distance between them and the Russian ships did not allow the use of artillery. </p><p>  Following the first detachment, the second, consisting of 15 ships, broke through.  Having completed this maneuver, Zmayevich‚Äôs detachment rounded the peninsula and, to the complete surprise of the Swedes, surrounded their ships, awaiting the land crossing of the Russian flotilla.  Then Watrang clearly panicked.  He very recklessly recalled a detachment of ships blocking the Apraksin flotilla, which was still located in Tverminna Bay.  Thus, he opened the coastal channel and gave the blocked ships the opportunity, combined with the main forces of the rowing fleet, to break through to the vanguard of the fleet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How the battle of Gangut unfolded </h2><p>  <span>The history of naval art</span> will forever retain in its annals the evidence of outstanding tactical skill and personal courage of Russian sailors.  From the documents of those years it is known that during the day the ships that were part of the Ehrensheld detachment and grouped off the northern coast of the peninsula were attacked by the vanguard of the Russian fleet. </p><p>  The Swedish vice admiral built them with a concave line, the edges of which reached the islands.  This gave them certain advantages for using artillery and helped repel the first two attacks.  But the third was fatal for them.  It was undertaken against the flanks and thus did not allow the enemy to take full advantage of the advantages of his artillery. </p>

    <h2>  The last boarding battle that won </h2><p>  A curious fact: the Gangut battle of Peter 1 was the last, the outcome of which was determined by boarding.  It is known that on that day the Russian emperor himself rushed to boarding, and, climbing a rope aboard an enemy ship, was an example of courage and heroism.  Soon, all the enemy ships were captured, and those members of their crews who were fortunate enough to stay alive were taken prisoner. </p><p>  The Gangut Sea battle (1714) ended with the capture of the flagship Swedish ship Elephant.  In addition to him, another ten ships under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrensheld became the trophies of the Russians.  Some of their ships still managed to break out and go to the √Öland Islands.  Ehrensheld himself was captured.  Although on this day happiness turned away from the old sea wolf, he did not stain himself with shame and, having been wounded seven times, surrendered to the Russian sailors, only obeying inevitability. </p><h2>  The factors that served the Russian victory </h2><p>  Modern researchers call the main factors that formed the victorious history of the Battle of Gangut.  Briefly, they can be described as a savvy shown by the command of the Russian flotilla, brilliant tactical thinking, which made it possible to take advantage of the light rowing fleet over the sailing one - more powerful, but less mobile, and the personal outstanding naval qualities of Emperor Peter the Great. </p><p>  Until now, researchers have no consensus on the number of attacks undertaken by Russian sailors against the Swedish fleet.  The version presented above is based on the testimony of the historians of the vanquished side, and raises some doubts.  There is reason to believe that in reality there was only one attack, and the other two were invented by the Swedes who wanted to somehow support the shaken prestige of their fleet and show that the Russian victory had come at a high price. </p>

    <h2>  The meaning of victory at Gangut </h2><p>  Thus, on that day, the formation of the Russian fleet, which was still being formed, won his first naval battle.  Under Gangut, Russia proved to be an emerging new powerful sea power.  This significantly increased its prestige among other European states and allowed it to conduct equal negotiations with the monarchs of the leading countries of the world.  In addition, the Gangut naval battle won in 1714 significantly influenced the general course of the Northern War. </p><p>  Thanks to this victory, Russian land forces were able to operate freely on the coast of the Gulf of Finland and Bothnia.  Although Sweden was still seven years away from the complete defeat, after <span>the Battle of Poltava the</span> Gangut Sea Battle - the first major victory at sea - showed the whole world the irreversibility of the process of becoming Russia as one of the legislators of world politics. </p><h2>  Triumph of the winners </h2><p>  In September 1714, the winners returned to St. Petersburg.  Here they were met by crowds of enthusiastic citizens and marched solemnly under the arches of the specially erected Arc de Triomphe.  She was crowned with an image of a Russian eagle sitting astride an elephant.  Elephant - this is how the name of the Swedish flagship Elephant is translated.  The allegory completed the ironic inscription: "The Russian eagle does not catch flies." </p><p>  For the Gangutsk Sea Battle, Peter I was awarded the title of Vice Admiral, which was well deserved, given his leading role in commanding the fleet and the ability to make competent decisions in difficult tactical conditions.  Many other participants in this battle received awards. </p>

    <p>  Immediately upon the return of the crews to the capital, a thousand sailor medals ‚ÄúFor Victory at the Gangut‚Äù were minted, but, according to contemporaries, they were not enough to award all those who distinguished themselves in battle, and in the next two years this number was tripled.  Special awards were issued for officers.  Russia honored the heroes, thanks to whom the Gangut battle was won.  No wonder the naval power of the state has always been considered the most important component of its defenses. </p><h2>  Captured ships </h2><p>  The captured ships of the Swedes were delivered to St. Petersburg.  They were placed for general viewing along the Kronverksky Canal, which separates the Peter and Paul Fortress from the north from that part of the coast where the Artillery Museum is located today.  Among them was the famous flagship "Elephant". </p><p>  Peter I treasured them very much as a memory of a glorious victory, and ordered not to continue to use them for military operations, but, having repaired them, dragged them ashore and made of them something like a memorial.  And so they did.  Once a formidable warship stood on the shore until 1737, until, finally decayed, it was not pulled for firewood. </p><h2>  Church - Sailors Glory Memorial </h2><p>  The Gangut sea battle claimed the lives of many Russian, but even more Swedish sailors.  Among them, 361 people are considered dead and 350 were injured.  Among Russian sailors, 124 people died and 342 were injured by the death of the brave.  In honor of their victory on the day when the Orthodox Church commemorates St. Panteleimon, a church was built in St. Petersburg.  Commemorative marble plaques were strengthened on its facade, indicating sea and land formations that took part in the battle. </p><p>  Church in the period 1735-1739  It was rebuilt under the guidance of the famous Russian architect I.K. Korobov and came to us in an updated form.  Many people are familiar with this building, located in the city center on the corner of Pestel Street and Salt Lane.  Thus, the Gangut battle, the first naval victory of Russia, was immortalized by an architectural monument. </p>

    <h2>  Sea battles for Grengam and Hankey defense </h2><p>  The same church serves as a monument to another glorious victory of the Russian fleet, won in 1720 in a battle with Swedish ships over the island of Grengam.  Gangut also witnessed the heroism of the Russians during the years of World War II.  By that time it was called the Hank Peninsula.  His defense, which began in the first days after the German attack on our country and lasted 164 days, has gone down in history forever.  They are reminded of <span>a plaque</span> located opposite the church of St. Panteleimon, on the opposite side of Pestel Street. </p>
