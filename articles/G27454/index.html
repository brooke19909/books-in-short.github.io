The substance was not just a bully, but also terribly voracious, easily changing its own state, passing from liquid to harder.  The ghost touched the audience so much that many manufacturers launched a kind of prototype in the form of a slim toy. </p><p>  Creative parents of many tomboys figured out how to make a slime from water and <span>shampoo at home,</span> thereby simplifying the process of buying new toys.  Home prototypes are easily customized to fit your child‚Äôs favorite color, size and even structure. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a lizuna from water and shampoo" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/969470.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  From shampoo </h2><p>  How to make a slime from water and shampoo without PVA glue at home?  Now we will tell.  But first prepare some components.  It: </p><ul><li>  100 ml of shampoo available at home; </li><li>  high-quality polymer (mostly fresh) glue type "Titan" - 100 ml; </li><li>  2-4 g of dye (different colors can be chosen); </li><li>  plastic thick container (plate or pike with a thick bottom); </li><li>  stick for stirring. </li></ul><h2>  Manufacture </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to pour the prepared shampoo into the container, then pour the selected dye into its center (so that the lysun is pleased with its color and texture, it is better to pour at least 5-6 g per 100 ml of base).  If the toy is for girls - together with the dye in shampoo, you can add glitter, a small scattering of beads or sparkle.  Next, you need to slowly mix until the mass is completely homogeneous, scrupulous mixing will give the best result. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to make a lizun from water and shampoo without PVA glue, few know.  But slime on polymer glue has the ability to bribe a child.  Which ones?  Pleasant ductility, peculiar stickiness and suppleness.  Many kids are better off playing with polymer glue toys.  After all, PVA does not give the slime correctly stretch.  The prepared <span>polymer glue</span> must be poured into the color base <span>.</span>  Then immediately begin to interfere well.  The base must become homogeneous over the entire surface of the mass. </p>

    <p>  Many are advised not to use glue exactly according to the recipe.  After all, the density and texture of the shampoo may require more thickener.  Therefore, mixing the base, it is worthwhile to carefully monitor the fluidity and, as soon as doubts arise, add glue in small parts.  To store the finished toy is in a closed jar or plastic container, as the access of air or moisture can lead to stratification of the mass. </p><h2>  How else to make a slime without PVA glue? </h2><p>  Most masters try to avoid using it.  Indeed, in recent years, the quality of the adhesive does not just want the best, but does not even satisfy the usual function of gluing sheets.  Now consider another method of manufacturing a stringy toy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  200 ml of tepid (tinted with <span>food coloring)</span> water; </li><li>  200 mg of fresh starch. </li></ul><p>  This method of creating a slime is approved by many mothers, because there are no chemical components in the composition, which means that there is no negative effect on the baby's body.  Due to the simplicity and accessibility of all components, you can not worry about the loss or drying of the toy.  After all, you can safely create it daily. </p>

    <p>  The first step is to tint the used water.  The dye can be selected as standard for the cartoon green, or you can decide on a brighter and more juicy shades.  After that, it is worth launching the starch in colored portions in small portions (having poured out all the dry part at once, you may not achieve mass uniformity).  Ready-made starch slime is elastic and supple, but it does not differ in jumping ability, so little children most often indulge in such toys, older teenagers want to rush in color slim. </p><h2>  Another option </h2><p>  And how to make a slime of water and shampoo at home?  Now consider another manufacturing option.  To prepare a slime you will need: </p><ul><li>  a quarter cup of high-quality uniform PVA glue (do not use a composition that is overwhelmed or separated); </li><li>  a third of a glass of starch diluted in warm water (it should also be taken fresh); </li><li>  dye - the usual green, food additives, gouache; </li><li>  inexpensive transparent bag for easy mixing. </li></ul>

    <p>  Many start the process with a glue base, but it is better to mix starch water and dye first.  How to do it?  In the package it is worth pouring a solution of starch and water and pour in the prepared dye there (you can also use sparkles or decorative crumbs).  Shake the whole mixture several times to make the liquid homogeneous and colored (unbroken lumps of the dye can interfere with the texture of the toy).  The last thing to add to the package is PVA (you can pre-mix it to be sure of its quality).  Having mixed the whole composition several times, the package should be sent to the refrigerator for 4 hours, after which you can safely play with the lizun. </p><h2>  No dyes </h2><p>  There is also a way <span>to make a slime</span> from water and shampoo without dye.  Such a toy is interesting in that it can be hidden anywhere, as well as to observe the ongoing processes inside the lump itself.  To prepare a colorless composition, you must: </p><ul><li>  300 g of "Titan" glue (or other polymer) - you can stock them in large construction stores; </li><li>  200 ml of colorless, but not cold shampoo (a similar base may not give the necessary uniformity). </li></ul><p>  You can mix the simplest components in a convenient plastic bowl, the slower the mixing, the more effective the composition.  Playing with such a colorless slime is pleasant for young children, especially those who have a reaction to dyes. </p><h2>  Without glue "Titan" </h2>

    <p>  And how to make a slime from water and shampoo without <span>glue "Titan"?</span>  Now we will tell.  After all, often these kinds of adhesives are not at home and you need to go to the nearest store for them.  To prepare a lizun without a "Titan" you will need: </p><ul><li>  ¬Ω teaspoon borax <span>(sodium tetraborate)</span> ; </li><li>  100 ml of colorless glue; </li><li>  2 cups of warm (40-50 ¬∫) water; </li><li>  two durable plastic containers (it is better to take with measured indicators); </li><li>  dye. </li></ul><p>  After rinsing the containers, you can begin the process of creating a slime.  The first step is to pour a glass of water into one and put a borax in it.  To make the mixture as homogeneous as possible, it must be mixed.  In the second container, it is necessary to mix 100-120 ml of tepid water and 30-40 g of transparent glue, the dye should be poured in small parts, monitoring the color saturation. </p><p>  Next, it is worth connecting the liquids - it is best to do this by pouring water with a borax into the second mixture, so the mixing process will be more effective.  That's all, the toy for the child is ready. </p><h2>  From soda </h2><p>  Now you know how to make a slime from water and shampoo.  But you can make a similar toy from soda.  How exactly?  We will tell you now.  To prepare you will need: </p><ul><li>  50 ml of a safe detergent; </li><li>  a teaspoon of ordinary soda; </li><li>  half a glass of warm water; </li><li>  any natural dye - 5-6 g. </li></ul>

    <p>  First of all, it is better to pour detergent into the dish - it will become a convenient basis for the future composition.  Next is the turn of water and the dye itself.  The composition must be mixed.  And only then add soda.  After thoroughly mixing it must be set aside for several hours and only then start the game. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear how to make a slime from water and shampoo and other components.  So, you can please your baby with handmade toys. </p>
