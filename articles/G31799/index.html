Insurance is a way of reimbursing losses incurred at the <span>expense of the insurance</span> company on the basis of an insurance contract with prescribed risks.  An insurance contract is an agreement between the insurer (insurance organization) and the policyholder (individual or legal entity), on the basis of which the policyholder is obliged to pay certain insurance premiums, and the insurer takes on compensation for damage in the event of an insured event. </p><p>  Types of insurance: compulsory and voluntary;  property, personal and <span>civil liability.</span>  Moreover, each type has certain subspecies, for example, property insurance is divided into insurance of property interests of legal entities (organizations) and individuals (specific citizens).  Having examined the basics of <span>insurance business,</span> i.e.  Having examined the basic concept and types of insurance, let us dwell in more detail on what personal insurance and its types are. </p><p>  Personal or life insurance is aimed at protecting <span>individuals</span> in the event of insurance events.  The main risks, the occurrence of which is undesirable for a particular insured, but it is quite possible, are: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - disability (partial or total), </p><p>  - temporary disability </p><p>  - death. </p><p>  As a rule, the policyholder acts as the beneficiary under such an agreement, only in case of death should another person be appointed as the beneficiary.  In the event that the beneficiary is not specified in the contract, then upon the occurrence of the risk of death, cash compensation shall be received by the heirs under the law. </p><p>  Personal insurance and its types in different insurance organizations has its own characteristics and differences.  The main types, however, include: </p><p>  - insurance from NS, </p><p>  - insurance for those who travel abroad, </p><p>  - DSG - long-term life insurance, </p><p>  - insurance for the purpose of accumulation </p><p>  -        and many others. </p><p>  Let us consider in more detail the types of insurance in tourism. </p><p>  The various types of insurance in tourism are caused by the fact that a person traveling to another country may be faced with various circumstances, and they, in turn, are associated with increased danger, since the person is in unfamiliar surroundings and in a strange environment.  Therefore, such insurance is designed to maximally protect citizens traveling abroad from the widest range of dangers.  Different insurance companies offer different types of insurance.  Therefore, it is important for everyone traveling out of their country to study all possible sources of risk in the area where he goes, and on the basis of the received factors, choose insurance coverage for himself. </p><p>  The classification of travel insurance includes insurance: </p><p>  1. The tourist himself and his property. </p><p>  2. Risks of travel agencies. </p><p>  3. Personal travel insurance. </p><p>  4. Foreign tourists. </p><p>  5. GO car owners. </p><p>  6. NS with coverage of medical expenses for treatment and medicines. </p><p>  At the same time, insurance is allocated: </p><p>  - Mandatory - GO car owners and transport trips. </p><p>  - Voluntary - all other species. </p><p>  At the time of concluding such a travel insurance contract, not only specific personal insurance and its types are determined, but also the amount for which the person is insured is selected depending on the country of destination, and then classified in accordance with the mandatory minimum coverage. </p>
