    <h3>  <strong>Requirements</strong> </h3><p>  An <span>older person's</span> telephone must meet certain requirements.  Among them are: </p><ul><li>  large screen with large text; </li><li>  simplicity and understandability of the interface; </li><li>  big buttons. </li></ul><p>  Another condition is the maximum battery life.  For example, grandfather or grandmother decided to go to friends, and the charger was forgotten at home.  If their mobile phone can be without charging for a long time, then there will be no problems.  And you‚Äôll have to come back, which is not very convenient. </p><h3>  <strong>Model Overview</strong> </h3><p>  As part of this review, we consider the following models: </p><ul><li>  Just5 CP10; </li><li>  myPhone 1082; </li><li>  Fly Ezzy4. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Choose a phone for an elderly person" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/304485.jpg" width="280"></div></li></ul><p>  Each of them is positioned by the manufacturer as a "telephone for an elderly person."  Looking at their appearance, we can agree with this statement.  Large buttons, large text on the screen - all this is in these models.  They will cope with receiving and sending SMS, as well as with calls without problems.  Their menu is simple and intuitive, so that parity is also maintained here.  But their screens are different.  Two of them are colored (these are Fly Ezzy4 and myPhone 1082), one of them is monochrome (Just5 CP10).  It is better to distinguish the characters on the display of the second type, so the last of them gets a certain advantage.  Next, pay attention to the battery.  On Fly Ezzy4 and Just5 CP10 it is 1000 mAh, while on myPhone 1082 it is 200 mAh less.  All this allows them to work on average 5 hours, 8 hours and 5 hours, respectively, without recharging.  As you can see, here CP10 compares favorably with competitors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among the additional equipment, it is worth highlighting the presence of a slot for memory cards at Fly and myPhone, as well as a camera at the first.  Not entirely justified solution (camera), in any case for our country - it is unlikely that most of the elderly people will be able to use it.  They are also equipped with an FM receiver, and Fly also has an MP3 player.  It is difficult to attribute them to advantages or disadvantages.  How often and whether our pensioners will be able to use these functions at all is a big question that is difficult to give a definite answer. </p>

    <h3>  <strong>The choice</strong> </h3><p>  Comparing specifications, you can <span>choose a phone</span> for an elderly person who is best suited for these purposes.  In ergonomics and design, all models are similar, and there is no clear leader.  But the screen is best for Just5 CP10.  It is monochrome and on it information will be best seen in any weather conditions. </p><p>  The situation is similar with the battery.  In terms of volume, it is the same as that of Ezzy4, but a more modest display will allow it to do twice as long without recharging.  Therefore, Just5 CP10 is the best phone among older models among older people.  Its price is slightly higher than that of competitors, but its advantages more than compensate for it.  So you can safely buy this device - it will not disappoint you.  This is the perfect gift for grandparents. </p><h3>  <strong>Summary</strong> </h3><p>  Phone for an elderly person <strong> </strong>  should be simple and reliable.  At the same time, it can have a minimal set of functions and have a long battery life.  These requirements are best met by Just5 CP10.  It is recommended to buy it. </p>
