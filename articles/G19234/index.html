    <p>  Some travelers call the resort of Salou typical of this coast, but there are a few points for which tourists love it: </p><ul><li>  A wide selection of housing - from expensive apartments and cottages to budget hotels, for example Belvedere 3 * in Costa Daurada, Spain. </li><li>  Located 92 km from Barcelona and only 10 km from Tarragona, you can see the maximum number of attractions in the area. </li><li>  A lot of amusement parks with attractions, discos and nightclubs attract young people, and lovers of peace and relaxation with a glass of Spanish wine by the pool get family-friendly hotels such as Belvedere 3 *. </li><li>  Salou, Costa Daurada, Spain - these are magnificent beaches with golden sand and a shallow dive into the arms of the gentle, incredibly clean Mediterranean Sea. </li><li>  Numerous convenience stores solve all the problems with the purchase of necessary foods and drinks.

    <p>  The guests are greeted with a smile by the friendly workers at the reception, and it is immediately noticeable how glad you are here, which can not be said about all three-star hotels.  Wi-Fi is available throughout, and a meeting room awaits business travelers.  Belvedere "3 stars" (Salou, Spain) is considered a family hotel.  There is a playground here, but nothing attracts the kids like the Spanish ‚ÄúDisneyland‚Äù Port Aventura, located just a 10-12 minute walk. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Ohtels Belvedere (Spain, Salou) is located on the third line from the sea, but this does not detract from its merits.  In fact, the path to the coast lies through the city and takes only 7 minutes, if not to be distracted by numerous temptations.  Sand on the shore due to the large interspersed quartz has a golden color, it is very small and therefore pleasant when walking barefoot.  The bottom of the Mediterranean Sea awaits the same vacationers.  The gradual diving and the absolute transparency of the water make the <span>beaches of Salou</span> an ideal place for children and those who cannot swim. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tourists in their reviews note the following pleasant aspects of local beaches: </p><ul><li>  At the bottom there are no algae, or any other plants that would be tangled underfoot. </li><li>  Since the beaches of Salou are municipal, the entrance to them is free. </li><li>  Cleaning is carried out daily. </li><li>  If you wish, you can change the beach every day, choosing the one where there are fewer people. </li><li>  The coast is fully adapted for a long stay there.  There are showers and toilets, and numerous bars and cafes will brighten up the monotonous lying on a deck chair and will not let you get hungry or thirsty. </li></ul>

    <p>  Relaxing at the Belvedere 3 * hotel, you should be prepared for the fact that sun loungers and umbrellas by the pool are free, and you have to pay for them on the coast. </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  Given the budget category of the Belvedere 3 * hotel (Salou, Costa Dorada, Spain), the prices for accommodation in it are quite affordable.  Customer reviews note the small size of the rooms, but the excellent cleanliness, excellent furniture and the presence of such pleasant things as: </p><ul><li>  daily cleaning; </li><li>  a towel thrown on the floor is a sign of the maid that it needs to be changed; </li><li>  TV; </li><li>  safe (secured, 4 ‚Ç¨ per day); </li><li>  large beds; </li><li>  bathroom / toilet with necessary hygiene products that change every other day; </li><li>  air conditioning; </li><li>  Balcony or terrace with pool or city views. </li></ul><p>  The category of rooms at the Belvedere 3 * hotel (Salou, Costa Dorada, Spain) is a standard for double, triple and quadruple with the possibility of sharing a child or adult.  Accommodation will cost in the amount of 7,000 rubles per day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Food lovers from around the world know that Catalonia is their paradise.  Indeed, like <span>Spanish cuisine,</span> Catalan is quite famous, but you will only have to go after it to Salou.  Although there are so few stars at the Belvedere 3 * hotel (Costa Daurada), vacationers' reviews say that they feed here no worse than in five-star apartments.  If you check the ratings made by hotel guests, they are equal to 9/10 for food, which indicates not only the quality of the food, but also its diversity.  This is extremely important, because, living in one place for a week or two and eating the same dishes, a person is unlikely to want to repeat such a vacation. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has a restaurant where guests can enjoy Mediterranean and international buffet meals.  In addition to ready-made dishes, they practice cooking them in the presence of customers, which always causes great interest - who does not want to see how the chef "conjures" in the kitchen?  There is also a piano bar, snack bar and poolside cafe.  Resting in Salou at the Belvedere hotel, one should take into account the local ‚Äúwhim": for breakfast all drinks (coffee, juices and even champagne) are free, and for lunch and dinner you will have to pay even for ordinary water. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The tourism business requires the constant introduction of any innovations in the field of entertainment and the quality of services, since beautiful nature and antiquities alone are not enough for modern people.  Sometimes it seems what to expect from a three-star hotel?  And in it, with surprise, pleasant trifles are discovered that brighten up leisure time.  This happens, according to tourist reviews, in Belvedere 3 * (Salou, Costa Dorada, Spain).  Here constantly guests are pleased with something: </p><ul><li>  garden in a small area; </li><li>  a variety of delicious dishes in the restaurant; </li><li>  packed lunches with love when there is no time for breakfast at the hotel; </li><li>  club and playroom for children; </li><li>  TV room in the common lounge in the lobby; </li><li>  children's menu and chairs in the restaurant; </li><li>  animation and more. </li></ul>

    <p>  Since this hotel belongs to the family category, the most frequent guests are couples with children and elderly people from all over Europe.  Here, within walking distance from all entertainment and shopping centers, there is an oasis of peace and prosperity at an affordable price. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Athletes and just those who can‚Äôt sit still will also find something to their liking.  In the pool, sports competitions and games are held, and to keep the body in good shape, you can do water aerobics every morning.  Here you are attracted by the sea, waiting for yachts and motor boats, making walks along the coast.  Catamarans and "bananas" complement the ride on the waves with the breeze. </p><p>  One of the most popular types of recreation in Salou is cycling in the surroundings, which is why Belvedere can rent this transport and spend free time on the beach traveling along the coast and out of town.  There are a lot of greenery and flowers, so the trip will take place in very picturesque places. </p><h2>  Wellness rest </h2><p>  During the velvet season "Belvedere 3 *" in Salou is more reminiscent of an elite holiday home for the elderly, as its guests write in their reviews, than a hotel in the center of the famous resort.  This is due to the fact that at this time in Ohtels Belvedere (Salou, Spain) the prices for all services, including wellness, are the lowest.  Customers expect: </p><ul><li>  hot tub; </li><li>  Solarium, which helps to prepare for sunbathing and even out the tan; </li><li>  fitness center for training; </li><li>  Sauna and Turkish bath. </li></ul>

    <p>  As an additional paid service, the hotel has a massage room where, for a small fee, a wellness or relaxing massage is performed.  The sun terrace is suitable for those who do not like noisy beaches and the scorching sun. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Pastime directly in Belvedere can be divided into two types: </p><ol><li>  Sports, which include billiards (for a fee) and table tennis. </li><li>  Entertainment, including animation and evening shows. </li></ol><p>  For many travelers, the Internet has become a familiar companion, and the hotel thanks to WI-Fi throughout its territory, you can not lose touch with friends and relatives who have remained at home.  But if you believe the reviews of tourists, the main life is beyond its gates. </p><h2>  Attractions near the hotel </h2><p>  No wonder Salou became a famous resort back in the 70s of the last century.  Its location in the immediate vicinity of the cities of Reus (15 km) and Tarragona (20 km) with their attractions and 92 km from Barcelona expands the horizon of research and study of the culture and life of the Catalans.  The most visited place in Salou is the Port Aventura theme park.  It is on the 6th place in popularity among the theme parks in Europe, and there really is something to see here. </p><p>  The park is conditionally divided into several zones: </p><ul><li>  Mexico; </li><li>  China; </li><li>  Mediterranean </li><li>  Polynesia; </li><li>  Wild West; </li><li>  Sesame Street. </li></ul>

    <p>  It is fortunate that the Belvedere 3 * hotel is located just seven hundred meters from it.  Here you can visit a saloon surrounded by cowboys or ride on a dizzying carousel, taste exotic salads from Polynesian cuisine or ‚Äúburn yourself‚Äù with Mexican snacks.

Singing fountains, cafes and small restaurants with live music, the sound of the surf and numerous shops with all sorts of things will make the path along it pleasant and not so long. </p><h2>  Inexpensive and high quality </h2><p>  It is worth believing the reviews of tourists vacationing in Belvedere 3 * in Salou.
