    <p>  People come to rest in Anapa for different purposes: someone wants to have fun, the attractive price that is offered in this resort town for living is important for others, many travelers come on their own and rent housing from the local population on the principle of ‚Äúthe main thing is the sea‚Äù. </p><p>  Hotel "Atelika Dolphin" has a low rating, if we talk about the quality of the services provided.  Since its very concept is to provide a range of services at the lowest price.  Nevertheless, the goal is achieved, and a large number of vacationers in Anapa finds their own accommodation option here and does not pay attention to the low budget of the Atelika Dolphin Hotel.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  visitors talk about the availability of recreation.  Many people do not like the low level of noise isolation, which interferes with rest, the low level of service, the dampness in the rooms and the poor condition of the plumbing. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the Russian tourism industry in the public sector is a resource that is in demand, but is extremely expensive for owners.  Rather, this tourism sector needs government participation, and a longer period will be needed to solve these problems. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the very possibility of a cheap vacation in a children's resort town is already a great achievement.  When planning a low-budget vacation, you should think about how and for what purpose cost savings are necessary.  In this case, the rest will not be spoiled, nature is not "low budget" for the health of children. </p>
