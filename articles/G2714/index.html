Unawatuna (Sri Lanka) on the map</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For many years, the resort of Unawatuna (Sri Lanka) has caused great interest among tourists.  This is a very beautiful place and a calm beach resort, which is located 5 km from the city of Galle.  The country's authorities are making great efforts to restore the resort to its former reputation, which suffered greatly after the powerful 2004 tsunami.  The entire tourist infrastructure - hotels, shops, restaurants - was pretty quickly rebuilt.  Now Unawatuna is quite ready to receive guests at the highest level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unawatuta sri lanka" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/383565.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  General characteristics of the resort </h2><p>  From Halle, this paradise can be reached by the coastal southern road in 10 minutes.  If you look at Unawatuna (Sri Lanka) on the map, you can see that it is 76 miles from the capital of Colombo.  The main advantages of this village are its magnificent beaches, an abundance of fruit trees and palm groves. </p><h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  On both sides of the reef strip, the ocean and the local lagoon are separated, so there are rarely large waves in this place, which makes swimming quite safe.  At the same time, a strong current will not allow you to calmly swim far from the coast on a mattress.  You can safely come to the resort with children, as there are shallow areas on the beach that are protected by reefs even from small waves.  The depth in such places is also small - about 1.5 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sri lanka unawatuta hotels" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/383557.jpg?1398634590494" width="600"></div>
