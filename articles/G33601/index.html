    <h2>  From the history of the resort </h2><p>  People inhabited the lands on which Gelendzhik is located a very long time ago.  Already in the 3rd millennium BC, ancient tribes settled here.  Over a long history, the peoples inhabiting this area have changed - there was a Greek colony, later - Byzantine cities. </p><p>  In the 15th century, the territory became part of the Ottoman Empire.  According to the Andrianopol Peace Treaty in 1829, the Black Sea coast became part of the Russian Empire. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  This is a rather rare union of the marine climate with the mountain.  There are many sunny days in Gelendzhik, and, which is especially pleasant, most of them fall in the summer season.  Autumn cooling begins only in mid-October.  Often, the velvet season lasts until mid-January.  At the end of January and February there are minor frosts.  But much more often, winter in these places is the rainy season.  The peculiarity of the weather in winter is the cold northeast wind. </p><p>  In summer, Gelendzhik is dry and hot, humidity is low, coastal winds refresh the air well, so the heat is easily tolerated even by children. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to see? </h2><p>  What can I see in Gelendzhik?

Magnificent pines and deciduous trees save from heat. </p><h2>  Gelendzhik: dolmens </h2><p>  Experts and ordinary tourists have been talking about this city landmark for many decades.  Gelendzhik dolmens, whose age is about five thousand years, are still a mystery.  There is not a single plausible version that would explain their origin.  There are many assumptions, among which there is even a version that this is the creation of aliens. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This is one of the attractions for which it is worth coming to Gelendzhik.

The residents of Gelendzhik assure that many tourists come to these places in order to get a charge of positive energy. </p><h2>  Safari Park </h2><p>  Every year, thousands of tourists come to <span>rest in Gelendzhik.</span>  What to see, where to go in this city?  We suggest you go to the famous Safari Park.  It covers an area of ​​160 hectares. </p><p>  The territory of the reserve is covered with deciduous and coniferous forests.  In its southern part is a zoo.  Animals live here in spacious enclosures, so they are quite comfortable.  There are more than fifty species.  Guests can admire and explore the habits of tigers and lions, Himalayan and brown bears, lynxes, raccoons and other animals. </p><p>  This park can be called a rehabilitation center for animals - some of them are brought by hunters, someone gets here after their owners refuse them.  Many animals fall in very serious condition.  We must pay tribute to the specialists of Safari Park - people who are not indifferent and very loving animals who do everything to cure their most hopeless "patients". </p><p>  Come to Gelendzhik.

Nearby is a sanatorium of the same name.  In the bay is the Institute of Oceanology of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  P.P. Shirshova.

In the bay, 260 days a year are sunny. </p><h2>  What to see in the vicinity of Gelendzhik </h2><p>  It is a very bright and friendly city.  All coming here are always captivated by the hospitality of local residents.  I would like to advise tourists who are coming to Gelendzhik for the first time that it is necessary to see the natural monuments that are unique in this region. </p><h2>  Rock "Sail" and other natural monuments </h2><p>  The rock is located near the village of Paraskeevka, 17 km from Gelendzhik.  It is a flat stone stratum 25 meters high and more than twenty meters wide.  Moreover, its width is only one meter.  The shape of a rock resembles a sail. </p><p>  Another natural monument located in the vicinity of Gelendzhik is a huge territory (950 ha) planted with <span>Pitsunda pine.</span>  This tree is under threat of destruction and is listed in the Red Book of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  There are many waterfalls in the vicinity of Gelendzhik.  Tourists are very fond of excursions to <span>the Janet River.</span>  Here is a whole cascade of waterfalls of different sizes.  For those who wish to visit such an excursion, a special walking route has been developed. </p><p>  At the Mikhailovsky Pass you can see and take pictures on the background of the <span>Plesetsk waterfalls.</span>  The highest of them is more than 17 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue bay gelendzhik" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/473563.jpg" width="600"></div>
