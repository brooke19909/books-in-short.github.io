Interest holders got the keys and moved into their long-awaited apartments back in 2012.  Currently, this complex, due to its unusually convenient location and excellent infrastructure, is still in great demand.  In 2017, you can buy real estate here only as a secondary housing.  This has its advantages, for example, the apartments are now being offered renovated rather than <span>rough finished,</span> as was the case at the time of delivery of the buildings, they can already see how much the quality of work declared by the developer corresponds to reality. </p><p>  In order to build the “Golden Triangle” residential complex, the old five-story houses and infrastructure were demolished, the necessary excavation work was carried out in their place, and excavations were dug again.  Now the area is completely updated.  Not only new buildings have grown here, but also modern shops, hospitals, and children's institutions.  We offer detailed information about this unique housing complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Golden Triangle" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1656553.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  LCD "Golden Triangle" was erected in the western part of Moscow, in the area of ​​Fili-Davydkovo.  It got its name by analogy with the "golden triangle" formed by three significant objects of the capital - Filevsky park, Kutuzovsky avenue (one of the main transport arteries) and Rublevsky highway.  They conditionally limit the territory on which the Golden Triangle complex is located.  He received the following address: Kastanaevskaya street, buildings 41-45.  Gerasima Kurkina and Tarutinskaya streets are nearby, and a railway line runs 150 meters from the residential complex.  <span>Kuntsevo station</span> is located 1300 meters from the buildings of the Golden Triangle, which is also nearby.  The closest neighbor of the complex is LCD Edelweiss.  A little further were built LCD "Kuntsevsky" and LCD "Filicheta".  In general, the development in this area is rather dense.  In addition to the LCD, there are several IFCs and free-standing skyscrapers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Triangle LCD Moscow" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1656574.jpg" width="496"></div>

Within a radius of 500 meters from the complex there are two metro stations at once, one is Pionerskaya and the other is Slavyansky Boulevard. </p><p>  Kutuzovsky Prospekt is 400 meters from the buildings of the residential complex; <span>bus stops</span> are located <span>.</span>  Thus, it is very convenient for residents of the Golden Triangle to use public transport. </p><p>  Motorists are also comfortable living here, because literally 300 meters from the complex passes Rublevskoye Shosse, through which you can get to Kutuzovsky Prospekt, which is the capital’s widest transport highway, in one and a half minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lcd golden triangle reviews" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1656558.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  From the point of view of environmental cleanliness, the LCD "Golden Triangle" is located quite well.  Responses of its residents note that in Moscow, because of the huge flow of cars, it has long been difficult to find an area where there is no air pollution.  The Golden Triangle has the same problem, but here, an apple garden, occupying a piece of land between the complex and Kutuzovsky Avenue, is a certain barrier against exhaust gases.  On the opposite side of the residential complex, about 650 meters away, there is a walking-park zone of the Mozilovsky pond, and after another 300 meters there are parks smoothly passing one into another - Soldatenkovsky, Voroshilovsky, Fili and Suvorovsky.  They form a fairly large forest park area, where residents of the complex can reach on foot in 7-10 minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The Golden Triangle, LCD (Moscow): infrastructure </h2><p>  The complex under consideration has a multifunctional infrastructure, including two kindergartens, a clinic, two schools built right in the yards.  Within a radius of 1200 meters from the complex there are 9 more kindergartens, 6 schools of a general education, a music school, two specialized schools, an academy of children's creativity, a trade institute, about a dozen fitness clubs, a pharmacy chain, shops, supermarkets, and entertainment centers.  The adjoining territories of the Golden Triangle are carefully ennobled and landscaped.  Playgrounds for kids' games were built here, recreation areas were created, flowers and shrubs were planted, sculptures of small forms were installed.  The territory of the complex is fenced and securely guarded.  However, the developer, for unknown reasons, did not provide for parking, which is a significant problem for residents who own vehicles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Golden Triangle Layout" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1656555.jpg" width="503"></div>

    <h2>  Design features </h2><p>  Stylishly and harmoniously looks LCD "Golden Triangle".  The photo shows one of its high-rise buildings.  The buildings are highlighted by the light colors of the facades and the rounded shapes of the balconies.  In total, five multisectional buildings in 19 and 25 floors were built here.  All buildings were erected using a monolithic-panel method, according to the norms of the I155N series.  It, together with design and architectural companies, was developed by the SU-155 organization, which is the developer of this complex.  The I155N series regulates the construction of three-layer walls in buildings up to 400 mm thick with the obligatory inclusion of a layer of insulation, the installation of ventilated facades, smoke-free stairwells, entrance halls without steps for people using wheelchairs, and the presence of fire alarms.  All this is available in the buildings of the Golden Triangle.  The entrance areas are spacious and bright.  Each house has three elevators, a concierge room, an area for prams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Golden Triangle Layout" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1656598.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <h2>  Layouts and design of apartments </h2><p>  LCD "Golden Triangle" apartment layout offers free, which is regulated by the norms of the series I155N.  That is, in the houses, despite the fact that they are all panel-mounted, not many load-bearing structures are installed.  This makes it possible for residents to freely change the footage of corridors, rooms, and kitchens according to their needs.  In this housing complex, all apartments, starting with “kopecks”, have two bathrooms, one of which can be removed at the request of residents to increase the remaining area.  It is also possible to make one large living room with a kitchen, dining room and hall from the kitchen and a nearby room.  Since the residents themselves will ultimately create apartment plans in the Golden Triangle LCD, they are presented in the preliminary plan in the general plan and accurately indicate only the total footage, the location of the windows, the ceiling height of 2.8 meters, and the points of supply for communications.  The complex has built the following categories of apartments: </p><p>  - one-room area from 51 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - two-room apartments with an area of ​​74 m2; </p><p>  - three-room apartments with an area of ​​95 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  Each apartment has a loggia or balcony, radiators with temperature regulators, water and electricity meters are installed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Golden Triangle photo" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1656584.jpg" width="452"></div>

    <h2>  How to buy real estate in this complex </h2><p>  In LCD "Golden Triangle" is no longer a single apartment from the developer.  But there are many resale ads.  All categories of apartments are offered.  The price of 1 m <sup>2</sup> at the excavation stage in this complex was 85,000 rubles.  Now it has risen to 180,000 rubles and above.  Accordingly, apartments cost from 8,000,000 rubles (for a one-room apartment).  At the stage of <span>commissioning,</span> there were some problems with the documents for the construction of the residential complex “Golden Triangle” (building 2 for this reason, the developer could not deliver on time).  Now everything is already settled, cadastral numbers are received, all apartments are issued in the property of their owners.  Therefore, transactions for the sale of real estate should take place without problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Golden Triangle Apartment Layout" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1656599.jpg" width="494"></div>
