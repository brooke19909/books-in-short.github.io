Apple Leader</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It would be strange to talk about the death of a person without explaining his biography.  In the case of Jobs, there is no choice at all.  His vibrant life has become a source of inspiration for millions of people. </p><h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  If the story of Steve Jobs does not impress you, then hardly anything else will surprise you.  The future founder of Apple was born on February 24, 1955 in San Francisco.  His parents sent the child to an orphanage, where he was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs.  The baby was named <span>Steve Jobs.</span>  Quotes suggest that he always considered foster parents to be family. </p><p>  Since childhood, the medium of his communication was programmers and engineers who were especially comfortable in California.  In addition, his mother worked as an accountant in one of the pioneering companies of the future <span>Silicon Valley.</span>  Steve's father was a car mechanic.  So he involuntarily introduced his son to the basics of electronics. </p><p>  At school, Jobs made friends with Stephen Wozniak - his main colleague and partner for many years.  Both were keen on new technology and 60s rock music, most notably Bob Dylan.  The hippie counterculture that appeared at that time had a huge impact on Jobs's character and worldview. </p><p>  Steve's first job was Atari, which was known for its video game machines.  Under these conditions, he and Wozniak founded the "Homemade Computer Club", which gathered lovers of microchips and other tricks. </p>

    <h2>  Apple Foundation </h2><p>  It was then that Wozniak created his first computer.  It was called Apple I. Steve realized that the invention has enormous commercial potential.  He persuaded a friend to found a company and start selling his products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Even then, the different roles of these two people in the future project were outlined.  If Wozniak created the product, then Jobs gave it a form that would be most popular with customers.  For example, this was the case with the new user interface technology, where everything happens on the desktop now familiar with the cursor and folders.  Before that, computers had only system directories and dull lists from their names.  Steve Jobs‚Äôs company combined, firstly, huge creative technical potential, and secondly, precise commercial acumen. </p>

    <h2>  1984 </h2><p>  The main success of Apple in the early years of its existence was the creation and promotion of the revolutionary new Macintosh computer (Mac is also often used in spoken language). </p><p>  He had several key innovations for the industry, from the already mentioned user interface to accessibility for each ordinary customer.  It was then that computers became personal.  They were bought by ordinary customers, not just programmers and geeks.  Another component of success is an advertising campaign that accompanied the start of sales. </p><p>  Everything happened in 1984, and Jobs suggested making a video with links to the novel by George Orwell, whose name was this date.  It was a book about a totalitarian society in a fantastic future.  Jobs wrote a story in which Apple buyers with new technology in their hands radically differed from the backward majority in the novel.  ‚ÄúThink Different‚Äù is the main slogan of everything Steve did. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Dismissal </h2><p>  However, in the future, things went wrong for the company.  Sales declined, and new products incurred losses.  Jobs was fired from his own brainchild.  He did not give up and created other projects - Next and Pixar.  The last of them was successful, and now it is the largest studio regularly producing popular cartoons.  The revolution was the use of computer graphics in the Pixar animation.  The first such cartoon was the painting "Toy Story" in 1995. </p>

    <h2>  Return </h2><p>  In the late 90s, Apple began to ask that Steve Jobs return.  The cause of the "death" of the company is useless products and marketing.  All this made many employees think of the founder.  In 1997, he again became the head of the enterprise. </p><p>  In the next decade, several supersuccessful devices and services appeared, for which the masses today know about Apple.  These are smartphones with an innovative operating system for zero years, the iTunes music service and much more.  All this was somehow invented by Steve Jobs.  Quotes from the entrepreneur suggest that the thought of death made him become 100% active every day.  He demanded the same from his subordinates. </p><p>  So what did Steve Jobs die from?  Largely from his busy daily schedule.  However, this is not the main reason. </p>

    <h2>  Deterioration of health </h2><p>  Since his youth, Steve was fond of alternative medicine: herbal medicine, acupuncture, vegan diet, etc. Indian culture and yoga practice had a great influence on him.  Recall his youth as a hippie with drugs and LSD.  Therefore, when in 2003 he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, he refused the traditional operation. </p><p>  After nine months of self-medication, he finally agreed to turn to qualified specialists.  He underwent an operation and an emerging tumor was excised.  However, the examination showed that metastases appeared in Jobs' liver - new cancer cells that eventually develop and spread to other organs.  It was possible to treat them only with the help of chemotherapy courses.  The entrepreneur publicly stated that he had got rid of the disease, and in the meantime, he began to undergo the necessary procedures secretly. </p><p>  That was all Steve Jobs.  The cause of death (in the future it was cancer) gradually gradually made itself felt.  First of all, it affected his appearance.  Jobs was very thin and shortly before his end admitted that he had cancer.  The audience also paid close attention to this because he continued to hold presentations for large audiences, where he presented new products of the company in a bright corporate style. </p><p>  Steve was supported by his family - wife Lauren and three children.  For all this he was infinitely grateful to them. </p>

    <h2>  Death </h2><p>  No matter how Steve Jobs leaves, the cause of the death of this man did not lead to the fact that his labors went in vain.  He could be exactly convinced that he had lived not in vain, thanks to the fact that he built the largest corporation in the world, whose products appeared in almost every American and among citizens of many other countries. </p><p>  In August 2011, Steve announced that he was leaving a managerial post at Apple.  He named Tim Cook as his successor, who is still in charge today.  Steve himself said he would remain on the board of directors.  However, a couple of months later, on October 5, he died at home. </p><p>  His attending physician said that death came due to neglect of his own health.  Despite this, the departure from life occurred peacefully and calmly.  Of course, the outstanding entrepreneur already understood everything and was internally ready for the upcoming outcome. </p><p>  In particular, he agreed with writer and journalist Walter Isaacson that he would conduct many interviews with him in order to prepare material for a book biography.  Isaacson recorded a large number of monologues, authored by Steve Jobs himself.  Death was interrupted by this large cross-cutting interview, which lasted until the last days of the businessman. </p><p>  In addition, Walter interviewed about a hundred people who were on close terms with Steve.  The book was supposed to be published in November 2011 during his lifetime, but due to death its release was postponed a month earlier.  In particular, the biography contained the answer to the question of what Steve Jobs died from.  The novelty immediately became a bestseller. </p><p>  No matter how Steve Jobs assured before, the cause of death was his own alternative treatment, while with such a serious diagnosis it was immediately necessary to turn to professionals.  The stubborn character with which he was distinguished did not allow him to admit his mistake. </p>
