The reviews of representatives of the manufacturer characterized the camera as a compact device with a simple menu and control, which is characterized by a rather high performance.  Its appearance on the market is primarily associated with a rise in price from version to version of the older generation, which is called J. As a result, it became necessary to fill a vacant niche with cheap modification.  For this, the Nikon 1 S1 model was created.  An overview of the camera is presented in more detail below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon 1 s1" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/523998.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The model is built on the same platform as the aforementioned J. series. In terms of size, this camera is quite compact and fits comfortably in the inside pocket of a jacket or bag.  However, due to the plastic glossy surface, holding the device with one hand is not very convenient.  In addition, the distance from the lens to the beginning of the body is quite small.  The model is available in black, pink, white, red and camouflage colors.  Excluding the lens and battery, it weighs 197 grams, and its dimensions are 102 x 60.5 x 29.7 millimeters.  The device debuted in the domestic market in February last year.  As for the cost of the Nikon 1 S1 camera, the price of the modification is 499 US dollars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  On the front panel of the case there is a lens and a button for removing it if replacement is necessary.  There is also a backlight for focusing, which simultaneously plays the role of an indicator of automatic shutter release.  The left side panel is empty, while on the right there is a key for activating the flash and two input covers protected by special covers - HDMI and USB 2.0.  They are used to connect external devices to the Nikon 1 S1 camera.  The first customer reviews indicate that people with short nails often have problems accessing these connectors, because the plugs are designed with the body on the same level and have only a small clearance for engagement. </p><p>  In the upper part there is a button for quick start of video recording, a power indicator, two microphones and a built-in flash.  The battery compartment, slots for installing a memory card and a tripod, as well as a built-in speaker are provided below.  On both sides are fasteners for the standard belt. </p>

    <p>  A three-inch liquid crystal display with 460 thousand pixels is located on the back of the Nikon 1 S1.  Its review is quite extensive.  To the right of it you can see the buttons with which you can manage the menu, view and delete pictures.  There is also a disc in which a function switch for four positions is built in (choice of timer mode, continuous shooting, flash operation and exposure compensation).  The input key is its center.  It should be noted that the model does not have a wheel for choosing the shooting mode, which is not very convenient when operating the Nikon 1 S1.  The reviews of many owners of this device are a vivid confirmation of this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The camera uses a completely new EXPEED 3A image processor.  In addition to it, one cannot fail to note a CMOS-type sensor with a size of 10.1 megapixels.  Thanks to this, the camera is capable of serial shooting at full resolution at a speed of 15 frames per second.  No other mirrorless device, not only from Nikon, can boast of such speed.  A market review indicates that it is now difficult to find similar cameras with such characteristics from other manufacturers.  <span>ISO sensitivity</span> ranges from 100 to 6400 units.  The device is equipped with a retractable flash, as well as a very fast automatic focus for taking photos and videos.  Among other things, it provides technology with which you can take snapshots of objects in motion. </p>

    <h2>  Image Quality </h2><p>  Pictures taken with the Nikon 1 S1 model are of fairly high quality.  In the event that the settings are correctly selected, the photos not only turn out to be rich and beautiful, but also have a high resolution.  If you increase them to 100%, even small elements do not erode and do not turn into "porridge."  This figure is not typical even for some SLR cameras.  Separate words deserve the function, which is called "Night landscape."  The fact is that it provides the opportunity to take great photos even in the dark without using a tripod.  The noise level in this case is quite tolerable, while the color rendering is practically not lost.  The resulting files are saved in <span>JPEG,</span> NEF RAW, as well as NEF RAW + JPEG.  What are the pictures taken with the Nikon 1 S1?  Examples of photos can be seen below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon 1 s1 sample photos" class="if" height="204" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/524000.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Separate words deserve such a feature as "Capture the best moment."  Its highlight lies in the fact that when activated, the device starts to take pictures even at the stage when the shutter button is not fully pressed.  The result of the mode is a series of shots. </p><h2>  Shooting a video </h2><p>  Video recording is in Full HD.  The duration of one single video in this model is limited to twenty minutes.  It should be noted that even despite the desire to reduce the cost of new items, the video is accompanied by stereo sound.  Information regarding the recording settings of the Nikon 1 S1 camera is displayed in the upper left corner, while the microphone sensitivity is initially set automatically.  However, the user has the ability to manually configure three different levels or disable it altogether.  As for the advanced characteristics of video shooting, here it is possible to select the mode and focus area, resolution, frame rate, as well as the type of exposure metering.  In addition, the device is equipped with a face priority function. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon 1 s1 price" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/524003.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  On and off </h2><p>  You can turn on and turn off the Nikon 1 S1 camera in two ways at once.  In this case, we are talking about pressing the corresponding power button or extending the lens.  Along with this, it is impossible not to note the nuance that, provided the device operates in the photo viewing mode, it is possible to use only the first of the mentioned methods. </p><h2>  Menu </h2><p>  Immediately after entering the device‚Äôs menu, six items become available - ‚ÄúShooting mode‚Äù, ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù, ‚ÄúMovies‚Äù, ‚ÄúImage processing‚Äù, ‚ÄúShooting‚Äù and ‚ÄúView‚Äù.  The choice of the necessary item is made by entering it.  At the same time, not all positions are available, which is not very convenient.  In this case, in order to get to the advanced menu, click on the left side of the wheel to scroll.  Similarly, there is a selection of filters and effects, for example, "Night landscape", "Lighting at the back", "Night portrait" and so on. </p><p>  Functions such as the Miniature Effect and Smoothing Filter have become the most useless of all that are provided for the Nikon 1 S1 camera.  A review of the opinions of many specialists and users of the device proves that their implementation is not even at an average level, leaving much to be desired.  Due to the inability to adjust the power of the superimposed effects, when using these modes, as a rule, not very attractive photos are obtained. </p>

    <h2>  The lenses </h2><p>  As noted above, for a standard equipment (with a zoom lens of 11-27.5 mm), you need to pay about $ 500.  Along with this, the characteristics of the camera can be significantly improved.  Even during the presentation of the model at CES, representatives of the manufacturer demonstrated additional lenses for the Nikon 1 S1.  Both of them belong to the 1 NIKKOR family.  The first of them is VR 6.7-13 mm f / 3.5-5.6 (18-35 mm equiv.), And the second is VR 10-100 mm f / 4-5.6 (27-270 mm equiv.).  Their cost is respectively about 500 and 550 US dollars.  If desired, customers can additionally purchase a waterproof case for their protection, which is estimated at $ 750.  When using it with a camera, you can safely dive to a depth of up to forty meters. </p><h2>  Shortcomings and difficulties </h2><p>  The biggest problems associated with the operation of the device usually arise when choosing manual modes of operation.  In the event that the user wants to independently change the <span>white balance,</span> ISO or select any of the Picture Control positions prepared by the manufacturer, you should go into image processing mode.  The metering and focusing characteristics are hidden in the ‚ÄúShooting‚Äù item.  In other words, people who can be attributed to advanced users of this kind of technology will need a few minutes of time and a lot of manipulations just to make the frame that they would like. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenses for nikon 1 s1" class="if" height="221" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/524001.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another drawback of the Nikon 1 S1 model is that when certain modes are activated, the images will differ significantly in color from what they saw in the lens at the time the image was focused.  As a rule, this applies to manual modes during filming in twilight time.  The result is a grayer picture than the one you would like to get.  It should be noted that the nuance that manufacturers did not provide for the modification of the optical <span>image stabilizer of the</span> lens. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  In general, the model can be confidently called one of the most optimal options for people who want an easy-to-operate, compact and affordable camera that can take high-quality beautiful pictures.  Moreover, it gives excellent results when functioning on the move, so it is recommended to pay attention to it also to lovers of an active lifestyle who travel a lot.  On the other hand, the Nikon 1 S1 camera is far from the most successful solution for those who like to independently configure the device to obtain ideal frames and images.  It is better for such people to pay attention to other modifications that provide quick access to functions that are often used. </p>
