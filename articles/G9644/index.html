In their opinion, stereo sounds better than 5.1 or 7.1 kits.  And in this we can agree with them.  Of course, stereo speakers come in different shapes and sizes, and are also made from various materials, but in the end it comes down to needs and, of course, the means allocated to meet them.  For example, more powerful and expensive floor models are suitable for larger rooms, while less productive <span>two-way speakers</span> are designed for smaller rooms.  With the exception of music lovers, most people will not spend a lot of money on stereo, and since floor speakers take up too much space, more compact models become the obvious choice.  Edifier currently produces a large number of active shelf-mounted speakers, but its R980T reviewed here is aimed at meeting the needs of consumers who want to get their hands on low-cost stereo speakers with good sound quality and great bass. </p><h2>  history of the company </h2><p>  Edifier specializes in high-end acoustics featuring technological innovation and elegant design.  The manufacturer provides listeners with excellent sound due to the wide frequency range of speakers, speakers and music systems designed for both personal and professional use.  Founded in May 1996 in Beijing, Edifier is the brainchild of a small group of enterprising music lovers.  Guided by the ‚Äúpassion for sound‚Äù principle, in two decades the company has become a world-class developer and manufacturer of award-winning speakers.  The company's products are distinguished by their bold design and high quality, affordable to many.  Today, Edifier works worldwide through distributors based in more than 70 countries in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region.  The company annually produces 8 million units of products for the home, consumer electronics and multimedia applications for the PC. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Unpacking </h2><p>  The Edifier Studio R980T packaging is unlikely to amaze anyone with its appearance, but it is large enough and immediately makes it clear that the columns, despite the small form factor, cannot be called small.  On the back of the box is the basic information about the speakers, which gives a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe functionality of the speaker system.  The speaker kit includes several cables, including standard connecting wires with red and black connectors, as well as a pair of audio cables.  One of them has RCA inputs and outputs, and the other has a 3.5 mm input for connecting to a PC sound card or portable music player.  Since the main audio speaker at the back has two inputs, you can simultaneously connect a computer and another device. </p>

    <h2>  Edifier R980T Design Review </h2><p>  The speakers themselves seem ordinary.  They are completely black, except for the red connection points on the rear panel.  The front cover is dominated by a foam cover that can be removed with the company logo on its bottom.  The main body of the Edifier column is made of MDF, the entire surface of which is finished in black wood, which gives it a more expensive look.  If you remove the polyurethane foam coating on the front panel, you can see the bass reflex and the speaker itself.  The ability to remove the decorative screen or replace it means that cleaning the speakers will not cause problems.  All ports, controls and power connectors are located on the rear panel.  A standard power cord connection and four audio inputs are provided.  Next to them are the bass and volume control knobs, as well as a power switch.  At the base of each monitor are red and black speaker cable connectors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Edifier R980T is a set of <span>active speakers</span> with a total power of 24 W RMS (12 W each) with a frequency range of 70 Hz ‚Äì 20 kHz, a signal-to-noise ratio of 85 dB and distortions not exceeding 0.5%.  Each of them is made of medium density fibreboard (MDF) and equipped with a 13 mm tweeter with a silk diffuser (4 ohms), a 106 mm woofer (6 ohms) and a calibrated bass reflex.  In terms of connectivity, the Edifier R980T has two RCA inputs (4 ports), so speakers can be connected to two devices at the same time.  Thanks to the two control knobs located on the rear panel of the main speaker, equipped with a universal power adapter with a voltage of 110‚Äì240 V, you can adjust the overall volume and bass level.  The switch is in the same place. </p><p>  So, does the active speaker provide parameters advertised by the manufacturer? </p>

    <h2>  Testing </h2><p>  Users who tested the speakers listened to a lot of music, and also used them for games and watching movies.  This allowed them to get a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe sound quality of the speakers in various scenarios and gave enough time to check all the tunable parameters to achieve the best performance of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The performance of an inexpensive system was pleasantly surprised.  When it comes to games, the Edifier speakers provide the necessary sound volume, an acceptable level of bass and clarity sufficient to reproduce explosions and shots.  Similarly, they cope well with more peaceful games.  The speakers are able to perfectly convey the eerie atmosphere, full of the sounds of dripping pipes and the creak of fans.  Xenomorph sounds more horrific than ever, which is probably the best score for Edifier acoustics. </p><p>  The speakers provide sufficient volume, and can easily fill a small room with sound.  The stereo effect, unless surround sound settings are used, is also excellent.  Of course, the vertical stereo pair was designed not only for gamers, it can also play music and, despite the relatively low price, does it extremely well.  The speakers are struggling to give out bass, but for a budget system, the sound quality is very commendable.  For perfect playback, you will need something else that can transmit the lower <span>frequency range,</span> since low-frequency tests at ultra-low levels did not give anything but a dull rumble, but medium-low frequencies will satisfy the most demanding music lovers. </p>

    <p>  According to user reviews, speakers are a good substitute for conventional speakers sold with ready-made PCs, and will be the cheapest way to dramatically improve sound quality.  Although it is strange to have a sound card that costs more than a speaker system, but if you can buy it in the secondary market, then you should definitely use it - it can also help improve dynamics and tighten bass. </p><p>  The woofer knob on the back of the main speaker must be carefully adjusted.  Turning it too high will have a negative effect on the overall sound quality, and the bass will become less focused and flabby. </p><h2>  Job evaluation </h2><p>  Acoustics Edifier R980T has been available for several years, but, unlike most enterprises in the industry, the technology that underpins the audio system has not changed at all.  It is because of this that the speakers are so accessible and show good mid and high frequencies, not subject to distortion, with sufficient bass even for the most demanding consumers.  However, they are not able to directly compete with 2.1 systems in terms of bass level, although they may possibly surpass some really inexpensive models, but for kit 2.0, acoustics work exceptionally well.  Unfortunately, the built-in switching power supply does not provide the speakers with sufficient power, so when using, say, a media player, the user may be unsatisfied with their volume.  This, of course, largely depends on the signal source, since when connected, for example, to a PC, tablet or smartphone, the sound power is good enough for the dimensions of the Edifier R980T.  Edifier R1100 with a power of 42 W RMS could be an outlet in situations where the younger model can not cope, but at the same time the size and price of the device will increase. </p>

    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  According to user reviews, the strengths of the <span>speaker system</span> are good build quality, crystal clear sound, relatively good low frequencies, the presence of an amplifier, sufficient sound power, which, however, depends on the signal source, dual RCA input, the presence of volume and bass controls, and also low price.  However, dissatisfaction is caused by the lack of ability to regulate the HF and the inconvenient location of the control. </p><h2>  So is it worth buying the Edifier R980T? </h2><p>  Users recommend purchasing this model if the budget is limited and you need to update the standard speakers that come with the PC.  Speakers can easily fill a small room with sound, and they reproduce surprisingly many low frequencies even without a dedicated subwoofer.  In addition to volume, they are unusually clear and transmit the midrange well.  Music, games and movies sound equally good.  Acoustics do worse with more complex compositions, but it is impossible to be too critical, given the modest price of the <span>speaker system.</span> </p>

    <p>  This model is probably not interesting for music lovers.  But if there is a desire to improve the sound of a laptop or mid-level gaming system without considering the use of headphones, then the R980T will serve well.  The build quality is very decent, and although a simple MDF serves as the material of the case, the wood finish will not allow the speakers to stand out noticeably against the background of other equipment and peripherals.  Overall, the Edifier R980T is a great way to start your journey on the road to audio excellence.  This is just the first, but surprisingly big step for a speaker system at that price. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  How much does a vertical stereo pair cost at retail?  This is one of the strengths of the model, as the manufacturer has taken a very aggressive marketing position, due to which the purchase of speakers will cost only 69.99 US dollars.  It goes without saying that for a great price you can find the best speaker system from Edifier or other manufacturers.  The R980T speakers leave a good impression, but they are not able to reach the volume level that other shelf models produce.  The build quality is good, the sound is quite clear, with a lot of bass, and all this at a very good price. </p>
