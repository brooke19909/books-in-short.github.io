    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  You will not lose if you decide to spend your vacation on its cozy shores.  Peno Lake is a pearl in the Upper Volga basin.  The beauty of untouched nature is unparalleled.  The name is somewhat surprising, it sounds completely different than all other objects in the area.  But in fact, everything turns out to be quite simple: at the bottom of the lake, a lot of stumps were found, which was expressed in the name.  The area is quite significant, 16.7 square meters, and the maximum depth is 17 meters. </p><p>  Here you can have a great time in summer and winter.  Pleasant pastimes include relaxing on a clean beach, boat trips and picking berries.  The place is truly unique because a huge number of rare plants grow here.  And hunting and rabalka are simply legendary. </p><h2>  Wild holiday </h2><p>  Peno Lake gives you the opportunity to take a break from civilization and be alone with nature and yourself.  By prior request, you can organize a wild vacation in the designated parking lot.  Of the benefits, tourists note the magnificent nature and silence.  Here you can really enjoy the fresh air, sunrises and sunsets, warm water and soft sand on the beach.  Even if it rains, you can still swim. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of the minuses - a huge number of mosquitoes.  No repellents help, the only way out is mosquito nets.  And come in handy and large, which are thrown on the tent, and small, on the head and body.  Insects begin to be especially atrocious in the evening and in cloudy weather.  On a sunny day, I manage to get a fairly calm sunbath.  But the lack of basic amenities often scares away urban residents.  Especially for them, Lake Peno prepared a surprise. </p>

    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Relaxing on the lake can be an unforgettable adventure for the whole family.  If you are traveling with children, it is better to choose one of the recreation centers, because spending the night in tents with a baby can be too difficult a test for mom.  But a group of like-minded people and lovers of singing songs around the fire will fully enjoy the evening under the stars alone with nature.  <span>Rest in the Tver region</span> is always a great mood and experience for the year ahead.  Add to this the relatively low prices.  Recreation facilities are scattered around the perimeter of the entire lake, so tourists have the opportunity to choose. </p>
