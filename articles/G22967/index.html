Conditions for granting and repaying a loan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  ‚ÄúDebt by payment is beautiful,‚Äù people said.  However, this proverb slightly distorted the circumstances in which everything happened.  According to another legend, everything was not so sad: "Abraham borrowed money from Moisha, bought a cow for loans, after a while he repaid the debt, and the cow remained in favor." </p><h2>  Which bank to get a loan from? </h2><p>  Credits today are a necessary service in the life of almost every person.  This has been the case since banks began to pursue a more loyal policy towards a wide range of citizens.  Today, for a small loan, you can already go with two documents and return with cash.  Or you can get a loan without leaving your home, and then cash out money at the nearest ATM. </p><p>  As of the beginning of 2017, licenses in Russia extended over 600 banks.  Each of them provides the population with a wide range of services.  In addition to obtaining a loan, citizens can place available funds on deposits and receive stable dividends.  When a citizen asks a question about which bank to take a loan from, he must first decide on the type of loan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="d-ao.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Just dreaming is not an option" class="if uuid-2415982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2415982.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of loans </h2><p>  If we take the whole industry as a whole, then financing is divided into two types: targeted loans and non-targeted.  The first group includes substantial amounts necessary for the purchase of real estate, for business development or for the acquisition of other valuable property.  These loan requests are subject to somewhat exaggerated requirements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By and large, for Russians, the question of which bank to get a loan from is not an acute issue.  The reason is that most people need a second type of loan - inappropriate loans.  Another name for this group is consumer loans.  In the framework of individual banking programs, types of targeted loans can be called differently: for travel, for training, for home renovation, or for the purchase of less valuable property. </p><h2>  Standard conditions </h2><p>  It should be borne in mind that any financial institution, issuing a loan to individuals or legal entities, sets a goal to earn on interest rates.  That is, at the stage of thinking about which bank to take a loan from, the applicant should know: the amount received and the amount of repayment will differ significantly. </p><p>  Loans are available only to solvent citizens.  And this must be proved by documents.  For these reasons, the bank makes a number of conditions: </p><ul><li>  The presence of a permanent source of income.  Moreover, the total income per family should be greater than the cost of living for each family member plus monthly installments for a future loan.  Otherwise they will refuse. </li><li>  Securing collateral.  For targeted loans, collateral is required.  For non-targeted loans, a guarantee can be provided by a surety or income statement. </li><li>  Credit history.  If the applicant previously received loans and was unable to pay on time, then this information will be entered in a special database.  However, successfully closed loans are also entered in this register.  But it will already be a positive credit history. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.imoney.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loans have become more affordable" class="if uuid-2415985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2415985.jpg"></div><p>  This is just a standard reference list.  About what documents the bank needs for a loan in a particular case, you should find out from the sources of the potential lender. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Loan Appointment </h2><p>  People need money for different purposes: to buy, repair or pay for their studies.  Bank proposals seek to take into account the purpose of the loan and are ready to provide the following types of financing: </p><ul><li>  Mortgages - borrowed funds for the acquisition of real estate.  The object remains pledged to the bank until the loan is fully repaid.  The right to transfer ownership is made immediately.  It is in great demand. </li><li>  For business.  The terms of the loan on this line require a working business that is focused and has a real chance of development.  It is almost impossible to convince a bank to finance a startup, since the risks are too high.  A weighty argument can only be liquid real estate as collateral and a small amount of the request. </li><li>  Consumer loans can be used for various purposes.  The need for collateral depends on the amount of the loan and on the personal conditions of the bank. </li><li>  Car loan - financing the purchase of a car.  Attention is paid to the year of manufacture of the car and its technical characteristics.  The newer the car, the greater the chance. </li><li>  Goods on credit.  It is made out when purchasing goods in partner stores of the bank.  The bottom line is that the latter pays off with a point of sale, and the buyer contributes money partially over a certain period of time.  The terms of the loan on this line are very simple. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.aarp.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="With a minimum of documents" class="if uuid-2415988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2415988.jpg"></div><h2>  Methods for issuing </h2><p>  Non-cash payment methods are becoming popular.  Thanks to the ability to autonomously manage funds, more and more people are getting bank cards and electronic wallets.  With their help, you can fully resolve credit issues.  If the question of which bank to take a loan by bank transfer is relevant, then you can contact any financial institution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are several ways to issue money: </p><ul><li>  Cash - at the checkout in the branch of the selected bank. </li><li>  Cashless - by transfer to a personal account or to the card balance. </li></ul><p>  There are many types of cards.  The most popular are the "plastics" within the Visa and Master Card payment systems.  In addition, each bank issues its own registered cards.  Financial institutions encourage the use of plastic credit cards.  For operations with their help, there is a whole range of bonuses and promotional programs. </p><h2>  Can everyone get it? </h2><p>  A citizen with a steady solid income and liquid real estate can easily become an honorary client of the bank.  But what about a different category of people who also need funds, are completely solvent, but cannot confirm this with documents?  This raises many questions about which bank gives a loan without guarantors, collateral, and certificates of employment.  Until recently, the doors of financial institutions were closed for this category of citizens.  Modern banks compete vividly in simplifying conditions, and this is only for the benefit of the population. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestfinance-blog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Based on contract" class="if uuid-2415990" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2415990.jpg"></div><p>  We are talking about students, retirees and people employed in the informal sector of the economy.  Together, they make up about 30% of the population.  In such cases, the question of which banks give loans to pensioners or students becomes relevant.  If you carefully look at offers from banks, then among them there are those that take into account the characteristics of all social categories.  Moreover, such proposals are relevant not only for large cities, but also in other regions of the country.  Next, we consider their conditions in detail. </p><h2>  Sovcombank </h2><p>  The age category of clients of this bank covers everyone who is under 85 years old.  Given the fact that most pensioners prefer to stop working, additional documents such as a 2-personal income tax certificate will not be required.  Three documents are enough: this is a pensioner's passport, a pension certificate and SNILS. </p><p>  Once the answer is found to the question of which banks give loans to pensioners, it is important to find out how much they can expect.  In Sovcombank you can request any loans within 100 000 rubles.  The refund amount will vary by 12-17% per annum.  The applicant can pay off the loan within 1 year. </p><h2>  "SKB-Bank" </h2><p>  This financial institution is ready to invest money in the amount of 51,000 to 1.3 million rubles for any plans.  Real estate or other liquid assets equivalent to the received funds are accepted as collateral.  The offer from SKB Bank is an excellent solution for those who are interested in the question of where it is profitable to take a loan.  This is evidenced by annual rates, which for pensioners will vary from 14.5 to 16.7%. </p><p>  The package of necessary documents is minimal: it is enough to visit a bank branch with a passport, a pensioner certificate and SNILS.  The application is considered within 5-7 days.  With a positive decision, money can be issued the next day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.racked.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="For any purpose" class="if uuid-2415991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2415991.jpg"></div><h2>  Interprombank </h2><p>  Here pensioners who are less than 75 years old can find profitable financial offers.  Loan repayment conditions allow for any period of not more than 36 months, but not earlier than 6 months.  One of the important requirements is the availability of financing only for Moscow and the Moscow region.  However, other parameters are very attractive. </p><p>  Pensioners with a Moscow residence permit, for whom the question of which bank to get a cash loan on acceptable conditions is relevant, can apply to Interprombank.  The loan amount may vary from 45,000 to 1 million rubles.  Confirmation of personal data and social status is carried out according to two documents: this is a certificate of the amount of the pension, a common passport and a copy of the certificate of Moscow registration. </p><h2>  How to be unemployed? </h2><p>  The unemployed can be conditionally divided into two types: actual unemployed and officially unemployed.  Unlike the first group, the second category has a certain employment, may be partial or episodic in nature.  In the first case, there is also the opportunity to get a little financing from banks.  But such clients are worried by another question: what documents are needed at the bank for a loan if you do not work anywhere? </p><p>  First of all, you should register with the territorial office of the employment service.  Under the law, unemployed citizens are entitled to a small allowance.  In addition, if the bank requires it, you can provide a certificate stating that the citizen is officially registered as unemployed.  Financing unemployed people implies higher interest rates.  Further, we will consider such proposals in detail. </p><h2>  "Summer Bank" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.kazan.kp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Summer Bank" class="if uuid-2417371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2417371.jpg"></div><p>  Here everyone who needs money up to 100,000 rubles can get financial resources without certificates from the place of work.  When there is a potential customer, banks are always ready to consider its conditions individually.  Those citizens who have been looking for a long time where it is profitable to take a loan can contact one of the 200 branches of Summer Bank.  In addition to loans with simple terms, you can also get credit cards with a long term of free service. </p><p>  True, for the unemployed, rates are slightly higher than the rest - 29.9%.  But the advantages of the loan remain with the borrower: plans will be implemented, and debt can be closed slowly. </p><h2>  "Renaissance Credit" </h2><p>  One of the best banks in the country, Renaissance Credit, is ready to enter the position of the unemployed and pensioners and give them a loan of 30,000 to 200,000 rubles for up to 5 years.  The refund amount will differ from the original by 13-14% per annum. </p><p>  The credit line includes several programs: for the purchase of goods, for urgent needs, for senior citizens and for regular customers.  Regardless of what type of financing the application is submitted, it will be considered no later than the next day. </p><p>  Renaissance Credit also helps those who are wondering which bank gives loans without guarantors.  A wide line of credit allows customers to choose.  Thanks to a mobile data verification system and a policy aimed at borrowers, the bank is ready to cooperate on alternative conditions: instead of guarantors, documents on income or collateral property can be provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.netdoctor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loans always help out" class="if uuid-2415995" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2415995.jpg"></div><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  Despite the simplicity of the conditions, any loan is a crucial step for the borrower.  When considering proposals, you should pay attention to the following points: </p><ul><li>  Payment type.  It happens annuity or differentiated, each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages. </li><li>  Rates of banks on loans to individuals.  Due to healthy competition, the consumer can choose a loan from a huge number of offers. </li><li>  If you take a loan - one of the long-term plans, then you should prepare for it in advance.  For example, almost all banks guarantee lower rates to those who open a deposit. </li><li>  Another way to lower rates is to use a bank credit card. </li><li>  The next way is to be a corporate client of a financial institution.  If the applicant‚Äôs organization cooperates with the bank, then the employee can count on special conditions. </li><li>  It is also useful to be a salary card holder where you plan to take a loan.  In this case, there is no need to confirm income, since the information is already clear to the bank. </li></ul><p>  Given the above, we can conclude that almost every citizen has the opportunity to get profitable financing from banks. </p>
