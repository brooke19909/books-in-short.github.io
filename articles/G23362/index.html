Many subscribers of the mobile operator were interested in this issue, but there are still problematic situations when the user cannot use this opportunity.  We tried to figure this out and prepared material that will help you.  But first, we will explain the meaning of the existence of such a service. </p><h2>  What kind of service is this? </h2><p>  A call at the expense of the Tele2 interlocutor is a unique opportunity to reach a relative or close person without having money on your mobile account.  But do not forget the main feature of this service, which consists in the fact that the subscriber to whom you dial up takes the payment.  And when the call itself is made, the user receives a notification of a paid incoming call.  He may agree or refuse this, therefore the fact of the occurrence of fraud is completely excluded.  So, we turn to the information about the procedure for using this service. </p><h2>  How to use it? </h2><p>  How to make a call at the expense of the interlocutor on "Tele2" in Russia?  To solve this issue, it will be enough to use a special instruction that looks like this: </p><ol><li>  Pick up the phone. </li><li>  Dial the command: * 140 * number of the called party, click on the call. </li><li>  The user receives a message about a paid call. </li><li>  If you agree, then a connection will occur. </li><li>  If he refuses, the call will be dropped. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Call from the interlocutor Tele2 Russia" class="if uuid-3179369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3179369.jpg"></div><p>  Carefully follow all these steps, try not to make mistakes and clearly follow the recommendations.  But knowing how to make a call at the expense of the interlocutor on Tele2 is not enough, you need to remember the cost and limitations, which we will mention later.  First you need to consider other mobile operators.  A similar service is available at all companies except Yota. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to use this feature on MTS?  It is enough to follow the instructions in the following format: </p><ol><li>  Pick up the phone. </li><li>  Dial 0880, click on the call. </li><li>  Listen to the autoinformer. </li><li>  Dial the number of the person you plan to call. </li><li>  Expect a connection. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="a call at the expense of the interlocutor pay on the tele2" class="if uuid-3179371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3179371.jpg"></div><p>  The procedure is slightly different, but will not cause you any problems.  Next, consider the instructions for making a call to Beeline: </p><ol><li>  Activate your mobile phone. </li><li>  Dial 05050 and the number of the called party, press the call. </li><li>  Expect a connection. </li><li>  If the subscriber agrees to payment, then you can start communication. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="call from the interlocutor megaphone on the tele2" class="if uuid-3179372" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3179372.jpg"></div><p>  Carefully indicate the number of the subscriber, starting with "7".  As for Megafon, the instruction has the following form: </p><ol><li>  Activate your mobile phone. </li><li>  Dial 000 and the number of the called party, press the call. </li><li>  Expect a connection. </li><li>  If the user agrees to pay for the call, communication will immediately begin. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="team for a call from &quot;Megaphone&quot;" class="if uuid-3179373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3179373.jpg"></div><p>  Now you have all the necessary information that can be useful for useful use.  The main thing is to carefully dial the number. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How much does the service cost? </h2><p>  Is it possible to make a call at the expense of the interlocutor from MTS to Tele2?  Unfortunately, this will not work, as the service is aimed at subscribers belonging to the same mobile operator.  Therefore, all that needs to be considered is the cost of calls, which is as follows: </p><ol><li>  MTS - the price varies from 2 to 9 rubles.  Differences in regions and travel should be considered.  For more detailed information, read the terms of the ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù service. </li><li>  "Beeline" - the price has two indicators: 3 and 5 rubles.  In the first case, the cost of calls for subscribers of their region is indicated.  The second option involves calling users from another entity. </li><li>  "Megaphone" - the price varies from 3 to 10 rubles.  The cost depends on regional affiliation and roaming. </li><li>  ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù - regardless of the tariff and location, the price is 1 ruble. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.samaa.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="call at the expense of the interlocutor tele2" class="if uuid-3179368" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3179368.jpg"></div><p>  All cost is indicated for 1 minute of conversation.  In this case, the Tele2 company is the most profitable.  But, before actively using the available services, it is better to clarify the information.  Now you know how to make a call at the expense of the interlocutor on Tele2 and other mobile operators.  In conclusion, we consider the limitations that should be considered before using the service. </p><h2>  What are the limits? </h2><p>  Despite the abundance of profitable services from mobile operators, almost each of them has its own limitations.  You need to know about them, otherwise you simply will not be able to use the available functions.  And so that the information is better absorbed, we have collected it into a single list: </p><ol><li>  It will not work to make a call at the expense of the interlocutor from Megafon to Tele2, since this service involves dialing exclusively for subscribers of one mobile operator. </li><li>  If the user has a negative balance, then using the function will not work. </li><li>  The interlocutor should have enough funds to connect, as payment is charged immediately. </li><li>  You must use the services of a mobile operator for at least one month. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="doithedienthoai.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="call restrictions" class="if uuid-3179378" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3179378.jpg"></div><p>  The restrictions are not so serious, but well-founded.  And if you still can‚Äôt make a call and fulfill the requirements, then in this case you need to contact the support service to find out the details. </p><p>  Now you possess all the information and know how to make a call at the expense of the interlocutor on Tele2 and other mobile operators.  Use our instructions and recommendations, and then no problems will arise. </p>
