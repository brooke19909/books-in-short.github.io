Typically, such decor is decorated in the form of a panel in a frame, but you can also make a very beautiful version of embroidery or mosaic on some element of clothing or accessory, for example, a bag made of fabric. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sequin picture" class="if" height="496" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1154747.jpg" width="365"></div></h2><h2>  Interesting hobby for children and adults </h2><p>  <span>Sequin embroidery</span> or creating murals to <span>decorate a wall</span> can be a great activity for spending a family time together.  If the mother is engaged in needlework, then the daughter will be interested in this.  Sequins are a very affordable material, and it‚Äôs also good because even the work that has just begun already looks spectacular due to the brilliance and overflow.  The child will seek to complete it faster and see the final result of his work. </p><p>  To lay out sequins with their own hands in the form of an ornament or a thematic drawing will be interesting even to a baby.  This, by the way, is very useful for the development of fine motor skills.  Of course, you need to work under the supervision of adults, since the details are small, but even a three-year-old child can lay out a simple pattern in the form of a geometric figure, fruit, flower or star. </p><h2>  Methods of fixing sequins </h2><p>  If the picture from sequins will be performed on cardboard or paper, then there are two options: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Stick on. </li><li>  Fasten with thin carnations through the central hole in the sequin. </li></ol><p>  In the first case, you can work on a material of any thickness (thin).  In the second embodiment, an additional substrate will be required under the base sheet, for example, foam plastic, and, in addition, this method is only suitable for sequins with a small hole that is slightly smaller than the diameter of the clove head. </p><p>  If you are going to decorate a fabric that will be actively used (wearing clothes, washing), then it is better to learn how to sew sequins. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sequin embroidery" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1154718.jpg" width="236"></div>  If the fabric base will be used for wall panels or other interior decoration, sequins are enough just to paste on cardboard.  It is convenient to work in this case with a thermal gun.

If the package says "Sequin embroidery", then the tools and accessories for this type of needlework are put inside.  When "Sequin Pattern" is indicated, it is usually intended to be mounted on a carnation.  Mostly round sequins are used in sets, so if you want to use elements of an unusual shape, buy everything separately.

The pattern on fabric or cardboard is easier and faster to perform than a mosaic.  The second option looks so amazing that the work is worth the time.  To complete such a product, you can buy ready-made kits for creativity.  Now they are presented in a wide range from simple small patterns to full-fledged paintings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sequin mosaic" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1154681.jpg" width="564"></div>  If you do not like ready-made templates or are considering a budget option, then you should independently develop a design, prepare all the materials and get to work.  Choose the method that is right for you.

    <h2>  Creator's Kit </h2><p>  If you are still happy with the option when everything is already in the kit, then without hesitation, buy the kit.  For example, a picture from Lori sequins would be a good buy.  Under this brand, various sets for artistic skill and work with children are produced.  The mosaic of sequins is intended for children from 4 years old (as indicated on the package).  These options are completed with vivid drawings with images of cartoon characters (a popular option).  You need to attach sequins to this blank according to the scheme, that is, not all the field of the picture is filled with decorative details, but only its part (flowers, leaves, a bit of background, etc.) </p><p>  There are other sets when sequins are attached to a dark background, for example, velvet paper according to the color scheme prepared on it.  Such sets will be interesting to needlewomen of an older age, since they will require more patience and perseverance.  The mounting methods in both versions are the same - studs, pins, which are inserted into the hole of the upper layer and are fixed in the foam substrate. </p><p>  Most of the images and patterns are more suitable for girls, but boys can also find an option with cars, for example, with the <span>heroes of the cartoon Cars.</span> </p><h2>  Work technology </h2><p>  If you want to learn how to sew sequins to create a pattern, you can do this with a chain <span>stitch, a ‚Äúback needle‚Äù,</span> hidden stitches, a solid seam or with beads.  However, most sets offer a different mounting option - using studs.  So, you decided to make a <span>wall panel</span> from sequins, having bought a ready-made set.  The work will be done like this: </p><ol><li>  Take the sheet on which the sequin overlay pattern is applied, and lay it on the foam base. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sequin mosaic" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1154687.jpg" width="402"></div></li><li>  Prepare sequins for work.  For convenience, you can arrange them in small saucers, taking them out of the bags in which they are packed, or simply lay out the right amount of parts in front of you. </li><li>  Take the first carnation and thread it into the sequin hole so that the hat is on the front side to the sequin. </li><li>  Fix the received element in the corresponding place of preparation. </li><li>  Work on the specified technology until the completion of the scheme. </li><li>  Frame the picture (it often comes in the kit). </li></ol>

    <h2>  Sequin pattern from scratch </h2><p>  If you decide to make your own version of the product, and not according to the pattern, but sequin embroidery as a manufacturing method is not like or does not fit, then you will have to work with glue or cloves.  Fasteners are available from the hardware and crafts department.  Pay attention to the diameter and length.  In accordance with the last parameter, you will have to buy polystyrene.  So, work in this way will be done like this: </p><ol><li>  Take the cardboard and draw a <span>contour drawing</span> on it with a pencil <span>.</span> </li><li>  You can make a color scheme in the form of a sketch on a simple landscape or a piece of paper in a box.  If you want to execute a variant with a photo pad, print a picture, for example, a picture from a cartoon. </li><li>  Attach sequins in rows in series using PVA or a thermogun (only under adult supervision) or on cloves. </li><li>  Buy a frame and complete the product.  This will give a complete look to your mosaic. </li></ol><h2>  Work option for kids </h2><p>  If your child likes to engage in creative activities, but is still too small to get a mosaic of sequins without your help, organize him as simple and understandable leisure activities on this topic as possible. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew sequins" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1154682.jpg" width="473"></div></h2><p>  Work like this: </p><ol><li>  Take a piece of cardboard. </li><li>  Draw the outline of a simple image or find a pattern on the Internet.  It can be an asterisk, balloon, heart, sun, bullseye, flower, mushroom, butterfly. </li><li>  Prepare sequins of suitable shades.  You can buy parts of various shapes, and not just round ones, for example, similar to scales - for a fish, a leaf for an apple or a flower petal. </li><li>  If the child is very small (2-3 years), color the picture with shades of pencil corresponding to the appropriate colors of the sequins.  Older children only need a contour or a nearby color sample. </li><li>  Apply glue to the surface of the area where the sequins will be the same color. </li><li>  Overlay sequins in rows. </li><li>  Also fill in the remaining areas of other shades, previously applying a layer of glue. </li></ol>
