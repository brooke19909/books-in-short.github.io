    <h2>  The general meaning of the term </h2><p>  What is revisionism?  The very word "revisio" (from Latin) is "revision, rethinking."  Ideological ardent supporters of something consider revision of views usually in a negative way, equating it to opportunism (this is when the more knowledgeable side, talking about the pros, ‚Äúforgets‚Äù to mention the minuses).  Such forgetfulness then turns into a profit (benefit) for those who have not warned about the possible negative consequences of anything else, less knowledgeable. </p><p>  At the moment, revisionism is applied not only to Marxism.  The concept itself has become wider.  Increasingly, one hears: ‚Äúit is necessary to revise views in economics, philosophy,‚Äù etc. Data are outdated, so the concept needs to be revised. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  General Provisions of Marxism </h2><p>  In answering the question of what revisionism is, the philosophical, economic, and political teachings of Marxism cannot be circumvented.  This is necessary to understand what the revisionists did not like, why they wanted to thoroughly, thoroughly review the theory prevailing in the circles of social democrats at the end of the 19th century, developed by Marx and Engels. </p><p>  3 provisions are key to understanding the basics of this system: </p><ol><li>  Surplus value. <br>  The cost of goods, according to Marx, is determined by the amount of labor invested in it.  This factor is the key.  To better understand this phenomenon, he introduces the concept of surplus value - the difference between the new value created in the labor process (profit, rent, taxes, etc.) and materialized value (raw materials, employees' salaries, materials, etc.).  In a capitalist economic formation, surplus value is appropriated by capitalists - the owners of the basic means of production. </li><li>  Materialistic understanding of history. <br>  History, its course obeys the objective laws of nature, socio-economic relations that have developed in society.  The role of leaders, kings is minimal.  The study of objective laws allows you to make certain predictions. </li><li>  Dictatorship of the proletariat. <br>  Everything is extremely simple here: it is the proletariat, as the main producer of material assets, that is obliged to take control of the basic means of production.  Voluntarily capitalists will not give up their dominant position.  Here, a revolution will break out, the main purpose of which is the complete elimination of the unjust social order, and at the same time some of the remnants of the past, which hinder the whole of humanity from rushing into the bright future.  For revolution is possible only on a global scale. </li></ol><h2>  History of revisionism </h2><p>  Not everyone shared the assertion that humanity is best warmed by the fire of the world revolution.  Considering this historical period, the end of the 19th century, it is necessary to remember: in Europe there were monarchies.  Social guarantees for workers did not exist.  Production was heavy, dangerous.  Having been injured, mutilated, the worker turned out to be a useless tramp. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Marxism, revisionism and social democracy were intricately woven into the mosaic of the prevailing social and economic relations of society, in the hope of changing life for the better.  One of the first who began to criticize Marxism was K. Schramm, I. Hechberg, E. Bernstein.  Especially in this field, the last representative stood out. </p><p>  The ideological battles took place against the backdrop of the persecution that the Social Democrats were subjected to.  It is enough to recall what happened in Russia, Germany, and a number of other countries.  Socialists were considered a terrorist organization. </p>

    <h2>  The Views of Edward Bernstein </h2><p>  What is revisionism and how did the ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù social democrats understand it?  The main stumbling block was the Marx class struggle.  This prominent politician believed that the breaking of the foundations of society was inevitable.  Singing the revolution, he did not focus the attention of his like-minded people on the terror, chaos, obscurantism that inevitably lurk in such periods of human history.  World society is evolving, completely updated, will enter a wonderful new world of universal equality and prosperity. </p><p>  Bernstein was well aware that there was an unprecedented, uncontrolled wave of violence that would then be impossible to suppress.  Therefore, an alternative was proposed: to fight for their rights is possible and necessary only by legal methods.  These included strikes, rallies, and demonstrations. </p><p>  Internationalism, the brotherhood of nations were rejected by the revisionists.  Bolshevism was considered exclusively as a purely Russian phenomenon.  This is a response to centuries-old serf slavery, the result of which in the future is terrible bloody upheavals. </p><p>  The only possible way is reforms, negotiations, a negotiation table.  Peaceful resolution of deep social contradictions. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  What is revisionism ultimately?  Why did European society, believing in the possibility of peaceful democratic transformations, retain the potential?  Historical experience has shown the possibility of reaching consensus.  What is now observed in their society cannot be called normal development.  Support for sexual minorities, a departure from traditional values ‚Äã‚Äãinevitably suggests that revision is also necessary in democracy.  Here, the words of E. Bernshtein are recalled very opportunely: "What is called the ultimate goal means nothing to me, movement is everything." </p><p>  The study of Marxism, revisionism and social democracy is impossible without going deeper into the history of secret destructive, essentially satanic organizations.  But that is a different story. </p>
