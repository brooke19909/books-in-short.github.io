On the one hand, users liked the work of the designer, thanks to which an attractive and easy-to-use smartphone was created.  However, the battery life was short and the model was unstable. </p><p>  In 2017, the XA smartphone was updated, introduced to consumers in the form of the familiar but improved Xperia XA1 Plus.  Reviews note the even greater perfection of the gorgeous case and the attractiveness of new specifications, including an updated 23-megapixel camera and FullHD-screen. </p><p>  So, did the Xperia XA1 manage to become what everyone expected from the XA, and is the smartphone able to compete with such popular models as the Moto G5S Plus and Lenovo P2? </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  In the rating of attractiveness of mid-range mobile phones, the Sony Xperia XA1 Plus Dual, according to reviews, can easily take first place.  The monoblock design is unique in many respects thanks to the screen extending from one edge of the case to another.  Left and right, the bezel of the display is very thin, although wider than the XA1. </p><p>  The result, of course, is not only aesthetically pleasing - it has a practical advantage.  XA1 Plus is convenient to operate with one hand.  This is great news for those who often write SMS messages when one hand is busy. </p><p>  According to reviews, owners of the Sony Xperia XA1 Plus smartphone they like even more than the flagship Xperia XZ.  It has the same flat upper and lower edges, as well as a more stable plastic finish.  After intensive use of the phone, several light scratches appear on its surface, but this is noticeable only when light is incident at a certain angle.  Of course, fingerprints remain on the rear panel, but you can easily get rid of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Like most phones in this price range, it does not differ in water resistance.  However, the model is perfectly protected from splashes, so it can be safely used in the rain. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The phone is equipped with an LCD panel FullHD resolution.  1080p and a 5.5-inch diagonal provide a pixel density of 401 dpi, which is actually the gold standard for mid-range models.  Photos and movies are displayed on the IPS screen with decent clarity. </p><p>  According to reviews, the Sony Xperia XA1 Plus, when activated, Super Vivid Mode also shows surprisingly rich colors.  The contrast level (1572: 1) also impresses with deep black (0.376 nits) and clear white (591 nits) colors.  These are excellent indicators for the LCD matrix, but not for AMOLED.  There are no problems with visibility outdoors.  At maximum settings, you can easily read the text even on a bright sunny day. </p><p>  Not only impressive color accuracy.  White tends to blue with DeltaE = 10.  Although the average DeltaE = 5.7 is normal, white inaccuracy is noticeable.  Reds are pretty muffled, especially when compared to AMOLED displays. </p>

    <h2>  Connectivity options </h2><p>  The smartphone is made in versions with one and two SIM-cards.  Cat.6 LTE is supported by the Helio P20 modem with download speeds of up to 300 Mbps. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Supported Wi-Fi standard b / g / n for 2.4 GHz and a / n for 5 GHz.

    <h2>  Media </h2><p>  Unfortunately, according to reviews, the Sony Xperia XA1 Plus smartphone does not support high-definition audio, like some of the more expensive models of the Japanese manufacturer.  Also, the phone cannot improve the quality of tracks with a low bit rate, although there is a Dynamic Normaliser function to adjust the difference in volume between music and video.  Track ID product identification service is no longer supported on September 15. </p><p>  To store their media files, applications and everything else, the buyer receives 32 GB.  Of these, about 10 GB are already used by the OS and pre-installed software.  Nevertheless, you can quickly and easily increase this amount by 256 GB by installing a micro-SD memory card, which will always allow you to carry a huge number of albums and films. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Xperia XA1 runs on OC Android 7.0.  The platform should be familiar to the owners of other droids, since the general appearance of the operating system and user interface has not changed much lately. </p><p>  Some features have appeared, such as a split screen mode, which allows you to run two applications side by side.  The general navigation and menu were also partially updated, and work was done to increase the efficiency of the operating system.  But this is basically the same Android that everyone knows and loves. </p><p>  Of course, Sony has redesigned the XA1's interface to make it unique to the Xperia.  The Unified Design theme matches the color of the phone, be it black, white, gold or pink, giving integrity to the look of the model. </p>

    <p>  According to reviews, the smartphone Sony Xperia XA1 Plus dual received a number of unique features that competitors do not have.  For example, through your home WiFi network, you can broadcast Playstation games to your phone to be able to play anywhere in the apartment. </p><p>  For beginners, the Sony assistant can offer you a lot of tips on making the most of your phone, and apps like Smart Cleaner, which removes unnecessary files from your memory, as well as the battery saver mode. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  One of the biggest mistakes of the previous model was insufficient processor power, which is why working with the user interface was inconvenient and frustrating.  Sony has improved the characteristics of the model, although, rather, it was only a small step forward. </p><p>  The phone is still equipped with the Mediatek budget chipset, this time it is the P20.  Fortunately, the amount of RAM has increased from 2 to 3 (or 4) GB, which also affects everyday work.  Thus, although user tests showed only a slight improvement (the average AnTuTu of the Sony Xperia XA1 Plus smartphone, according to reviews, is 55 thousand points, and for XA it was 47 thousand points), the phone functions much more stable. </p>

    <p>  The model proves that Mediatek can produce decent mid-range processors.  The Snapdragon 625 is a bit more powerful for multi-core use, but the P20 outperforms it in single-core applications and has a slight graphics advantage. </p><p>  According to reviews, the Sony Xperia XA1 Plus Dual sometimes downloads applications with a short pause, but they usually work stably.  Users were surprised at how well this phone handles two running programs in split-screen mode.  For example, you can simultaneously watch YouTube videos and visit sites on the Internet. </p><h2>  Battery life </h2><p>  Battery life has increased significantly.  If the previous model had enough energy for just a day, and sometimes it did not reach the evening, then the non-removable battery with a capacity of 3430 mAh ensures a significantly longer operation.  The Sony Xperia XA1 Plus G3412's full battery charge, according to reviews, provides 23 hours of phone calls or 15.5 hours of web surfing over a wireless Wi-Fi connection, or a 12.5-hour movie session.  The resulting rating is 102 hours - more than four days of work, provided that 1 hour per day is allocated for talking, watching videos and using the Internet.  This is an outstanding achievement. </p>

    <p>  Sony Xperia XA1 Plus reviews are praised for supporting fast charging and Qnovo adaptive charging technology, which is used in the best phones of the Japanese manufacturer.  It ensures that the battery does not recharge, which can damage it or affect its longevity. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  One of the biggest updates Sony Xperia XA1 Plus dual reviews called the new 23-megapixel camera.  Compared with the old 13-megapixel sensor, this is really a major improvement. </p><p>  True, <span>4K</span> videos cannot be recorded, but HD movies shot with SteadyShot image stabilization look pretty pretty.  The excellent automatic mode of the Sony Xperia XA1 Plus Dual 32GB camera, according to reviews, is perfect for everyday shots, coping well with the required lighting conditions.  For users who want to independently change the settings to achieve the perfect shot, full manual control is available. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Smartphone Sony Xperia XA1 Plus reviews are praised for a significant improvement over previous models, so the models managed to become a strong contender for competitors such as the Moto G5S Plus and Lenovo P2.  The magnificent design was improved to make the phone even more attractive and convenient, and its increased performance and long battery life provided a more pleasant use of the device.
