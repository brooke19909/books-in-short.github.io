People selflessly and with enviable persistence make all kinds of things with their own hands, which then very successfully decorate not only country houses and personal plots, but also the interiors of apartments.  Firstly, all the same, such crafts are really unique, since you can‚Äôt get anything like this in the store.  Secondly, this is a great way to save some money, because, as we all know, the price tags even for the most insignificant items of the same household goods make even owners of quite substantial wallets tremble. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY chandelier" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/351700.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Do it yourself </h2><p>  So let us join the wonderful world of needlework.  And let's talk about how to make something useful and beautiful.  For example, a designer lampshade in the shape of a ball from improvised materials.  As the last we take the thread.  And do not lose, believe me.  A chandelier made of threads, made with love and made with love, will decorate any room.  Yes, and cause undisguised envy from neighbors and friends.  Still would.  Few can boast that one of his rooms in the apartment is illuminated with a handmade lampshade.  Therefore, we will not waste time in words.  Getting down.  So: "A chandelier made of threads: a master class."  Go! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2>  What do we need </h2><p>  First, let's talk about what we will need to have in order to implement the plan, and then we will discuss specifically some of the individual details.

    <h2></h2><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  As for the ball, its size should be what you want the future lampshade to be.  Here you need to take into account one caveat.  <span>A homemade chandelier</span> made of small threads is simply not intended for use in it with bulbs of high power.  Therefore, if you plan to hang it in a large room, then the size of such a chandelier should be more solid.  And you also need to have a cord with a cartridge and a bowl for fastening.  You can make it yourself from the materials purchased in the store, but the ideal option is to find a suitable one from a lamp that was already in use.  As for the choice of threads, here we already choose what we like best and is suitable in color and texture.  Thin or thick - it does not matter much. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  Do it yourself chandelier made of threads with your own hands.  So do not be afraid, we will succeed.  We start with the simplest and for many familiar process - inflate a balloon.  Especially not zealous, because if it is very tight, it can burst under the weight of our future lampshade.  And to make it easier to see how and where to wind the threads, it is better to buy a ball in bright colors. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the top of our layout, draw with a marker a circle corresponding to the diameter of the mount on which the lampshade will hold.  We tie a thread to the ‚Äútail‚Äù, and then we hang the ball from the ceiling.  Since the process by which a chandelier of thread is created with your own hands will be rather dirty in itself, then we must put the oilcloth prepared by us under the ball.  And after that, not sparing Vaseline, very generously grease him with the entire surface of the ball.  This is necessary so that when our chandelier is already completely made with our own hands, we can easily remove it from the layout. </p>

    <p>  Now we need to dilute the decoupage glue in half with water.  And then add corn starch in small portions until the mixture acquires the consistency that the glue had before dilution.  Perhaps that's all.  At this preparatory stage can be considered completed.  You can proceed directly to the process itself. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Process technology </h2><p>  But directly to the manufacturing stage it would be nice to attract another person.  So things will go faster and much more fun.  Someone alone will hold a bucket and pass the thread through the glue, while someone will wrap the ball around it.  The first row is best wound vertically, while the second is horizontal.  And then in any order.  The only thing to keep in mind.  No need to make the lampshade very dense, because in this form it will let in very little light.  Unless, of course, this is our main goal.  Therefore, we still try to leave gaps between the threads, but we wind, which is important, as evenly as possible.  When everything is finished, you need to leave the structure alone for a day - let it dry. </p><p>  And then remove from the ceiling and pierce the ball with a needle.  As a result, we have in our hands an almost finished lampshade.  But to make it even stronger, it can be coated with transparent varnish.  When it dries, it remains only to assemble the lampshade and the cartridge with the mount.  Then, to the ringing of fanfare and applause from the household, a chandelier made of thread, with its own hands, patiently and carefully crafted, is set up in its rightful place - under the ceiling.  Master class passed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="homemade thread chandelier" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/351703.jpg?1394591187745" width="340"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A chandelier made of threads is far from the only type of such a product.  In a similar way, you can make shades and lampshades of various configurations, using as a model not balloons, but other auxiliary materials (plastic bottles, glasses, and the like).  However, the same balls are now sold not only round.  Imagine!  And experiment! </p>
