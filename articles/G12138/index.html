This name is suitable for a waterfall, because it really beats with a powerful stream directly from the cliff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="atys waterfall" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1133107.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Waterfall Characteristic </h2><p>  Water originates underground.  <span>The underground river</span> Atysh, rising up to the grotto, emerges to the surface, beats from the cave with an inclined stream.  The width of the waterfall is 6 meters, and the height is slightly more than 4. Although it is small, it is unique in its kind in the Urals.  Thanks to this, <span>Bashkiria,</span> whose Atysh <span>waterfall</span> is quite popular, constantly accepts travelers.  The mountain with which the water flows is called Yash-Kuz-Tash. </p><p>  The depth of the Atysh grotto is more than 10 meters, the water washed stones here for thousands of years.  Therefore, a lake formed naturally here.  Water falls into it not only from the waterfall, but also underground sources feed it.  Filling, the lake gives life to a small stream, which flows down a winding path into the Lemezu stream.  At the foot of the mountain runs another small river - Inzer.  The water in the source is always the same, like any underground stream it is cold, has a temperature of +4 degrees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An interesting fact: the locals call Inzer a man, he is quiet, calm.  They call Lemeza a woman.  She is fragile, babbling.  And Atysh (waterfall) is called "female grunts." </p><p>  Mount Yash-Kuz-Tash consists of limestone rocks that formed 580 million years ago.  Two mountain streams - Atysh and Aguy - pierced the caves in the limestone, many of which are now flooded with water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bashkiria Atysh waterfall" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1133110.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Natural objects </h2><p>  Atysh is a waterfall, which is a complex natural reserve.  In addition to the natural site itself, caves and grottoes, underground channels and other karst landforms are significant here.  The flora and fauna of this place also play a special role.  The rare plants and some representatives of the animal world that live here are under protection. </p><p>  There is a karst zone.  Near the natural site you can find many funnels.  Due to the flow of underground reservoirs, <span>stalactites and stalagmites formed.</span>  The most interesting may be the Cave;  its length is about 180 meters.  The <span>skulls of bears</span> were found in it <span>.</span>  However, they ‚Äúrelated‚Äù to the walls of the cave due to leaky clusters.  This place was formed at a time when a river valley had just appeared. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="atysh waterfall on the map" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1133111.jpg" width="600"></div>

Every year, every season visitors come here from all over the country.  Getting to the waterfall is quite difficult.  Even if you drive on your own car from the nearest cities, this trip will still take more than a day in time.  Therefore, your trip must be planned overnight. </p><p>  To the north of the waterfall, after a few kilometers, you can see an interesting place where Atysh and Aguy through a karst cave fall into the mountains.  Its locals are called Atysh-Sugan, which literally means "Atysh has failed."  There are many <span>karst caves</span> and other smaller craters in these surroundings.  In them you can go down and see <span>stalagmites and stalactites.</span>  The largest and most interesting cave in this place is the Sanctuary.  The total length of its moves is 180 meters.  Here, skulls of cave animals and even traces of human activity were found. </p><p>  The infrastructure here is not completely developed.  Tourists need to take care of everything they need on their own, starting from food and ending with sleeping places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Atysh waterfall how to get there" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1133113.jpg" width="405"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Atysh is a waterfall that can be reached in three ways: on your own car, on a bicycle or on a hiking trail. </p><p>  By car you must go to the village of Verkhny Lemezy.  There is a road 10 km long from it to the waterfall.  But it is very difficult, you have to cross the river several times, so it is better to travel on an SUV.  In some areas, you need to go straight along the river, and against the flow of water. </p><p>  If you are a hiker, then the nearest route from Ufa by train to Inzer.  The stop is called ‚Äú71 kilometers‚Äù.  From a stop uphill a path 7 km long.  The road also lies along the river.  You can admire the beautiful places: the calm shallow rivulet Lemeza and the surrounding forests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bashkiria Atysh waterfall" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1133192.jpg" width="456"></div>

    <h2>  When is the best time to come? </h2><p>  Such a difficult path to the waterfall will be one of the most interesting adventures for real tourists.  After all, Atysh (waterfall) is difficult to find on the map.  The prize at the top will be untouched by nature and cool clear water.  Travel can be arranged in any season.  It is beautiful in winter and summer.  The main thing is to choose a time when there will be no rain, and it is desirable that they are not there two weeks before the campaign.  A soft road makes the task much harder, and cloudy weather robs the journey of some of the fun. </p>
