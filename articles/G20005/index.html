    <p>  As for the cost of the permit, it all depends on the season, as well as on the availability of a charter flight.  Therefore, the figures below are not final.  For example, for six nights with meals on the concept of "full board" and departure from Moscow in the high season, Russians can pay about forty thousand rubles.  Of course, we are talking about living in a standard room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Porto Azzurro Club Mare Turkey" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/567871.jpg" width="600"></div>
