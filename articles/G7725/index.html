The knowledge that you will learn from this article will help you quickly get used to this country and avoid the possible occurrence of awkward situations. </p><p>  Turks are very hospitable, and they respect the guests who honor their customs.  Today Turkey is one of the most beloved resorts on the Mediterranean coast, but even the large influx of foreigners representing the culture of their peoples did not prevent the natives from being faithful to strict family rules and habits.  This is especially true for matters of faith.  Despite the fact that women who live in Turkey today have almost the same rights as men, old morals operate in small towns. </p><p>  In rural areas, Turkish women cover their heads with scarves, so if you go on an excursion to some remote corner, you should definitely bring a shawl with you.  Thus, you will not only protect your hair from dirt and dust, but also demonstrate your respect for the religious feelings of believers.  Although the Turks are quite loyal to the lives of foreigners, women dressed too frankly can have problems. </p><p>  It is forbidden to take photographs of local women dressed in black cloaks, and men must always ask permission before pointing their camera lens at him. </p><p>  You can enter a private house or a mosque only barefoot - all shoes are left at the entrance.  According to the rules of crowded mosques, visitors can hide their shoes in a bag and take with them to the room.  When visiting such an institution, you need to be quiet.  Clothing should be neat and modest.  Mini-skirts, shorts, T-shirts, sundresses are categorically excluded.  Turkey is a Muslim country, and Turks are extremely negative towards people who drink alcohol on the street. </p><p>  Tipping in the restaurant is not required, however, it‚Äôs good practice to leave the waiter about 10% of the order amount.  You can give the porter one dollar for tea, a taxi driver does not need to pay over the price. </p><p>  Additional information on how a tourist should behave when arriving in a country, as well as <noindex>  <span>reviews of tourists about Turkey</span> </noindex>  You will find on our website.  Also on the site there is information about customs restrictions, additional fees and popular resorts of the country. </p></div></article>
