From the name of this option, it immediately becomes clear what it is.  However, as for any offer of mobile operators, whether it is a service or tariff, ‚ÄúUnified Internet‚Äù (MTS) has a number of features and nuances, which you should study before you start using this service.  In order to understand how relevant is the ability to have common access to the Global Network and whether it is profitable to connect the option offered by the red-and-white operator, we will examine its conditions in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Service Overview </h2><p>  Before answering a question from our readers and telling about how to connect ‚ÄúUnified Internet‚Äù (MTS), it‚Äôs worth giving a brief overview of this service.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe service in question from one of the largest and most popular operators is the ability to access the Global Network simultaneously from several mobile gadgets on the same terms.  Thus, one client of a red-and-white communication service provider can add several of his gadgets to the so-called group - for example, a smartphone, a computer (including a laptop), a tablet PC, and not think about each times that it is necessary to replenish the balance of each of these devices.  You can also include other subscribers in the group, leaving them to do online surfing for their ‚Äúown‚Äù account (more on this below). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who can use unified access to the Web? </h2><ul><li>  Friends: sharing the Internet, you can provide your friend access to the global network, helping him out in a difficult situation. </li><li>  Family members: in order not to think monthly about whether relatives have access to the Internet, whether the money has arrived on the balance sheet, it‚Äôs enough to simply add them to one group and take care of all the payment costs. </li><li>  Colleagues: if you need to use the Internet for work issues, you can ‚Äúadd up‚Äù and pay for access at a bargain price. </li></ul>

    <h2>  What should I remember when connecting to a single Internet? </h2><p>  How to connect the "Unified Internet" MTS and not regret it later?  It is recommended that subscribers who are considering whether to start using this service as much as possible familiarize themselves with all the nuances of using the service and notify their friends and relatives about them with whom it is planned to share access to online services.  This article will describe the terms of service that are worth paying attention to.  Such nuances include the fact that you can connect MTS to your Internet package and thereby share traffic only with those subscribers of your network who are in the same home region.  Thus, a resident of the capital will not be able to add his relative from Nizhny Tagil to the single Internet group. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  MTS "Unified Internet": how to connect? </h2><p>  Activation of the customer service can be done by creating a group and adding the required number of numbers to it.  There are two ways to do this: </p><ul><li>  on the official portal of the service - this will require access to the Internet; </li><li>  through short requests sent from the cell phone of the subscriber who plans to distribute megabytes - in this case, connection to the global network is not required. </li></ul>

    <p>  You can connect ‚ÄúUnified Internet‚Äù (MTS) from your phone through a USSD request: * 111 * 750 #. </p><p>  In general, the procedure for connecting the service is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Sending a request (or rather an invitation to another subscriber or number, if you plan to connect your second number) via the Internet or via SMS. </li><li>  Confirmation or rejection of the invitation received.  You can also do this by clicking on the link to the service website or by sending the number 1 (if agreed) to the service number of the service (5340). </li></ol><p>  In the event that the sent request was accepted by a different number (s), each member of the group, including the initiator (i.e., the subscriber from whose device traffic will be distributed) will receive a text message with the corresponding notification.  Moreover, if the subscriber mistakenly gave his consent to join the group, then at any time he can leave it - how this can be done will be described later in the current article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to disable "Unified Internet" on MTS? </h2><p>  Consider two cases of rejection of the service: the initiator and the subscriber included in the group. </p><p>  In the first situation, when the creator of the community decides to stop paying for the Internet for other subscribers or their numbers, deactivation of the service means the dissolution of the group.  Thus, other subscribers will no longer be able to use the service of a single Internet.  Payment for connection will be carried out with them in accordance with the tariffs / options set on the room. </p><p>  In order to delete groups and stop distributing the Internet, you will have to remove from the list all numbers entered into it.  This can be done quite simply: a message with the text ‚Äú0_ *‚Äù should be sent to the service short number of the service, where _ is a space.  A similar operation can be performed in the web interface on the official website of the service.  Successful closure of the group will be sent a notification. </p>

    <p>  How to disable ‚ÄúUnified Internet‚Äù on MTS to a group member?  To do this, use one of the options below: </p><ul><li>  execute the command to exit the group on the site of the service "Unified Internet"; </li><li>  send a message to the short service number of the service, in the text of which indicate "0". </li></ul><p>  If there are difficulties when disabling the service, subscribers of the red-white operator can contact the consultation line - specialists will help solve the problem.  At the same time, MTS technical support will not be able to withdraw a specific number from the group - for this it is necessary that the subscriber himself performs the action for deactivation. </p><h2>  Benefits of using the service </h2><ul><li>  The ability to use the single Internet on any device: it can be either the gadgets of a particular subscriber, or smartphones, tablets or PCs of other MTS SIM card holders.  A group can have up to six numbers.  At the same time, subscribers should not be located in neighboring rooms or houses. </li><li>  Regardless of how many users the Internet shares, the data transfer rate of the group members is always stable and high (the maximum permissible in a particular region). </li><li>  Favorable price: the cost will pleasantly surprise - for each device added to the group (subscriber number), not counting the initiator, 100 rubles will be required per month.  For example, for a group consisting of 4 devices (numbers), you will need to pay a fee of 300 rubles per month. </li><li>  No need to replenish the balance of each member of the group separately - money should be paid only to the balance of the group initiator. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Nuances of single access </h2><ul><li>  If the creator of the Unified Internet group forgot to transfer the amount necessary for payment to his mobile account in time, then all participants will be deprived of the opportunity to use the service. </li><li>  In roaming, the Internet within the framework of the service considered in the current article is provided on the conditions of the home region: i.e.  If the tariff or option implies the possibility of using traffic outside the home region, then a single Internet will be available to all members of the group.  Otherwise, roaming charges will only be deducted from the balance of the group initiator and the service will be suspended. </li><li>  If the quota is exceeded, you can add a megabyte package in a standard way for MTS subscribers: by connecting turbo buttons.  If a community member spent all the traffic allocated to him, then he has two options to use the turbo button or ask the initiator to increase the size of the allocated traffic to him. </li><li>  Service is available only on some tariff plans, including: ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù and ‚ÄúUltra‚Äù.  Also, a single Internet can connect (create a group) a subscriber whose SIM card has activated options such as Internet Mini / Maxi / Super / VIP. </li></ul>
