    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sandalwood Hotel &amp; Retreat 4 *: reviews of Russian travelers </h2><p>  The choice of a hotel, according to many tourists, is one of the most important points in planning a trip abroad.

    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  Guests at Sandalwood Hotel &amp; Retreat 4 * (Goa) were generally satisfied with the rooms provided to them.  So, the apartments, according to them, are spacious, bright, clean, with a pleasant design.  Many liked the stylish furniture.  As for technology, everything is modern, in excellent condition.  But if something went wrong, then after contacting the reception all the malfunctions were fixed very quickly.  As a plus, tourists note the presence of spacious furnished balconies.  By the way, some vacationers advise upon arrival at the hotel to ask that you not be accommodated in the rooms, whose windows open onto the area where karaoke and other entertainment are held.  Otherwise, loud music in the evenings may disturb you.  True, at 22:00 it is turned off, so no one will disturb the night's sleep in any case. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Our compatriots also attribute the advantages of the apartments to the availability of roomy safes in the rooms, as well as the fact that free Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel.  Moreover, the connection speed seemed quite good to the guests.  So you don‚Äôt have to spend extra on the Internet here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sandalwood hotel retreat 4 dona paula" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1114754.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cleaning service </h2><p>  Our compatriots, judging by their comments, were quite satisfied with the work of the Sandalwood Hotel &amp; Retrit maids.  So, cleaning and change of towels in the rooms were carried out every day.  Also, as they were used, maids replenished the contents of <span>tea sets</span> and supplies of bath accessories (shampoo, soap, shower gel, toothpaste, etc.).  Many tourists note that almost every day, upon returning to their apartments, they found amusing figures of towels in the form of hearts, swans, etc. on the beds. Such attention from the staff was very pleasant for the guests. </p><p>  As for the hotel staff as a whole, our compatriots characterize them as friendly, responsible and always ready to help.  Almost nobody speaks Russian here, however, remembering a little bit of English from the school curriculum, you can quite explain yourself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sandalwood hotel retreat 4 goa" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1114753.jpg" width="600"></div>

In addition, for each guest, the cook fries an omelet to his taste and with the ingredients as desired. </p><p>  Lunch and dinner are also available in the hotel restaurant.  Travelers say that they cook here very tasty.  However, many tourists considered the cost of food at the hotel unreasonably high.  So, according to them, in the city you can taste the same dishes at a price of two, or even three times cheaper than at Sandalwood Hotel.  Therefore, most vacationers preferred to eat outside the hotel. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Hotel Sandalwood Hotel &amp; Retreat 4 * (Goa, India), judging by the comments of travelers, is about five minutes walk from the sea.  The beach here is not very large, however, there are usually very few people on it.  Tourists can sit both on sunbeds and on rubber mats, which are issued free of charge at the hotel.  By the way, <span>beach towels are</span> also provided for guests. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of vacationers, the beach here is not bad, but far from the best in Goa.  Therefore, most tourists used the opportunity to visit other places. </p>
