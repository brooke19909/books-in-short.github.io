    <h2>  basic information </h2><p>  A new culture was formed thanks to the changing social relations in Europe.  Especially influenced by the fall of the Byzantine state.  Many Byzantines immigrated to European countries, and with them they brought a huge number of works of art.  All this was not familiar to <span>medieval Europe,</span> and Cosimo de Medici, impressed, created the Academy of Plato in Florence. </p><p>  The proliferation of city republics entailed the growth of estates that were far from feudal relations.  These included artisans, bankers, merchants, and so on.  They did not reckon with the medieval values ‚Äã‚Äãthat were formed by the church.  As a result of this, humanism was formed.  Under this concept is meant a philosophical trend that considers a person as the highest value. </p><p>  In many countries secular scientific and research centers began to form.  Their difference from the medieval was the separation from the church.  The invention of typography in the 15th century made a big shift.  Thanks to this, prominent Renaissance figures began to appear more and more often. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Formation and flowering </h2><p>  The first appeared Renaissance in Italy.  Here, his signs began to appear in the XIII and XIV centuries.  However, he was not able to gain popularity at that time, and only in the 20s of the 15th century could it gain a foothold.  In other European countries, the Renaissance spread much later.  It was at the end of the century that this trend flourished. </p><p>  The next century was a crisis for the Renaissance.  The result was the advent of mannerism and baroque.  The entire Renaissance is divided into four periods.  Each of them is represented by its culture, art. </p><h2>  Proto-renaissance </h2><p>  It is a transitional period from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance.  It can be divided into two stages.  The first continued during the life of Giotto, the second - after his death (1337).  The first was filled with great discoveries, during this period the most outstanding figures of the Renaissance created.  The second was parallel to the deadly plague that plagued Italy. </p><p>  Artists of the Renaissance of this period expressed their skills mainly in sculpture.  Arnolfo di Cambio, Andrea Pisano, as well as Niccolo and Giovanni Pisano are especially notable.  Painting of that time is represented by two schools, which were located in Siena and Florence.  A huge role in the painting of that period was played by Giotto. </p><p>  Renaissance figures (artists), in particular Giotto, began to touch secular in addition to religious themes in their paintings. </p>

    <p>  In literature, a revolution was made by Dante Alighieri, who created the famous "Comedy".  However, the descendants, admiring, called her "Divine Comedy."  The Petrarch sonnets (1304-1374), written at that time, gained immense popularity, and Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375), the author of The Decameron, became his follower. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most famous figures of the Renaissance became the creators of the <span>Italian literary</span> language.  The works of these writers gained fame beyond the borders of their native state during their lifetime, and subsequently were completely ranked among the treasures of world literature. </p><h2>  Early Renaissance </h2><p>  This period lasted eighty years (1420-1500).  Figures of the Early Renaissance did not abandon the familiar recent past, but began to resort to the classics of antiquity in their works.  Gradually, they moved from medieval principles to ancient ones.  This transition has been influenced by changes in life and culture. </p><p>  In Italy, the principles of classical antiquity were fully manifested, while in other states they still adhered to the traditions of the Gothic style.  Only by the middle of the 15th century did the Renaissance penetrate Spain and north of the Alps. </p><p>  In painting, first of all, they began to show the beauty of a person.  The early period is mainly represented by the works of Botticelli (1445-1510), as well as Masaccio (1401-1428). </p>

    <p>  Especially famous sculptor of that period is Donatello (1386-1466).  The portrait type prevailed in his works.  Also, Donatello for the first time since antiquity created a sculpture of a naked body. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main and <span>most famous architect of</span> that period was Brunelleschi (1377-1446).  He managed to combine in his works the ancient Roman and Gothic styles.  He was engaged in the construction of chapels, temples and palaces.  Also returned elements of ancient architecture. </p><h2>  High Renaissance </h2><p>  This time was the heyday of the Renaissance (1500-1527).  The center of Italian art is located in Rome, and not in the familiar Florence.  The reason for this was the newly made Pope Julius II.  He had an entrepreneurial and decisive character, during his stay on the papal throne, the best Renaissance cultural figures came to court. </p><p>  In Rome, the construction of magnificent buildings began, sculptors create numerous masterpieces, which are the pearls of world art in our time.  There is a spelling of frescoes and paintings that fascinate with their beauty.  All these branches of art are developing, helping each other. </p>

    <p>  The study of antiquity is becoming more and more deep.  The culture of that period is reproducing with increasing accuracy.  At the same time, the calm of the Middle Ages is replaced by playfulness in painting.  Nevertheless, the figures of the Renaissance, whose list is extensive, borrow only some elements of antiquity, and create their own basis.  Each has its own distinctive features. </p><h2>  Leonardo da Vinci </h2><p>  The most famous Renaissance figure is, perhaps, Leonardo Da Vinci (1452-1519).  This is the most versatile person of that period.  He was engaged in painting, music, sculpture, science.  During his life, Da Vinci was able to invent many things that have firmly entered our life today (bicycle, parachute, tank, and so on).  Sometimes his experiments ended in failure, but this happened due to the fact that some inventions, one might say, were ahead of time. </p><p>  Most of him is known, of course, thanks to the painting "Mona Lisa".  Many scientists are still looking for a variety of secrets in it.  After himself, Leonardo left several students. </p>

    <h2>  Late Renaissance </h2><p>  It became the final stage in the Renaissance (from 1530 to 1590-1620, however, some scientists extend it until 1630, because of this there are constant disputes). </p><p>  In southern Europe at that time, the movement (Counter-Reformation) began to manifest itself, the purpose of which was to restore the greatness of the Catholic Church and the Christian faith.  All the chanting of the human body was unacceptable to him. </p>

    <p>  Numerous contradictions resulted in the crisis of ideas beginning to manifest itself.  As a result of the instability of religion, the leaders of the Renaissance began to lose harmony between nature and man, between bodily and spiritual.  The result was the appearance of mannerism and baroque. </p><h2>  Revival in Russia </h2><p>  Renaissance culture in some areas has influenced our country.  However, its impact was limited by a sufficiently large distance, as well as the attachment of Russian culture to Orthodoxy. </p><p>  The first ruler to pave the way for the Renaissance to Russia was Ivan III, who, during his tenure on the throne, began to invite Italian architects.  With their arrival, new elements and construction technologies appeared.  However, a huge revolution in architecture did not happen. </p><p>  In 1475, the restoration of the Assumption Cathedral was carried out by the Italian architect <span>Aristotle Fioravanti.</span>  He adhered to the traditions of Russian culture, but added scope to the project. </p><p>  By the 17th century, due to the influence of the Renaissance, Russian icons were becoming realistic, but at the same time, artists followed all the ancient canons. </p><p>  Soon Russia was able to master typography.  However, it received special distribution only in the 17th century.  Many technologies that appeared in Europe quickly imported into Russia, where they improved and became part of the traditions.  For example, in accordance with one hypothesis, vodka was imported from Italy, later its formula was further developed, and in 1430 a Russian version of this drink appeared. </p>
