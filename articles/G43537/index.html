  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Repin Park on Bolotnaya Square</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Bolotnaya Square, located in the very center of Moscow, is a famous historical place.  Being not far from the Kremlin, it was actively used in the political events of the country.  However, this territory was famous for a long time and the gardens broken here, an abundance of greenery.  Repin Park, which Muscovites also call Bolotnaya Square, today is very attractive for residents and visitors, especially in summer. </p><h2>  In the swamp </h2><p>  A place called ‚ÄúSwamp‚Äù first appeared in documents at the beginning of the 16th century.  It lived heavily, the drainage process took a lot of energy, and the buildings of the 11th century were constantly engaged in fire.  By order of Ivan III there was a large garden.  Imperial gardeners were forcibly settled next to fruit trees.  So the progenitor of the present Repin park in Moscow appeared. </p><p>  A huge area was enough not only for trees, merchants chose a place in the city center.  It is with the appearance of the shopping arcade that the place was mentioned in the letters of that time.  And where there is trade, there is entertainment.  The swamp was an ideal place for festivities, fist fights, fairs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tournavigator.pro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park in autumn" class="if uuid-3191573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3191573.jpg"></div><p>  Historians Bolotnaya Square is known as the place of execution of rebels.  Here, the participants of the ‚ÄúCopper Riot‚Äù ended their lives, the elder Abraham burned down on a fire, and the body of executed Stepan Razin was thrown into the wasteland to intimidate the townspeople. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The garden burned down during the next fire, and Bolotnaya Square alternated with entertainments for curious residents - from fireworks and festivities to executions.  The last execution took place here in 1775 - Emelyan Pugachev completed the list of those killed in Bolotnaya Square. </p><h2>  Repin Park </h2><p>  For many years the purpose of this place was commercial.  Both before the revolution, and after it, there were malls, warehouses, storehouses.  In the 30s of the XX century, buildings began to be used for housing, dormitories for workers were equipped.  There were many development plans for Bolotnaya Square, but all of them were not implemented. </p><p>  To the 800th anniversary of the capital, a park was opened in this territory, V. Dolganov became the author of the project.  In 1948, the main entrances with columns, a cast-iron cast-iron fence, vases and flowerbeds appeared here.  A fountain has been launched in the park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tournavigator.pro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fountain in the pack" class="if uuid-3191569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3191569.jpg"></div><p>  In 1958, a monument to the Russian artist Ilya Efimovich Repin was erected in the park, and the Bolotnaya Square, nicknamed the people, in 1962 received the official name: Repin Park. </p><h2>  Monument to the artist </h2><p>  The author of the monument, M. G. Manizer, executed the artist's sculpture from bronze to full height.  Ilya Efimovich looks around with an interested look, perhaps looking for an object for a new composition.  The fact that he was going to work is beyond doubt.  He stands in a relaxed, free position and holds brushes and a palette in his hands.  The figure of Repin is set on a high pedestal of dark red stone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Repin" class="if uuid-3191557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3191557.jpg"></div><p>  The very fact of the appearance of a monument to this artist in Moscow caused a warm response in the hearts of connoisseurs of his talent.  This could happen only during the ‚Äúthaw‚Äù in the political situation of the USSR.  Repin, who spoke negatively of autocracy in general and of the last Russian emperor in particular, also resolutely did not accept the ideas of the Soviet system.  After leaving the country, he categorically refused to return from exile, despite invitations from the authorities and friends. </p><p>  A monument to the great artist nevertheless appeared in the city center, in a square by the Moscow river.  The Luzhkov bridge connected Repin Park with Lavrushinsky Lane, where many of his works are stored in the Tretyakov Gallery.  The monument stands in its place, but the name of the park has not taken root.  In 1993, it was renamed. </p><h2>  Modern square </h2><p>  Now it is again called the Swamp Park of Moscow or the square on Bolotnaya Square.  This place is popular among young people who spend their leisure time here.  On hot summer days or evenings, young people sit on the lawns, resting from the heat near the river coolness.  This square was chosen for communication and performances by musicians, artists, fireworks and many other interest groups. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.7462427" data-lng="37.6183896" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/6/5/3/16653.png"></div><p>  Walking along the well-groomed paths of the park, people admire the majestic Moscow Kremlin, its cathedrals, the embankment of the Vodootvodny Canal.  Newlyweds come to Luzhkov bridge, excellent photos are obtained here. </p>
