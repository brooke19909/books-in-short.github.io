But it is popular with tourists.  To get here, you need to get to the northern part of Goa.  Regular buses run to the hotel, both from <span>Dabolim Airport</span> and from the train station.  Drive about an hour.  It's cheap, but requires a few transplants.  The hotel is surrounded by several famous resorts.  It itself is just a small private hotel.  Sometimes it is even called a guesthouse.  Nevertheless, the rating of the hotel is surprisingly high even among very demanding tourists.  Let's try to find out what they find in this seemingly unpretentious budget hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shelsta Holiday Resort" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1203315.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Calangute </h2><p>  This former hippie capital is probably still one of the most popular resorts in Goa.  There are always a lot of people here - vacationers, touts, merchants and just onlookers.  But in this resort you can always find a place to spend the night and have breakfast.  For example, at Shelsta Holiday Resort Calangute 1. This hotel also has the advantage that its guests can choose between the beaches of this resort and neighboring Bagi.  The sea in Calangute is pleasant, but because of the huge number of people it is not too clean here.  Therefore, tourists are advised to be at the local beaches early in the morning.  Well, ‚ÄúShelsta Holiday‚Äù, like some other local hotels, due to its location, can offer guests sections of the sea with the possibility of a more relaxing holiday.  There are no luxury hotels in Calangute, basically all budget ones.  Transport is excellent here and bus services are well developed with all neighboring towns and villages.  So if you want to look at the real India, get out of the hotel and catch any bus.  Any trip to Calangute will be pleasant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shelsta Holiday Resort Goa" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1203344.jpg" width="446"></div>

To the beach no more than three hundred meters.  At the same time, she has a small, but very well-groomed and green area.  It is a garden with paths winding between flowers and trees, where squirrels live.  Vacationers write that you will not see such beauty in many Indian hotels with a higher class.  Administratively, the hotel belongs to Calangute, but geographically it is located between this resort and the village of Baga, or rather, on the road between them.  The staff does not speak Russian, but you can communicate with basic knowledge of English and sign language.  Describing the Shelsta Holiday Resort, the reviews say that visitors are accommodated for a quarter of an hour, without any problems.  There are several bars and cafes nearby, so if you are disturbed by the audience who is going to sing karaoke there, ask for a number that does not face the road.  Shops, pharmacies, restaurants - all this is a five minute walk.  The hotel has a parking, laundry, medical office. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shelsta Holiday Resort Calangute 1" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1203308.jpg" width="302"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms and guest rooms </h2><p>  The hotel consists of three two-story buildings.  White houses with columns and arcades, tiled roofs ... The guests who live in the Shelsta Holiday Resort say a lot of good words about the aura of the rooms.  They seem to be saturated with ancient Hindu asceticism, because they are somewhat reminiscent of cells.  The interior is very simple.  High bleached ceilings, wooden beds, a table with chairs, a door on an iron bolt.  Windows on the lower floors with bars.  Despite the modesty of the rooms, they are very comfortable.  Wardrobe with hangers.  Shower and toilet - in the room, hot water with good pressure.  There is a fan.  Air conditioning may be included for a fee, but tourists are advised against.  They say that the fan is enough.  On the upper floors there are balconies.  Very charming maids, young men and women, clean the rooms every two days.  They are calm, friendly and honest.  You can leave things and money - no one will touch anything.  There is Wi-Fi, but the speed is not always good.  The hotel also offers superior rooms - with free of charge air conditioning and a plasma TV. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shelsta Holiday Resort reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1203326.jpg" width="600"></div>

They are quite simple - tea or coffee, juices, toasts with jam, butter.  But there are no complaints about them.  There is also a small Martin bar on the territory.  They always play nice music, serve cold beer and make good cocktails.  The London Dairy ice cream parlor is open from morning until lunch.  You can have a bite to eat at the Kviznos restaurant, which offers pizza, salads, kebabs.  There is also a coffee shop where they prepare this drink in the traditional way.  But on-site eating is quite expensive.  Therefore, tourists eat mainly in local cafes (sheks).  Dine on the beaches, where they bring everything that your heart desires.  Of the nearby restaurants, experienced guests recommend Queen Beach, Blue Marlin and Pashmina Bar.  Tourists praise not only local cuisine, but also Nepalese and Tibetan.  Such establishments are very popular in Calangute. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shelsta Holiday Resort 1 reviews" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1203355.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Sea: where it is better to sunbathe and swim </h2><p>  The sandy beach of Shelsta Holiday Resort can be reached in different ways.  Some prefer the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù beaches of Bagi or Calangute - after all, both villages from the hotel, as they say, are within easy reach.  And other tourists are advised to go along the lane that goes straight from the hotel, then turn right near the taxi stand and get to the beautiful beach, where there are never many people.  Of the equipped beaches, the bathing area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBaga is the closest located.  There are beautiful landscapes, clean, many offers with water sports, especially surfing. </p><h2>  Hotel Shelsta Holiday Resort 1: reviews </h2><p>  The main thing that unites the positive feedback from all the guests of this hotel is the authentic, fabulous, colorful atmosphere of India and Goa in particular.  There are wonderful and responsive hosts, everything is very clean and well maintained, despite the low "stardom".  All the disadvantages that can be read about other <span>Goa hotels of</span> the same category - dirt, theft, insects in the rooms - are completely absent here.  As for excursions, the opinions of tourists were divided.  Some advise not to take organized trips, but to hire a taxi and travel on their own routes - this is cheaper, more interesting, and more informative.  Of the places to visit in the vicinity, Calangute itself is highlighted, beautiful beaches in Arambol, the night market in Arpora.  Most of the guests who visited the hotel promise to return to this paradise, in the Shelsta Holiday Resort (Goa). </p>
