    <h2>  Tinkoff Biography: Early Years and Education </h2><p>  The biography of Oleg Tinkov begins in the village of Polysaevo, which is located in the Kemerovo region.  In Leninsko-Kuznetsk Oleg graduated from high school, and then worked at the mine, and then worked at the Kuzbaselement plant. </p><p>  Oleg also excelled in sports.  Around the age of 12, the future entrepreneur began to get involved in cycling.  He won many competitions, and at the age of 17 he even became a <span>candidate for master of sports.</span>  It was then that Oleg took the first steps in entrepreneurial activity.  During trips, fees, he bought goods that were scarce for the USSR in Central Asia, and later sold them in his native Lenin-Kuznetsk.  Oleg Tinkov, whose biography is unbelievable, sometimes very unusual in some places, already in his youth took up farting.  In 1986, the young man entered the service, his sports career was interrupted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Immediately after the army, already in 1988 Oleg entered training at the Leningrad Mining University.  Even then, the young man realized that in a university with a large number of students you can make pretty good money.  He started selling jeans, perfumes, black caviar, cosmetics and vodka.  He traveled from St. Petersburg to Siberia, where he sold St. Petersburg goods, and in Siberia he bought equipment that he sold in the northern capital.  The biography of Oleg Tinkov is full of interesting coincidences.  So, he was engaged in the sale of goods with his fellow students, who subsequently founded large companies and became no less successful than Tinkov himself.  One of his fellow students, Andrei Rogachev, became the founder of the famous Pyaterochka grocery chain. </p><h2>  A family </h2><p>  The biography of Oleg Tinkov is decorated with his family life.  It is generally accepted that businessmen, entrepreneurs and celebrities rarely have happy families.  But Oleg met his future wife, named Rina Vosman, as a student.  He lived with her for about 20 years, and then only in 2009 they had a wedding.  Now Rina and Oleg have three children - Daria, Pavel and Roman.  Daria is studying at the famous <span>University of Oxford,</span> while Pavel and Roman are still in school.  In his book, Oleg Tinkov himself spoke in detail about his wife.  The wife also participated in the writing of this book, recalling some moments from their life together. </p>

    <h2>  Company "Technoshock" </h2><p>  In 1995, the Technoshock store opened in St. Petersburg, and then several more in St. Petersburg, Omsk, Novorossiysk and Kemerovo.  Despite the fact that the mark-up for equipment in Technoshok stores was quite large, much more than in other stores, this equipment was in demand among people, it was loved and bought.  Oleg Tinkov realized in time that competent sellers would sell more equipment than those that were not trained.  Therefore, when recruiting new staff, sales consultants have always been waiting for free training in successful sales.  This, probably, is a large share of the success of the Technoshock network. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1997, Eldorado stores began to open on the streets of St. Petersburg.  Competition increased sharply, so Oleg Tinkov made an important decision for him - to sell a chain of stores.  He went out of business in 1998.  At that time, Tinkoff had $ 7 million that he received for the sale of the network.  He will subsequently invest them in a network of convenience foods. </p>

    <h2>  Company "Daria" </h2><p>  The existence and functioning of the famous company "Daria" began thanks to an interesting occasion.  In the bathhouse, Oleg Tinkov was sitting with his Greek acquaintance <span>Athanasius.</span>  <span>Athanasius</span> supplied the USSR with equipment for the production of Italian pasta - ravioli.  It was the Greek who gave Oleg the idea to create a company that would sell such frozen semi-finished products as <span>dumplings, dumplings</span> , etc. </p><p>  In 1998, the Daria company (named after Tinkov‚Äôs eldest daughter) opened, quickly became one of the most popular in Moscow and St. Petersburg, but largely thanks to advertising banners that adorned photographs of female buttocks stained with flour, and even with caption "Your favorite dumplings!".  But already in 2001, the company was sold to a successful holding company, Roman Abramovich.  Oleg received $ 21 million for it, of which 7 he spent on a loan fee.  The state of Oleg Tinkov is gradually increasing. </p><h2>  Tinkoff Bank </h2><p>  The start of the operation of the Tinkoff bank was reported on <span>Necker Island,</span> which is located in the Pacific Ocean.  It was there that in 2005 the entrepreneur notified the people about the creation of his bank and presented the project.  It was the first bank in Russia based on remote customer service.  At first, he suffered major failures in attracting investments, but already in 2008 his profit grew 50 times.  Bank of Oleg Tinkov is functioning to this day, is the main field of activity of Tinkov.  The entrepreneur owns a little more than half of the bank‚Äôs shares. </p>

    <h2>  Tinkoff beer </h2><p>  In 1997, the entrepreneur decided to open his own brewery, but there were big failures in finding an investor.  But during the search for an investor, Tinkov met two suppliers who offered him two interesting ideas, which he later used.  The first proposed the creation of a brewing company based on a true Bavarian tradition, which is to name beer by its surname and come up with a legend.  The second idea was to create a restaurant-brewery and in this restaurant to promote its own brand of beer. </p><p>  The search for an investor was not unsuccessful.  Already in 1998, the first restaurant-brewery was opened in St. Petersburg.  The first investment amounted to about a million German marks.  In 2001, the restaurant opened in Moscow, invested two million dollars in the institution.  Then points began to open across the country - in Samara, Sochi, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Vladivostok, Nizhny Novgorod, etc. </p><p>  In 2003, two large factories were built.  Only the second plant took 75 million dollars, which were taken on credit.  In 2005, a deal was made to sell two breweries for $ 200 million.  Already in 2009, all the restaurants of Oleg Tinkov were bought. </p>
