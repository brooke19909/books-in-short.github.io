    <h2>  History of construction </h2><p>  In the late 60s of the last century, serious problems began with water supply in the described region of the Orenburg region.  Therefore, projects were developed for the use of the Samara River and all flows flowing into it in order to solve this situation.  These plans were repeatedly adjusted, because various examinations were regularly conducted.  Only in 1976 began the construction of this reservoir on the river.  Samara.  Sorochinskoye reservoir took a very long time to form due to delays in the delivery of special equipment, insufficient deductions of funds and other reasons.  In addition, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, construction was stopped altogether.  However, in 1994 it continued and ended in 1997.  This was announced by the local administration. </p><h2>  Research </h2><p>  In 2005, all possible examinations, project adjustments and restoration work were re-performed.  They were fully funded by the federal water agency.  Every year, the local government carries out activities to control such an important object as the Sorochinsk reservoir.  The following can be attributed to the basic works: checking the water quality, hydraulic regime functionality, measures during the flood and flood periods, sanitary-technical and water protection research. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Control Features </h2><p>  Control over the state of water implies the following: samples are taken for analysis, qualitative indicators are determined, recorded in the appropriate tables, reports are made on the chemical composition of the water in the reservoir described. </p><p>  Checking the operation of the hydraulic regime, which is characterized by the Sorochinsk reservoir, is carried out as follows: a group of engineers of the enterprise every day collects data on the level of filling, its inflows and outflows, and water discharge.  Based on the information received, analytical work is carried out to study the situation of the economy in this reservoir and make up the balance. </p><p>  Activities during the flood and pre-flood season are carried out in the following way: they prepare special hydraulic equipment, then they carry out engineering control and collect all the necessary analytical data. </p><p>  Sanitary-technical and water protection measures are also carried out by employees of the local administration.  They explore the Sorochinsk reservoir (photo of the object is in the article) according to all the rules established by law.  The necessary indicators are collected, systematized and analyzed.  Much attention is paid to how abundant the coastal area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reservoir is, whether wetlands have formed, if the coast has partially collapsed, or if adjacent lands have been flooded.  And in those areas that are subject to water protection, special plates are installed with appropriate explanations.  Taking into account all the collected analytical indicators, the higher authorities decide on whether additional repair or restoration work is necessary.  These include, for example, the following: the improvement of areas where you can relax, cleaning the bed of this reservoir, eliminating wetlands, fire research to protect nearby forests, strengthening coastal slopes, repairing broken equipment and damaged structures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sorochinsk reservoir photo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1375422.jpg" width="600"></div>

The fact is that waste is dumped here from nearby industrial enterprises and settlements.  Also, tourists who come to this area often do not remove garbage.  The local administration does not conduct timely work on its disposal.  Even if travelers do not throw garbage directly into the reservoir, then it is brought from the coast either by wind or by torrential streams.  Of course, measures to eliminate waste can be carried out, for example, by attracting students to subbotniks, as in some other reservoirs of the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sorochinsk reservoir recreation center" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1375402.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Unpleasant consequences </h2><p>  This adverse situation negatively affects the environment.  What consequences can this lead to?  Of course, the fact that nearby settlements are at risk of being flooded.  But here the problem is not in the Sorochinsky reservoir itself.  The fact is that the construction of the above settlements is carried out without special observance of the established rules for planning and other activities.  This negligent attitude led to sad consequences - flooding of local territories.  In addition, the effluents of industrial enterprises do not go through the filtration procedure, which leads to the undoubted deterioration of the general situation in the reservoir area. </p>

    <h2>  Recreation at the reservoir </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the Sorochinsk reservoir is located near Orenburg, it, despite all the problems and pollution, has become a resting place for the urban population.  These areas are well lit by sunlight, the nearby forests have wonderful green hues, the water warms up to an acceptable temperature, which - if not for the above problems - is ideal for a comfortable swim.  Wonderful natural conditions help citizens to relax and gain strength before the new work week.  It is only a pity that a person does not appreciate what Mother Nature gives him and spoils the environment with his own hands.  But there is every opportunity for good fishing, because pike, zander, burbot, carp, carp, perch live in this pond.  However, due to the circumstances and the indifference of the authorities, rest on the Sorochinsky reservoir is the prerogative of only local residents who do not have the opportunity to go on vacation outside their native land, who have to put up with the lack of normal conditions and violations of sanitary standards. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Given the above advantages, it is easy to conclude that this pond has become one of the main attractions of the Orenburg region.  You can get to the described reservoir both from the center of the district and from Sorochinsk, using local vehicles.  It is possible to drive on a paved road by car. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on the Sorochinsk reservoir" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1375416.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tourists, albeit without much excitement, come to the Sorochinsk reservoir.  There is no recreation center, however, if you wish, you can give preference to "wild" rest.  Why is the coast not equipped?  This is due to various kinds of pollution.  Small groups of vacationers who can be found on the shore are residents of nearby cities.  They choose this pond because of their convenient location.  It will definitely be cheaper to stay here.  Also often come here for a few days with tents.  Fans of sitting on the shore with a fishing rod also often come to the Sorochinskoe reservoir.  Fishing here is not bad.  There are many underwater inhabitants, so no one will be left without a catch. </p>
