  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the basic return and how is it calculated</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An indicator such as basic profitability is used in the calculation of a <span>single tax on imputed income</span> or, more simply, UTII.  It was introduced in order to support the activities of small entrepreneurs and facilitate tax assessment.  This tax exempts the business entity from the need to calculate and pay a number of others.  However, only organizations of specific activities can apply the simplified form. </p><p>  The basic return of UTII is the value of the monthly return for the selected unit of physical indicator.  The company is obliged to record physical indicators on its own.  Here, specialists are faced with the problem of processing calculations and choosing methods for their implementation.  The fact is that the government took measures for simplified taxation, but did not begin to develop specific guidelines.  You can review and analyze the Tax Code or legislative acts of the Ministry of Finance for a long time, but well-written recommendations cannot be found. </p><p>  That is why the basic profitability is calculated on the basis of books of a single tax on imputed income, which also allows you to take into account physical indicators.  However, business entities have a choice, because they can abandon the simplified system.  Then they will not have to calculate UTII, but to prepare full financial statements, which requires additional resources.  As you know, the standard form of accounting requires accurate reflection of any movement of the assets of the enterprise, while the simplified system allows you to track only changes in the article of intangible assets of the organization and the movement of its fixed assets. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From the legislative acts it follows that the two above options for the implementation of accounting can be used at the enterprise at the same time.  In this case, the specialist is required to keep a separate book registering the expenditure and income.  In addition, the UTII book is filled out, which is mandatory sent to the tax service for verification. </p><p>  Individual entrepreneurs also pay UTII.  The basic return is then calculated on the basis of physical indicators.  In addition, they usually do not have to pay value <span>added tax.</span>  Of course, the simplification does not apply to cash transactions.  The presence of a <span>cash book,</span> receipts and expenditure orders and other standard documentation is mandatory. </p><p>  So, let‚Äôs take a closer look at the process of calculating the basic return indicator.  Based on the book on the conduct of UTII, it is necessary to compile a complete list of physical indicators in accordance with the specific type of activity of the enterprise.  These include the number of company employees, the number of vehicles, the size of the occupied retail space, and even the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room.  Then, a <span>comparative analysis</span> should be carried out <span>,</span> in which the basic profitability and physical indicators for each <span>type of entrepreneurial activity</span> will be taken into account <span>.</span>  It is worth noting that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hall is indicated in square meters, to express them in numerical value, you need to use the table provided in the UTII books. </p><p>  Basic return is used in the three main methods for calculating the single tax on imputed income.  The first method is based on the collection and processing of statistical information that reflects the results of specific activities that are strictly defined by legislative acts.  According to the second method, the amount of tax payments actually transferred by the organization to the accounts of the budget and extra-budgetary funds is taken into account.  In the third method, the basic profitability for each object is considered, recommended for lowering or increasing the ratios. </p>
