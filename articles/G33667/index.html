  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY a dress fast and easy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What woman does not want to be the owner of many outfits that emphasize all the advantages of the figure?  And what representative of the fair sex, at least in jest, did not ask the girlfriends ‚ÄúGirls, and in your closet there also lives a funny little creature named Nothing to Wear?‚Äù ... How can this creature be expelled from its closet?  Very simple - learn how to sew <span>dresses with your own hands!</span>  Yes, such that men delightedly look at you and envy women!  It's simple: it‚Äôs not even necessary to build patterns!  Further - about how to sew a dress with your own hands quickly. </p><p>  First option.  This is the fastest solution to the problem of creating an outfit for those who need to sew a dress in an hour. </p><p>  You will need a piece of fabric (about 3 meters), two pins and a belt.  An important nuance: the fabric should be draped well (silk, <span>satin, crepe,</span> knitwear "oil"), and if its edges do not require processing, then it‚Äôs fine! </p><p>  To start ‚Äúsewing‚Äù such a dress, you should stand in front of a large mirror and begin to drape fabric over your body, emphasizing what you want.  The free edges will remain secured with pins and underline the waist with a belt.  You can complement this outfit with notable accessories - a brooch, earrings or a necklace.  Depending on the fabric, you can get both an evening outfit and a beach outfit.  Agree, making a dress with your own hands is quick and easy!  And the result is very decent. </p><p>  The second option.  Here you already have to work with scissors and a needle, but the result is worth it.  You will get a <span>dress in the Greek style,</span> which will allow you to feel like a goddess from Olympus - Hero, Aphrodite, Artemis or Athena. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You will need fabric, the length of which should be equal to the estimated length of the dress, multiplied by two (if the dress is 1 meter long, you will need 2 meters of fabric).  You will also need regular braid and decorative braid or tape.  Their length should be equal to the sum of the volume of your chest and waist (if the chest volume is 90 cm and the waist is 60 cm, then you will need 1, 5 meters of braid and tape).  You can track the time - it will take you about an hour to sew a dress with your own hands quickly! </p><p>  The fabric should be spread on the floor or on the table, folding it in half, and marking the middle with chalk - this line will be the shoulder line of the future dress.  Now, from the middle of the shoulder line, lower the perpendicular line, which indicates the depth of the neckline (minimum 15 cm, so that the head passes, then it can be increased) and cut it with scissors.  Next comes the "blank" of the dress to wear.  The shoulder line should be folded with a pin.  Tie a braid under the chest on the body.  Now the fun begins - we take the pins and collect the fabric into folds, pinning each pin to the braid.  Now we tape the waist and make the folds in the same way as on the chest. </p><p>  If the look of the dress suits you, then you can bast the fabric to the braid with a needle.  It is not necessary to monitor the accuracy of the stitches. </p><p>  The back of the dress can be both with a neckline and without it - at your discretion.  If you decide to make a cut, then everything is done similarly to the front. </p><p>  Now you can sew (neatly!) The side seams, and sew decorative tape over the braid on the front side (also neatly!).  Your dress is done!  Indeed, making a dress with your own hands is quick and easy!  At the same time, the model is perfect for you!  Men are delighted, and women turn green with envy! </p><p>  By the way, these dresses were sewn by the great French fashion designers Alix Gre and <span>Madeleine Vionne,</span> who did not recognize paper patterns and believed that the dress should be created for a specific figure of a woman.  Their clients were Greta Garbo, Grace Kelly, Vivien Leigh, Jacqueline Kennedy, Barbra Streisand and Marilyn Monroe.  So why don't you join these great women?  Moreover, it is so easy to quickly sew a dress itself! </p>
