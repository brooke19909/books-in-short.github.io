The history of the monument "The people of Czechoslovakia - to their liberator"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The left bank of the Vltava River, not far from the Chekhov Bridge, has an amazing and somewhat mysterious story.  Here, at one time, the largest cultural monument in the history of the USSR was located.  "The people of Czechoslovakia - their liberator" - the sculpture was dedicated to I.V. Stalin.  She stood for only 7 years, but left a bright imprint in the life of the people. </p><h2>  History of the creation of a masterpiece </h2><p>  At the end of the 40s of the XX century, the country's authorities put forward the idea: a monument to the great leader should be installed in a city like Prague.  The Czech Republic, which at that time constituted a single state with Slovakia, was socialist.  This decision emphasized the expression of gratitude of its inhabitants for the liberation from fascism.  The monument was supposed to reflect the greatness of Stalin and be in a place from where the whole city is visible at a glance.  The next step was the choice of the location of the monument.  The embankment between Charles Bridge and the National Theater, Vilonsky Station and Letenskaya Upland were proposed.  After much debate and reflection, they finally made a decision.  The monument should stand on Letn, opposite the Chekhov bridge.  The place was very successful: Stalin towered over the river, and its famous sights surrounded it: Prague Castle, St. Vitus Cathedral and the mansion of Karel Kramar≈æ. </p>

    <h2>  Hello!  We are looking for talent! </h2><p>  Soon after the approval of the location of the monument across the country, a competition was announced among sculptors for the best project.  The jury evaluated over 50 works - many wanted to <span>show themselves</span> and their skills.  But the project was recognized as the best by the sculptor Otakar Shvets, who worked in collaboration with the then-famous architect Jiri Shtrusa.  The monument was a whole composition: a column of people stood behind the main leader of the USSR.  Representatives of Czechoslovakia, a worker, peasant woman, inventor and soldier, were located on the right side.  On the left are representatives of the <span>Soviet Union</span> (worker, collective farmer, scientist and Red Army man).  This sculpture was to symbolize the fraternal inviolability of the two states and the unity of the leader with the proletariat.  However, the people got a more stable and apt name for it: "The line for meat." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The first steps to creating a great creation </h2><p>  After observing all the formalities, they began to erect the sculpture.  To do this, organized the collection of stone from all of Czechoslovakia.  The department of the railway service was subordinated to a single goal: the delivery of huge boulders to the place of installation of the sculpture (we are talking, as already clear, about a city like Prague).  <span>The monument to Stalin was</span> slowly starting to take shape.  The ceremonial laying of the first stone took place in 1949.  The primary task was to build a reliable and strong foundation.  It took tons of granite and concrete.  However, the construction work itself began only in 1952, and after another three years, the grand opening of the sculpture took place in the city of Prague.  Monument to Stalin <strong> </strong>  it can rightfully be considered the largest and most expensive sculpture created in Soviet times.  Its weight was 14,000 tons.  Its length is 22 meters, its width is 12, and its height is 15 meters.  The interior of the monument consisted of reinforced concrete structures, to which the stone parts of all the statues made of North Bohemian granite were attached.  In total, about 240 blocks were used.  The creation, construction and installation of this monument took about 140 million crowns. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The long-awaited discovery does not bring happiness </h2><p>  In 1953, JV Stalin dies, never having seen the great monument created in his honor.  The death of the ‚Äúleader of all peoples‚Äù entailed a number of unexplained deaths involved in the creation of the monument to people.  In the same year, after Stalin, <span>Clement Gottwald,</span> president of the Czechoslovak Republic <span>,</span> dies.  Otakar Shvets was not destined to see his creation either.  The fifties were difficult for Czechoslovakia: perestroika, repression, forced collectivization.  All this left a heavy imprint on the sculptor's family: in 1954, his wife committed suicide.  And then, just before the opening of the monument, Otakar passed away. </p>

    <p>  May 1, 1954, the monument became available to the people.  However, the joy of what happened was no longer felt.  Arriving at the opening, Khrushchev made a speech and handed the creators of the Order of Lenin.  And in 1956 in Moscow, at the Twentieth Congress of the CPSU, Nikita Sergeevich made a report exposing the <span>cult of personality of Stalin.</span>  Belief in the great leader staggered.  Mass dismantling of monuments erected in honor of Joseph Vissarionovich began.  Prague did not stand aside.  The monument to Stalin in 1961 was ordered to destroy. </p><h2>  The fate of the sculpture is solved! </h2><p>  First, the inscription "The people of Czechoslovakia - to their liberator" disappeared from the monument.  And after some time a terrible verdict was announced: ‚ÄúStalin‚Äù needs to be eliminated.  They decided to dismantle the monument using explosives.  The statues and the foundation did not cause difficulties.  The main problem was the elimination of the head of Stalin.  She weighed about a few tons.  There were fears that this part of the monument could seriously damage the Chekhov bridge, located below.  Therefore, the team of masons took several more weeks to turn their heads into rubble. </p><p>  Then came the demolition line.  The inside of the sculpture was filled with ammunition, but after the explosion it became clear that this was not enough.  Only the facing part was damaged.  In order to destroy the monument completely, it took two more explosions. </p>

    <p>  Finally, the monument, which lasted only 7 years, was eliminated.  And for a long time, there was an empty place on Letn√° in such a beautiful city as Prague.  The Czech Republic at that moment was influenced by changes in the USSR caused by Khrushchev‚Äôs policies.  This affected the architectural appearance of the country.  Almost all the monuments in Prague erected by the former ‚Äúleader of the peoples‚Äù were destroyed. </p><h2>  A holy place is never empty </h2><p>  Almost until the mid 60-ies of the twentieth century, the <span>cult of the personality of</span> Stalin was exposed not only in the USSR, but in the Czech Republic.  Participated in this and Prague.  The monument to Stalin has long been demolished.  But this place was still empty.  The huge dungeon under the monument was adapted for storage for vegetables, which lasted almost two decades.  At the beginning of the 90s, there was briefly a rock club, then a radio station. </p>

    <p>  Before the General Czechoslovak Exhibition, it was decided to establish a metronome on the site of the monument to Stalin.  Vratislav Karel Novak took up the project.  It was assumed that a huge pendulum, symbolizing the inevitable passage of time, would mark the opening of the exhibition.  However, the metronome was left after its end.  Now it is included in many excursions in Prague. </p><h2>  Instead of an epilogue </h2>

    <p>  Now the capital of the Czech Republic is one of the most beautiful European cities.  Here, almost every building can be called a work of architectural art.  Prague in June is a wonderful sight: blooming gardens, plenty of sunshine.  Even a sudden rain will not be able to interfere with your mood, because the air temperature remains at around 16-20 degrees.  In the summer, a large number of various festivals, concerts and holidays are held.  Excursions in Prague are available to anyone who would like to experience all the hospitality and friendliness of this bright city. </p>
