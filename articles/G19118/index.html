Very soon, smartphones can be used instead of cameras.  But for now, only flagships have cool cameras.  Cheaper devices cannot provide high-quality images.  And not least because they do not have optical stabilization.  Phones with optical stabilization are able to make a clear shot under any conditions.  There will be no blur, and indeed this is the key to high-quality photography.  In this review, we will analyze the best models of smartphones whose cameras have the function of optical stabilization.  Let's start with the flagships, since there are not so many cheaper devices with this option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Optical Stabilized Phone" class="if uuid-2993662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993662.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 1. Apple iPhone Xs MAX </h2><p>  Without the notorious iPhone, nowhere.  No matter <span>how regrettable it</span> may sound, it is the ‚Äúapple‚Äù smartphones that currently have some of the coolest cameras.  And some consider the iPhone the best phone with optical image stabilization.  Besides, besides this, the smartphone has a chic screen, an excellent processor with artificial intelligence, an impressive amount of RAM, all the necessary sensors, a chic glass case and much more.  But back to the camera.  This unit has a dual photomodule, which can adjust the depth of field (bokeh effect).  By the way, artificial intelligence is responsible for image processing during shooting, so the quality of photos and videos is the highest.  Optical stabilization in this device applies not only to the photo, but also to the video that this device can shoot in 4K resolution and at a speed of 60 frames per second.  Everything is fine in the iPhone, except for the price.  It costs so much that it is far from accessible to every person.  However, this optical stabilization phone is in demand.  Consider the feedback from the owners of this device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.macworld.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best optical stabilization phone" class="if uuid-2993668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993668.jpg"></div><h2>  User reviews for Apple iPhone Xs MAX </h2><p>  Those who purchased this smartphone (even despite the price) note that it works just fine: quickly and clearly.  But we are interested in the camera.  Users agree that this is definitely the best camera phone with optical stabilization.  Photos on it are always clear.  The image quality is off the charts.  Color reproduction is at the highest level, as is the depth of field.  And the device also allows you to save images in RAW for subsequent processing in a graphical editor.  Owners also liked the autofocus speed.  It works almost instantly.  Even in low light conditions.  The smartphone also shoots videos without the slightest shaking.  This device does not even need an accessory in the form of a monopod.  In general, the smartphone is very decent.  But it‚Äôs better to watch something cheaper.  This is what we are going to do now. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phones with optical camera stabilization" class="if uuid-2993663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993663.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 2. Samsung Galaxy S9 + </h2><p>  Where without a fresh flagship from Samsung?  This device is released relatively recently.  And he is the coolest in the entire line of Samsung.  Therefore, the camera is gorgeous.  As, however, and other components.  The device has a top-end Exynos processor with incredible performance, a huge "unlimited" screen, six gigabytes of RAM, 512 gigabytes of internal storage, a capacious battery, support for all communication standards, a large number of necessary sensors, all modern wireless interfaces and a beautiful case.  And also this is the best Samsung phone with optical camera stabilization.  And the latter is no worse here than in the notorious iPhone.  By the way, her work is also controlled by artificial intelligence, because the photos are excellent.  The camera also knows how to record video in 4K at a speed of 120 frames per second (in slow motion).  It is also possible to save images in RAW.  In general, according to the capabilities of the camera, this unit is not far from the "apple" smartphone.  It also costs a lot, but still several times cheaper than the same iPhone.  Therefore, if you need a good phone with optical stabilization for adequate money, then you should look at the ninth ‚Äúgalaxy‚Äù.  Now consider the reviews of those who have already managed to purchase it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung phone with optical camera stabilization" class="if uuid-2993670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993670.jpg"></div><h2>  Samsung Galaxy S9 + reviews </h2><p>  Since the device was released relatively recently, far few have purchased it yet.  But those who bought note that the device is simply excellent.  Soundly assembled, has high-quality materials, works great, quickly responds to any action.  And yet, according to users, there are no games that would be too tough for him.  However, we are interested in the features of the camera, stabilization, in particular.  Users note that it was thanks to this option that the opportunity to record a full-fledged video appeared.  With stabilization turned on, hand trembling is imperceptible at all.  The video sequence is smooth, not twitching.  In photographs, this option is also noticeable.  The camera provides clear photos in all conditions.  And this is the merit of stabilization.  In general, Samsung phones with optical stabilization are not new.  There is such a thing in last year‚Äôs flagships.  Therefore, if you want to save money, the eighth ‚Äúgalaxy‚Äù is at your service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung phones with optical stabilization" class="if uuid-2993664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993664.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 3. HTC U12 + </h2><p>  Another fresh flagship, but this time from the NTS company.  It is nice that the legendary manufacturer had the strength to get out of the swamp and he pleased the loyal fans with a high-quality and interesting smartphone.  This is a very interesting device.  It has an excellent screen on the PVA matrix, uses touch keys instead of the usual mechanical volume keys, and boasts the top Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset, 6 gigabytes of RAM, 256 gigabytes of internal storage.  If you are looking for the answer to the question of which phones have optical stabilization, then here's the answer: on HTC U12 +.  The camera at the device is one of the best on the market.  The dual photo module provides the highest image quality and can play with depth of field.  And the camera is able to write video in 4K at a speed of 60 frames per second.  A feature of this device is that it is one of the most affordable flagships.  It is even cheaper than the notorious Samsung.  Although not far from him in terms of technical specifications.  Now consider the reviews of the owners of the device. </p><h2>  Reviews on HTC U12 + </h2><p>  Those who managed to buy this phone with optical stabilization note excellent workmanship and chic appearance.  But the smartphone looks no worse than it works.  Its power is enough for all tasks.  Including all modern toys.  Also, users note that the device has excellent autonomy, which is a bit strange for the flagship.  But most of all the positive comments apply to the camera apparatus.  She really is one of the best.  Able all the same as the iPhone camera.  But it works faster.  Focusing takes place in a split second.  And optical stabilization allows you to get high-quality images in any conditions.  The video also turns out gorgeous - 60 frames per second at a resolution of 4K.  A dream, not a camera.  And despite the fact that this unit is even cheaper than the Samsung.  An excellent device with chic specifications for the right price. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ibtimes.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Which phones have optical stabilization?" class="if uuid-2993666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993666.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 4. ASUS Zenfone 5Z </h2><p>  An excellent device from a reputable brand.  It has a modern design (with a screen on the entire front panel and a "monobrow") and excellent technical characteristics.  Onboard one of the best ‚Äúdragons‚Äù is installed, a decent amount of RAM, a good internal drive, an excellent battery and much more.  The "chip" of this unit is a dedicated DAC, providing crystal clear sound in the headphones.  Music lovers will definitely be pleased.  But let's not forget that we have a phone with optical stabilization.  The cameras on the device are simply excellent.  He is able to provide a high-quality image in any conditions.  And he can write 4K video at a speed of 30 frames per second.  And this is at its price!  It costs even less than the flagship of the NTS, although in some ways ASUS even surpasses U12 +.  However, now it‚Äôs worth considering user reviews about this device. </p><h2>  ASUS Zenfone 5Z Reviews </h2><p>  There are a lot of people who bought this phone on the Internet.  And all of them unanimously declare that "ASUS" is the best camera phone.  According to them, even the iPhone‚Äôs cameras are not able to provide the same quality as Zenfon‚Äôs.  Well, it may well be, since this device was created with an emphasis on photo and video shooting.  Optical stabilization here works almost perfectly.  Autofocus is incredibly fast, and fast lenses give an excellent picture even in low light conditions.  Therefore, it is quite possible to agree with users that we have the best camera phone.  And the fact that it is the best in price is not at all in doubt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phones with optical image stabilization" class="if uuid-2993667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993667.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 5. Honor 6X </h2><p>  If you were looking for inexpensive phones with optical stabilization, then Onor 6X is just what you need.  This device, manufactured by the Huawei sub-brand, cannot boast of a top-filling, but it has an excellent camera with a dual module and optical stabilization.  In all other respects, it is a stable "average".  He will easily pull modern games, but he does not have such a power reserve as the Samsung Galaxy, but it costs indecently cheaply.  This is one of the most affordable smartphones with a cool camera, and it's really cool.  The camera provides high-quality images in any lighting conditions and can write video in Full HD at a speed of 30 frames per second.  And this allows you to fully call a smartphone a camera phone.  Those who want to buy an inexpensive, hardy device for work and entertainment should definitely pay attention to this Onor.  It‚Äôs better not to find it anyway (at least among devices with optical camera stabilization).  Now consider the reviews of those who have purchased this device. </p><h2>  Honor 6X reviews </h2><p>  The owners of the sixth ‚ÄúHonor‚Äù note that although the phone is ugly, it works honestly.  According to users, this unit is even able to pull WoT Blitz and PUBG Mobile (although not at maximum graphics settings).  However, most of the compliments fell to the camera.  Many do not even believe that in a frankly budget smartphone there may be such a sensor.  The dual camera copes with the fashionable bokeh effect and optical image stabilization.  Of course, the stabilizer works worse than in the flagships.  But he is.  This is already an achievement.  The rest of the technical specifications are somehow lost against the backdrop of such a cool camera.  In general, the device is decent, albeit cheap. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, above we have analyzed the best phones with optical camera stabilization.  Among them there are insanely expensive flagships, as well as devices that are quite adequate for the price.  But it depends only on the user what he will choose to receive high-quality photos and videos. </p>
