"Freshness and purity," the answer will follow.  And although meteorologists daily inform us of its relative humidity, we perceive this parameter as something abstract, not having a special relation to our life. </p><p>  Meanwhile, the human body is comfortable only with relative humidity of 60-75% in the summer and 55-70% in the winter.  Unfortunately, in vivo the optimum level is extremely rare.  In summer, it falls due to high air temperatures, and in autumn and winter - due to overheating of its heating devices. </p><p>  To achieve such a state of the air environment, which will provide a comfortable heat sensation of a person, use a household air humidifier.  But is it really necessary, because for so many years people have somehow managed without it? </p><p>  Comfort in the office </p><p>  First of all, insufficient humidity contributes to the development of symptoms of low oxygen consumption due to its insufficient ingress into the blood.  One feels tired, irritated, a person cannot concentrate on work.  Due to a decrease in immunity, the body becomes easily susceptible to various infectious diseases. </p><p>  In modern conditions, it is unlikely that a competent employer will want to have a team in his submission, the efficiency of which is rapidly approaching zero.  It becomes clear that it is better to invest certain funds in the purchase of humidifiers and, thanks to this, increase the efficiency of employees. </p><p>  Home Health Care </p><p>  Unfortunately, we are not yet accustomed to treat our health with care.  And if in the offices of self-respecting companies the microclimate indicators correspond to the established standards, then in residential premises things are much worse.  Dry air contributes to the rapid spread of dust, which is very poorly tolerated by allergy sufferers and asthmatics.  The skin, due to lack of moisture, becomes dry, which leads to its rapid aging.  Those who are forced to wear contact lenses have additional irritation of the mucous membrane of the eye. </p><p>  Another argument for the acquisition <noindex>  <span>humidifier household</span> </noindex>  it may be necessary to care for expensive furniture made from natural materials and wooden interior decoration of the house.  Just these products react very subtly to changes in relative humidity.  And if you are also a grower, then without this device you just can‚Äôt grow a beautiful and healthy plant. </p><p>  Convenience in the car </p><p>  There is another place where sometimes life depends on the level of comfort.  This is car.  Dry air is not the best companion.  Eyes get tired, watery.  Difficulty breathing.  Since a modern man spends a significant part of his life behind the wheel, comfort on the road should be taken into account.  A car humidifier allows you to stay awake throughout the day.  And this is the key to good health and successful work. </p><p>  We believe that we were able to convince you of the need to purchase these necessary devices, which every minute will take care of your comfort at home, driving and in the office.  Stay healthy! </p></div></article>
