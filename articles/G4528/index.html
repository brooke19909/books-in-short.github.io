Her delicate small flowers of lilac, white, pink and <span>lilac color</span> attract and captivate with their aroma.  Of course, it will take a lot of time to create such a beautiful <span>tree from beads.</span>  Lilac is not the easiest work in beadwork, but it will help to bring a spring mood into the house and will enchant you with its gentle beauty. </p><p>  How to make lilac from beads?  First you need to prepare everything you need for your work, namely several different colors and shades of beads.  The leaves, of course, will be green, but the palette of the flowers themselves should be decided in advance.  The classic version is lilac and <span>white lilac</span> from beads, but you can also make it in <span>pink,</span> which will give the inflorescences even more lovely tenderness.  The main work will be carried out using thin wire.  For the main trunk and branches you will need a wire of a thicker diameter.  For wrapping all the branches you will need a <span>floristic ribbon,</span> but if one is not found, it is quite possible to replace it with brown or green floss threads.  And of course, you will need a beautiful pot or vase, in which a tree of beads will be fixed using plaster. </p><p>  We begin to carry out lilacs with making flowers.  This is done as follows.  Three beads are strung on each piece of wire.  They will be, as it were, the basis of the flower.  Then begins the execution of the petals.  To do this, six more beads are collected on the base, the wire is bent and threaded into the base on the same side.  This way you get one small petal.  You need to make three more petals and the lilac flower will be ready.  Many have heard that if you find a flower with five petals on a blooming lilac and make a wish, it will certainly come true.  Therefore, it is worth making several of these flowers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The following is the assembly of the main brush.  <span>Small flowers</span> need to be connected in four to five pieces, then put the finished inflorescences in two together.  Here you can fantasize and arrange flowers so that their combination resembles a real lilac brush.  The more flowers there are, the more magnificent and, accordingly, the finished lilac from beads will be more beautiful and luxurious. </p><p>  Fluffy brushes are ready and now work begins on the leaves.  They are made using the parallel weaving technique and are made quite simple.  To do this, dial the required number of beads for the middle part of the sheet (length), and then take turns to weave both of its halves, reducing the number of beads in each row.  For each branch, you need three such leaves and one - two fluffy blue brushes. </p><p>  How to make lilac from beads?  It remains only to collect all the finished parts of the structure and fix them on the main stem.  After assembling all the parts, each twig is wrapped with floristic ribbon or <span>floss thread.</span>  Since the design is quite massive, thanks to fluffy inflorescences, it is worth choosing a thicker wire for the main stem.  Lilac from beads is set in a beautiful vase and fixed with plaster or small beautiful pebbles. </p><p>  The work is completed.  And even though she was rather painstaking, her result was a magnificent result, pleasing with the beauty not only of her creator, but also of all her friends and acquaintances.  Lush lilac from beads practically does not differ from the real one.  Well, maybe only because she does not fade, but for a long time remains one of the objects for the admiration of everyone around.  With the help of aromatic oil, crafts can give a real smell of lilac.  Just a few drops will add her even more reality.  A delicate fragrant sprig of lilac will be the best gift on spring holidays.  It will fill every house with spring mood and will always be appreciated. </p>
