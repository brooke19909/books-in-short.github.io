The princes always wanted the city to belong to them.  The princes of Vladimir planted their eldest sons on the throne, hoping that the city could always become a fortress and a place of shelter from enemy invasions.

    <h2>  Times of Dmitry Donskoy </h2><p>  The lands of Vladimir princes gradually expanded.  This, accordingly, helped strengthen their power.  But this state of affairs did not suit the Horde khans. </p><p>  And in 1327, the Horde Khan intervened and divided the lands of Vladimir into parts.  Novgorod with Kostroma went to Prince Ivan Danilovich Kalita.  It turned out that the city of Vladimir was given to another.  Kostroma has always been associated with him.  And Kalita was the Prince of Moscow. </p><p>  But under Dmitry Donskoy, much has changed.  Previously, the <span>Moscow principality,</span> which included Kostroma, was not in the best position because of the impossibility of communication with the Volga route. </p><p>  But Prince Dmitry began to use Kostroma bypassing the Volga route.  Even a shelter from <span>Khan Tokhtamysh</span> for Prince Donskoy became Kostroma.  A brief history of the city for children includes a story about the Kostroma Kremlin. </p><h2>  Kostroma Kremlin </h2><p>  There is an interesting fact in the history of Kostroma when the so-called old city was built on the Volga hill.  It was called the Kremlin.  Around it were mounds, ramparts and deep ditches.  Even today, the remains of former embankments and ramparts are preserved. </p><p>  Entrance to the Kremlin was through the Spassky Gate with the crossing of the bridge of the same name.  A deep moat was dug below. </p><p>  In the Kremlin itself were located: </p><ol><li>  Sentry, labial and moving hut. </li><li>  Jail. </li><li>  Granaries of the sovereign. </li><li>  Siege yard and Pushkar yard. </li></ol>

    <p>  There you will be shown all the memorable places associated with Susanin.  This is a museum, and a chapel, and Yusupov swamps.  They will also show you a stone installed by grateful residents at the site of the death of a peasant. </p><p>  Nearby is the native village where Ivan Susanin lived and from where he left on his last journey. </p><h2>  Monument to Yuri Dolgoruky </h2><p>  Kostroma residents have always honored all who contributed to the prosperity of their city.  When the city turned 850 years old, a pedestal was erected in honor of Kostroma's benefactor <span>Yuri Dolgoruky</span> . </p><p>  Tell the children that it was he who, in the distant 1152, founded the small town, which turned into the present majestic Kostroma.  Therefore, now on the Resurrection Square flaunts a 4.5-meter monument that residents have been waiting for. </p><p>  Again, the Moscow architect Tserkovnikov made the bronze sculpture.  He is famous for participating in the reconstruction of the composition ‚ÄúWorker and Collective Farm Girl‚Äù and is the author of the Chaliapin monument. </p><p>  The monument itself to Y. Dolgoruky is made in the form of a seated prince with a pointing gesture, as if to say that a new city will stand and prosper in this place. </p><p>  Thanks to the special technology for performing the sculpture, the monument shines in the sun, this place is very popular not only among tourists, but also among citizens. </p><h2>  Museum of Wooden Architecture </h2><p>  Now wooden houses are very fashionable and look great.  But it is expensive, not everyone can allow to build a hut from a real tree.  But before the whole city was wooden.  But because of this, tragedies and fires often happened. </p><p>  But Kostroma still rebuilt.  But, interestingly, in the whole city there is not a single ancient wooden building.  But people wanted their children to know what the city looked like before, how people lived. </p><p>  Therefore, at least some surviving wooden architectural monuments began to be brought to Kostroma from all over the region. </p><p>  An unusual museum has been opened since 1958.  Its peculiarity is that all exhibits are stored not in the walls of the building and behind glass, but directly in the open air. </p><p>  Be sure to go there with the children.  Tell them that the houses were brought here disassembled.  They were assembled on site and furnished inside as they had done before. </p><p>  The guys will learn a lot of interesting things about various household items, their purpose and even see how a real ancient loom works. </p><h2>  Terem Snegurochki </h2><p>  Of course, you can not do without the main attraction for all the kids - the house of the Snow Maiden.  Be sure to take the children there, and they will find themselves right in a fairy tale. </p><p>  The hostess herself will meet you and show her possessions.  Then you can go into the room. </p><p>  The snow maiden will tell the children about how she lives, and will show magical things.  And in another room, children will be able to listen to interesting tales that will amaze with their imagination. </p><p>  How do you like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãvisiting a real Ice Room?  This is a construction of Ural craftsmen, where children will try ice fairy drinks, and adults will also not be left out, treating themselves to the original Russian drink. </p><p>  Then you will find a fabulous program with the help of the Snow Maiden.  Brownies will offer songs, dances, jokes and jokes.  Not a single child will remain on the sidelines; everyone will find something to do. </p><p>  At the end of the evening, all guests will receive souvenirs and gifts from the Snow Maiden.  Then they will long remember the visit and interesting walks in the possessions of a fabulous guest. </p><p>  Finally, give the children a walk along the wide Volga on the ship.  In children, this usually causes a lot of emotions.  Around such beauty, there is a feeling of true freedom. </p><p>  Here is such a story of Kostroma (briefly), for children and adults this will be enough to appreciate the flavor of the ancient Russian city.  And if you want to know even more, you can always visit this glorious city again and again.  After all, there are still so many attractions! </p>
