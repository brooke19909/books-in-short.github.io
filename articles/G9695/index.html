Flagship phone models are simply excellent, but there are people in the world who cannot afford them at all.  Smartphone <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Win is designed specifically for such users.  It was announced in the spring of 2013, immediately after the Galaxy S4, to which it is very similar in appearance, in size and design.  From a distance of several meters, not everyone can distinguish them.  Of course, the filling of the device is inferior to the flagship, and there are no funny excesses, for example, a barometer or a thermometer.  But its cost is much lower. </p>

    <h2>  Briefly about the device </h2><p>  So, Samsung Galaxy Win, reviews of which are already appearing, is a classic glossy device from this series.  It is half the price of the flagship, equipped with quite decent iron, and its battery is quite capacious.  The screen resolution is good enough, the color display is excellent.  But the camera in the Samsung Galaxy Win may disappoint. </p><p>  The phone of this model may be gray or white.  The device looks very stylish and attractive.  The case is folding.  You can easily remove the back cover, it is very thin.  The battery is removed.  All connectors and buttons are standard.  The buttons on the front panel are touch-sensitive, and one mechanical, but the first without backlighting are almost invisible.  This can be easily fixed by adjusting their glow for the entire time that the screen is active.  The Samsung Galaxy Win phone weighs only 144 grams, and its official dimensions are 70.7 * 133.3 * 9.65 millimeters.  The camera protrudes a little, but not too much.  There is no LED reporting missed calls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Insides </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy Win, reviews of which have already appeared, is equipped with a mediocre processor from Qualcomm today.  The quad-core Snapdragon 200 MSM8625Q chipset with a frequency of 1.2 gigahertz each in combination with an Adreno 203 video accelerator. The RAM is also quite sufficient - one gigabyte.  In real life, such iron works quite normally, does not slow down, performance only pleases.  There are eight gigabytes of internal memory, of which five in most devices of this model are available for storing user files.  Samsung Galaxy Win, reviews of which are quite eloquent, supports memory cards up to 32 gigabytes.  In this model you will not find <span>a light sensor,</span> as well as such pleasant excesses as a thermometer and a barometer, however, there is a compass, an accelerometer, and <span>a proximity sensor.</span> </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The specification indicates the speed of mobile 3G Internet 7.2 megabits per second for reception and 5.76 for transmission.  This is considered not too high indicators, but most operators do not support high speeds, so it will be quite enough for use.  3G is available only for the first SIM card and it cannot be redirected programmatically to the second, it is only necessary to physically change their places.  This can be considered one of the shortcomings of the Samsung Galaxy Win i8552, reviews of which will show the rest of its characteristics.  The device is equipped with single-band Wi-Fi with an average sensitivity, that is, in this case there is nothing to complain about.  There is also Bluetooth 3.0.  The smartphone connects to the computer via USB only in MTP mode. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Theoretically, the Samsung Galaxy Win, reviews of which are mostly positive, has such a weak spot as the screen.  With a diagonal of as much as 4.7 inches, there is a very modest resolution of 800 * 480 pixels.  The specification says the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãused by TFT.  However, usually on such screens <span>inversion of colors</span> is visible <span>,</span> and there are not too good viewing angles.  Immediately good viewing angles, there is no fading of the picture on either side.  The screen is juicy and very nice looking.  And the permission available here is quite enough.  Of course, if the letters are very small, then their outlines seem slightly rough.  However, most users do not feel particularly strong discomfort when using the device.  The brightness of the screen is such that it is convenient to use both in the dark and in brightly lit environments. </p><p>  The five-point sensor is very decent, it responds just fine.  It is possible that a special coating is applied to the screen, since it is very slippery, and fingerprints are easily erased from it.  The manufacturer indicated that the surface is made of plastic, but it is so high-quality that it can compete with glass, and there are almost no scratches on it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Samsung Galaxy Win Operating System </h2><p>  User reviews speak about the convenience of using this device, because the Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean axis, which is quite fresh for the fall of 2013, is installed here with the addition of traditional elements from Samsung.  Installing applications is possible only in the main memory of the device, this can not be done on the memory card.  There are not many pre-installed software, but there are several applications that cannot be removed. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy Win phone, which reviews may be interesting, is equipped with a 2000 mAh battery.  According to the results of the work, it is at the S4 level, although at some points it even surpasses it. </p><h2>  Phone features </h2><p>  There are no problems with the connection, good audibility and the video in Skype works at a level.  Since the phone is dual-SIM, certain nuances of its operation are observed, however, there is an active mode in the settings, that is, it is able to receive calls to both cards even when talking. </p>

    <h2>  Photo and camcorder </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy Win, reviews of which generally speak of its high quality, is equipped with a 5 megapixel camera and video camera.  It is worth noting that at this price, most users want to see something more significant.  A camera with autofocus does not shine with quality, even in very good weather and under ideal shooting conditions, the frames are ‚Äúsoapy‚Äù.  And if you shoot in low light, then everything looks very sad.  In macro mode, the quality is much better, but this is provided that the smartphone focuses on what interests you. </p><p>  Video recording is carried out only with one resolution - 480 * 720 and 30 frames per second.  The resulting videos can be called not too high quality, while autofocus is completely absent. </p><p>  There is also a <span>front-facing</span> VGA-resolution <span>camera</span> , it is better not to say anything about its quality. </p><h2>  Navigation features </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy Win, which reviews are quite interesting, does not support GLONASS.  He catches satellites with a fairly good speed. </p><h2>  Use as <span>a video</span> and audio player </h2><p>  You should not use a pre-installed video player, since it does not show everything that you want to view, sometimes there may be no sound and so on.  You can put a good MX Player app, with which everything works just fine.  With its help, you can even watch high-definition video, but with the provided screen resolution this just does not make sense. </p><p>  If we talk about the capabilities of the audio player, then here is quite normal sound quality. </p>

    <h2>  Work with the Internet and games </h2><p>  Smartphone Samsung Galaxy Win, reviews of which are very numerous, displays the content of Internet pages quite well.  If you do not use too small fonts, it will be difficult to notice any problem points.  For reading Twitter and news, the device is quite satisfactory. </p><p>  On the one hand, this device is fast enough for the normal operation of almost all games.  On the other hand, it‚Äôs difficult to install some kind of big game due to the fact that the memory simply does not have enough space for it.  However, for most games that currently exist, there are enough resources. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  As a result of using Samsung Galaxy Win as the main smartphone, we can conclude that it is very convenient with it, and its functionality does not cause problems.  Of course, you might want a more powerful camera, as well as the ability to install software on a memory card, since the resource can be used up very quickly.  Another point is the price, which may seem slightly overpriced with such a set of characteristics.  However, it is important to note one thing: if you want to buy an A-brand with such a screen diagonal for ten thousand or less, it‚Äôs difficult, and, perhaps, it will be impossible to find a suitable option. </p><p>  Samsung Galaxy Win is aimed at users who are looking for a larger smartphone, but are not ready to buy Fly or the like, while agreeing to put up with a lower screen resolution and main camera.  This device is aimed at cautious customers who are not ready to spend too much money, but who want to try out a big diagonal in business, and who also value Samsung products.  This model is not intended to turn the heads of millions, leaving its noticeable mark in the history of gadgets, but it will be able to participate with dignity in a segment where devices of the first echelon are not presented.  The ability to use two SIM cards at the same time is a huge advantage of this smartphone, since you will always be in touch for all your contacts. </p>
