Now it is a favorite vacation spot for residents of this country, as well as citizens of neighboring countries, mainly Moldovans, Belarusians and Russians.  The secret of the popularity of the Iron Port lies in the clear Black Sea, clean air, watered by the aromas of the steppe, a favorable ecological environment and rapidly developing tourist infrastructure.  The former agricultural village is rapidly turning into a noisy and fun resort.  Every year new guest houses, pensions and mini-hotels open there.  In this essay, we will consider only one recreation center located in such a town as the Iron Port - ‚ÄúAlbatross‚Äù.  Where is it located, what is it?  What are the prices there and do they correspond to the proposed living conditions?  We will try to describe all this in our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iron Port Albatross" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/972345.jpg" width="472"></div>

    <h2>  Summer Holidays, Iron Port </h2><p>  Albatross is not the only guesthouse in this resort.  The village is spread over five kilometers along the sea, and near the golden beaches almost fifty bases rise.  Some of them were built in the 1980s - at the dawn of the resort era of the Iron Port.  Many of these buildings need renovation.  Recreation centers are not newer located on the first line.  But they have a more developed infrastructure, the living conditions in them are better.  Therefore, it is worth deciding in advance what is best for you: living in a dull room with a bedside table and mesh beds by the sea or relaxing in a comfortable room at the base with a pool, but a little away from the beach.  The second option is also encouraged by the fact that in the evenings the majority of holidaymakers go for a walk on the promenade - a pedestrian road that separates the beaches from the boarding houses of such a resort as the Iron Port.  "Albatross" is located two hundred meters from the sea.  Walking to the beach is only five to seven minutes, but calm nights await you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iron Port Base Albatross" class="if" height="304" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/972325.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  <span>The recreation center</span> is located in the center of the resort called Iron Port.  Albatross is just one hundred and fifty meters from the bus stop.  Nearby there is a food market, shops, a pharmacy.  The recreation center consists of two buildings separated by a road.  Both sites are fenced, guarded.  Initially, the guests received the only two-story building.  Around it were planted flower beds, built a playground and a bar.  In 2007, the recreation center bought another piece of land and built a new three-story building on it.  A pool and cafe soon appeared near him, and a well-groomed courtyard was laid out.  On two sites there is a guarded paid parking.  Thus, the Albatros recreation center in the Iron Port was able to attract both budget vacationers (for them there are rooms in the old building) and customers with high requirements (they are being housed in a new building).  It should be noted that the cost of living in the resort depends on the season.  The highest prices are July-August.  In June and September, when it‚Äôs still warm and comfortable to swim, the cost of housing is lower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation center albatross iron port" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/972333.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Iron Port, Albatross Base: Old Building </h2><p>  In a two-story building there are 2-, 3- and 4-bed rooms of various categories.  The budget option is represented by a block system.  It has amenities (toilet and shower) for two rooms.  But there are suites in the old building.  These double rooms have a fridge, TV and air conditioning.  Possible relaxation with three meals a day, which is served in a cafe.  What were the prices in the summer of 2015?  We give a price list for one person per day with three meals a day, which was submitted in July-August by the recreation center "Albatross" (Iron Port).  So, a two-room suite with European-quality repair, air conditioning, a refrigerator and new furniture cost 350 hryvnias.  The same conditions, but accommodation of 2 or 3 people in one room - 300 hryvnia.  Economy option with amenities in the block - 200 UAH.  At the same time, residents of the old building can use the pool located on the site across the road. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation Iron Port Albatross" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/972497.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  New building </h2><p>  This place is ideal for tourists with high leisure requirements.  And many of them come to the Iron Port.  ‚ÄúAlbatross-2‚Äù offers its guests comfortable accommodation with three meals a day in an air-conditioned cafe, where visitors are served by waiters (there is a children's menu).  From the infrastructure you can mention the pool, bar, sauna, playground, fish pond, Wi-Fi in rooms and parking.  What were the prices in July-August of this year?  They asked for 300 hryvnias for a place in a two-room suite, and 270 hryvnias for a superior.  An improved standard, which differs from the usual one by the presence of air conditioning, a TV and a refrigerator, cost the tourist already 230 hryvnias.  And the most economical option cost <span>200 hryvnias</span> in a double room and 180 UAH.  in a triple or quadruple room. </p>
