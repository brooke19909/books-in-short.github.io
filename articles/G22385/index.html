Characteristics and photos of this model will be presented in the article.  The device was announced last summer.  He is a representative of the entry-level budget segment.  The cost of the gadget starts at 2850 rubles.  Of course, the buyer should understand that for such money it is impossible to purchase a device with flagship characteristics.  Naturally, you have to sacrifice something.  But with what exactly, let's understand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade l110 specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2078981.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Before describing the characteristics of the ZTE Blade L110 (Black, Red and other color options), it is proposed to familiarize yourself with the features of the appearance.  Given that the device is sold at a critically low price, you should not rely on any delights.  For the case, the developers chose a budget plastic.  The edges of the back cover and the corners are rounded, so that the gadget lies comfortably in your hand.  The dimensions of the device are 125 √ó 64.6 √ó 10.4 mm, which is quite standard for devices with a 4-inch screen.  The only thing I wanted to focus on was the thickness.  This indicator is very large by modern standards.  By the way, we note that even smartphones with capacious batteries are much thinner. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Although the latest models of this manufacturer have a beautiful and stylish design, however, the Blade L110 is clearly not in this category.  Everything is very simple and uninteresting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade l110 black specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2078982.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Screen options </h2><p>  As mentioned above, choosing an inexpensive phone model, you have to sacrifice something.  In order to understand what exactly, there is no need to test the smartphone for hours - just look at the screen and study its characteristics.  In the ZTE Blade L110, the manufacturer installed a 4-inch display.  Lovers of small gadgets can please this, however, until they know the permission.  The maximum that the screen is capable of - 800 √ó 480 px.  But the density indicator is quite acceptable, as for such sizes - 233 ppi, so the picture will be displayed holistic, but with poor detail. </p><p>  In order to significantly reduce the cost of the phone, the manufacturer installed a TFT-matrix.  She does not have special advantages.  With viewing angles, this is not the best way, the same can be said about color rendering.  In sunny weather, interaction with the gadget will turn into torture, since it is almost impossible to parse information, you will have to either cover the screen with your hand or hide in the shade. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone zte blade l110 photo specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2078983.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  ZTE Blade L110: platform features </h2><p>  What results does this model show by performance criteria?  Definitely weak, and this is quite natural.  It is clear that a phone for 3 thousand rubles will not ‚Äúfly‚Äù in the same way as a flagship for 30 thousand rubles.  Given the budget, the developers used the 4-core Spreadtrum SC7731G processor.  The maximum of his strength is the frequency of 1200 MHz.  The Mali-400 MP2 graphics card allows you to work with graphics.  The volume of "RAM" in one gigabyte was a nice bonus, although the overall characteristics of the ZTE Blade L110 did not improve too much.  But still, the owners of the device can play undemanding games and work with applications.  Multitasking in the device is not implemented in the best way, so it is recommended not to load it especially, otherwise this will lead to short-term system hangs.  In general, Android 5.1 OS (Lollipop) works well. </p><p>  As for integrated memory, you can‚Äôt get too fast here either.  For everything about everything, the user receives only 8 GB, some of which are already taken.  You can, of course, use a USB flash drive, with which you can increase the storage to 32 GB, but you can not save music, video, photos and other similar files.  But applications are installed only in the phone‚Äôs memory, which can cause some inconvenience. </p><h2>  A few words about cameras </h2><p>  Having studied the characteristics of the cameras in the ZTE Blade L110, we can safely say that this unit is not suitable for fans of photographing.  The resolution of both the main and frontal is critically small.  It is hard to imagine why a 0.3-megapixel module is useful.  But this is exactly what is installed for the selfie camera.  There is nothing to talk about, since even during a video call, the image quality will be terrible. </p><p>  The main module is a little better.  The 2-megapixel camera allows you to get mediocre pictures.  The situation does not even save the presence of a flash. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Smartphone zte blade l110 specifications and reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2078984.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  ZTE Blade L110 Smartphone Battery: Features and Reviews </h2><p>  The weakest point of this model, according to users, is the battery.  The chemical composition of the battery is lithium polymer.  Capacity (attention!) - only 1400 mAh.  What guided the manufacturer, it is not clear, deciding to install such a weak battery.  In the comments of the owners there are a lot of angry statements about autonomy.  If you operate the phone in a gentle mode, then it will "survive" until the evening, but if you just turn on the Internet, you will have to charge the battery in 1-1.5 hours. And what‚Äôs most annoying is that in order to restore 100% charge, you need to spend about 3 hours </p>
