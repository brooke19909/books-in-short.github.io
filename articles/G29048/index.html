  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sulfuric acid and its use</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Sulfuric acid</span> is one of the most famous and common chemical compounds <strong>.</strong>  This is explained primarily by its pronounced properties.  Her formula is H2SO4.  It is a dibasic acid with a high <span>oxidation state of</span> sulfur +6. </p><p>  Under ordinary conditions, sulfuric acid is an odorless and colorless liquid with oily properties.  It is quite widespread in technology and various industries. </p><p>  At the moment, this substance is one of the most important and most common products of the chemical industry.  In nature, deposits of native sulfur are not found so often, as a rule, it is found only in compounds with other substances.  Sulfur production from various compounds, including various industrial wastes, is currently developing.  In some cases, even <span>non-ferrous metallurgy</span> gases can be adapted to produce sulfur and various compounds with it. </p><p>  The properties </p><p>  Sulfuric acid adversely affects any <span>organic compounds.</span>  She takes water from them very quickly, so that the tissues and various compounds begin to char.  100% acid is one of the strongest, while the compound does not smoke and does not destroy <span>ferrous metals.</span> </p><p>  <span>Dilute sulfuric acid</span> reacts with any metals other than lead.  In a concentrated form, it begins to oxidize many elements. </p><p>  The use of sulfuric acid </p><p>  Sulfuric acid is mainly used in the chemical industry, where it is used to produce nitrogen and <span>phosphate fertilizers,</span> including superphosphate, which is currently considered one of the most common fertilizers.  Up to several million tons of this substance are produced annually. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In metallurgy, H2SO4 is used to verify the quality of the products obtained.  When rolling steel, microcracks can occur, in order to detect them, the part is placed in a lead bath and etched with a 25% acid solution.  After that, even the smallest cracks can be seen with the naked eye. </p><p>  Before electroplating on metal, it is necessary to prepare it beforehand - to clean and degrease it.  Since sulfuric acid reacts with metals, it dissolves the thinnest layer, and with it any traces of contamination are removed.  In addition, the surface of the metal becomes rougher, which is better suited for applying nickel, chrome or copper plating. </p><p>  Sulfuric acid is used in the processing of certain ores, and a significant amount of it is also required in the oil industry, where it is mainly used for the purification of various products.  It is often used in the chemical industry, which is constantly evolving.  As a result, additional possibilities and methods of application are discovered.  This substance can be used for the production of lead-acid <span>current sources</span> - various batteries. </p><p>  Sulfuric acid production </p><p>  Sulfur and various compounds based on it are the main raw materials for acid production.  In addition, as already mentioned, the use of industrial waste for sulfur production is now developing.  In oxidative firing of sulfide ores, the exhaust gases contain SO2.  It is adapted to produce sulfuric acid.  Although in Russia the leading positions are still occupied by production based on the processing of sulfur pyrite, which is burned in furnaces.  When air is blown through the burning pyrites, vapors with a high SO2 content are formed.  To clean other impurities and hazardous vapors, electrostatic precipitators are used.  Nowadays, various methods of producing acid are actively used in production, and many of them are associated with waste processing, although the share of traditional industries is high. </p>
