A cold kingdom created from ice and rocks, and then formed and carved by time.  In the shadow of the mountain peaks, a life that seems unnatural to us has firmly established itself.  Over the years, living organisms have adapted to harsh conditions.  And everyone who lives in these mountains, whether it be a plant, a mammal or a bird, all adapted to the course and change of local natural phenomena.  However, these natural processes pass unnoticed by mountains, whose age is measured in tens or hundreds of millions of years.  And the most famous among all the peaks of the world are the Alps, where there are the highest peaks, bustling life and bewitching views.  Since ancient times, various peoples lived here, who consider the Alps to be their support and protection from the whole world.  Where are the mountains of the Alps?  Many will answer that in Europe.  But on Earth, as many as 4 mountain ranges are called the Alps, and they all differ from each other. </p>

    <p>  <em><strong>European Alps</strong></em> </p><p>  Mountains have a certain life span.  The European Alps formed during the <span>tectonic shift</span> about 35 million years ago, when the continental plates of Africa and Europe collided.  The European Alps are still growing, pushed by the internal forces of the planet.  For most of its history, mountains have remained wilderness too extreme for human life.  And yet, it was people who gave the name to these mountains when they explored the <span>globe.</span>  It doesn't matter where the mountains are: in the north or in the south, in the east or in the west - they owe their formation to the same geological processes.  At the locations of the mountains, the lines of the most active geological faults of the rock are marked.  The Alps, where just such areas are located, often present bad "gifts" in the form of avalanches or small earthquakes.  At the foot of the Alps live animals that can hardly be called alpine: European otters, lynxes, marmots, red deer and others.  A few thousand years ago, in the Alps, where there are crystal clear <span>mountain lakes</span> and rivers, huge meadows and vast forests, a new force came that learned to withstand any seasonal weather events.  These people, living for centuries at the foot of the mountains, moved upstairs with their groups, founding cities and towns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  <em><strong>Australian Alps</strong></em> </p><p>  At the other end of the world, in Australia, the Alps mountain system is also present, however, the Australian Alps are significantly different from the European: there are no huge jagged peaks, these mountains appeared 600 million years ago.  But their initial relief has undergone global changes, because for millions of years it was affected by winds and rains, as well as spring flows of meltwater.  Glaciers of mountain peaks barely reach the ground - these are the oldest of the 4 Alps in the world.  And after tens of millions of years, they remained isolated from the whole world.  Thanks to this isolation, Australia has a unique world of plants and animals.  Australian echidna, like her relative of the platypus, can only be found in Australia.  Some inhabitants of the Australian Alps amaze enough with their presence, because among the snows the parrots look ridiculous, right?  It is more usual to see them in the tropics than in the winter Australian Alps, but you can also see this here.  The most common tree in Australia is eucalyptus, it remains green regardless of location, even in the snow.  Yes, the Alps of this region is truly an amazing place on Earth! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  <em><strong>New Zealand Alps</strong></em> </p><p>  The Alps in New Zealand are the youngest of all the Alps.  They have been formed over the past 7 million years.  2.5 million years ago, the glacier shift marked the beginning of the Ice Age.  This affected the <span>southern islands of New Zealand,</span> which forced ancient species of the animal kingdom, such as Kia parrots, to adapt to new conditions.  This is an amazing bird, possessing the mind of a monkey, and the only one of the whole species that lives behind a line of snows.  The mountains live their lives here.  The landscape of New Zealand was formed by glaciers - a reminder of a world that has almost disappeared. </p>

    <p>  <em><strong>Japanese Alps</strong></em> </p><p>  The last of the Alps combine several mountain ranges on the island of Honshu in Japan.  Most of the peaks are more than 3 km high.  The mountains are amazingly picturesque, and the snow-capped peaks amaze tourists visiting this country with their splendor.  An interesting fact is that of the representatives of the fauna in these mountains the northernmost primate lives (of course, in addition to people) - mountain monkeys living among harsh snows.  They had to adapt to winters, which can last up to 6 months, and a temperature that can stay below zero for several weeks in a row. </p>

    <p>  <strong>Tourism</strong> </p><p>  Where are the Alps of Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan on the map?  The European Alps are the largest and <span>highest mountain</span> system in Western Europe, covering France, Monaco, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Slovenia.  We think it will be easy to guess the location of the rest of the Alps from their name.  The European Alps are extremely attractive for tourists, who annually number over 50 million people.  First of all, these mountains attract climbers and skiers.  For the latter, the season lasts from December to April.  Vacationers from all over the world come to the best ski resorts: Le Des Alpes, Courchevel, Meribel, Val Thorens and many others.  In addition, the Alps, where there are many winding tracks and paths, attract professional cyclists, and the landscape beauty that opens from the sky attracts paragliders.  The Australian Alps also boast ski resorts in Mount Hotham, and a bewitching picture of national parks invites hikers to take an unforgettable trip through the virgin lands of this mountain kingdom.  The New Zealand Alps provide many extreme slopes, the season here lasts from June to September.  It is an interesting fact that the legendary Lord of the Rings movie trilogy was filmed in these parts, and not in the USA, as many believe.  And finally, the mountains of Japan.  They are not particularly popular with tourists and act as pilgrimage lands for Buddhists and places for hiking for travelers who are looking for an unforgettable experience. </p>
