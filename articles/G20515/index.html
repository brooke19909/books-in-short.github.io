  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Induction hob - a creation of high technology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Do you know how to quickly prepare a delicious soup for lunch without resorting to the usual stove?  And can you touch the burner, on which something edible was brewed a few seconds ago?  No, this is not a trick and you are not in the circus, it is high technology, and you are in the kitchen.  This requires an induction hob.  It works on the principle of <span>electromagnetic induction.</span>  This principle is quite common, its effect can be seen at every step, for example, a transformer.  And at the end of the last century, non-contact current transmission came to the kitchen.  Now similar devices are produced by many manufacturers of household appliances, for example, AEG, Bosch, Hansa and others. </p><p>  Induction hob also works on the principle of a transformer.  The induction coil, which is the primary winding, is located below the surface of the stove, electric current passes through it.  The secondary winding is the dishes that are on the stove.  The bottom of the dishes is heated by induction, and at the same time the products that are in it.  In this case, the transfer of <span>thermal energy</span> is not carried out <span>,</span> which means that there are no heat losses.  In terms of efficiency, <span>an induction cooker is</span> significantly different from other types of stoves, because heating is faster, and <span>the efficiency is</span> higher and equal to 90%. </p><p>  Induction hob require the use of special dishes, which can work on the principle of ferromagnetics, that is, iron, which means that aluminum or copper pots are not suitable for it.  Heat on such an induction cooker is generated if there is cookware on it.  Such a panel itself determines the availability of dishes, and in the absence, it turns off. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Induction hob is not much different from ceramic.  Similar appearance, the same <span>touch</span> control <span>panels</span> .  And induction coils are hidden in the housing. </p><p>  The power of induction hobs is also different, from 50 to 3500 watts.  And it can change depending on the need, for which there are quite a lot of modes.  The induction cooker allows you to adjust the cooking temperature to a degree, and the temperature changes instantly.  Also, induction cookers have their own distinctive features, compared to conventional ones.  In addition to those already listed, there is a Booster function, which increases the intensity of heating by transmitting power from one burner to another by reducing the power of another.  This feature is useful when you need to cook in a large saucepan. </p><p>  In addition to useful functions, an induction hob has many advantages.  Caring for such a hob is very simple, just wipe the surface with a cloth, since the food does not burn during cooking, as the burner remains cold.  Also such a stove is very effective from a safety point of view, because there is no open fire and hot plates. </p><p>  Induction hob has its drawbacks.  Such panels must not be installed above devices with metal surfaces. </p><p>  How to connect a hob that works on the principle of induction?  The installation of a hob of this type is carried out in the same way as in the case of classic <span>heating elements,</span> but with reservations.  With all the ease of use, the induction cooker is a serious device and requires appropriate respect for itself.  During installation, the necessary conditions for the removal of hot air must be provided.  This is due to the fact that induction hobs consume decent power, and a fan is installed to cool the bottom of the <span>hob</span> .  In this regard, when installing such a surface, it is necessary to leave ventilation gaps in accordance with the instructions. </p><p>  Spending on the purchase of such a unit, you will get a reliable assistant who will improve the quality of cooking, as well as save time and energy. </p>
