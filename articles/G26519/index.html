Coat patterns with a hood</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Can't pick out your <span>outerwear?</span>  Either the style is not the same, the hood is not enough?  If you are familiar with this situation, you can safely assume that you are not alone.  Many girls are unhappy with the mass production of coats.  But what is the way out?  Well, of course, sew outerwear yourself.  Look patterns of a coat with a hood of various styles below. </p><h2>  Classic coat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/489625790716565661/"><img itemprop="image" alt="rough coat pattern" class="if uuid-2239767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2239767.jpg"></div><p>  Not always in the store you can buy the outerwear of your dreams.  Even such a seemingly trivial thing as a <span>classic coat</span> can be searched in vain all day.  And if you like a thing, it will not suit the material from which it is made.  Above is attached a pattern of a coat with a hood.  This model is a classic fitted style.  Such outerwear will look great on women of all ages.  How to make such a new thing?  First you should print a <span>pattern of a female coat</span> with a hood, and then pick up the material.  It is advisable to pay attention to dense fabrics that hold their shape well.  They are most often wear resistant.  Be sure to buy a lining fabric. </p><p>  Now you should cut out the details of the patterns.  The lining and base of the coat are sewn separately, but they have the same principle of order.  First, the shoulder seams should be tailored.  Then we sew sleeves into the open armhole and now we make side seams.  We do the same manipulations with the lining.  Now you need to sew the inside of the coat with the outside.  Separately, we grind the details of the hood, grind the lining to it, and then fasten it to the finished product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bat coat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of a female coat with a hood" class="if uuid-2239781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2239781.jpg"></div><p>  Such outerwear is suitable for ladies who want to draw attention to their slim waist.  The wide sleeves, tapering downward, and the rather voluminous base of the coat make the woman fragile.  The new thing will look good both on women of high growth, and miniature girls.  The pattern of a coat with a hood is attached above.  It can be cut both from plain fabric and from printed material.  Moreover, the pattern can be located only on some separate parts of the coat, for example, on the sleeves and the hood. </p><p>  When all the details are cut, you can proceed to grinding.  The first step is to sew the sleeves.  Stitch cuffs to them and insert the lining.  Now we pass to the basis of the product.  In the two front shelves, immediately insert pockets and make decorative overlays.  Now you need to grind off the hood.  When all parts are complete, large parts can be stapled.  Grind the front shelves from the back.  Now we sew a lining, sleeves and a hood into an almost finished product.  There is very little left - to make a belt.  Stitch the details inside out to each other, turn the resulting snake and sew up the remaining hole. </p><h2>  Baby coat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of a children's coat with a hood" class="if uuid-2239784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2239784.jpg"></div><p>  Any child grows very quickly, and parents know this.  He does not want to buy new clothes every season, so many mothers sew their own clothes for their children.  The pattern of a coat with a hood of a standard children's style is given above.  It should be scaled and printed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The fabric for the coat should be chosen dense and preferably stretched.  Do not buy 100% wool.  The child will not appreciate the prickly and choking movement of the material.  Yes, synthetics will warm worse, but such a fabric will last longer and allow the child to play freely with their peers. </p><p>  Let's start sewing.  We transfer the pattern of the children's coat with a hood to the selected material and cut out the details.  Start sewing the product with large forms.  First you need to make sleeves, then insert the side wedges into the back shelf and only then sew on the front shelf.  Now you should sew the details of the hood and attach it in place.  In the children's coat, you should grind the castle.  Then the child will be able to put on outerwear on his own. </p><h2>  Coat with a collar-hood </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coat with a hood pattern burda" class="if uuid-2239798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2239798.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the complex style, such outerwear is amazingly simple to sew.  The pattern of the coat with the hood-collar is presented above.  This outerwear should be sewn on a fur lining.  At least a collar hood.  This combination is relevant today.  The coat will combine a classic style with a custom finish.  We print out the pattern and transfer it to the selected material.  Now you can start making coats.  First we sew the sleeves, then the front and rear shelves.  Now you should insert the lining both in the main part of the product and in the collar.  We sew two pieces together.  The coat is ready.  Buttons can be sewn to it, or a belt can be made. </p><h2>  Cape Coat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/420664421429093786/"><img itemprop="image" alt="girl in a beautiful finger" class="if uuid-2239805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2239805.jpg"></div><p>  This model of outerwear resembles the main characters of famous fairy tales.  But how beautiful she looks in life.  Of course, it is difficult to walk in such a coat every day, as it is quite well blown and does not have reliable fixation in the form of a row of buttons.  However, this style will ideally complement the front-exit image.  The girl will feel in this outerwear like a fairy princess.  How to sew a coat with a hood? </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern coat with a hood collar" class="if uuid-2239811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2239811.jpg"></div><p>  The pattern from Burda (fashion magazine) is located above.  We transfer it.  Now you should cut all the details from the fabric.  You don‚Äôt have to sew much.  Lining should be stitched to the two main parts and sew them together.  If desired, patch pockets can be sewn onto the cloak. </p><h2>  Cape coat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern coat with a hood collar" class="if uuid-2239820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2239820.jpg"></div><p>  This style of outerwear is sewn by analogy with the previous one.  Only unlike the cape, the cape is fixed with buttons and it has sleeves.  We cut out the details from a suitable material and duplicate them on the lining fabric.  Now you should connect the upper part with the lower one in turn.  First we sew the lining into the base, then into the hood.  Now you need to connect these two parts together.  Cape can be decorated with fur trim. </p>
