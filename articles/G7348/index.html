Loro Park is the best zoo, dolphinarium and entertainment town in Europe.  So, at least, reviews say.  In this article we will check whether this is so.  We will tell you how to get to Loro Park, when to go there, what to bring with you and which ticket is best to buy.  True, some travelers are wondering: is it necessary to sacrifice a day spent not on the beach in order to visit the zoo and the botanical garden?  The reviews of those who visited Loro Park claim that this is one of Tenerife's main attractions.  And if you have not seen the show of parrots, killer whales, dolphins and fur seals, if you have not walked along the alleys among orchids, consider that you did not see the island.  Now consider Loro Park in more detail.  Let's start with the story of the creation of this wonderful place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tenerife Loro Park" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2016924.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How Loro Parque appeared </h2><p>  People who know the Spanish language claim that the word "loro" translates as "parrot."  But is it worth it just for the sake of these birds to visit a park on an island full of other wonderful wonders and entertainments?  The sights of the park are not limited to parrots.  Although it all started with them.  More than forty years ago, the 33-year-old manager of the German airline Wolfgang Kissling arrived in Tenerife.  And this businessman‚Äôs vacation has led to far-reaching consequences.  Kissling just fell in love with Tenerife.  He decided to invest in a safari park.  But after calculating the estimated costs, the practical German changed the original plans.  In childhood, he had a pet - budgerigar.  And Wolfgang retained his love for these savvy birds in his mature years.  He decided to arrange on a warm island, where eternal spring reigns, a parrot park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The transformation of the ornithological nursery into an empire of entertainment </h2><p>  The commercial flair told Kissling that you couldn‚Äôt lure visitors with parrots at Loro Park.  Therefore, the Aqua Viva Oceanarium soon appeared, where one could see a variety of jellyfish, sharks, stingrays and other fish, mollusks, arthropods.  In 2006, the Kissling family bought four killer whales at the Sea Ward American Zoo.  Now there are six of these cetaceans, and bottlenose dolphins and sea lions have joined them.  The show of marine mammals has become a real hallmark of Loro Park.  Then came the "Penguin Planet."  Raising Antarctic birds in Tenerife is expensive.  And the reviews assure that this is easy to verify, since the penguins created the most real natural living conditions.  And in the zoo you can see the most diverse and sometimes very rare animals, such as capybaras, cat-bears, <span>crowned cranes,</span> jaguars, crocodiles.  The garden of fanciful orchids will not leave indifferent beauty lovers.  The Kissling family is not going to stop there.  He also owns Siam Park, the largest <span>water park</span> in <span>Tenerife,</span> located in the town of Costa Adeje. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Puerto de la Cruz" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2016933.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is fully stylized to Thailand.  The Kingdom of Smiles is Wolfgang Kissling‚Äôs second love after the Canary Islands.  Siam, which, incidentally, can be visited on a two-day ticket with Loro Parque, is the greatest collection of Thai-style buildings outside of this country.  And for this, the representative of the family, Christopher Kissling, had to take permission from the <span>king of Thailand.</span>  In the "Siam Park" the visitor is greeted by a traditional Siamese village.  Reviews recommend taking the booklets offered.  They do not just give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe vast territory of the park and indicate where what is located.  The booklets also indicate the schedule of the show and their venue.  Tourists say that Loro Park needs to be dedicated all day.  The schedule of submissions is designed in such a way that all shows can be viewed in hours of work.  After seeing the sights of the park, do not rush to leave its territory.  You can buy a so-called re-ticket with a big discount.  You must use such a certificate within two weeks after purchase. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="siam park" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2017130.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Parrot show </h2><p>  These cute birds, Loro Park (Tenerife) owes its name.  And in 1972, parrots were the only inhabitants of the zoo.  Then in the Kissling collection there were only 150 birds.  Now there are four thousand of them, and they belong to 350 species.  Moreover, in ‚ÄúLoro Prake‚Äù there are also such parrots that you can no longer meet either in the wild or in other zoos.  Besides the fact that you can watch birds in huge enclosures, shows are held with them - six times a day.  During such performances, parrots amuse the audience with various tricks and well-aimed statements.  The reviews claim that visiting Baby Station will be interesting.  There you can watch how zoo ministers feed parrot chicks with spoon nectar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Parrot Park" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2016926.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Killer Whale Show </h2><p>  Performances featuring dangerous cetaceans became the hallmark of this amazing place.  Probably for their sake, forty million people visit Loro Park every year.  The killer whale show is held three times a day.  Many spectators want to take the front rows in the amphitheater, where performances are held.  But reviews warn: if you do not stock up on a waterproof raincoat, you can get it wet.  On the seats of ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù seats, it is indicated that spray is reaching here.  In addition, before the start of the show, videos from previous performances are shown, so that people in the front ranks can guess what awaits them.  There is no point in describing the killer whale show - you need to see it.  These are very dangerous animals.  Despite the fact that the trainers received special training in the USA (in similar parks in Florida and Texas), in Loro Park there were two tragic cases.  In 2007, killer whales were seriously injured, and two years later one of the trainers was killed. </p><h2>  Dolphin and Sea Lion Show </h2><p>  Bottlenose dolphins are more friendly animals and love to make contact with people.  Performances with them occur four times a day.  If you came to Loro Park (Tenerife) with a small child, select a seat in the audience in the front rows on the left (if you are facing the pool).  Reviews say that in this case, your child will be especially honored to swim in a small boat in which dolphins will be harnessed.  By the way, this is the largest pool for bottlenose dolphin shows in Europe.  You should also not deprive the attention of funny and friendly sea lions.  Shows with their participation are held five times a day.  But reviews warn: loving animals can splatter you from head to toe! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tenerife Loro Park tickets" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2016935.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Oceanarium, zoo and penguins </h2><p>  Puerto de la Cruz, in which Loro Park is located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 14 hectares, has the largest menagerie in the Canary Islands.  But this does not make it unique, but the fact that animals here regularly bring offspring.  And all because conditions are created for them that are as close to natural as possible.  Get at least penguins.  For these birds, not only a huge refrigerator with icebergs and ponds was created, but also polar day and night are provided - just like in Antarctica.  Therefore, Loro Park boasts the largest population of penguins living in the Northern Hemisphere.  But this is not the last record.  Loro Park has the longest tunnel under the shark aquarium.  More recently, in 2014, a new attraction was opened here - the jellyfish museum.  Tourists leave very enthusiastic reviews about this entertainment.  Aquariums are highlighted in different colors, and exotic jellyfish seem to be unearthly creatures.  And in ‚ÄúLoro Park‚Äù you can see rare birds in an open aviary, gorillas, marmosets, rare white jaguars and tigers.  And the avenue of orchids will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Loro park killer whale show" class="if" height="231" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2016934.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Loro Park </h2><p>  And now some practical information.  Loro Park is located in the western part of Puerto de la Cruz.  This resort is located on the northern tip of Tenerife.  If you rest in Puerto de la Cruz itself, then you will be taken for free to Loko Park by a small yellow ‚Äútrain‚Äù.  From other resorts of northern Tenerife, buses go to the city, and by car you can get to it via the TF-5 highway.  Bus number 343 travels from Los Cristianos and Las Americas to this city. Reviews advise you to get on the T-1 highway, but before reaching Puerto de la Cruz, turn onto TF-5.  Tourists urge not to trust the navigator, which sends cars across the west, since this path goes along serpentines.  Those who rest in Los Gigantes can take bus number 325. But alas, it follows the T-82 serpentine.  Loro Park is so popular as a place of family relaxation that excursions are carried there.  Such a pleasure is an order of magnitude more expensive than an independent visit, but you will be taken away from the hotel gates and taken back there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Loro tenerife park reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2016927.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tenerife, Loro Park: tickets and opening hours </h2><p>  Reviews are advised to allocate a full day to visit this amazing place.  Loro Park is open seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 6:45 p.m.  But the ticket office closes at exactly four days.  Kids up to six years old are allowed to enter the park for free.  Until the age of twelve, a preferential rate for children is valid - 22 euros.  And for people over thirteen, a visit to the park will cost 34 euros.  But this rather big at first glance price includes all the shows.  Once again, we remind you that the performances are planned so that in five hours a tourist can visit them all.  And if you have planned two days for entertainment, tourists recommend buying a Loro + Siam ticket.  It costs 58 euros for adults and 28 for children.  This ticket is valid for two days and allows you to visit in any order the two main attractions in Tenerife - Loro Park and Siam Water Park.  Did you like it and would you mind repeating it?  By purchasing one ticket, you can purchase a second at a reduced price. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What should a tourist take with him before heading to Loro Park (Tenerife)?  Reviews advise you not to worry about food.  The park has many cafes and restaurants.  There is even a market.  If your children are indifferent to animals, then for sure they can be occupied in the corner of Kinderland. </p>
