A review of it is extremely important.  Just like any other smartphone model.  After all, it is he who helps to know the capabilities of the phone, its quality and reviews.  So let's try to figure out what the Jiayu G4S is.  Review, reviews and specifications will now be presented to our attention.

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Let's start with one of the most important points.  What is it about?  About the screen of a smartphone.  After all, it is he who often helps potential buyers make their choice.  Why?  Many now love to play games on the phone.  And so you have to pick up a smartphone that will allow us not to strain our eyes very much in this lesson. </p><p>  And just that is Jiayu G4S.  A review of any model, as a rule, begins with what we are told about the display of the device.  In our case, this is a very worthy smartphone.  After all, its diagonal is 5 inches.  A great choice for any modern phone.  Just what is so necessary for everyone and everyone. </p><p>  In addition, there is another plus, which is famous for the Jiayu G4S smartphone.  The review of this model emphasizes the high resolution of the screen - 1280 by 720 pixels.  On such a display it is very convenient to watch movies in good quality.  Of course, the picture on this phone is very bright.  After all, he is able to transmit up to 16 million colors and shades.  This makes the image bright and saturated.  It is very nice to see this in the main advantages of the model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, the Jiayu G4S, a review of which is presented to our attention, allows you to see a clear picture even in clear or rainy weather.  The same goes for cloudy rainy options.  It is difficult to scratch the screen - it is equipped with reliable protection.  So this smartphone has many advantages. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Since the screen is good on the phone, you can move on.  For example, you should pay attention to such a moment as the processor.  He is responsible for the power of the device.  And of course, a good processor is needed for games.  Only with this can you hope for reliable operation of the device. </p><p>  How are we doing with the Jiayu G4S?  A review of this model indicates that this device has the most powerful processor that you can imagine.  Only a few analogs have similar power.  And the reason lies in the fact that there is a processor for 8 cores with a clock frequency of 1.7 GHz. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jiayu g4s smartphone review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/957766.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What does it mean?  To understand this from a technical point of view for a long time.  But in simple language (accessible to the average buyer), we can say that the Jiayu G4S smartphone, which we are trying to compile a review, will ensure that up to 40 powerful games will be launched simultaneously, and the model will not slow down.  That is, we repeat, the processor in the device is the most powerful.  And that is why many became interested in the Jiayu G4S.  You always want to try out the latest technical innovations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  But for a phone it‚Äôs not enough to have only a powerful processor.  To ensure high-quality operation of the device, you will also have to provide it with the so-called operating system.  That is, a program that can launch and activate all the capabilities of the smartphone to the maximum.  Phone Review Jiayu G4S can not do without mentioning this moment. </p><p>  Fortunately, things are just fine here.  Indeed, in this model, we have an operating system based on the familiar base - Android.  And the latest version is 4.2.2.  If necessary, you can easily and simply update it.  To do this, the phone has a special navigation option.  So with respect to the operating system, you can only rejoice.  The Jiayu G4S we are interested in reviewing is a very good model.  And it requires special attention.  In any case, some buyers say so. </p><h2>  RAM </h2><p>  What else can affect the performance of the equipment?  For example, the phone‚Äôs memory is considered an important moment.  True, there are two scenarios.  After all, there are also two kinds of memory.  One of them is operational.  She is responsible for the operability of the phone and its power in general.  Of course, together with the processor. </p><p>  Jiayu G4S, the review of which we are now interested in, has in this sense extremely good performance.  After all, the RAM here is 2 GB.  Yes, you can find some models with 3-4 GB, but it is better not to buy such devices.  Indeed, in them often the processor does not correspond to RAM.  And this affects the speed of the phone.  2 GB of RAM allow you to run a lot of programs and applications at the same time.  Of course, the merit of the processor here too. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  We continue to get to know the Jiayu G4S phone.  Overview, specifications and features of this device may still pleasantly surprise you.  Especially if you are looking for a really new and powerful model. </p>

    <h2>  Memory for data </h2><p>  But the second <span>type of memory</span> plays an important role when the question arises of data storage.  It is a built-in option.  That is, about where the operating system and your personal data are located.  The larger this indicator, the better it is considered. </p><p>  And without mentioning the built-in memory, you cannot praise the Jiayu G4S.  Overview, photos and specifications should be presented in full.  And therefore it is worth paying attention to the fact that initially in this device 16 GB of memory is mounted.  About 2 of them are occupied by the system.  At the disposal of the user remains approximately 14 GB. </p><p>  In general, for a modern phone, this is a very good indicator.  This space is enough to watch high-quality films, listen to music and do not forget about photos.  You can store a lot of personal documents on your phone without any problems.  And for a long time you do not have to think about cleaning the phone from the "garbage".  Only some of this space is not enough.  What to do in this situation?  Is there any way out of it? </p><h2>  Additional memory </h2><p>  Of course there is.  Since we are given the memory in the phone, we can connect additional space.  After all, everyone‚Äôs requests are completely different.  And so we will try to understand how perfect this or that phone model is before buying.  Maybe you will need much more than 14 GB of space for your own needs. </p><p>  In this case, you can connect an additional flash memory.  A review of the Jiayu G4S phone cannot but emphasize this feature.  It is worth considering that the latest innovations are trying to produce without slots for memory cards.  And this fact extremely upsets all buyers.  After all, everyone wants to make information mobile.  We changed the phone, rearranged the memory card, and all problems were resolved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jiayu g4s camera review" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/957764.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Jiayu G4S MTK6592, which we are reviewing, has the ability to connect an additional memory card up to 64 GB.  Quite normal numbers for a modern buyer.  Card format is microSD.  This is the most common model, which is the gold standard for modern telephone devices.  So you can not worry about the place on the smartphone.  If you wish, you can always increase it without any problems. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  For Jiayu G4S camera review also occupies an important place.  Modern buyers are used to the fact that the phone replaces the alarm clock, camera, navigator and other devices.  And therefore it is important to have a good camera on the phone.  If the power of programs mainly depends on the characteristics of the model, then the quality of photos and videos - only on the capabilities of our next item. </p><p>  It should be noted right away - in this smartphone there are 2 types of cameras.  The first is frontal.  It serves to take selfies, and also provides a ‚Äúpicture‚Äù for a video call.  A very convenient device that you need to be able to use.  The quality here, as a rule, is not very large - it is 3 megapixels.  But on average, on similar smartphones you can find a camera with only 2 megapixels.  This is a pretty decent indicator. </p><p>  True, the rear camera occupies a more important place.  It is located on the back of the device and serves to capture video, as well as pictures.  And it is he who depends on the image quality.  Here, too, everything is at a fairly high level.  After all, we will be offered 13 megapixels.  There is also a flash with auto mode and autofocus.  Very useful tools that will allow you to achieve maximum quality from the images we receive. </p><h2>  Sim cards </h2><p>  As you can see, the Jiayu G4S is pretty decent.  A review in Russian of this model is just what you need to fully understand the features of the phone.  Pay attention to such a feature as the number of possible use of rooms.  For many business and busy people this factor is extremely important.  Especially when you constantly have to combine personal life and work.  It is more convenient in this case to have separate numbers for each case. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jiayu g4s feature review" class="if" height="476" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/957763.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Fortunately, in our smartphone today there is support for 2 SIM cards at once.  And this small advantage attracts the attention of many.  Of course, the manufacturer promises high-quality and long work with two numbers.  Even if you have them from different operators.  But is it really so? </p><p>  According to many buyers, yes.  True, minor malfunctions and malfunctions can sometimes occur.  No one is safe from this.  And similar problems appear even on the best phones.  But with Jiayu G4S they are not as frequent as you might imagine.  There is no need to worry about using SIM cards. </p><p>  Unless it is worth paying attention to the size of the "sims".  After all, now you can insert mini-SIM and micro-SIM into this phone.  This allows you to make the smartphone almost universal. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Communication is another crucial point.  After all, initially the phones were created just so that people can communicate with each other at the right time.  And so now there are so many diverse networks that affect signal quality. </p><p>  Jiayu G4S supports 2G and 3G connectivity.  Just these two types of communication are often used by operators.  In addition, there is GPRS.  And, of course, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.  Using these options, you can use the wireless Internet, as well as transfer data to other phones wirelessly.  But the new and popular 4G network is not yet available.  But so far only some smartphone models can boast of it. </p><h2>  Additional functions </h2><p>  Phone Review Jiayu G4S Advanced Black is nearing its end.  And now you can pay attention to additional features that are available to all buyers "by default."  Sometimes this particular functionality is able to force us to abandon the model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jiayu g4s review reviews" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/957762.jpg" width="463"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The Jiayu G4S has a compass, a navigator, and a flashlight.  It is also worth noting that there is an alarm clock and a task scheduler, a gyroscope, a motion and proximity sensor, an accelerometer, as well as voice control.  All this is not so important, but very useful and interesting. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Since we have a modern smartphone, then it should work at the highest level.  The phone‚Äôs operating time is very important.  After all, it is with this that many buyers are tormented.  If the battery runs out quickly, then all meaning in buying it disappears. </p><p>  Fortunately, with our device in this regard, everything is in order.  After all, it is equipped with a removable battery that can operate in standby mode for 2 months.  If you talk on it - 3 weeks, and with active use - about 3-4 days.  These are quite good indicators that are found in many modern smartphone models. </p><h2>  Quality </h2><p>  So, now it‚Äôs worth understanding what customers think about the quality of this smartphone.  Jiayu G4S, according to many customers, really has good features.  And not only them.  Indeed, now most potential buyers are paying attention to the stability of the device to various circumstances. </p><p>  For example, to the falls.  You can break this model, but you should try.  After all, it is equipped with reliable protection.  And it provides unsurpassed quality of the device.  Just what is so necessary for modern society. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  So, we have learned what Jiayu G4S is.  But is it worth it to buy?  To be honest, you need to pay attention to this option.  Especially when you need a multifunctional gadget to make calls.  He will definitely be able to suit you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jiayu g4s phone review" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/957761.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  True, there is such a "charm" of about 20 thousand rubles.  In principle, the price is quite high.  But if it is not so important, then it is really worth trying the Jiayu G4S in action.  Otherwise, look for cheaper counterparts. </p>
