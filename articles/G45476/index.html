    <h2>  Biography of Vasilevsky Alexander (briefly) </h2><p>  The birthplace of the future Soviet military leader was s.  New Golchikha.  Vasilevsky himself believed that he was born on September 17 (according to the old style) - on the same day as his mother.  He was the fourth of eight children.  In 1897 the family moved to the village.  Novopokrovskoe.  Here, Vasilevsky's father began his service as a priest in the Ascension Church.  After a while, Alexander entered the parish school.  In 1909, after graduating from the Kinesham Theological School, he entered the Kostroma Seminary.  The diploma allowed him to continue his studies at a secular educational institution.  In the same year, Vasilevsky took part in a strike by seminarians who opposed the ban on authorities from entering institutions and universities.  For this he was expelled from Kostroma.  However, a few months later he returned to the seminary, after the demands of the rebels were partially satisfied. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marshals of victory Vasilevsky" class="if" height="253" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1264596.jpg" width="207"></div>

However, the war radically changed his plans.  Before the last class at the seminary, he and several of his classmates passed exams externally.  In February, he entered the Alekseevsk military school.  After completing an accelerated four-month course, Vasilevsky went as ensign to the front.  From June to September, he stayed in several spare parts.  As a result, he was transferred to the South-Western Front, where he was in the position of a half-company commander at the 409th Novokhopersky regiment.  In the spring of 1916 he was awarded the rank of commander.  After a while, his company was recognized as the best in the regiment.  In this title, Vasilevsky took part in the <span>Brusilovsky breakthrough</span> in May 1916. Subsequently, he received the post of staff captain.  During his stay in Romania, in Adjud-Nou, Vasilevsky learns about the beginning of the October Revolution.  In 1917, having decided to leave the service, he quit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="biography of vasilevsky alexander briefly" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1264591.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <h2>  Civil War </h2><p>  At the end of December 1917, while at home, Alexander learns that he was elected commander of the 409th Regiment.  At that time, the unit belonged to the Romanian front, commanded by the gene.  Shcherbachev.  The latter supported the Central Rada, which proclaimed the independence of Ukraine from the newly arrived Soviets.  The military department recommended that Alexander not go to the regiment.  Following this advice, until June 1918 he stayed with his parents and was engaged in agriculture.  Since September 1918, Vasilevsky taught in elementary schools in the villages of Podyakovlev and Verkhovye in the Tula province.  In the spring of the following year, he was drafted into the ranks of the Red Army in the 4th reserve battalion.  In May, he was sent to the Stupinsky volost as a commander of a detachment of 100 people.  His tasks included the implementation of food reconnaissance and the fight against gangs.  In 1919, in the summer, the battalion was transferred to Tula.  Here formed the 1st Infantry Division in anticipation of the approach of the gene troops.  Denikin and the Southern Front.  Vasilevsky was appointed commander of the company first, and then the battalion.  From the beginning of October, the leadership of the 5th Rifle Division, which is located in the sector of the fortified area on the southwest side of Tula, has been transferred to him.  However, to participate in the hostilities did not happen, because the Southern Front stopped at Kromy and Orel in late October.  In December, the division was aimed at fighting the invaders.  At the request of Vasilevsky, he is appointed assistant commander.  As part of the 15th army, he participates in battles with Poland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marshal A.M.

But Stalin and Antonov had to go to the <span>Yalta Conference.</span>  In this regard, Vasilevsky was recalled from the Baltic.  During a conversation with Stalin on the night of February 18, he asked him to relieve him of his duties as chief of the General Staff, since he spent most of his time at the front.  In the afternoon, news came of the death of Chernyakhovsky, who commanded the 3rd Belorussian Front.  Stalin appoints Vasilevsky commander.  In this position, he led the <span>Koenigsberg operation.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marshals of victory Vasilevsky" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1264594.jpg" width="238"></div>
