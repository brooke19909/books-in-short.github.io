Iberostar Tainos 4 *</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Even despite the costly and lengthy flight, a vacation in Cuba continues to gain popularity among tourists from Russia.  At the same time, they are interested not only in sunny Havana, but also beach resorts, for example, Varadero.  Travelers prefer to stay in trusted hotels, which are part of large hotel chains.  For example, they consider the Iberostar Tainos complex in Cuba a good accommodation option.  It is described in detail in our article. </p><h2>  Where is this hotel located? </h2><p>  Varadero is a respectable beach resort in Cuba.  Getting to this island is not easy and not cheap.  The fact is that the flight Moscow - Cuba takes at least 15 hours if you fly directly from the Russian capital to Havana.  In Varadero, you can only get with transfers in European countries.  Travel time is about 22 hours.  The hotel itself is 150 km from Havana.  Therefore, tourists arriving there will have to spend a few more hours on the road to the vacation spot.  Varadero Airport is 40 km from the hotel, which means that the journey to it will take about 1-2 hours. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="23.1880944" data-lng="-81.17680559999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/8/1/7/4817.png"></div><p>  The hotel itself, according to guests, has a rather favorable location.  It is built on the first line of the sea, that is, right on the coast.  On the other side of the complex is a motor road, but no noise is heard from it, as the hotel is surrounded by a lush tropical garden.  The central part of Varadero is 13 km away.  Other beachfront hotels are nearby, and a dolphinarium and golf course are nearby.  Unfortunately, there are no other infrastructure facilities nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Important information for future guests </h2><p>  The Iberostar Tainos complex belongs to the large hotel chain of the same name that organizes leisure not only in Cuba, but also in other famous resorts.
