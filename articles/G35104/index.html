Manufacturers are constantly releasing more and more smartphones, without ceasing to surprise us.  A great surprise was made by the domestic company Explay, releasing a smartphone under the name Neo.  Naturally, this is not the protagonist of the cult film "The Matrix", but a gadget that has all the necessary functions for a modern user. </p>

    <p>  Let‚Äôs take a look at the general feedback from users who have already tested Expley Neo and are ready to share their impressions. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Before considering the practicality of the gadget, of course, you need to know its technical characteristics.  They look as follows. </p><ul><li>  Operating System: Android version 4.2.2. </li><li>  Processor: Quad-core MTK 6582, 4 cores, 1.3 GHz. </li><li>  Video: Mali-400, single core. </li><li>  Memory: 16 GB </li><li>  RAM: 1 GB. </li><li>  Display: 5 inches, 720x1280 pixels, IPS, capacitive sensor, multi-touch. </li><li>  Camera: 13 MP main, flash, Full HD video recording, 5 MP front camera. </li><li>  Network: GPS, Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n /, Bluetooth 4.0. </li><li>  Battery: 2000 mAh. </li><li>  Dimensions: 134 x 71.4 x 7.7 mm. </li><li>  Weight: 131 g. </li><li>  Average cost: 8,000 rubles. </li></ul><h2>  Reviews about the configuration </h2><p>  Having bought a smartphone, you will receive it in a nondescript cardboard box, which is made of recycled paper.

    <p>  Opening the lid, you can immediately see a picture that is slightly reminiscent of the Tetris game.  Here lies one large square in which the smartphone itself is located, and several small ones.  They contain a charger, a headset, a warranty, a user manual and a USB cable.  Separately, a special key is located in the bag, with which they extract micro-SIM from Explay Neo.  User reviews about the headphones are mixed.  Some complain about the inconvenience and poor sound, while the second, on the contrary, praise them.  However, this is all for everybody. </p><p>  As for the appearance and convenience of the location of the function buttons, here all users gave good marks.  Especially admired smartphone Explay Neo received reviews from the beautiful half of humanity.  It's all about thoughtful design, subtlety and elegance.  In size, it is not very large, and small weight does not bother a gentle female hand.  But this does not mean that this gadget is not suitable for men.  It's just that they are not so violently accepting beauty and are more looking at the capabilities of the smartphone. </p><h2>  Function Key Location </h2>

Below it are the touch buttons "Menu", "Home" and "Back".  Users note their low backlight, which initially leads to inconvenience.  But over time, you can get used to their location.  The upper part, except for the earpiece and the <span>front camera,</span> has nothing more. </li><li>  The back panel is non-removable, on top it has a camera with a flash, and on the bottom there is a call speaker and company logo. </li><li>  The upper rib has only a headphone input. </li><li>  The bottom end has a microphone and an output for micro-USB. </li><li>  The right end has buttons on / off and a double ‚Äúrocker‚Äù to adjust the volume.  Nothing is located on the left. </li></ul><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  In general, regarding the design of the phone, the Explay Neo reviews are normal.  But users complain about the lack of <span>oleophobic coating</span> (the screen is quickly covered with fingerprints), a slightly inconvenient button layout with which it locks and turns on (located under the ‚Äúrocker‚Äù) and the slippery plastic of which the case is made. </p><h2>  Feature and Performance Reviews </h2><p>  If women pay more attention to appearance, then the filling is already a man‚Äôs horse.  So let's look at what Explay Neo can do. </p>

    <p>  This gadget works under the control of the well-known <span>Android operating system</span> version 4.2.2.  It has not undergone major changes and is not particularly different from a clean OS.  The lack of Play Market upsets users a bit.  But it can be easily installed, so this can be considered a minus.  But it pleases the presence of a complete "stuffing" of applications from Yandex. </p><p>  Explay Neo cannot boast of standard office software.  Reviews about him didn‚Äôt get worse, because there are other ‚Äúwired-in‚Äù applications that are no less useful.  Especially touching is the presence of an application with all the series of the cartoon "Masha and the Bear." </p><p>  As for productivity and speed, everything here is a little sad.  I would like to get something more than indicators of the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù device from a gadget with a five-inch bright screen and a beautiful design.  But nevertheless, they are quite enough for normal comfortable work with moderate applications. </p><p>  After testing with various benchmarks, you can see that they all give a pretty good mark.  Explay Neo Black received good reviews from demanding users.  They noted that this gadget is very productive at its cost.  By the way, the price of sellers is gradually decreasing every month and may soon reach the limit of 6.5 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Cameras and their overview </h2><p>  But the special admiration of users appears after they have tested the camera.  And this is justified, because here the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãof very high quality and has a separation capacity of 18 megapixels.  All photos are obtained in high quality, the flash allows you to shoot at night, the color rendering is as lively as possible, even there is the ability to shoot video in Full HD resolution.  Nobody expected such a "mincemeat" from an ordinary domestic producer.  Smartphone Explay Neo black reviews about the camera has only the best.  Some users boldly say that it is much better here than the flagships of well-known manufacturers.  Well, the price at the same time greatly pleased everyone. </p><p>  As for the front camera, everything here is a bit simpler.  She has 5 megapixels.  Photos and videos from her are normal, and there is plenty of such a camera for video communication. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Judging by what Explay Neo has reviews, we can say that the greatest camera for which this smartphone is worth buying is an excellent camera.  The display is bright and conveys the most natural image.  It is also worth noting the excellent work of designers. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, the absence of an oleophobic coating, the rather slippery material of which the body is made, and the lack of normal illumination of the front functional touch keys are clearly highlighted.  But just look at the cost of this gadget so that all its cons immediately become invisible. </p>
