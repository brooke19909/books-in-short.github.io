They can be made for decorative small vases or decorate them with pots of the topiary type.  This flower can be made in many ways, the petals can be narrow and convex, and the leaves can be oval and patterned.  Let's start with a simple way. </p><h2>  <span>Flowers from beads:</span> single-layer chrysanthemums </h2><p>  If you look at natural flowers, you will see many varieties.  They can be large terry, small bushy and single-layer, something <span>similar to chamomiles.</span>  <span>Flowers</span> are monochromatic (white, red, yellow, crimson, pink, orange, green) or two-tone.  Let's start making chrysanthemums with simple varieties. </p><p>  To make flowers you will need: </p><ul><li>  white, yellow and green beads; </li><li>  wire; </li><li>  green paper or thread; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  plastic bottle. </li></ul><p>  Make 7 shamrocks from white beads.  To do this, collect 35 beads on a wire 25 centimeters long, cross the ends through the last bead.  Next, on the same wire, make the same petal, where there will be 6 more beads.  In the same way, make the third petal, which is a copy of the first.  Twist the ends of the wire. </p><p>  Do the middle of the flower as a mimosa: string 5 yellow beads on a wire and twist a loop.  Do such plexuses 5-6.  Then squeeze them into a lump and twist the ends. </p><h2>  Chrysanthemum assembly </h2><p>  We continue to make chrysanthemums from beads.  Now make a 9-sheet sepal from green beads.  Make it by analogy with shamrocks, only the number of beads on all the petals will be the same - 26 pieces.  It is better if you take a long wire and immediately make nine petals on it, connect it in a circle and twist the ends of the wire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chrysanthemum beads" class="if" height="478" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/385126.jpg" width="362"></div>

In it you need to make seven holes at the edges and in the middle one hole.  Insert the petal blanks into them.  Pass the sepals from below and only then insert the core. </p><p>  Now make some leaflets.  The easiest way is to string the beads on the wire so that a petal of the desired length is obtained.  Next, pass the end of the wire through the bead from below, collect the beads on it and again draw the wire through the top bead, that is, fill the petal with beads.  Decorate the trunk with corrugated paper or green threads.  Attach the leaves in the right place. </p><h2>  Weaving Chrysanthemum from beads of 10 tiers </h2>

For the first tier, take a 40-cm wire and make five petals of 14 beads.  For the second tier on a 50-centimeter wire, you also make 5 petals of 28 beads.  The third tier is made of 70-centimeter wire and 34 beads.  All you need to weave 7 loops.

    <p>  The next 4 tiers are made up of thin petals.  To do this, string 21 beads onto a 75-centimeter wire.  Pull the other end of the wire through 20 beads and twist.  You make 9 such petals for each tier.  By analogy, make of 90-centimeter wire and 24 beads of 9 petals for another three tiers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now insert the tiers into each other and twist the wire.  Near the core, the petals are bent inward, the outer ones are slightly bent.  Then weave leaves with <span>parallel weaving.</span>  The sheet consists of two symmetrical parts.  First weave one half, then the wire is pulled through the rows and the second part is created. </p><h2>  Curved sheet layout </h2><p>  The sheet consists of 24 rows.  Pull the wire through all the beads in a row: </p><ul><li>  1st row: 1 bead. </li><li>  <span>2-3rd p.: 2</span> beads. </li><li>  4-5th p.: 3 pieces. </li><li>  6th row: 4 beads. </li><li>  7th p.: 5 pieces. </li><li>  8th p.: 7 beads.

Wind the trunk with green paper.  By analogy, create a whole bunch of flowers.  Such bead chrysanthemums can be made two-tone.  To do this, divide the beads into three parts and string the beads of a different color in the middle. </p><h2>  Simple weaving of unusual flowers </h2><p>  Take the beads of different colors and make several tiers in a looped way.  For the middle, on a wire 60 centimeters long, make 18 loops, each of which has 13 beads.  Next, twist them into a roll and wind the ends of the wire around the stem of the flower.  It can be a wand or a thick wire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bead chrysanthemum weaving" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/388058.jpg?1399130117366"></div>

    <p>  The second tier is made of wire 70 centimeters long.  It is necessary to weave 20 loops, in each of which there will be 21 beads.  The third tier will consist of 32 loops, where there will be 23 beads in the loop.  Gently screw these petals to the core. </p><p>  Next, go to the main petals.  You need to make 30 loops of 31 beads.  In the next tier there should be 15 loops of 37 pieces, and in the last row - also 15 loops of 43 beads.  Now collect all the petals into a flower, wrapping the ends of the wire around the stem. </p><p>  Next, make leaves, as in the first method, filling the space of the petal.  Attach 8 sheets of sepals to the flower.  Wrap the stem with green paper and fasten two more leaves.  The result was a kind of aster or chrysanthemum from beads. </p><h2>  A few more options for weaving petals and leaves </h2><p>  In the above examples, the petals are woven in a looped way, while in each tier the amount of beads per 4-6 pieces is added.  Also, <span>the chrysanthemum flower</span> is collected from loops and single sets of beads.  But you can make two more options for the petals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chrysanthemum bead flowers" class="if" height="202" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/385131.jpg" width="200"></div>

    <p>  In the first version, the petals are made as if with stamens.  Put three beads on the wire and cross the ends through the last two beads.  Next, collect two pieces of beads two more rows.  Then connect the ends of the wire in one bead.  Twist the ends of the centimeter by 1.5-2 and at one end of the wire pass one bead, twist also 2 cm. The result is a petal with a branch. </p><p>  In the second case, make the petals of chrysanthemum from beads solid.  Type 5 beads onto the wire.  Pass one end through three beads.  Next, weave three more beads of three rows each.  Then there are 3 rows of two beads.  Finish the petal with one bead, twist the ends. </p><p>  To make unusual leaves, go to French weaving, that is, you will screw other segments to the main wire and connect in the right places.  Take a 50-centimeter wire and screw another segment to its end.  Collect 20 beads on it and make a petal.  At the second end, also pick up the same amount of beads and make a petal.  It turns out a leaf with a vein.  Next, screw the pieces of wire and make such arcs two more times on each side. </p><p>  Then step back a little from the base and make a leaf with a vein on the right side, only pass each arc through the beads of the first leaf.  Such a leaflet is made on the left side.  Shamrocks for one flower need about four. </p><p>  It turns out elegant chrysanthemum from beads.  The layout of the petals and leaves is simple and understandable even to beginners.  Just vary the different ways - and get unusual flowers! </p>
