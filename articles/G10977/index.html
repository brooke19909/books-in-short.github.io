  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Granite. Description and Application</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Quite often, such materials as granite are used in the construction of buildings.  The description of its physical properties quite adequately answers the question of why this breed is used so widely.  In addition, granite is great for decorative flooring, stairs.  Due to its higher resistance to destruction and abrasion compared to marble, as well as a much more affordable price, this material has gained unprecedented popularity.  Although even more often it is used to create monuments, including for ritual purposes.  After all, the stone is well polished to a mirror shine, has several color options and looks quite noble.  But what is granite inherently?  Due to what this breed shows such amazing indicators? </p><p>  The unique properties of granite are explained by its origin.  This rock is formed from magma - mineral particles heated to a semi-liquid state.  The <span>composition of granite</span> includes quartz, biotite, potassium feldspar, muscovite, as well as plagioclase.  This breed is widespread in the earth's crust of any of the continents.  To extract granite is also not a particular problem. </p><p>  Despite the massive structure, the overall <span>appearance of</span> this breed is quite aesthetic.  Due to this, granite has become almost indispensable in finishing and facade works.  In addition, even great creators do not neglect such material, creating real works of art from rough stone blocks.  The name of the breed itself comes from the Latin word "granum" ("grain").  If you have ever seen granite (the description available in any source also focuses on this feature) in real life, you probably noticed its unusual structure.  Fine crystalline inclusions or granules vary in color and are so tightly adhered to each other that it is practically impossible to separate them.  Previously, almost any rock with such a structure was called granite.  However, then a thorough analysis of all components made it possible to identify materials that are only analogues or similarities. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What properties does granite have?  The description of this mineral highlights several particularly important qualities: </p><ul><li>  strength; </li><li>  wear resistance; </li><li>  durability; </li><li>  environmental friendliness; </li><li>  water tightness; </li><li>  excellent combination with textures of other origin (wood, ceramics, metals, etc.); </li><li>  rich assortment of textures; </li><li>  extensive palette of shades. </li></ul><p>  Granite (the description of this stone as well as possible characterizes its exclusively positive sides) is material ‚Äúfor centuries‚Äù.  All products created from this mineral are perfectly preserved for many hundreds of years without losing their appearance.  Most often we can see gray granite.  However, its color palette also contains many other shades.  For example, red, orange, pink, gray with a blue tint and even bluish green. </p><p>  This stone, like any other purely natural material, is able to influence the moral and physical condition of a person.  Finishing from granite can relieve nervous tension, anxiety, and also fill the house with comfort and coziness. </p><p>  Thanks to the mica, which is part of the breed, it is able to literally sparkle with brand new bright colors after polishing.  Even the <span>interior decoration of a</span> room interior will become richer and more sensual if you add a few details from brilliant granite to it.  And if you leave the stone its natural roughness, then it will perfectly emphasize the originality of the room. </p><p>  <span>The properties of granite</span> are such that some designers prefer this breed even when creating furniture.  For example, the covers of kitchen and <span>writing tables</span> made of granular stone will last their owners incredibly long.  In addition, such furniture can not be afraid to scratch or break. </p>
