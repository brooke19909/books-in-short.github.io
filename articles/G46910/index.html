    <h2>  VIP number </h2><p>  This is ideal for a true connoisseur of beauty.  Unique furniture, as if created for the palace chambers, fresh flowers, a beautiful bedroom and living room - all this fascinates at first sight.  Fruits and drinks are served in the room, and the windows offer panoramic lake views.  Cribs and high chairs are available upon request.  But the most important thing is the huge jacuzzi in the bathroom.  Price - from 4600 per day. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Of course, how many people, so many opinions.  Therefore, analyzing the reviews, we tried to make an average picture.  It will be very useful for those who plan to visit the Christie Hotel (Mirny) next year.  Reviews in general are very good, this can be said, looking a little ahead.  And the first thing that stands out is the amazing sandy beach and a completely modern hotel. </p><p>  The hotel is located near the beach, which is very convenient, especially if you have small children.  But if it is raining, then you have to think what to do with yourself.  The nearest civilization is the <span>village of Mirny.</span>  Relatively close, but a one-way ticket will cost 200 rubles.  It is very convenient that there is a free shuttle to Evpatoria, it is very beautiful and interesting there. </p><p>  In general, the hotel looks very good.  Refined furniture, decorative lamps - all this creates a certain mood.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rooms is simply huge, you can play catch-up or hide and seek.  The furniture is very good and expensive, the repair was obviously done recently.  However, among the minuses, guests note good audibility, which is not so pleasant, given the large number of children in the hotel.  In general, the rest is worth the money spent, so without hesitation, go to the Crimea. </p>
