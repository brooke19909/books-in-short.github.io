City beaches of Chelyabinsk</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Chelyabinsk is a beautiful big city, which is located in the hollow of the Ural Mountains.  Being in Asia, but being Russian, this settlement absorbed two different cultures and related traditions, beliefs, and customs.  The breath of absolutely opposite worlds - western and eastern - is also reflected in architecture, tourist features, in the way of life of ordinary people.  Another feature of the city is its water environment: there is the <span>Shershnevskoe reservoir,</span> the Miass river, the lakes Pervoe, Smolino and Sineglazovo.  Therefore, the city beaches of Chelyabinsk are found at almost every step. </p><h2>  sunny Beach </h2><p>  This is one of the largest beaches in the city, located on Lake Smolino.  Roomy and voluminous, he is warmly ready to accept 3 thousand vacationers.  It occupies a <span>recreation area of</span> as much as 12 thousand square meters, which are conditionally divided into four sectors: general, children‚Äôs, sports and cafes. </p>

This place is intended for tanning young couples and senior citizens.  If you have kids, then it is better to go to the children's zone, since there are many attractions that can entertain noisy boys and girls: slides, swings, trampolines and cafes for the smallest.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  People leading an active lifestyle will be interested in the sports part of the beach.  There are sports fields for volleyball, badminton and futsal.  Specialists of the massage room and the gym will also provide their services.  There is an aerobic fitness area and massage room.  The sandy and gently sloping beach of Sunny Beach (Chelyabinsk) offers visitors a good vacation at a relatively low price. </p><h2>  Sports </h2><p>  There are many other interesting places to relax on <span>Smolino Lake</span> : swimming areas on Magnitogorskaya and Yampolskaya Streets, as well as Sunrise Beach.  Chelyabinsk also boasts thematic territories.  For example, recently a special recreation area was opened on the lake for athletes.  It is located in the Leninsky district near Vasilevskaya street.  The beach has no name, but judging by its orientation, it is called "Sports".  Special areas for fitness and aerobics, various sports games attract people who do not forget about their figure and health for a second.  There is also an excellent tennis court and the largest zone in the Russian Federation for WorkOut - the so-called yard gymnastics.  Athletes train on horizontal bars, parallel bars or simply on the floor, focusing on the development of endurance and the ability to work with your own weight. </p>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beach City </h2><p>  So the locals simply call the recreation area on the Shershnevsky reservoir.  She is the most popular among Chelyabinsk citizens, and therefore became for them "City".  The beach is free, which explains the bulk of vacationers on any, even weekday.  Of course, there are no sun loungers and water slides here, but the sandy beach and the relaxed atmosphere attract lovers of summer holidays. </p>

If you get bored of wallowing in the sand, you can hire a catamaran and ride on the surface of the water.  In the recreation area there is a cafe where they cook delicious barbecue, baked <span>vegetables on the grill.</span>  Nearby is a forest belt, in the shade of which you can relax from the scorching summer sun.

    <p>  Chelyabinsk beaches of this type are usually intended for students and senior citizens who want to save a little on entrance fees.  Couples with children are not recommended to go here, as the infrastructure is not designed for toddlers.  The rest of the beach is in no way inferior to other swimming areas, so it remains a favorite vacation spot for many Chelyabinsk residents. </p><h2>  West beach </h2><p>  So it was called because of its location on the western shore of the Shershnevsky reservoir.  Some people call it Caspian, emphasizing that the territory is similar to the coast of the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe same name.  The beach is divided into two parts: a VIP zone, for people who do not regret paying 150 rubles for entry, and a regular sector, which costs half the price, but does not differ much from the first. </p><p>  If you arrived by car, then it has a special parking.  The presence of umbrellas, sunbeds and bathrooms also pleases visitors.  There are several <span>water slides here, the</span> choice is small, but it brings variety to the leisure of vacationers.  Ways of entertainment are boats, catamarans, <span>jet skis</span> for rent, which cut through the water surface of the reservoir.  By the way, locals simply call it Hornets, as it is located near the village under the same name.  Getting here, like other beaches in Chelyabinsk, is easy.  Regular buses and fixed-route taxis run regularly and without delay. </p><h2>  White sail </h2><p>  Another recreation area that the Hornets (Chelyabinsk) can boast of.  The beach is paid, like most recreation areas in this city.  120 rubles are taken from a person at the entrance.  To put the car on which you arrived, you have to pay another 50 rubles on top.  But the parking lot is constantly guarded: you can not worry that the car was stolen or damaged by hooligans.  For children and pensioners, discounts are provided at the entrance - 50 percent.  For preschoolers, you don‚Äôt have to pay. </p>

Young children can frolic in a special area with swings and inflatable figures, many water slides are open for schoolchildren.  Jet skis and catamarans work for the most adults.  There are special sunbeds and changing cabins.

    <p>  In addition, there are other beaches on the Hornets.  For example, on Kaliningradskaya Street (stop "Energy College") or on the side street Bolshoy Poselok (stop "Red Bridge"). </p><h2>  Holidays on the lakes Pervoe and Sineglazovo </h2><p>  People also come here to spend a weekend or vacation.  There are relaxation areas on Lake Pervy.  Most of them belong to private owners, so entry is usually paid.  Golden sand, cool waves and the presence of attractions attract people from the eastern part of the city, as the lake is located next to this microdistrict.  The beaches of Chelyabinsk on Lake Pervy are always filled with a mass of visitors who are lying on deck chairs, drinking cocktails in bars and having fun on water slides. </p>

Wetlands, thickets of reeds on the banks do not contribute to swimming.  But there are a lot of fish.  Therefore, if bathing and sunbathing do not appeal to you, and fishing is exactly what you need to relax your body and soul, Lake Sineglazovo is just for you.  Wonderful nature and calm atmosphere will give strength and relieve fatigue.  Lakes, like other water bodies of the city, are under constant control of the local sanitary and epidemiological station.

    <h2>  Careers </h2><p>  The beaches of Chelyabinsk are not only lakes and reservoirs.  They are also located on the banks of quarries, in which local residents do not shun bathing.  There is nothing special about this, since you do not need to pay for admission: he came, chose a convenient place and sunbathe to his health. </p><p>  One of the most popular is the Emerald quarry, which is located near the Shershnevsky reservoir.  When the weather is warm and warm, the people, like flies, are clinging to its shores.  There is clean water, only the territory is not equipped, so bathers jump into the water from the cliffs.  Student - another Chelyabinsk quarry.  The water in it is dirty, as a result, people are not quite willing to go to these places.  The largest quarry in the city, Goluboy, instead collects the sold-outs of vacationers, as it is more or less adapted for those who want to bask in the sun. </p>

The main thing is that the rest should not be hazardous to health, and also bring pleasure and enjoyment from the summer days.
