The technique is very similar to another ancient art - origami.  Initially, this is a piece of paper in the form of a square, from which the figure was created.  The square for the inhabitants of the East is a symbol of the earth, which has firmness, indestructibility and constancy.  Kusudama differs from origami in cutting and gluing paper.  There are different versions of the origin of this name.  One at a time, the name consists of the words "kusuri", translated from Japanese - "medicine", and "tama" - "ball".  It turns out a "medicinal ball".  It was believed that medicinal herbs were placed in this ball and hung over the patient‚Äôs bed.  Few people realize that the first Kusudamas were square.  According to another version, ‚Äúkusu‚Äù from Japanese means ‚Äúcamphor‚Äù and ‚Äúkusunoki‚Äù is a <span>camphor tree.</span>  The fruits of this tree are in the shape of a ball.  In both cases, the contents of the ball were used as a therapeutic agent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="easy kusudama" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14511/331011.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What does it consist of? </h2><p>  Now Kusudama can also be attributed to a medical lesson: while working with paper, calm comes, children develop hand motility.  You can pick up any easy kusudam for children, the schemes of which are really not only simple in execution, but also very exciting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kusudama lungs" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14511/331044.jpg" width="340"></div><br>  So what does kusudama consist of?  Usually these are square sheets of paper glued together.

Some also use fabric and everything imagination can allow: sheets of glossy magazines, wallpapers, and even plastic.  But professionals are still advised to start with plain paper.  Later it will be possible to use paper for making origami.  The glue is also the most ordinary (PVA), the main thing is that it does not seize instantly and leave no traces on paper.  There are no requirements for the selection of scissors. </p><h2>  Easy options </h2><p>  Before you start creating kusudama, it is best to practice the manufacture of basic modules.  In principle, kusudamas are light in their manufacture; everyone can master this process.  Kusudama helps to develop perseverance well.  The easiest Kusudama is the basic door module.  It consists of a standard square two-color sheet, which, according to the conditions, needs to be folded in half, so that a fold line is formed in the center of the square.  The edges are folded to the center line, resulting in the final result. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="easy kusudama for children circuits" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14511/331055.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <p>  Another easy kusudama - ‚Äúkite‚Äù, is generally not more complicated than the previous version.  The same square is taken as the basis, only it needs to be expanded so that a rhombus is obtained, and folded in half, forming a fold.  Then expand and from the top of the corner to the fold line lower the side lines, you get a ‚Äúkite‚Äù. </p><p>  Or a light ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù kusudama, for which you need 30 rectangular strips of one color and 30 of another. </p><h2>  Kusudama classic </h2><p>  This is a ball consisting of only 6 elements.  Its manufacture does not require much perseverance.  The square is bent in half, then again in half.  Then, the ‚Äúdoor‚Äù is formed by the basic technique, and from 2 sides of the sheet edge bends towards the middle.  By flattening, pockets are obtained, the corners of each of which are bent inward.  Each resulting corner unfolds and is flattened, the 4 corners of the square are bent inward, circles are obtained that are joined by gluing.  This creates a fairly light kusudama "ball".  Go for it! </p>
