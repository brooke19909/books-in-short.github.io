    <h2>  <span>Bulgaria, Sunny Beach,</span> Hotel Kiparisite 4 *: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  It should be noted immediately that this hotel is one of the few where the vast majority of guest comments are extremely positive.  There are, of course, some complaints, but there are very few of them.  We invite you to read reviews of our compatriots about their holidays in the Bulgarian "Cypress" in more detail. </p><p>  So, the first thing that absolutely everyone pays attention to is the appearance of the hotel building, as well as its interior decoration.  Many tourists were a little shocked by the design of the corridors.  So, the walls of orange or raspberry color in combination with a red carpet on the floor and green doors to the rooms left our compatriots with conflicting impressions.  However, the rooms themselves are decorated in calmer colors and furnished with high-quality comfortable furniture, which makes them very cozy.  There were no complaints from the vacationers about the operation of any household appliances or plumbing. </p><p>  Many of our compatriots noted the good work of the hotel maids.  So, regardless of whether tourists left a tip or not, they always cleaned their rooms in good faith, did not forget to replenish their supplies of shampoo, soap and shower gel, and they were often not too lazy to make funny figures from towels on the beds.  Other staff of the Kiparisite 4 * hotel (Bulgaria) did not hit the face.  So, both administrators and bartenders and waiters are exceptionally friendly, helpful and just nice people who are always happy to help guests.  In addition, almost all hotel staff speak Russian well, so you will not have any communication problems. </p><p>  As for nutrition, there were no special complaints from our compatriots either.  All products were fresh and the dishes were delicious.  In addition, there has always been a large selection of fruits.  Many were also pleased with the very reasonable price of drinks in bars. </p><p>  An exceptionally positive impression on holidaymakers was left by the pool of the Kiparisite hotel.  It is located on the second floor, above the roadway, and is surrounded by a wall, picturesquely entwined with plants.  Pool water is always clean and pleasant.  Near the pool there is a sun terrace with plenty of sun loungers.  According to tourists, here you can almost always find a free sunbed and umbrella.  There is also a bar by the pool, so you don‚Äôt have to go far for a drink. </p><p>  As for the beach, the nearest city beach, according to our compatriots who had a rest in Cypress 4 *, is really located about 80 meters from the hotel.  However, the entrance to the sea is rocky and not very convenient.  But if you go to the side of only 150-200 meters, then you can walk to another beach with an already sandy entry into the sea.  Many tourists did just that.  For the rental of sunbeds on the beaches you need to pay separately.  If you want to save money, you can buy a couple of large towels or mats with an umbrella in the store and sit with them on the beach in an area free of deckchairs. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that the vast majority of our compatriots were more than satisfied with their stay at the four-star hotel ‚ÄúKiparisite‚Äù (Sunny Beach, Bulgaria) and find its value quite consistent with the quality of the provided living conditions and services.  They do not exclude the possibility that they will stay here again, and will also recommend this hotel to their friends and relatives. </p>
