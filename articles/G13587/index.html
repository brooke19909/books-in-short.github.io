    <h2>  Device model </h2><p>  Outwardly, the steam cleaner resembles a vacuum cleaner, but its functional orientation is fundamentally different.  It is designed to supply a jet of hot steam during operation, which increases the cleaning efficiency and provides disinfection.  The design of the model under consideration is oriented toward the fulfillment of these tasks.  The component parts of the device can be divided into three categories: power base, functional organs, communication equipment and auxiliary devices.  The drive action is provided by an electric motor with a power of 1800 watts.  How much this cleaning potential is enough depends on the conditions in which the Gorenje SC1800R steam cleaner will be used.  Reviews of those who use the device for cleaning surfaces in apartments and houses indicate its adequacy.  As for the functional organs, they are represented by a steam gun, a reservoir, brushes, regulators and mode switches, a nozzle and a funnel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Communication includes cable, hoses, extension tubes, etc. The model is also equipped with a wide range of additional devices, including indicators, handles, adapters, holding belts, fuses and other devices that enhance the functionality of the Gorenje SC1800R steam cleaner.  The package contains specialized devices specifically designed for the care of glass surfaces, a rag for cleaning floor coverings and nylon brushes. </p><h2>  Instrument Specifications </h2>

The developers managed to comply with the established principles of creating a household cleaning apparatus, providing compact dimensions, a basic option, an acceptable power load and structural ergonomics.  Added to this is the reliability of the consumables from which the Gorenje SC1800R steam cleaner is made. </p><p>  Advantages in terms of security are not so obvious, but the presence of a double protection system, of course, is a plus model.  As for the shortcomings, the device is on the market about 8-9 thousand rubles.  Household appliances for cleaning in this price segment nevertheless receive a wider list of innovative technologies related to the same safety devices and the latest management principles.  How this steam cleaner manifests itself in the practice of operation will help to find feedback from the direct owners of the device. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about the model </h2>

    <p>  Opinions on the merits of the model vary, but in general, the basic quality of cleaning causes more positive impressions.  It is noted that the working bodies cope well with cares in hard-to-reach places - for example, behind bars, batteries and furniture.  Housewives point to the ability of the appliance to clean kitchen appliances efficiently.  So, with a microwave and an <span>oven, the</span> unit works even without the use of special detergents, leaving an acceptable result.  The same applies to items of clothing, but with the exception of silk items.  Some users even point out the superiority of this model over its competitor in the form of Karcher 1020. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is emphasized that the Gorenje SC1800R steam cleaner works better in the maintenance of floor coverings, facade surfaces and tiles.  Reviews of physical ergonomics are also positive.  The minor miscalculations, which are often made by more eminent manufacturers of cleaning equipment, are almost absent in this case.  This also applies to the mechanism of winding the cord, and the shape of the handle and other structural details - this functionality is convenient and does not cause any complaints. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Among the impressions with a minus sign, a strong smell from the water tank to generate steam can be noted.  However, it is also noted that over time he leaves.  There are also claims to the level of pressure.  According to the calculations of some owners, the device does not provide the declared 5 bar.  Although, again, the result of force in most cases satisfies users.  But a long heating time is noted by almost all owners of the Gorenje SC1800R steam cleaner.  Reviews indicate that it takes several minutes to bring the device to a healthy state. </p><h2>  The nuances of choosing a steam cleaner </h2><p>  Steam generators for domestic use are in many ways similar to each other.  The same power at 1500-1800 watts is the average and most common as the pressure indicator at 3.5-5 bar.  Focusing on these parameters, you can make a win-win choice of the device, both for an apartment and for a private house.  Ergonomics rather deserve special attention - the nuances of the design, functional components, handles, brushes and holders.  And according to these parameters, we can say that the SC1800R model is the optimal steam cleaner for the home. </p><p>  How to choose a device with universal purpose?  The segment in which the same device from Gorenje is presented also has the right to be considered as universal.  With the help of such models, users cope with the cleaning of textiles, carpet materials, glass, tile and other surfaces.  But if we are talking about large areas, then restrictions will be found in terms of power and tank volume.  These characteristics will need to be paid attention to when it comes to the use of a steam cleaner also in office rooms or cleaning the house area. </p>

    <h2>  Instructions for assembly </h2><p>  The first step is to connect the steam gun to one of the extension pipes using a flexible hose.  This is done by simple manipulation of the latch, which is pushed back and latches the integrated pipe in the pipe.  Next, an angular adapter with a brush is installed, on which you can put a complete rag - it is conveniently fastened with clamping clips.  We should also consider the process of filling the tank of the Gorenje SC1800R steam cleaner.  Reviews recommend that before each use of the device thoroughly treat the surface with a cleaning agent - this will at least eliminate an unpleasant odor.  However, the applied composition must be completely withdrawn by the time it is filled with clean water.  The manufacturer further warns against the use of detergents directly in the process of spraying steam.  Water can only be filled with the appliance disconnected from the mains.  The device is installed on a flat surface, the cap of the tank is unscrewed and the liquid is poured to the desired volume. </p><h2>  Workflow Recommendations </h2><p>  For each type of surface, the manufacturer recommends the use of appropriate equipment.  With the aforementioned combination of a brush and a rag, floor surfaces can be treated while holding the device body on the shoulder with a belt.  Vertical surfaces are recommended to be wiped initially with napkins, and then use the smallest brush from the kit, directing it back and forth.  Spot stain removal is also available for the Gorenje SC1800R steam cleaner.  The operating modes for servicing such areas are selected using the steam supply intensity control - a spot nozzle is used directly to remove stains.  For glass surfaces, it is advisable to use a rubber nozzle, also directing it on the sides or clockwise. </p>

    <h2>  Maintenance Instructions </h2><p>  During operation, it is important to maintain optimal technical and sanitary-hygienic condition of the device.  The manufacturer recommends regular cleaning of the working surfaces of the device, functional organs and the tank.  The design and construction of the Gorenje SC1800R steam cleaner is also subject to revision.  The instruction, in particular, indicates the need to check the basic connections of the housing components - bolt fasteners, clamps and clamps are checked.  It is especially important to monitor the tightness of the tank.  At the first sign of its deformation, a replacement should be made. </p><h2>  Safety requirements </h2><p>  In the process of using the device, you cannot turn its case over, pull on the connected cable, immerse it in water and allow third-party effects of elevated temperatures.  If the electrical infrastructure was damaged, then before its restoration it is worth abandoning the use of a Gorenje SC1800R steam cleaner.  The disadvantages of such generators are associated with the operation of a hot aquatic environment, which should also be taken into account.  All manipulations when disassembling the structure and updating the water in the tank must be carried out carefully, taking into account the risk of fluid leakage. </p><h2>  Finally </h2>

    <p>  Steam generators are much more expensive than conventional vacuum cleaners, which forces the consumer to think in principle about the appropriateness of such an acquisition.  How useful a steam cleaner is at home, how to choose a specific model and not be disappointed in the operation process are the main questions that beginners ask in this method of cleaning.  Practice shows that devices of this type really give an incomparable effect on cleaning and disinfection with vacuum cleaners. </p><p>  As for the nuances of choice, the SC1800R model and similar analogues in its characteristics are quite suitable for a full range of home cleaning operations.  It remains only to individually determine the list of mandatory nozzles, draw up requirements for the shape of the device and establish an acceptable price category. </p>
