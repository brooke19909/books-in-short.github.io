    <h2>  Visit time </h2><p>  In the season when the Flower Garden in Dubai is open, it can be visited both on weekdays: from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and on weekends: from 10 a.m. to midnight.  There are buses to the park from the Mall of Emiraites metro station.  Of course, you can also get to him by taxi.  Children under three years old visit the park for free.  For all other visitors, entrance to the flower country is paid - about 5.5 dollars (at the current rate of about 312 rubles).  There is a cafe in the park.  It is strictly forbidden to pick flowers, litter, walk on lawns and flower beds.  If during a vacation in the UAE the purpose of the excursion will be a flower park, then it is better to call there first and clarify all the information about its work, as due to weather conditions the schedule of tourist reception may change. </p><h2>  Flower gamut </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This wonderful park has more than forty-five million varieties of various types of flowers.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">There are even such cultures that were first brought to the Persian Gulf.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">It is hard to imagine, but the flowers of the park create more than 60 different colorful shades.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Unofficially, the UAE's Miracle Garden Park is</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">called a multi-color oasis.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">And this is not surprising, because it seems that a magician painted a vast territory, scattering delicate flowers instead of paints.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">If you look from a height at the created landscapes, it seems that the artist worked, with a wide brush, writing out various landscapes from bright stripes.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Here you can see painted butterflies, a rainbow, peacocks, amazing architecture - and all this from flowers!</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">All compositions are saturated with romance and humor.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">In the park you can even see a small copy of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper entwined with flowers.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="miracle garden uae" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39363/1801098.jpg" width="600"></div>
