    <p>  The Great October Revolution is one of the stages of the Russian revolution that took place in 1917, as a result of which the Provisional Government (VP) was dissolved, and the Bolsheviks (RSDLP, Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and Anarchists) came to power. </p><p>  The old government was overthrown on October 25 (November 7) during the rebellion.  The October <span>armed uprising was</span> organized by L. Trotsky, Y. Sverdlov and V. Lenin, and he was led by the VK of the Petrograd Soviet. </p><p>  Assessing all the events that have occurred, we can say that for some the revolution became a national catastrophe, which led to the Civil War and destroyed Russia as an empire;  others believe that the coup was a huge event in history, it had an impact on the whole world, giving Russia the opportunity to choose a different path of development. </p><p>  The Great <span>October Revolution</span> was inevitable.  The situation that developed after the formation of the government was characterized as "dual power."  On March 2, the Cabinet was formed by the Provisional Committee, where there was not a single adherent of the country's withdrawal from the war.  At the same time, the <span>Provisional Government</span> said that Russia would fight until victory, fulfilling agreements concluded with the Allies.  In response to this, the Petrograd Soviet appealed to the masses to oppose the policy of the imperialists, speaking out in favor of peace.  As a result of such actions, a declaration was created that satisfied both sides, the question of war and peace was postponed for some time. </p><p>  But already on April 18, Miliukov came out with the idea that the people were trying to win the war, which caused discontent, and as a result armed forces were withdrawn to the streets of Petrograd, and a demonstration was held near the Mariinsky Palace calling for the dissolution of the Provisional Government.  Miliukov's supporters also held demonstrations in his defense.  But the Executive Committee managed to stop the demonstrations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before the Great October Revolution, the EaP, along with the socialist parties, made appointments to various posts of representatives of the latter.  A number of bills on labor issues were considered.  However, the socialists did not add popularity to the VP; moreover, they quickly lost theirs.  Thus, the so-called dual power was formed within the government. </p><p>  For this reason, in July there were many rallies and demonstrations led by the Bolsheviks in order to seize power and overthrow the EP.  Gradually, anarchy began to reign in the country. </p><p>  On August 27, a government crisis erupted, and two days later a mutiny broke out, as a result of which Trotsky led the Petrograd Soviet.  On October 10, the question of insurrection was put on the agenda; a meeting of the Central Committee confirmed this decision. </p><p>  The day of the Great October Socialist Revolution was appointed first on the seventeenth, and then on the twenty-second of October, however, the coup that took place on the twenty-fourth was unexpected for everyone, because they were waiting for an armed meeting, which was supposed to end with the arrest of power.  However, it did not happen, everything proceeded calmly, without shots.  Methodically, the Petrograd Soviet turned diarchy into autocracy. </p><p>  On the morning of the twenty-fifth, only the <span>Winter Palace</span> remained under the control of the VP <span>,</span> and in the evening his assault took place.  On October 26, the Provisional Government was arrested. </p><p>  The Great October Revolution ended on October 26, when the Provisional Government was arrested.  On the same day, a Peace Decree was adopted, which stated that all warring states needed to negotiate peace, and the <span>death penalty</span> was also abolished <span>.</span> </p><p>  Thus, the October Revolution played an important role in the history of mankind, it enabled Russia to reach a new level of development. </p>
