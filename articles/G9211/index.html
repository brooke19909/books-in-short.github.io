The chain of these hotels is known all over the world, and the quality of their service is constant regardless of the country of location.  German management and elegant oriental style - a combination of these two qualities make the hotel unique, and rest in it is not just good, but very high quality.  Iberotel Club Fanara is located on the shores of a coral reserve, of which there are so many in Sharm, Rasum El Sid.  The hotel‚Äôs location area itself, Hadab, is characterized by steep slopes from which you can go down to the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iberotel Club Fanar" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/309556.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  328 rooms of the hotel have a standard content.  Most of them cover an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 25 square meters and are designed for a settlement of two to three people.  Iberotel Club Fanara has different room categories.  There are over eighty family rooms for five guests.  They are twice as large and have a living room.  And three exclusive suites (75 square meters) provide the guest with the greatest number of amenities and space.  In general, the hotel has two parts: Club on the first line and Residence on the second.  There are bungalows, but they are somewhat far from the sea, and the villas are closer to the beach.  If you need additional services - including for children - right in the room, contact the administration and everything will be done at your request. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Iberotel Club Fanara" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/309559.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Iberotel Club Fanara operates on an all-inclusive basis.  However, after eleven in the evening it ends.  But from early morning and throughout the day, guests can enjoy a buffet in three restaurants: the main one, by the sea and near the exit.  Or you can have a snack and a drink in various bars: on the beach, in the lobby, by the pool, ‚Äúdisco‚Äù (in the latter there is not only good music, but also especially tasty cocktails).  There is also an √† la carte restaurant with Italian cuisine.  You can sleep and go to brunch for a long time, everyone has enough food, but there are no queues. </p><p>  Iberotel Club Fanara, like any hotel with German management, offers guests typical for their lineup, but good entertainment: fitness equipment, spa services, sauna, diving center.  The hotel has a good, albeit small, beach with all the accessories for a sea holiday and a sandy bottom (you can enter without slippers).  Older people may experience some problems due to the steep descent, climbing stairs, but young people and middle-aged guests are even happy, because you can pump up muscles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iberotel club fanar reviews" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/309558.jpg" width="350"></div>  Those who like to snorkel are completely expansive: their own <span>coral reef,</span> which can be watched for hours, as if in an aquarium.  Due to the steep slope there are no winds, which is very important in winter.  This hotel is especially recommended for children, there is a special heated pool, a good entry to the sea for kids (which is far from all Egyptian beaches), and a club.

    <p>  Most tourists say that the best place for a winter holiday in Sharm is Iberotel Club Fanara.  Guest reviews note the cleanliness and well-groomed area, silence, tranquility and comfort.  For more active entertainment, you can take a taxi for two or three dollars right to the center of Sharm.  Tourists are fascinated by local baking uncharacteristic for Egypt and an amazing variety of <span>fruits: guava,</span> pomegranates, melons, dates.  On Thursdays, on a "fish day", grilled crab and octopus are served.  Such luxury was not even in the neighboring fives.  No wonder most vacationers write that they were sad to leave. </p>
