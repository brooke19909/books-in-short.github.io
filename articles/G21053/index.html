The island is interesting to many pilgrims for its Orthodox shrines.  In Cyprus, there are an incredible amount.  The rich past of the island is associated with the formation of Christianity in its lands.  According to scientists, Christianity came to Cyprus more than 2 thousand years ago.  For a long time religion has undergone many changes.  In different eras, there were persecutions of believers; monasteries and temples were destroyed.  A large number of relics disappeared without a trace, but still some survived.  The Orthodox holy places of Cyprus are revered by believers around the world.  Pilgrims from different countries come here.  But ordinary tourists will be interested to look at <span>these sights.</span> </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="35.126413" data-lng="33.429858999999965" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="7"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/2/1/9/9219.png"></div><h2>  A bit of history ... </h2><p>  Cyprus is often called the island of saints, because its lands are sanctified by the exploits of the many saints of God.  Christianity was preached by the holy apostles Mark, Paul and Barnabas.  But even before their appearance, there were already Christians on the island.  The bishop in Cyprus was Lazarus the Four-Day, who was resurrected by the Lord Jesus Christ.  On the island, St. Spyridon of Trimyphus and St. John V the Merciful were born. </p><p>  The autocephaly of the Cyprus Church was approved at the Third Ecumenical Council.  Cypriots are a very pious people, therefore, in the local lands there are many temples that are crowded with people on weekends and holidays.  A lot of the island and monasteries.  For example, in one village there can be several temples. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Christian shrines of Cyprus have long attracted pilgrims.  The most revered Cypriots are the great martyr George the Victorious.  No less respectful are the righteous Lazarus the Four-Day, the great martyr Harlampius, the martyr Mamant, Mafra and Timothy. </p><p>  Over the long history of the island, there have been many events that have not been reflected in the local shrines in the best way.  In 1974, the northern lands of Cyprus were captured by Turkish troops.  Many temples of the island were desecrated and destroyed, and some of them were turned into entertainment centers and mosques.  Some shrines were plundered and disappeared without a trace.  And yet on the island there are a lot of places that are worth visiting for pilgrims.  In our article we want to talk about which holy places and shrines to visit in Cyprus.  Even if you are far from religion, during the holidays it is worth seeing the most interesting objects of Christianity. </p><h2>  Main shrine </h2><p>  The royal Stavropegial Kikk monastery is considered the main shrine of Cyprus.  It is located at an altitude of 2 thousand meters above sea level.  The royal monastery was named for the reason that it was founded by the emperor of Constantinople.  Now he is independent and subordinate to the Cypriot Archbishop Chrysostomos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="de.cyplive.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Orthodox shrines in Cyprus" class="if uuid-2841122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2841122.jpg"></div><p>  Not only all Russian pilgrims, but also ordinary tourists strive to get into the Troodos mountains and Larnaca.  The road to the main shrine of Cyprus is a mountain serpentine.  In the Troodos mountains, the weather is cooler (+28 degrees) than on the coast or in Nicosia (+40 degrees).  The local slopes are overgrown with cedars, pines and plane trees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tradition says that the Blessed Virgin once visited the mountains.  On the same spot now is the Kikk monastery - the main holy place of Cyprus.  The monastery is highly revered by Cypriots and pilgrims.  Local pines have a bizarre bent shape.  An old legend says that on the way in front of the Virgin Mary, the trees bowed their proud peaks.  They remained inclined to this day. </p><p>  The main shrine of Cyprus is always crowded.  All visitors line up in a long line to approach the Kikk icon of the Mother of God.  She is also called the "Kikkas Merciful."  Pilgrims say that the icon is always covered by a canopy.  But, going up to her, everyone feels grace. </p><h2>  History of the Kikk Icon </h2><p>  A long history has been associated with the appearance of the icon in the main Orthodox shrine of Cyprus.  In the ninth century, a hermit monk lived on Mount Kykkos.  Once on a hunt, the ruler of the island met him, who thought that the old man had not shown him honors at a meeting.  Therefore, the ruler gave the order to beat the old man. </p><p>  Soon after returning home, he fell ill and realized that he was punished for his treatment of a monk.  The ruler decided to reconcile with the old man.  But the monk had God's revelation to ask the ruler for the icon of the Mother of God, painted by the Apostle Luke.  This image was kept in the palace of the emperor. </p><p>  Such a request embarrassed the ruler.  However, it soon became apparent that the emperor‚Äôs daughter had the same illness.  Nevertheless, nobody wanted to give the monk the original.  Therefore, it was decided to make a copy and offer a choice of both options.  The bee, who sat on the original, helped the monk make the right choice.  So the icon was in the Kikk monastery, and the emperor had to accept the loss.  But he made a condition so that no one else saw her.  Since then, the icon is covered. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  History knows several cases when people tried to open it.  Each attempt was unsuccessful and ended badly: someone went blind, and someone lost their arm.  Here is such an interesting story at the most revered Orthodox shrine of Cyprus. </p><h2>  Tomb of St. Lazarus </h2><p>  One of the main Orthodox shrines of Cyprus is the tomb of St. Lazarus.  Escaping the resurrection from persecution, the saint was forced to flee to the island in Kition.  Here he lived for 30 years, for 18 of them he was a bishop.  Later (in the sixth century) a temple was built on the grave of the saint, which still bears his name. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What shrines and holy places to visit in Cyprus" class="if uuid-2841129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2841129.jpg"></div><p>  Now Kition is called Larnaca.  The famous resort is popular among tourists.  And the pilgrims visit him to see the shrine.  The relics of St. Lazarus are in the sarcophagus under the altar.  The iconostasis seen by pilgrims in the temple dates from the 18th century.  It is skillfully made of wood and is the best example of woodcarving on the island.  It is difficult to imagine, but there are 120 images in the iconostasis.  They all date from the 18th century and are made in the style of Byzantine writing.  There are also older icons in the temple. </p><h2>  Monastery of St. Thecla </h2><p>  The island has long been famous for healers.  <span>The holy springs of</span> Cyprus are one of the pilgrims' travel goals.  If you want healing, then you should go to the monastery dedicated to St. Thecla (disciple of the Apostle Paul).  It houses an old casket with the relics of the saint, as well as her miraculous image. </p><p>  There are two sources on the territory of the monastery: with water and clay.  The latter surprisingly heals skin ailments if you lubricate it with sore spots.  Eyewitnesses say that clay never ends, no matter how many pilgrims take.  Sometimes it happens a lot, and sometimes less.  But she is always there.  Pilgrims pick her up with them in a container and take her home to give healing to their loved ones. </p><h2>  Northern area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island </h2><p>  Famagusta was once the island‚Äôs most luxurious resort.  Luxury hotels, kilometers of golden beaches, beautiful clear water - all this is a thing of the past.  The situation changed after the Turkish occupation of the region.  365 churches previously functioned in the city - according to the number of days in a year for worshiping each of them as a holiday.  Turks destroyed the shrines of northern Cyprus.  Only the ruins of the magnificent structures remained.  A wide beach area is now inaccessible, as it is fenced with barbed wire and is under the protection of UN troops. </p><h2>  Apostle Barnabas </h2><p>  In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNorthern Cyprus near Famagusta are the ruins of the ancient city of Salamis, in which the Apostle Barnabas was martyred.  He became the founder of the Cyprus Autocephalous Church.  The apostle Mark found the body of Barnabas and buried it in a cave along with the volume ‚ÄúThe Gospel of Matthew‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="inpantanassis.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monasteries of Cyprus holy places" class="if uuid-2841174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2841174.jpg"></div><p>  After the death of the saint in the city of Salamis, persecution of Christians began.  The burial place of St. Barnabas was forgotten.  According to legend, at the end of the 5th century AD, the relics of the saint were rediscovered, and in a very remarkable way: the Cypriot Bishop Anfemios found the place of burial of Barnabas in a dream.  Here began the miracles of healing.  Later, the cave, in which the relics are stored, was called the "Place of Health", and a church was built near it in honor of St. Barnabas. </p><p>  Now the region is occupied by the Turks.  After their arrival in Cyprus, the monastery was looted, and all the monks were dispersed.  But the church of the Holy Apostle has been preserved and can be visited.  Not far from it is a crypt with a tomb - a particularly revered shrine of Cyprus. </p><h2>  Andrew the First-Called </h2><p>  The monastery of the Apostle Andrew the First-Called in the northern region of Crete existed until 1974 (before the Turkish occupation).  At one time, it was one of the most significant on the island.  According to ancient legends, the apostle Andrew performed a real miracle here.  After his prayer, a source of fresh water appeared, so necessary for people.  In Cyprus, there was always a shortage of this resource.  An interesting fact is that in the ancient temple at the monastery the source still exists. </p><h2>  Stavrovuni Monastery </h2><p>  Far from the noise of the city, on the top of the mountain, is the ancient <span>monastery of Stavrovuni,</span> whose name translates as the monastery of the Holy Cross.  The cloister was founded by Queen Elena.  Its main shrine is a part of the Life-giving Cross of the Lord, which the saint left here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cyprus-hotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Orthodox Cyprus holy places" class="if uuid-2841185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2841185.jpg"></div><p>  There is a legend that the queen was hiding on the island from the storm when she was given God's command: to build a temple on the island and leave a piece of the Viviparous Cross here. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the exact date of the appearance of this shrine in Cyprus is unknown.  But the first mention of it dates back to the XI-XII centuries.  Initially, the monastery was very small.  But subsequently its territory expanded significantly.  The monastery has repeatedly experienced periods of active development and decline.  And only in the 60s of the last century did the situation normalize.  Now everyone can visit the monastery.  But the monastery has strict rules that prohibit women from entering it.  A chapel has been built nearby for them.  A particle of the Holy Cross is still kept within the walls of the monastery. </p><h2>  Neophytos Monastery </h2><p>  Not far from Paphos is the monastery of St. Neophyte.  They say that in the XII-XIII centuries in the cell, hollowed out in the rock, the reverend father lived.  In his youth, he decided to devote his life to the Lord.  He learned to read and write in the monastery, and then led the life of a hermit, having built a cell and a temple in the rock.  Later, other believers joined him.  So a small monastery was formed around the mountain.  Saint Neophyte was a spiritual writer, his works the monastery began to publish only now.  The exact date of the death of the reverend is unknown.  It is believed that he died after 1241, since his last work is dated this year. </p><p>  Currently, a cave church and a saint‚Äôs cell are open for pilgrims.  And in the monastery lie the relics of Neophyte, to which believers can join.  On the territory of the monastery there is a museum in which you can see church utensils and icons, as well as archaeological finds. </p><h2>  Sabatons of St. Spyridon </h2><p>  The Sabatons of St. Spyridon of Trimythous is the shrine of Cyprus, highly revered by pilgrims and Cypriots.  They say that those who have financial difficulties and who are facing legal proceedings should attach themselves to it.  The saint eagerly responds to the prayers of the pilgrims.  Spiridon's shoes help solve material issues. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The main Orthodox shrines of Cyprus" class="if uuid-2841189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2841189.jpg"></div><p>  There is a legend that the saint still walks around the world and helps people, so his shoes very quickly ‚Äúwear out‚Äù.  Once a year, the relics of Spiridon, stored in a temple on the island of Corfu, change their shoes.  And old shoes give.  Therefore, gradually the shoes spread around the world and are stored in different churches.  You can see the shoes in the Danilov Monastery (Moscow).  In Cyprus, they are kept in the Church of the Virgin Mary in the village of Afiena.  If you want to ask the saint to help you in solving financial difficulties, be sure to go to the temple and follow the slippers. </p><p>  Most often, Spiridon is addressed with household questions.  During his lifetime, the saint helped people a lot.  And to this day, people believe in the power of his shoes. </p><h2>  Miraculous icon </h2><p>  In the village of Simvula in the vicinity of Limassol, the icon of the great martyr George the Victorious was once found.  There was also a monastery, which was later abandoned and forgotten.  But in 1992, the saint appeared in a dream to a pious, sick woman, speaking of the need to rebuild the temple. </p><p>  When she and her husband came to the indicated place, she found a miraculous icon.  Later, work began on the restoration of the temple.  The woman was soon healed miraculously, and the miraculous icon is still preserved in the new church to this day.  The temple is dedicated to the great martyr George.  Numerous pilgrims come to him in the hope of receiving blessed help and healing. </p><h2>  Temple in Menico </h2><p>  In the village of Menico in Cyprus there is a temple of the martyr Justina and the holy martyr Cyprian, where their relics are stored.  Not far from the church there is a holy spring, the water in which has an unusual taste.  She is healing.  The relics are stored at the altar.  The priest brings them to the pilgrims and reads a special prayer.  After that, the priest hands each believer a fleece with blessed oil. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kiprinform.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shrines of Northern Cyprus" class="if uuid-2841196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2841196.jpg"></div><p>  In the temple there is a miraculous icon of the Mother of God, in front of which they pray, asking for children. </p><h2>  Monastery in Nicosia </h2><p>  Currently, the capital of Cyprus Nicosia is divided into two parts by a wall.  Part of the city is located in the territory occupied by the Turks, who captured the island in 1974.  Nicosia has many temples with the relics of saints and revered icons.  In one of them the relics of saints Timothy and Moor are stored. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Shrines of Cyprus Spyridon of Trimyphus" class="if uuid-2841226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2841226.jpg"></div><p>  In the city there is a monument to Archbishop Makarios, whom all Cypriots venerate.  He was the first president of Cyprus after gaining freedom by the island.  He was elected to this post three times.  Makarios died in 1977.  His body was buried in the mountains near the city.  As a sign of respect and memory, there is always a guard of honor near the grave. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  In our article, we tried to talk about the most basic shrines of Cyprus.  In fact, there are a lot of them on the island.  Thousands of pilgrims come here every year in the hope of receiving healing or help from the saints. </p>
