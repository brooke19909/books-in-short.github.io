    <h2>  The best time to relax in the Philippines </h2><p>  This country is always summer.  However, as on all islands, predicting the weather is not an easy task.  Sometimes for several weeks in a row there can be magnificent weather without rains and winds, and it also happens that the sea begins to storm for several days, and there is no way to swim in it. </p><p>  Just keep in mind that in the off-season (early spring and late autumn) there may be prolonged rainfall.  But the winter months are even a very convenient time for a beach holiday. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, the island of Boracay is characterized by an incredibly interesting celebration of the Christmas holidays, which begin here on December 16 and last until January 6.  These days you can have a lot of fun, dance in disco bars, hang out in night clubs, in a word, celebrate Catholic Christmas and New Year in a non-standard and original way. </p><p>  By the way, on the white beaches of the islands, you can also celebrate an extraordinary wedding and then spend a honeymoon.  In a word, if you do not like standard solutions and want to spend your holidays in a special way, then you have a direct road to the Philippines. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel dave straw hat boracay" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1462650.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Boracay </h2><p>  This is a tiny island.  It has an oblong shape.  Its width (at its widest point) is 2.5 kilometers, while its length is about 7 kilometers.  Despite the fact that this island is not a popular tourist destination, its beaches, according to the ratings of reputable tourist publications, occupy 5th place in the world. </p><p>  Boracay hotels can also compete with the best hotels in Europe, America and mainland Asia.  However, as you know, the main wealth of these places are natural beauties.  The beach of the island has a length of 4 km, it is completely covered with snow-white, flour-like sand.  Palm trees approach the very edge of turquoise water.  Why not advertise the Bounty bar ?! </p><p>  Numerous bars and cafes, restaurants and hotels, clubs and shops are scattered along the coast.  As already noted, prices here are not low, but in comparison with European prices are quite acceptable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Boracay hotels with private beach" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1462649.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Boracay? </h2><p>  If you are traveling to this island, then you will first need to fly to Manila - the capital of the Philippines, and from there go by domestic flight to Caticlan or El Nido.  The flight will take about an hour.  Almost all Boracay hotels provide tourists with a transfer from the airport to the hotel grounds, and by motor boat.  On the way you will spend another half an hour.  By the way, the boat, as a rule, does not approach the pier or shore, but stops in the water.  Tourists have to go for a walk through the shallow water to the shore.  Things are transferred in the same way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels of boracay" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1462647.jpg" width="550"></div>
