By the standards of Russians, Malm√∂ is a very small town in Sweden, although it is the third largest in the country.  Unfortunately, few vacationers get to Malm√∂, and yet it is full of surprises. </p><h2>  Cosmopolitan city </h2><p>  The so-called Swedish gates to Europe are located in southern Sweden, near the border with Denmark, on the very shore of the Baltic Sea.  Malmo, whose sights are becoming the subject of admiration for tourists, is the administrative center of the province of Skane. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.604981" data-lng="13.003822000000014" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/6/7/7/18677.png"></div><p>  About 320 thousand people live in the multinational city, and half of them are migrants.  It is cosmopolitanism that contributes to the development of its rich cultural life. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Due to its unique location in a sheltered bay, the city, built in 1272, has always flourished.  For several centuries it belonged to Denmark and therefore stores many works of architecture characteristic of the Middle Ages of this country.  The large seaport and shopping center grew rich from year to year.  In the middle of the 17th century, a war broke out between Denmark and Sweden.  Soon, tired of the fierce bloody battles, they signed a peace treaty.  According to him, a decision was made in 1658 to surrender the province of Sk√•ne to Sweden. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the sixteenth century, Malm√∂ even competed economically with Copenhagen. </p><h2>  St. Peter's Church </h2><p>  Malmo's most famous religious attraction is St. Peter's Church.  This is the oldest temple in the city, which was built over 100 years.  In the XIX century, local authorities, concerned about the problem of its destruction, decided to demolish the remains of an ancient monument.  In its place there was a new church built of dark brick.  Her appearance is very restrained and may even seem inconspicuous and uninteresting from an architectural point of view to someone.  But such a laconic design is inherent in almost all of Swedish architecture.  But the interior is a real admiration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Saint Paul's Cathedral" class="if uuid-3270548" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3270548.jpg"></div><p>  The Gothic-style cathedral is located in the very center of the city, and its high spiers are visible from any corner of Malmo, Sweden (photos are presented in the article).  Especially surprising is the multi-tiered tower of the square bell tower.  The lower levels are decorated with spacious windows, and the upper ones are decorated with both bas-reliefs and figures of gargoyles. </p><p>  Inside the temple is decorated with columns and arcades (near arches), and its main relics are an old altar with carvings, on which famous sculptors worked, and an organ.  It is curious that the walls and floor of the church are laid with gravestones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the service, which is held in the morning, tourists are not allowed to enter the church. </p><h2>  Malmehus Castle </h2><p>  The marvelous architectural creation used to protect the trade routes is an excellent example of Danish architecture in Sweden.  The castle, more reminiscent of a fortress, arose on the site of the destroyed structure, which was intended for King Christian III.  There are many architectural monuments of the Middle Ages in the province of Skane, but Malmehus is the most famous.  It housed the royal residence and prison for prisoners, including the husband of the Scottish Queen Mary Stuart was kept in the casemates. </p><p>  Laid back in the middle of the 15th century, it underwent several large-scale reconstructions and assumed a modern look.  The powerful citadel with baroque and renaissance elements is surrounded by a deep moat filled with water, and a fortress wall with two tall towers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.encirclephotos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malmo Castle" class="if uuid-3270547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3270547.jpg"></div><p>  Historical interiors are recreated here, and therefore visitors immediately fall into the Middle Ages.  In the building of the fortress there was a place for several museums, whose expositions tell about the rich history of the country and the city. </p><h2>  The triumph of engineering </h2><p>  In 1995, the construction of a tunnel bridge began, including a four-lane road through the √ñresund Strait and the railway.  But only after 5 years, its official opening took place, after which the city becomes a bridge between Sweden and Denmark.  A very complex structure weighing 82 thousand tons is connected by a tunnel on Peberholm - a specially created island. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The bridge in Malmo (Sweden) was supposed to make life easier for Danes and Swedes, because in just 20 minutes, anyone can get from the city to Copenhagen.  But in fact, the road is very heavily overloaded with transport, and there are constant congestion on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="√ñresund bridge" class="if uuid-3270545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3270545.jpg"></div><p>  Construction costs amounted to about $ 2 billion, and now they are covered from the money that is collected for travel. </p><p>  According to tourists, moving by car over the bridge is an exciting adventure, and everyone gets a lot of unforgettable impressions from this trip. </p><h2>  The pride of all of Sweden </h2><p>  The futuristic looking skyscraper with the interesting name ‚ÄúTurning Torso‚Äù is the most modern architectural landmark of Malmo in Sweden (photo can be seen below).  Designed by a Spanish architect, he actually creates the effect of a spinning facade, because its author wanted to depict a human figure in motion.  A residential building, formed of nine cubes, until 2013 was considered the most "twisted" building in the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.needpix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Famous skyscraper" class="if uuid-3270546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3270546.jpg"></div><p>  The facade of the building, and in fact resembling a relief torso of a person, a very simple but bizarre form of architectural creation compensates for the laconic design.  The structure, which rises 190 meters, is ‚Äúfolded‚Äù in such a way that the lower and upper segments are located at an angle of 90 ¬∞ <sup>to</sup> each other.  During the construction, the most advanced technologies were used so that the design was stable and durable. </p><p>  On 54 floors there are both office premises and 150 apartments.  These are real spacious mansions with viewing platforms, conference rooms and wine cellars.  A beautiful building can only be admired from the outside, tourists are not allowed inside. </p><h2>  Modern center "Malmo Arena" </h2><p>  In November 2008, a multifunctional complex was opened, called the city of Malmo.  The attraction, the photos of which tourists necessarily take for memory, is really impressive. </p><p>  The facility, which is located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã51,000 m2, is a concert hall, a stadium, and a venue for symposia and negotiations.  The modern center has a huge restaurant and about 20 cafes.  In addition, those who wish can stay in a comfortable hotel. </p><h2>  City in the city </h2><p>  The Western Harbor area, whose windows offer wonderful views of the Oresund Strait, is the most environmentally friendly.  This is a kind of city of the future, built on the site of former shipyards. </p><p>  And now modern houses are towering here, for the construction of which the latest environmental technologies have been applied so that people live in harmony with nature and lead a healthy lifestyle.  You can‚Äôt park cars in the residential area, so residents leave them outside and transfer to bicycles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.guidebook-sweden.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Environmentally friendly area" class="if uuid-3270551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3270551.jpg"></div><p>  It is curious that the quarter in which windmills and solar panels are installed is non-volatile.  In addition, there is a unique system that allows you to warm houses in the winter and cool them in the hot summer. </p><p>  It is over this area that the famous skyscraper grows, which has become the most interesting landmark in Malmo.  And the whole Western Harbor is famous for its modern architecture. </p><h2>  Royal park </h2><p>  The city has a huge number of parks, but the Royal is considered the oldest, which opened in 1872.  It is located on the very outskirts of the historical center of Malmo in Sweden.  The famous landmark, the project of which was designed by the architect Ove Hansen, a big fan of Misty Albion, is decorated in the English style. </p><p>  The park is located on the site of an old cemetery, which caused a lot of speculation.  Religious figures could not calm down for a long time and tried their best to prevent its opening.  However, it so happened that the amazing masterpiece created by human hands really liked the locals, who soon forgot about all the unpleasant moments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.guidebook-sweden.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal park" class="if uuid-3270550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3270550.jpg"></div><p>  Numerous fountains and sculptural compositions harmoniously complement the amazing beauty of this corner.  And about his magnificent greenhouses and decorated flower beds are true legends.  Now it is a great place for family vacations and romantic meetings. </p><h2>  Picturesque manor </h2><p>  On the outskirts of the city is a curious landmark of Malmo (Sweden), reflecting its diversity.  Katrintorp rural estate was founded at the end of the 19th century by the rich merchant Bjerman, but the main house of the estate appeared after 14 years, with the new owner. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the manor was greatly affected by the terrible fire that broke out in 1826.  Reconstruction lasted quite a long time, and the estate changed again.  And then the municipality of Malmo bought the estate, which began restoration work. </p><p>  Katrintorp is now a whole complex, which includes a large house decorated with wall and ceiling paintings, a garden and a garden that delights you with a magical view, a greenhouse and a rose garden - favorite places for tourist photo shoots. </p><h2>  Beach holidays in the city </h2><p>  The Russians do not associate Sweden with beach vacations, but meanwhile in the south of the country you can sunbathe and swim.  The average air temperature in summer is 23 ¬∞ C, and the sea - 21 ¬∞ C. A mild climate, a large number of sunny days contribute to an excellent pastime at sea.  The beach season in the resorts of Sweden is very short: it begins in mid-June and lasts until the end of August. </p><p>  Among the places intended for entertaining holidaymakers, beaches that stretch along the coastal strip in the province of Skone deserve attention.  They even got the name "Swedish Riviera". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripsavvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beach vacation" class="if uuid-3270568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/3270568.jpg"></div><p>  Since the city of Malmo in Sweden is located in the south of the country, here you can have a good rest in the summer.  City beaches are sandy and very long.  Ribbersborg is the most popular holiday destination among locals and tourists.  It is curious that in the territory with a length of more than two and a half kilometers there were places for nudists, disabled people and dog lovers who came here with their beloved pet. </p><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  The city has a huge selection of hotels of various price categories, and vacationers will be able to make a decent choice.  The cost of a double room starts from 70 euros per day. </p><p>  Radisson Blu Hotel Malm√∂ and Savoy Lulea are the most fashionable hotels offering a high level of service.  Park Inn by Radisson Malm√∂ is a mid-range hotel that is popular with tourists.  And young people who come in large companies most often stay in numerous hostels. </p><p>  Many tourists make the choice not only in favor of hotels in Malmo (Sweden).  Those who travel by car settle in campsites located outside the city. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Tourists admit that in terms of the location of the main attractions of Malmo - a compact town that can be circumvented in one day.  Some walk independently, imbued with the spirit of an amazing corner, where antiquity and modernity are intertwined.  And others hire a guide who knows the place very well. </p><p>  This is a green town in which most often travel by bicycle - the most harmless form of transport.  In hotels, you can rent it for free and travel around all the local monuments. </p><p>  In addition, the Russians note that a large number of migrants do not negatively affect the standard of living, but, on the contrary, the city is flourishing and developing economically. </p>
