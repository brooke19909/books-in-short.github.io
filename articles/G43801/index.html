A distinctive feature of this enterprise was that the products manufactured here were intended for a wide variety of segments of the population.  Moreover, over time, special emphasis began to be placed on consumer goods. </p><h2>  The emergence of the Brokar Empire </h2>

Consumer goods brought the enterprise a considerable income.  And by the end of the founder’s life, the “Brokar Empire” grew up on the site of a small private economy with an annual income of about three million rubles.  By the 14th year, the Brokar &amp; K Society already had about ten <span>gold medals from the</span> best international exhibitions, emblems, the Grand Prix of the perfumery Paris exhibition of 1899 and other awards.

    <p>  And what was the name of the perfume factory after the revolution?  At the beginning of the existence of the Soviet state, it was called Soap Factory No. 5. Then, under the guidance of an energetic "red director", it grew into a perfumery and soap factory, which received the name "New Dawn". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The enterprise labeled all products with labels with the abbreviation “Trust Fat” - TER, mentioned in the song by V. Vysotsky. </p><h2>  "Red Moscow" </h2>

Remember what the perfume factory was called after the revolution?  The New Dawn.  The products of this company were so democratic initially that they were not affected by changes in the social system.  She was popular and met all the aspirations of women.  Many of Brocard's classic flavors have changed their name, but not the essence. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

    <p>  So, the spirits of the factory "New Dawn" for many years have become the world famous face of this enterprise.  Although the Soviet “empire of spirits” produced several brands of other titled fragrances, such as “Queen of Spades” (issued to the 150th anniversary of A.S. Pushkin), “Red Poppy”, “Stone Flower”, the fragrance “Red Moscow” remained this day is memorable and welcome.  And to announce now that these spirits are your favorites is not at all embarrassing, but even juicy.  And not because fashion is changeable, but because this fragrance is really beautiful.  It has already become a classic, along with well-known French brands.  But here again a new historical picture - the <span>Soviet Union</span> collapsed <span>.</span>  New revolution. </p><h2>  New star </h2>

As a kind of return to the origins - Nouvelle Etoile, which in translation into Russian sounds no less gentle and reverent - "New Star".

    <p>  Unconditional and unconditional is the primacy of France in the creation of aromas.  So during the years of Soviet rule, the most famous domestic perfume factory worked closely with eminent French perfumers, and in 2004 a new Russian-French enterprise was officially registered on its basis. </p><p>  Perfume “Red Moscow” is a legend that, along with ballet, has become a kind of symbol of the USSR.  It was readily bought up by foreigners, since the quality corresponded to the famous French brands. </p><p>  I would like to wish that the name Nouvelle Etoile does not change for a long time, and never again there is a shadow of doubt prompting to ask a question about what was called the factory that produces perfumes after the revolution? </p>
