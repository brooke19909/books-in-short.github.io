    <h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  <span>Mount Elbrus</span> is located north of the Main <span>Caucasus Range</span> <span>.</span>  Where is its double top located?  This needs to be understood in more detail.  The fact is that the mountain is a rather bulky object.  Its spurs are located immediately in two administrative-territorial units: Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay-Cherkessia.  The peaks have a classic form for the volcano.  Therefore, they are especially interesting for scientists.  At the beginning of the last century, scholars chose Elbrus, where the highest laboratory for the study of geophysics problems is located on our continent to this day.  The mountain has two peaks, each more than five thousand meters.  Between them is the so-called "saddle".  That is, the core of the mountain below the peaks is about three hundred meters.  I must say that this territory belongs to the European part.  This is the pride of Caucasians and Russians.  After all, Elbrus is the highest point of Europe.  Its coordinates: 43 ° 21'11 "north latitude 42 ° 26'13" east longitude. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mountaineering </h2>

One of the most famous centers of mountaineering is Elbrus, where there are many bases for the strong and severe climbers of the mountains.  It is believed that its peaks are simple enough for climbing.  Despite this, many people die there every year who do not have an adequate level of training or overestimate their capabilities.  For specialists, Elbrus is one of the stages of skill.

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  From anywhere in the world you need to fly to Mineralnye Vody.  There, change to ground transport.  From the airport towards Elbrus there are many minibuses.  The nearest <span>railway stations</span> are in Pyatigorsk and Nalchik.  From these points to the peaks of Elbrus also need to get on wheels.  The beauty of the landscape begins when you approach the complex at a distance of one hundred kilometers.  I must say that many tourists will accompany you on a trip to Elbrus, where there are a number of health and sports facilities.  You will find yourself in a special "country" with its own climate, attractions, and history.  All this is worth a look! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Another Elbrus </h2><p>  This name in the minds of people causes only one association - the highest point in Europe.  But such a name has not only the Elbrus volcano.  Where is his namesake located and what is this object like?  We'll have to go to Iran to explore the Elbrus mountain system, where the Demavend stratovolcano is located.  This peak is comparable in height to our “miracle”.  He is active and quietly scares the locals, puffing from time to time with smoke. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mount elbrus where is" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15236/399548.jpg" width="361"></div>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  The history of Elbrus is inextricably linked with the name of Tamerlane.  They say that he climbed with the army and turned to the Gods for help.  After that, the commander became almost invincible.  An immense amount has been created about the origin of the <span>name of the volcano of</span> legends.  Each people living on its spurs tried to combine their history with the mountain.  They just didn’t call him!  Perhaps the most beautiful name is Mountain of Happiness.  There is a legend according to which Elbrus was called the prince who killed his beloved daughter.  It came out as a result of an error.  The noble husband immediately froze, turning into a mountain mourning for loss.  An interesting version is that kefir, so beloved by the people today, is of Elbrus origin.  It was invented and distributed to the whole world. </p>
