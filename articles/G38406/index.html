This separation allows you to most realistically reflect the picture of costs and redistribute costs to other accounts.

    <p>  Also, troubles can arise in the transportation of finished products.  When <span>processing the primary documentation,</span> there are times when the amounts billed for payment do not correspond to the rates stated in the contract.  Such shortcomings can be caused both by a conscious overvaluation, and by errors in arithmetic.

    <p>  The accounting policy of the organization fixes the number of such checks, the timing and procedure.  Inventory plays an important controlling role, helps reduce the number of ‚Äúdead‚Äù payments and get rid of bad debt by <span>forgiving the debt to the</span> partner. </p><h2>  What is bad debt </h2><p>  Any debt whose due date has been missed can be called dubious.  It should be borne in mind that if a taxpayer has overdue payables to the same partner, then such a debt is not doubtful.  Perhaps, to solve such a situation, it is enough to enlist counter obligations.  Debt, which was recognized as doubtful, can be written off unilaterally after three years ago. </p>
