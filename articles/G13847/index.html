  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a double boiler for personal use?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We are all used to the fact that in the kitchen we always have assistants at hand who become irreplaceable in special moments.  For example, a double boiler is useful not only when a person is trying to join a healthy lifestyle.  It helps to prepare special dietary dishes that can help restore body functions after serious illness.  You can use it even when there is a need to lose a couple of three extra pounds.  But in order for the described device to cope with its duties, it is necessary to choose the right model. </p><p>  Important selection criteria </p><p>  How to choose a suitable double boiler?  It is important to consider several important points at once.  When buying, you need to focus on the power of the device, the principle of operation, the type of control, the presence of certain functions and the manufacturer.  For example, a tefal double boiler from a French manufacturer does not need advertising.  She is the embodiment of all advanced technical ideas, and the cooking processes are maximally simplified. </p><p>  The assortment of one line is presented in a wide variety, therefore, in choosing a particular model, it is necessary to focus primarily on the power of the device.  It can vary from 400 to 5100 watts.  The higher this indicator, the larger the double boiler will be.  A device with large baskets is convenient to use in large families.  But before buying them, you need to make sure the condition of the wiring.  She may simply not stand it.  Therefore, a steam cooker with a capacity of 5100 watts is more suitable for restaurants.  There, a separate line is allocated for them.  For a home, it is better to choose something between the indicated parameters. </p><p>  The device of the double boiler is quite simple.  It consists of a metal case, a heating heater and baskets in which products are placed.  The volume of one basket varies depending on the model.  It can be 1.5-3.5 liters.  In the complete set there is necessarily a closed non-perforated bowl for cereals.  Baskets can be transparent and opaque, with removable bottoms, oval and round.  There is no difference in functionality.  Therefore, the choice of form is a matter of taste.  To see immediately all the variety of existing configurations will allow the TTS television store. </p><p>  Choosing a double boiler, experts recommend paying attention to the design of pallets.  Some devices have one pallet for all baskets.  In this case, the smells in the preparation of different dishes will be mixed.  Not everyone likes it.  In this case, it is necessary to choose a double boiler, which under each basket has its own pan. </p><p>  And another important indicator is the type of device control.  It can be mechanical and electronic.  The difference is one: with mechanical control and setting the operating mode, as well as the timer, you just need to turn the switch on the number of divisions that you need. </p><p>  For electronic control, a keypad and display are used.  It is on it that all the stages of the work of the double boiler are displayed.  Note!  Electronic models have more functions than mechanical ones.  They have the option of delaying the start, for example, or keeping the food warm for a specified time.  Electronic steamers are good, but not everyone is able to quickly understand complex electronics.  And this also needs to be considered when choosing a double boiler for personal use. </p></div></article>
