  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lace Crochet - Secrets of Mastery</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What girl did not crochet lace at school, because this is a very standard task in labor lessons.  But many fall in love with this occupation and continue to knit for many years.  Do-it-yourself lace has a special charm.  Light, graceful, like snowflakes, but at the same time it seems to give off heat.  They are dear to the heart, and the process of creating them brings true pleasure. </p><p>  Crocheting lace is a difficult and at the same time simple task.  After all, it all depends on the pattern and your experience.  You can create a thin web of lace using various threads: cotton, wool, synthetic, and even fabric cut into thin strips.  The thread must be selected depending on the product. </p><p>  Starting the process of crocheting lace, the main thing is to determine for yourself how it is convenient for you to hold the hook.  Starting to knit any product, you will use the technique of knitting a chain of air loops.  To do this, enter the hook under the working thread, which is located on the index finger of the left hand.  Then, rotate it counterclockwise 360 ‚Äã‚Äãdegrees from left to right, as a result of which the thread will twist and a loop will appear with an overlap located under the hook.  For the formation of subsequent chain loops, it is necessary to throw the working thread on the hook and stretch it through the previously formed loop, then tighten. </p><p>  The Irish lace technique was developed by Riego de Blancardier.  This mademoiselle made lace, which closely resembled Venetian, but was carried out very quickly with a hook.  Convenient and simple technique quickly won the hearts and hands of craftswomen.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãIrish crochet lace is the creation of individual elements, such as flowers, leaves and the like.  Each element is subsequently connected to others using a grid. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This method helped to divide the work, as each knitter was involved in creating individual motives that worked best for him.  At that time, both men and women knitted, and each work was a masterpiece and was not shown to anyone until graduation. </p><p>  The main <span>thing</span> in the technique of creating Irish lace is <span>composition.</span>  Since all finished parts in the future should make up a single picture, which should look good after assembly.  Also no less important point is the correct construction of the pattern, taking into account all the features of the figure. </p><p>  Now, using the technique of <span>crocheting Irish</span> lace, they create collars, dresses, blouses and even umbrellas.  Not everyone can create masterpieces in this technique; a huge reserve of patience and creative imagination are needed. </p><p>  How to draw lace in order to further use the pattern for knitting, only some know.  Basically, they use ready-made schemes from magazines and books.  But true perfection can only be created by oneself. </p><p>  In order to be able to consider all the beauty of the finished product, it must be starched.  It is necessary to make a thick solution (dilute three teaspoons of starch with half a liter of water).  Then the lace is laid out on a flat, clean surface, spreading every detail and waiting until it dries.  After this procedure, you can use lace. </p><p>  The hook must be selected in accordance with the size specified in the instructions.  Well, if the size is not specified, then you can choose it yourself.  For knitting more loose, use a thick hook, and for tight knitting - a thin one.  Keep in mind that tightly knitted lace looks much more spectacular. </p><p>  Another important point is the assembly of the product.  As an example, if the lace is later sewn onto linen, then it must be washed before that.  This is done so that after attaching the lace, waves do not form.  It is always better to take fabric with a margin. </p><p>  Follow all the rules and be careful about work, and you will get an excellent result. </p>
