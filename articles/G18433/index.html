This beautiful historical building is a cult monument of architecture of the late XIX century.  The design of the facades is dominated by East Muslim motifs.  This allowed the unknown architect to build such a unique romantic image of the mosque. </p><p>  The Azimov mosque is a <span>monument of the Muslim</span> religion with a characteristic cult Tatar architecture.  It is a magnificent attraction, loved not only by local residents, but also by tourists from all over the world.  Today, the mosque is an object of the Muslim community. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Azimov mosque" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1974282.jpg" width="532"></div>

    <h2>  Mosque building </h2><p>  Many experts in Kazan recognize it as the best in the city for its beauty.  The double-green mosque of light green color differs from the others in the three-tiered minaret, starting not from the roof of the main building, like most similar structures, but from the ground itself, from its own foundation.  According to some travelers who visited Kazan in the late XIX and early XX centuries, the minaret of the Asimov mosque is similar to the old minarets in the city of Constantinople. </p><p>  Modern interior reconstruction corresponds to the perfection of the facades.  And the fence is magnificent and unusual complements the excellent architectural design of the building.  The minaret rises at 51 meters high. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that in Soviet times the color of the mosque was red (because of the brick of this color). </p><p>  Today, one of the best religious buildings in its architecture is the Azimov Mosque (Kazan).  Address: st.  Fatkullina, building 15. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Azimov Mosque (Kazan): address" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1974280.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The history of the Azimov <span>mosque in Kazan is</span> amazing <span>.</span>  It all started with the fact that in its place stood a completely unremarkable wooden Muslim mosque without a minaret, built in 1804 for workers at a soap factory.  In 1851, the richest merchant of those times, Mustafa Azimov, at his own expense, built a new mosque in this place with a minaret, but also of wood.  From 1887 to 1890, his son Murtaza Azimov <span>(a merchant of the first guild)</span> built a more spacious stone mosque.  The merchant‚Äôs own funds were also invested in this construction. </p><p>  The name of the talented architect who created such a romantic image of the building, unfortunately, remains unknown.  And the name of the mosque came from the name of the Asimovs. </p><p>  In connection with the emergence of the state‚Äôs anti-religious policy in the 1930s, the Azimov Mosque was closed and stood inactive until 1992.  It opened after restoration under the project of Rafik Bilyalov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Azimov Mosque (Kazan)" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1974281.jpg" width="570"></div>

Even today you can see on his fence an old sign with the inscription "Foreigners are not allowed to enter."  According to rumors, the guards of the industrial enterprise were so vigilant that they were not allowed on the street.  Sabanche (now Fatkullina St.) is not only foreigners, but even local residents.  Therefore, many did not know about the existence of a mosque. </p><p>  During the Soviet period, in its halls at different times housed a school of projectionists and a movie theater. </p><h2>  About the interior of the mosque </h2><p>  For tourists, the Azimov mosque is closed.  Excursions inside are not carried out due to the fact that the staircase in the minaret is wooden and very dilapidated.  According to the imam, it is not safe to climb it. </p><p>  At the top of the minaret there are hexagonal stars known as the "stars of David."  In fact, such religions are used by many religions, including Islam.  In the Muslim religion, this symbol is called the "seal of Suleiman." </p><p>  Usually, a six-pointed star as an independent symbol is rarely used in Islamic murals, so it is "hidden" in a more complex ornament.  The fence of the Asimov mosque made of wood is original and unique. </p><p>  One of the curious features of the mosque are ... cats.  Parishioners and the local imam are constantly feeding them, so they took root there.  And before visiting the temple, tourists can stock up on something edible for cats.  According to the Qur'an, such a good deed (‚Äúsadaka‚Äù) does not go unnoticed by Allah, he grants the remission of sins. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Excursion: Azimov Mosque" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1974283.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Legend </h2><p>  Where else could the name of the Azimov mosque come from?  There is one urban legend that claims that the mosque is named after Isaac Asimov, a science fiction writer from America.  Parishioners of the mosque often say that Isaac was born somewhere in the area, and they took him to another country when he was 2 years old.  In an interview, the writer even admitted that he would like to return to these native places and see the mosque. </p><p>  However, the legend remains only a legend, no matter how beautiful it is. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It is important to note that the Abdulgafarovs - a dynasty of clergymen are quite closely connected with the amazing history of the Azimov mosque.  The ancestor was Abdulvali Abdulgafarov, who served as the imam-khatib of this mosque from mid-1849 to the end of 1888.  Subsequently, he was replaced by Khisametdin Abdulvalievich Abdulgafarov (son), who served in the mosque until 1923. </p>
