In general, this small Italian town is very nice and convenient, located near the most important excursion points - Venice and Rome, San Marino and Pisa, Bologna, Urbino and the castle of San Leo.  It is from this town that it is convenient to travel in any direction, have fun, expand your horizons, and then return to Rimini hotels, comfortable, elite and created in order to serve the pleasure of its guests. </p><p>  Fun, diverse, popular and loved by many tourists, the resort of Rimini offers an unrivaled vacation on the beaches and in the waters of the Adriatic Sea - a true Italian holiday.  This can be done, for example, in the wonderful Accademia Hotel, which is located in the Rivabella area on the Adriatic coast.  This complex can offer its guests comfortable rooms with modern decoration, free parking and an excellent restaurant with dishes of not only original and unique Italian cuisine, but also dishes from around the world.  This hotel, like many other Rimini hotels, is very well located - from it you can get to the Fiera di Rimini exhibition center, as well as convenient areas for <span>cycling,</span> within a few minutes <span>.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel offers ample opportunities to relax on its own territory - sun terraces and pools, gyms and fitness centers, <span>restaurants, cafes,</span> bars and gardens, bike rental and the opportunity to use the Internet terminal.  The hotel is convenient primarily for families who come on vacation with children, as they have all the opportunities for relaxation. </p><p>  Rimini hotels, most popular with foreign tourists, are usually located in the central part of the city.  So ‚ÄúHotel Rosabianca‚Äù, functioning throughout the year, host a huge number of guests.  Therefore, if you are planning a vacation to this Italian town, you should take care of booking your rooms in advance, otherwise you might be left with nothing.  Hotel ‚ÄúRosabianca‚Äù is the hospitality and comfort of a resort corner of Rimini, located almost in the very center of the city - in the Marina Centro area.  Here you can lie on the beach and swim in the warm waves of the Adriatic Sea, you can take a bike ride or go for a walk and excursions to the historic city center.  The only drawback of this complex may be that pets are not allowed on its territory, which will undoubtedly upset people traveling in the company of their dogs or cats. </p><p>  The most successful option, combining the comfort and coziness of living with a low charge, is the Mercure Rimini Artis Hotel.  Its good location on the Adriatic coast allows guests to take romantic walks in picturesque places or spend all their free time on sunny beaches without leaving the territory.  Those who wish can relax in the swimming pools or on the terraces, sit in the bar or enjoy the vibrant nightlife organized by this and many other Rimini hotels, take a trip to the Fiabilandia theme park or relax in massage and beauty parlors. </p><p>  For the most part, reviews of Rimini hotels are positive, but some of them may have problems with children or pets.  That is why it is worth collecting information in advance about the place in which you are going to spend your vacation, and clarify all the necessary details. </p>
