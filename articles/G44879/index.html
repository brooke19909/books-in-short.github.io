    <h2>  Znamensky Cathedral </h2><p>  The magnificent church building is located on Ilyin - a street near the Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior.  The cathedral was erected in 1682.  Earlier in this place was a disassembled temple of the Sign of the Mother of God, relating to buildings of the 14th century.  The cathedral was created at the initiative of <span>Metropolitan Cornelius.</span>  The construction became possible thanks to the means of the Hagia Sophia.  The construction was carried out by local carpenters.  Also, capital archers were involved in the construction work. </p><p>  The consecration of the cathedral took place in 1688.  Prior to this, the temple was badly damaged by fire, but was rebuilt.  In 1689, the iconostases were equipped in the main altar and aisles.  Their frames are made in the technique of "flem" thread.  History has not preserved the names of many remarkable masters who participated in the creation of the iconostasis.  Later, an ensemble of wall frescoes was created by Kostroma icon painters led by Ivan Bakhmatov.  Today the Znamensky Cathedral is included in the list of ‚ÄúHistorical Monuments of Novgorod and its Environs (UNESCO)‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The cathedral was built in a traditional manner for Russian architecture.  It is a five-domed, four-winged temple with three apses.  There is a basement and a two-story bypass gallery.  Facades are separated by shoulder blades.  They end with false curtains, which are decorated with frescoes.  Below them is a frieze with a drawing ‚ÄúPeacock Eye‚Äù, characteristic of Moscow and Kostroma monuments of church architecture.  The platbands on the windows are made of figured brick.  The gallery is decorated with tiled belts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the course of repeated rebuilding, the cathedral largely lost its original appearance.  It is known that restoration work was carried out in 1745, as well as in 1844-1845.  The need for repairs was caused by fires.  At the end of the 18th century, funds for updating the cathedral were donated by Countess A. A. Orlova-Chesmenskaya.  In the course of numerous reconstructions, the shapes of the main square and the western porch were changed.  The porch on the south side was lost.  The northern part was erected again.  Also, murals on the drums were lost.  New records were put on the original painting.  Some historical monuments of Novgorod and its environs were significantly damaged during the hostilities. </p>

    <h2>  Restoration work </h2><p>  The war did not spare the Znamensky Cathedral.  During the German occupation of Novgorod, barracks for German soldiers were arranged in its building.  Many icons were exported.  The carved frames of the iconostasis were burned to the ground.  The fate of many icons lost during the war years is still unknown.  The historical monuments of Novgorod and its environs were actively restored in the post-war period. </p><p>  At this time (1950-1070 of the 20th century), a lot of work was done to restore the cathedral and restore its historical appearance.  Experienced workshop specialists (NSNRPM) took part in it.  Restoration work took place in several stages.  Initially, repairs were carried out.  In 1960, after its completion, the restoration of the cathedral began.  It was carried out under the leadership of G. M. Stender.  The restoration of the frescoes was attended by Moscow artists G.S. Bakhtel and V. G. Bryusov, as well as the art team of the NSNRPM. </p>

    <h2>  Yaroslavovo courtyard </h2><p>  The historical monuments of Novgorod and its environs are represented by yet another unique ensemble of structures of ancient Russian architecture that has the status of a reserve.  Yaroslav's courtyard is named after the mighty Prince Yaroslav the Wise.  The princely palace was erected in the central part of the city near Torg.  It was the most magnificent castle complex in all of Northern Europe.  During archaeological excavations around the palace, the remains of wooden bridges and flooring from the bones of cows were removed.  They connected the princely palace with St. Nicholas Cathedral and the Paraskeva Friday Church. </p><p>  Not far from the palace was the famous Veche Square with a wooden platform erected on it.  On it during public meetings were the highest Novgorod dignitaries.  The square adjoined Yaroslav's courtyard.  It was a place of brisk trade.  Novgorod and foreign merchants brought here numerous goods: jewelry, fabrics, various spices, furs and other household items of that era.  Restoration of this territory also began in the post-war period. </p><h2>  Veliky Novgorod today </h2><p>  Since 1950, many other historical monuments of Novgorod and its environs have been restored.  <span>Archaeological excavations</span> and scientific research in the city continue to this day.  This land hides a lot of interesting secrets and mysteries, so they will happen for more than a dozen centuries.  Nowadays, the Yaroslavl courtyard, the Znamensky Cathedral and the Church of the Nativity are objects that are definitely worth a visit in Veliky Novgorod. </p>
