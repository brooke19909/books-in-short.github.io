The leader in popularity among visitors - both vacationers and business travelers - is the Amichi Grand 4 * hotel and restaurant complex. </p><p>  In this article we will describe this establishment in detail.  Its original, reminiscent of the donjon of a medieval castle, dark blue mirror glass building can be seen from afar.  The address of Amici Grand Hotel is known to all local taxi drivers, and finding a hotel is easy.  Let's see what rooms this complex offers its guests, and what is its infrastructure.  An informative base for the review was the reviews of tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel in the center of Krasnodar" class="if uuid-3229015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3229015.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel and restaurant complex is located in the heart of the city.
