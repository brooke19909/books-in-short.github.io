    <p>  Krasnodar Territory is a place where single people, newlyweds, couples with children and noisy companies go.  Developed infrastructure is focused on several types of recreation.  Sanatoria can be divided into climatic, balneological and mud therapy.  The Krasnodar Territory attracts tourists from all over the world, because in order to receive high-quality treatment, it is not necessary to cover thousands of kilometers and look for suitable establishments in Europe. </p><p>  The Black Sea and Azov health resorts are popular not only among elderly people with serious problems, but also among young guys and girls who visit mineral water pools and mud baths for prevention.  Pleasant warm water cheers up and soothes the nervous system, so it‚Äôs fair to say that a person who has returned home after a week's vacation in the Black Sea sanatorium looks more balanced and young. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to take on a trip to the sea </h2><p>  As a rule, they begin to plan vacations from the very beginning of summer.  Vacationers in advance seek to purchase all the necessary things, manage to inspect all hotels, but on the day of the trip they forget about basic items.  Family fees must start at least one week before departure.  Oddly enough, but most often forgotten at home are beach items.  Swimwear, slates, sunscreens and goggles, of course, are sold in any resort shop, but it is extremely annoying to leave a specially purchased accessory that I really wanted to wear at a new vacation spot.  In the evening, the air temperature in sunny cities drops significantly, so you can not do without a sweater with jeans or a tracksuit.  If you have finally decided where it is better to relax <span>in the Krasnodar Territory,</span> study the terrain and take the necessary medicines with you - acclimatization will become noticeable for people of all ages.  Refuse from heavy equipment - laptops, dvd players only interfere with a good rest. </p><h2>  The Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov or the Black Sea? </h2><p>  Most tourists go on vacation with the goal of dabbling around for days on end in warm water that cannot be compared to liquids even in the most expensive pool.  Many are faced with a dilemma: <span>where is it better to relax</span> in the Krasnodar Territory - in the Black Sea or Azov resort.  In terms of climatic conditions, purity of water, prices and impressions of the rest, both options are not much different from each other. </p>

    <p>  Water in the Black Sea is suitable for swimming in every sense: it is invigorating, not too salty and crystal clear.  Maximum transparency (77 meters) was recorded near the Senoda.  The coast is rocky, because of which it will not be possible to make long trips along the <span>coastline.</span>  <span>The Black Sea is</span> very deep, and young parents will have to look closely at their babies, so it is better to put a rubber pool on the beach so that the child does not have the temptation to splash in sea water on an equal basis with adults.  The water is cold and salty, because of which not every tourist decides to get out of a warm sauna in a sanatorium. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>The coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov is</span> strewn with golden white sand and small shells.  <span>The water is cloudy</span> due to the abundance of healing mud at the bottom.  The maximum depth is only 8 meters.  Still, the best place to relax with children and the elderly is the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  Krasnodar Territory is famous for its cozy cottages and hotel yards throughout Europe, so the vacation will be as comfortable as possible.  The water is almost unsalted and warms up quickly, so it is especially pleasant to swim in it. </p><h2>  Where better to relax in the Krasnodar Territory: TOP-5 resorts </h2><p>  Olginka is a large, but inexpensive resort-type village.  In the summer, the streets are fragrant with the aromas of planted flowers, so that vacationers enjoy walking more.  The closest houses to the beach are located just two minutes walk from the sea. </p><p>  Dzhubga is a great place to relax with children.  The beach has many attractions and a luxurious water park.  The resort is recognized as one of the most beautiful places in the Caucasus, in addition, it is the most unpolluted: from the production points there is only a winery. </p><p>  Lazarevskoye is a large village for active vacationers.  On the territory there are a huge number of entertainment venues: night clubs, casinos, strip clubs.  Due to the large influx of holidaymakers, it is already very difficult to find a free spot on the beach from the middle of summer. </p>

    <p>  Makopse is a quiet and pleasant place with cozy houses near the beach.  The lack of entertainment facilities and the magnificent nature are the reason why it is better to choose a resort for elderly people and families with small children. </p><p>  Dederkoy is a resort town combining developed infrastructure and at the same time nature untouched by civilization.  Thanks to its excellent ecology, it is suitable for mothers and families with children to relax. </p><h2>  Yeysk - the cradle of Azov </h2><p>  Thousands of resorts with excellent service are located in Russia, but tourists prefer to combine business with pleasure and choose places where you can relax and at the same time improve your health.  For these purposes, a small city near the coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov - Yeysk is perfectly suitable.  The Krasnodar Territory is waiting with open arms for everyone to relax in the period from early May to mid-autumn.  The waters of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov are shallow and fresh, so in 90% of cases, Yeysk resorts are chosen by families with children and elderly people.  The resort occupies one of the leading positions in the quality of balneological and mud springs.  You can get to Yeysk by air or land - the distance from Moscow to it is exactly 1000 kilometers. </p><h2>  Children to Anapa! </h2>

    <p>  Most parents are afraid to send their offspring to the camp.  School children will surely embarrass their mothers and fathers, who in the summer decided to go on a romantic trip to the sea, but is it fair to leave them at home with the care of grandparents?  The magnificent <span>camps "Petrel",</span> "Sunrise", "Wave" are located in a city like Anapa.  Krasnodar Territory is the best place to relax with the whole family or children without parents.  The camps are located near the coast, the sea near them is shallow, so the children will be completely safe.  The children are guaranteed a beautiful tan, a lot of impressions and new friends, and counselors will transfer their skills to boys and girls. </p><h2>  Sochi Primorye </h2><p>  The resort town attracts tourists from all over Russia and neighboring countries with its colorful climate.  Here, relaxing on the beach can be combined with hiking in the mountains, horseback riding and attending interesting events.  At the suggestion of the governor of the Kuban, the New Wave music festival can be moved from Jurmala to Sochi, so vacationers will be able to personally attend this event.  Fans of cinema will be able to see first-hand the famous models and actresses at the Kinotavr and Velvet Seasons. </p>

    <p>  Do you want to swim in the warm sea, sunbathe in the sun and enjoy exotic fruits from the trees?  It‚Äôs not necessary to go to Africa or Southeast Asia!  Traveling abroad is no longer so relevant, and the Russians prefer to go to the Krasnodar Territory.  "Where to go to rest?"  - a question that all people pose before themselves long before the first summer month. </p><p>  The city of Tuapse has long been famous for its hospitality and excellent service.  Even the most sophisticated tourist can not help but admire the bewitching nature of this region: on the one hand - virgin mountain peaks and icy waterfalls, on the other - the studied beaches washed by the gentle waves of the Black Sea.  People from all over the world travel to Tuapse for a wellness holiday: mineral springs and mud baths will help with the treatment of any ailment. </p><h2>  Fishing paradise </h2><p>  The Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov is a reservoir with seventy species of marine inhabitants, which are especially nice to catch from their own nets.  Choosing Yeysk, Kuchugury, Dolzhanka or other locality, you can combine hobbies with relaxation.  Azov is much better suited for fishing than the Black Sea coast.  The Krasnodar Territory is literally filled with ram, shemayka and other inhabitants, who are found in the market in any form at the lowest prices during the fishing season.  To make your holiday experience more vivid, stock up fishing rods and nets and go to a cozy bay.  The first successful catch in such a place is guaranteed! </p><h2>  How to choose a place to stay </h2><p>  If you have finally decided to go on vacation to the Krasnodar Territory, take the time to explore the area in which you plan to stay and select a hotel with a convenient distance from the sea.  Holiday villages are divided into several types depending on the cost of living. </p>

    <p>  Wealthy families with children will have a great time in a sanatorium, not far from which there is a water park, dolphinarium or summer playground for animated performances.  If you are going to heal, but do not yet know where it is better to relax in the Krasnodar Territory, give preference to a small, calm village.  As a rule, food and accommodation in such a place will be cheaper than in a large sanatorium, and you will be provided with real peace and relaxation. </p><p>  Regardless of which resort your attention was paid to, ring several hotels and make sure that there are available rooms.  Many families prefer to drive their own cars and take pets along with them.  To avoid unpleasant surprises upon arrival at the sanatorium, find out if there is a nearby parking lot and whether you can take a cat or a dog with you to your room.  Think through everything to the smallest detail, and the impressions of the rest in the Krasnodar Territory will remain the most striking! </p>
