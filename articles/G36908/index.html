    <p>  At the age of fifteen, Isis Valverde came to <span>Belo Horizonte</span> to study journalism.  In one of the shopping centers, she was noticed by a representative of a modeling agency.  Despite the parental ban, the girl saved the received business card and began to work as a model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the age of seventeen, she was offered a contract to work as a model in Istanbul and Tokyo.  But her parents did not give their consent, and she had to wait until she was eighteen years old to engage in modeling business.  Soon, Isis Valverde, whose photo is presented in the article, moved to Rio de Janeiro, where she had the opportunity to try herself in the cinema. </p><h2>  Successful career as an actress </h2>

    <p>  The model agency, where Isis Valverde worked, directed her to take tests at Globo.  Casting producer of the novel "Senorita" immediately approved the girl for the role of Ana.  The 2006 short story was a remake of the 1986 version.  Then the role of Ana was performed by <span>Patricia Pilar.</span> </p><p>  To approve the role, she had to fulfill an important condition.  The girl was forbidden to disseminate information about her participation in the project.  Only parents knew about the shoot.  The actress was supposed to hide until the thirty-second episode, in which the heroine revealed her appearance by refusing to vow to cover her face before the wedding.  The same trick was used in the film with Patricia Pilar twenty years ago. </p><p>  Isis Valverde accepted the conditions of the canal administration and led a secretive lifestyle for three months.  She had to tie a tight tail, wear a cap and big glasses.  She did not attend any social events, only occasionally visited the cinema. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The actress was very difficult during this period of her life.  She had to rent a room with another woman, pay utility bills, do housekeeping, refuse all castings.  The girl did not have enough money for a living, but she did not inform her parents about it.  Her nervous and physical exhaustion led her to lose forty-five kilograms and her hair began to fall out. </p><p>  But the actress did not give up.  Having become famous, she moved to Barra da Tijuca (a prestigious area).  She continues to collaborate with Globo, starring in new short stories. </p><p>  Filmography of the actress: </p><ul><li>  "Tropical Paradise" - Thelma; </li><li>  "Perfect Beauty" - Raquel; </li><li>  “Roads of India” - Camilla; </li><li>  “You, you, you” - Marcela; </li><li>  “Brazilians” - Katarina; </li><li>  “Brazil Avenue” - Suel; </li><li>  “Song of the Siren” - Seriya; </li><li>  “Western Caboclo” - Maria. </li></ul><h2>  Best Actress Roles </h2><p>  The fame came to the Brazilian after the role of Camilla, and later Suen in the paintings mentioned above. </p>

    <p>  In the film "Roads of India", which was released in 2009 and received the international Emmy Award, the heroine Camilla meets a young man from India named Ravi.  They marry, and the young wife moves to her husband’s homeland.  In India, she has to adapt to new unfamiliar conditions.  She plunged into a world with an unusual culture, but for the sake of love, she was ready to become a part of it. </p><p>  The actress admitted in an interview that she was completely unlike her character.  Unlike Camille, Isis Valverde, whose films conquered fans of Brazilian TV shows, considers herself to be straightforward and “down-to-earth”, and not romantic and sentimental. </p><p>  In 2012, the telenovela “Prospect of Brazil” was released.  The main events unfold between the two main characters.  Suan is a windy girl who loves football.  Her favorite hobby is meeting football players.  Valverde's approach to the on-screen image so delighted critics and spectators that in 2012 she won several awards in the nomination "Best Supporting Role". </p>
