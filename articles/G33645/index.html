    <h2>  Republic of Niger </h2><p>  Before you visit the capital city of the African state, it is worth a little talk about himself.  The name of the country comes from the Niger River, which carries its waves across the territory of <span>West Africa.</span>  In total, more than ten million people live in the republic.  These are representatives of the Hausa, Germa, Fula-ni, Tuareg peoples, who practice mostly Islam (80 percent) and paganism (14 percent). </p><p>  The capital of Niger is Niamey, and its neighbors are Algeria and Libya, Chad and Nigeria, Benin and Mali, Burkina Faso.  The country is headed by the president and the national assembly.  As an official, the country uses the Niger French language. </p>

    <p>  The country is hot and arid, but rainfall is not uncommon.  Flora is very scarce, sometimes absent altogether.  But here large animals are found: buffaloes, wild boars, giraffes, lions, elephants, antelopes, warthogs.  The best time to visit the exotic Niger is from November to February. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The river that gave life </h2><p>  So, the <span>Republic of Niger.</span>  Where is she, we have already figured out.  Now I want to stop on the river, which gave the country not only a name, but also life.  This is the main waterway of the whole region, and the name is translated from the local dialect as “Great River”, “River of Rivers” or “Flowing Water”.  On its banks there are several large cities, including the capital of Niger.  Like the Nile in <span>Egypt, the river</span> has a large fertile valley, perfect for agriculture.  In the Niger Delta area there is a unique attraction - a real oasis that arose on the site of a long-dried lake. </p><p>  Replenishing the tributary along the road, a powerful river flows into the <span>Gulf of Guinea,</span> which belongs to the Atlantic Ocean.  Vessels are cruising along it, from the sides of which you can freely enjoy the unique beauty of the Black Continent and one of its most important rivers. </p><h2>  Delightful Niamey </h2><p>  Before us is the capital of Niger, the glorious city of Niamey.  This is the largest settlement in the country, located in a picturesque place.  Founded in the late nineteenth century, it has been actively developed recently.  The name can be translated as "a place near a tree where they draw water."  It is here that the government bodies and headquarters of various international corporations are concentrated.  And in the city there are many attractions that are definitely worth seeing. </p><p>  Since the religion of Islam reigns in the Republic of Niger, we begin our inspection of interesting places with Muslim shrines.  And the main one is the Great Mosque (built around the seventies of the twentieth century).  171 steps lead to the minaret, and a breathtaking panorama opens from it.  On the colorful Big New Market, an obelisk is installed for those killed in both World Wars.  The National Museum has a grand collection of artifacts - objects of art and life, <span>national costumes,</span> artisans, and even dinosaur bones and the last tree of <span>the Sahara desert.</span>  Niamey has several parks of rare beauty and a zoological garden.  And the main sports events are held at the stadium.  General Seinie Kunche. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="niger religion islam" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/808052.jpg" width="600"></div>

In ancient times, it was the bottom of a large reservoir (Lake Chad is its remnants), then - a tropical forest.  Today it is a deserted and waterless place, covered with dunes, in which the wind walks. </p><p>  The city of Zinder, the former capital of the colonial Niger and the Damagaram Sultanate, is a border settlement that is famous for its unusual architecture, an abundance of mosques, and developed infrastructure.  Here is a very interesting quarter of Birni, where square-shaped houses, covered with original paintings, are located.  The descendants of the formidable ruler still live in the magnificent palace of the Sultan, but they do not affect life in the city. </p><p>  The mountains of Air in southern Sahara are low, but very picturesque, have volcanic origin.  Sharp black rocks were home to the Tuareg nomads.  Poor land could still feed livestock, and was even suitable for the cultivation of certain crops.  In the depths of the peaks lies the hot mineral spring Tafadek. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is nigga" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/808051.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The city of Dogonduchi is the capital of trade, and in Agadez you can see the ancient fort and old quarters, a mosque.  In Doso, the citadel and the royal castle are perfectly preserved.  Timia Oasis conquers with lush <span>orchards</span> located at the foot of the mountains.  The city of Iferouan is famous for its high level of agricultural development (due to the proximity of groundwater), crafts, jewelry and leather art. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Niger is a country unlike any other.  And only a true connoisseur is able to appreciate her rare beauty, having personally witnessed all these charms. </p>
