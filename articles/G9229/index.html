    <h2>  Reviews about the camp "Borok" </h2><p>  Both schoolchildren who visited the camp and their parents share their impressions of the camp.  Children and adolescents mainly write about the entertainment program, events, discos.  The older generation is much more concerned about issues related to life and nutrition, as well as the attitude of camp staff towards vacationers. </p><p>  It can be noted that in most cases reviews contain words of gratitude and appreciation.  Especially emphasized are comfortable conditions, quality food and attention to children.  It is also important that the <span>schedule of the day in the camp is</span> designed in such a way that the child almost never remains without classes. </p><p>  In fairness, it is worth saying that there are also dissatisfied parents.  But, speaking of the Borok camp, reviews of this nature relate mainly to staying in the institution of younger schoolchildren, who are not yet fully prepared for an independent holiday and are banally homesick.  And older children really like everything.  Therefore, many guys come here to rest for many years and come back with great pleasure. </p><h2>  Is it necessary to let a child go to a children's camp? </h2><p>  Many parents worry whether it is too early for the child to go to the camp, whether he will be safe there and whether he can take care of himself.  As a rule, these fears are groundless.  Indeed, in the camp, the student learns independence and the ability to fully communicate with peers.  And its safety and health will be taken care of by experienced and qualified teachers and medical workers. </p>
