Poker gained its popularity not only due to the fact that a game with relatively simple rules requires both a creative approach and logic, but also because it sometimes brings good income.  A large number of online platforms allows you to take part in various tournaments and earn money. </p><p>  It can be argued that the popularity of poker is only growing.  After all, this game is not only a way of earning, but also entertainment.  In addition, this game is for an interesting company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wired.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple and popular game." class="if uuid-2585596" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2585596.jpg"></div><h2>  Texas Hold'em Poker Basics </h2><p>  An interesting kind of poker is Texas Hold'em.  The game assumes the presence of two cards on hand and five community cards used by all players to collect a successful combination.  We'll talk about combinations a bit later, but for now, let's look at the basics of poker, which are necessary for beginners. </p><p>  Understanding the rules is not so difficult.  Be patient and practice playing online chip games using our tips.  A card game will open up new opportunities for you to earn money and have fun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bettingarbitrage.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clear game rules" class="if uuid-2585591" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2585591.jpg"></div><h2>  Texas Hold'em Game Process </h2><p>  We will tell you about the basics of poker: where to start playing, what are the best combinations of cards, tell you about the names of actions in the game, and also give a couple of tips for beginners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The process begins with a small bet for which all participants sitting at the table will fight.  It increases the activity of players. </p><p>  After that, those sitting at the dealer bring blinds into the common bank (blind - blind) - these are mandatory bets that are made blindly without cards.  An interesting moment: the first who makes a bet pays half, and the next - the minimum contribution. </p><p>  Cards on hands receive after a preflop.  Two cards are dealt in a circle, which will be a betting circle.  All participants receive a flop, these are three cards on the table, and trading begins.  The button puts the fourth card - this is called the turn.  Players make their bets.  The last round of betting and betting ends after the fifth card laid out on the table.  This is called a river. </p><p>  The player's task is to make the best combination at the table.  The combination is five of seven cards (two on hand and five on the table).  About which combinations are considered successful, we will talk very soon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.magiacasino.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Build your lucky combination" class="if uuid-2585589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2585589.jpg"></div><h2>  Available game </h2><p>  The basics of poker are accessible and understandable to everyone.  A little practice - and you will figure it out.  Do not be afraid to sit at the table. </p><p>  But before you start the game, you should know that Texas Hold'em comes in several forms: limited, unlimited and pot-limit.  The first has limits on bets, and the second implies the presence of a maximum bet by the player’s stack.  A pot limit game cannot go beyond the size of the pot with its bets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Having familiarized with the basics of poker, anyone can try themselves in the tournament, and it is likely that he will become the winner.  The main difference between Texas Hold'em and other types of poker is the blinds.  This betting obligation transfers each hand from a participant to another in a circle.  This is due to the constant change of dealer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sremskevesti.rs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Newbie Basics" class="if uuid-2585600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2585600.jpg"></div><h2>  Quit the party </h2><p>  The basics of poker for beginners should also remind future players that if you don’t like your cards after the deal, they seem unattractive and unpromising to you, you can always exit the deal.  It is your desire to play with the cards that have been drawn or not. </p><p>  But you need to exit the distribution if you do not support the minimum bet.  The first bet placed indicates its minimum, if you do not want or cannot support, you must discard the cards and exit the deal.  Cards are discarded into the draw. </p><p>  Any player can go to raise rates, but thereby he obliges to raise others.  If one of the players cannot support the raise, he must leave the game. </p><p>  The one who put all-in cannot leave the game, and he can’t leave ahead of time.  You should sit for scrapping, waiting for the end of the game and hope for a good jackpot. </p><p>  These are the simple basics of poker, but let's talk about winning combinations in this game. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.atkinsdietplus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A game that can generate revenue" class="if uuid-2585595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2585595.jpg"></div><h2>  Combinations </h2><p>  The combinations in the Texas Holding are different, let's look at them in descending order, starting from the strongest. </p><ul><li>  The Flash Royal is the rarest combination, but the strongest one.  This successful combination of cards consists of one ace to 10 of the same suit. </li><li>  "Street Flash" - a combination of 5 cards of the same suit.  It is necessary to collect from larger to smaller, without missing a rank.  Several players can collect several cards of the same suit. If this happens, the one with the strongest card wins. </li><li>  "Kare" is found a little more often.  To collect this combination, you need to collect 4 cards of the same rank, for example, several queens or 4. </li><li>  The Full House is no more often than the Flash Royal.  This is a combination of 5 cards, where 3 cards of one rank and two of the other.  If the opponent has Full House, then the winner is determined by the seniority of the two cards. </li><li>  "Street" - is assembled on the basis of the "Street Grand Piano".  However, in this combination, the suit is unimportant. </li><li>  "Three" is a combination of cards, where three cards of the same rank are collected.  This combination has several names, for example, “set” - two cards on hand and one on the table, and “thrips” - if vice versa. </li><li>  “Two pairs” - the combination is similar to “Full House”, however, there are pairs of two cards.  If the opponent has the same combination, then the winner is determined by the strength of the lower cards.  If this coincides, then the decisive kicker is the fifth card. </li><li>  “Pair” - two cards of the same rank. </li><li>  “High card” - if no one was able to collect combinations, the winner is determined by the highest card in your hand.  If one of your opponents has the same high card as yours, then it is compared as follows.  With an absolutely identical combination, the win is divided equally. <div class="photo" data-original="www.adda52.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Good card combinations" class="if uuid-2585588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2585588.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Common mistakes </h2><p>  Finally, we’ll complement our beginner poker basics with a short list of common mistakes. </p><ol><li>  Do not play every hand, be patient and wait for a combination that is successful for you, without wasting chips in vain. </li><li>  Do not be afraid of the game, beginners play quickly without hesitation.  Think over your actions. </li><li>  Poker can be called a competition, but to save here is not to be frightened.  Discard bad cards.  The spirit of rivalry is inappropriate here. </li><li>  Think about bets and your cards.  Do not bet too much and do not expect, when entering the game with strong cards, that you are lucky. </li><li>  Do not bluff too much, otherwise it will just be uninteresting to play with you. </li><li>  Do not sit down at the game, taking all your money. </li><li>  When playing poker, try not to think about your own, do not read in the clouds, but think over your moves, actions and actions of others.  You can guess whether they have a good combination or not. </li><li>  Feel free to change tables.  As a beginner, do not try to defeat experienced players. <div class="photo" data-original="www.freeholdemstrategy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Poker basics" class="if uuid-2585598" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2585598.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  Remember the rules of the game and avoid the mistakes of beginners, and then you will certainly succeed.  We hope you find the basics of poker for beginners useful.  Good game! </p>
