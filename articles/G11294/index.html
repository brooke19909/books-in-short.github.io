  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The principle of operation of SLR cameras</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most common mistakes of novice photographers is their too much hope for the achievements of modern technology.  Digital photography forums overwhelm newcomer jokes.  For example, a person has a great desire to learn to take good pictures, but does not want to understand photos.  He hopes that his brand-new SLR camera will do everything for him, and good photos will be obtained on the machine, but miracles do not exist.  Subsequently, the novice photographer ceases to engage in this hobby, having spent a large amount of money on it (buying a SLR camera), or begins to read about the correct photography.  Our article will be useful to the second category of beginners, who will be interested to know the principle of the SLR operation, its differences from a conventional digital camera. </p><p>  The first thing that is easy to replace is the similarity of appearance of SLR cameras and digital cameras, except for overall dimensions. <noindex>  <span>Sony SLR cameras</span> </noindex>  compared to conventional digital cameras are large.  But the SLR has a completely different principle of operation.  To begin with, the SLR camera allows the photographer to view the image the same as it looks.  And in a digital camera, the image is edited before it hits the screen, this is another difference between them and DSLRs.  They do not have any additional electronic parts and wires between the image and the photographer, which can distort the image in any way. </p><p>  Therefore, SLR cameras are called SLR cameras, since the image enters the viewfinder passing only through a certain number of lenses and a swivel mirror mounted inside the camera.  Due to this, it does not distort.  But such an explanation does not fully express the principle of the operation of SLR cameras.  To get a more detailed explanation, let's track the path of the ray of light that creates our image.  The first thing the image falls on the lens of the lens, and there is refraction.  Physics explains this by saying that you have the ability to reduce or enlarge the image as you wish.  After light passes through the lens of the lens, it goes to the rotary mirror of the camera, after which it falls directly into the viewfinder at the pentaprism of refraction.  You can say in the viewfinder you see a reflection of what is happening in front of the lens.  Some <noindex>  <span>Nikon SLR cameras</span> </noindex>  can have two lenses - one for shooting, and the second for previewing the image. </p><p>  What happens immediately at the time of photographing? </p><p>  Having taken the desired position and aimed the lens in the right direction, the photographer presses the shutter button.  At the same moment, the rocker pushes the pivoting mirror up, blocking the viewfinder.  Therefore, at the very moment of shooting, nothing is visible there.  Further, the light beam goes the same way as when viewing the image through the viewfinder, but instead of being reflected in the viewfinder, it is displayed on the photosensitive element.  In SLR cameras, it is a matrix (image sensor).  In film soap dishes they are actually the film itself.  The time it takes for the shutter to open is called the release delay. </p><p>  In this article, we familiarized ourselves with the standard operation scheme of a single-lens reflex digital camera. </p></div></article>
