Collecting as a hobby and a way to make money</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Almost all people collect various items that are similar in external parameters or tied to a specific event.  It can be photographs, letters, postcards, stamps, coins, items of clothing, or even what, in the eyes of an outsider, would seem like rubbish. </p><h2>  A hobby or a way to make money? </h2><p>  The collector sits in each of us, and this craving can become a serious occupation.  For some it‚Äôs just a hobby, but for others it‚Äôs a way to make money. </p><p>  The most interesting and common collectibles are coins.  The 20th century was rich in events; Tsarist Russia was replaced by the USSR, followed by Russia.  In circulation, in museums, in private collections and just in the ground there were a wide variety of specimens, with different emblems, from different materials.  How much are the coins of Russia and the USSR, to determine is not so simple because of the abundance of factors affecting the price.  In our country, in addition to standard coins, they are issued dedicated to various events: Olympic, jubilee, etc. </p><h2>  How much are Russian coins? </h2>

    <p>  Such information is especially interesting to those who have not inherited from grandparents, parents of old Soviet rubles.  It would seem what value the Russian ruble can have, the nominal value of which is one ruble.  Demand creates supply, and the rarity and interest of collectors creates the value of Russian coins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The average price of Russian coins varies from face value to 20 thousand rubles.  Particularly rare specimens are estimated at 100 thousand rubles.  All coins are similar to each other, therefore, copies that are different from the total mass have the highest value.  How much are Russian coins in your pocket?  Perhaps they do not have the stigma of the mint?  The cost of such a coin is several times greater than its face value. </p><h2>  Collectibles </h2><p>  According to some criteria, coin collecting is divided into three groups: weather jacket, commemorative coins, collecting by variety. </p><p>  Pogodovka - collecting coins with a distribution by year of issue.  Now there are special magazines to which a list of coins is applied to simplify the search. </p><p>  Commemorative coins - this is the most massive collection direction available to any citizen of the Russian Federation.  It is not necessary to have reference books on numismatics and a magnifying glass to distinguish a jubilee coin from a regular one.  Their release is timed to some anniversary date or a significant event.  Another plus of this direction is that it is not necessary to know how much the commemorative coins of Russia cost.  In the year of manufacture and in the next couple of years they can be purchased at face value. </p><p>  Collecting by variety is a rather narrow direction in which knowledge in numismatics is necessary.  Some coins have factory defects, or they are issued in a very small batch.  This raises their value hundreds of times. </p><h2>  Types of Russian coins </h2>

Beginning in 1992, mints began producing specimens with a double-headed eagle on the reverse.  The value of the coins of 1991-93 is small, there are separate instances where the inscription is removed from the rim or the plumage of the eagle has a different pattern.  There are also types of 100-ruble coins that bear the inscription ‚Äúfifty rubles‚Äù on the reverse.  Such are of interest only to real collectors who do this not for the sake of earning.  These are all coins in denominations from 1 ruble to 100. </p><p>  The next batch of coins falls on the time period from 1997 to 2014. There are already pennies from 1 to 50 and from 1 to 10 rubles.  The value of such coins depends on a dozen little things.  They are made of different metals, in different mints.  Prices for Russian coins vary from face value and above, depending on the small details of the picture.  Feathers at the eagle, the stigma of the mint at different angles and different thicknesses, lines of letters of different definitions, etc. can merge. </p>

    <p>  Commemorative coins perfectly complement the list of Russian coins.  There are several sets: "Ministry of Russia", "Ancient <span>Cities", "Hero Cities",</span> "Federal Subjects".  There are also individual coins issued in honor of the first flight into space, World War II.  Their value is clear and most understandable.  Children like a variety of pictures, and they are collected just like that.  The fact that such coins become more expensive every year, children will learn much later. </p>

    <p>  Anniversary are divided into bimetallic and ordinary tens.  The cost of bimetallic varies depending on the rarity of the batch (from 150 rubles to 500), the usual dozen - from <span>50 rubles</span> to 450. </p><h2>  How to determine the value of Russian coins? </h2><p>  If you do not want to use the services of a specialist in numismatics, you will have to arm yourself with a magnifying glass, a directory of factory defects and visit several exchanges or auctions.  Each of these resources has its own price, but they differ, as a rule, not too much.  To determine how much Russian coins cost from your collection, you will have to devote a lot of time and patience.  Leave yourself room for bargaining.  If you are going to sell, then slightly increase the price, 10 percent. When buying, respectively, understate.  Also do not forget about shipping costs. </p><h2>  How to store and clean? </h2>

    <p>  The prices of Russian coins, as well as any other, depend on their condition.  The oxidation of the metal does its job and dramatically reduces the cost.  There are several easy ways to clear coins at home.  Toothpaste, toothpowder, soda, <span>ammonia,</span> citric acid - these are the simplest and most affordable means.  It‚Äôs worth processing carefully and don‚Äôt immerse coins in the solution for a long time, you can easily ruin a copy.  After that, rinse with clean water and wipe dry. </p><p>  For storage, it is convenient to use special albums with separate cells for each coin. </p>
