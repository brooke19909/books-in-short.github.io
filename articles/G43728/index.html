Here, at an altitude of 122 meters above sea level, the famous salt lakes are located, attracting crowds of tourists to the small settlement and wanting to improve their health. </p><h2>  Sol-Iletsk is considered the Russian Dead Sea </h2><p>  And this is true.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lakes is 53 hectares.  Healing mud and speleocameras are in demand in sanatoriums throughout the country.  The water in the lakes is mineral, with a high concentration of salts.  Thanks to this, it is impossible to drown in water bodies; you are literally pushed to the surface.  If you are going to Sol-Iletsk for a family vacation with children, then you will think about how to diversify their leisure time.  What do they offer in the resort town? </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.1645902" data-lng="54.98845670000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/6/8/8/15688.png"></div><h2>  Entertainment for children in Sol-Iletsk </h2><p>  Firstly, this is the territory of the resort.  To get there, you have to defend a rather big queue.  Various attractions are offered to your attention: Ferris wheel, inflatable trampolines, mini-water park, extreme attractions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="garynevillegasm.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Sol-Iletska" class="if uuid-3147626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/132274/3147626.jpg"></div><p>  I would especially like to note the original "House Upside Down".  This is one of the most interesting entertainments in Sol-Iletsk.  He stands on the ground with a roof, all objects in the house are turned upside down and attached, as they say, "upside down."  There you can literally walk around the ceiling, the children are thrilled. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="lq9TxS_E12U" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq9TxS_E12U" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/6/8/9/15689.jpg"></div><p>  The city has a dolphinarium.  Admission is free for children under three years.  The performances at the dolphinarium are professionally delivered, and both the child and the adult will enjoy such leisure time. </p><p>  Not so long ago, a new park opened in the city, adding to the list of entertainment in Sol-Iletsk.  At the entrance is a musical fountain, there are carousels and a room of fear, as well as other attractions.  The city has an oceanarium and a bird show. </p><h2>  What are the entertainments in Sol-Iletsk for tourists, besides improving the body? </h2><p>  Of course, visitors spend most of their time on the lakes.  But still, the soul asks for entertainment, what do vacationers offer in the city? </p><p>  It is worth going on an excursion to Bukobay Yars and meditate among the stone balls.  A visit to the museum of local lore may be useful in terms of an excursion into the history and culture of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rasfokus.ru" data-author=": Marat Kuchkaev, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bukobay Yars" class="if uuid-3147652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/132274/3147652.jpg"></div><p>  An ostrich farm is also located in the Orenburg region, in the village of Sergievka.  The infrastructure there is developed, for visitors there is a pond, benches, sculptures, arbors.  There is also a souvenir shop.  Well and, of course, ostriches!  In addition to them, there are many other animals: goats, pheasants, swans, ducks, pigeons, guinea fowl and even peacocks!  And this is not the whole list of fauna living on the Bird of Fortune farm. </p><p>  There are cafes and restaurants in the city.  For lovers of vocals, a karaoke bar is open.  There is an opportunity to watch a movie in the open air and visit a disco in the fresh air.  All the entertainments in Sol-Iletsk can be seen with your own eyes if you spend the next summer vacation here with your family. </p><p>  Sol-Iletsk, although a small town, but every year its resorts are visited by a huge number of people, among whom are foreign tourists.  Of course, a five-star holiday will not work here, but to heal and spend time with pleasure is quite real. </p>
