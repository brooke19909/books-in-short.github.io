How to make a crocodile from a cucumber?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the onset of autumn, it is time to harvest.  What bizarre forms nature does not create!  What a rich food for the development of the imagination!  And children need help, suggest that such bizarre figures can be created by ourselves. </p><p>  Those parents whose children attend kindergarten and go to school often think about the problem of what crafts to help the child do at the next exhibition.  Such events are usually called "Gifts of Autumn".  What only crafts created by children's hands, you will not see there!  Very popular <span>figures from vegetables.</span> </p><p>  For example, you can get an original crocodile from a cucumber.  Now consider how to do it. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cucumber crocodile" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/1032018.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  First craft </h2><p>  First you need a long cucumber.  On one side of it will be a crocodile tail, and on the other, a head.  The crocodile will be lying.  Therefore, from the side where the belly of the figure will be, it is necessary to cut a thin layer for stability.  Now you need to make a head.  It is necessary to cut off a cone layer of skin on top of the future muzzle.  There should be eyes on this section, so you need to make two indentations and insert two peas of allspice.  The same cone-shaped layer is also cut off from the bottom of the head - the jaw of a crocodile mouth has turned out.  A corner is cut out of the mouth.  The teeth will be small, even slices of white onion.  A piece of sausage will serve as a tongue.  Cucumber should be laid on a flat stand.  Now, from the cut cucumber residues, you need to create the hind and front legs, making small cuts so that the legs are with claws.  It‚Äôs boring for a crocodile to lie on an ordinary board, therefore, in order for the craft to have a finished look, you can pre-paint the stand in blue and this will represent water.  On the edges you need to lay out thickets of onion greens to show a predator emerging. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Crocodile Gena </h2><p>  Everyone remembers the famous cartoon about Cheburashka.  You can make an interesting craft, only now it will be Gene.  How is such a crocodile made from cucumber?  We need to take two fresh green cucumbers.  One is suitable for the body, the other, smaller, for the head of a crocodile.  In order for the animal‚Äôs figure not to fall, on the one hand it is necessary to trim the cucumber-body, and on the other we perform a similar action to fasten the head.  For a greener vegetable, which is smaller, you need to cut the very top at an angle, make small holes for the eyes. </p><p>  The jaws, two front straight legs and two solid hind legs should be formed from the remains. </p><h2>  The last stage of manufacturing </h2><p>  The most important thing is the assembly.  To get a crocodile from a cucumber, reminiscent of a cartoon character, you need to try.  The body is placed vertically, on top we place the lower jaw with teeth and tongue from carrots.  Do not forget that the crocodile Gena wore a small hat.  You can cut out a small bell from sweet pepper and put figures on your head.  The lower limbs are quite simple to put next to, as the gene will be in a sitting position.  In the front legs, you need to pierce the holes and attach to the body using pieces of toothpick. </p><p>  How to do without a tail, because this is a crocodile made from cucumber?  You should cut a piece from the green vegetable, cut it in half, make cuts on the side, cut several triangles on top.  It remains to attach the tail to the body.  So the crafts from cucumber are ready.  Crocodile Gena will occupy a worthy place on the exhibition and will remind many adults of his childhood.  Because it should turn out very similar to the real friend of Cheburashka. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Crocodile for the smallest </h2>
