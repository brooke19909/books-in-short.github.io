Due to the fact that modern construction does not stand still, it is not difficult to purchase real estate today, the main thing is to allow financial opportunity.  According to the project, the Putilkovo microdistrict involves the construction of 20 monolithic-brick houses from 12 to 25 floors.  Infrastructure facilities such as a comprehensive school, three kindergartens, clinics and ground parking will also be located here.  The houses include studios, 1, 2 and 3 bedroom apartments.  The developer also offers the option of renting out finishes.  Let us consider in more detail what the Putilkovo residential complex is, reviews of residents, and also features of the complex. </p><h2>  Features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="uzhedoma.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Putilkovo Moscow" class="if uuid-3099642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/3099642.jpg"></div><p>  Let's see how this object attracts attention.  Bolshoi Putilkovo is a large-scale project with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã245 hectares.  The location was chosen very well: near the Aleshkinsky forest and the Kurkino natural park.  You can get to the metro in 15 minutes by car. </p><p>  A large pragmatic class microdistrict is being built on the banks of the Skhodnya River.  It is planned that up to 15 thousand people will live in it.  The scale of the residential area requires the creation of its own infrastructure.  It is planned to open medical and educational institutions in the complex, as well as offices, shops, restaurants and cafes.  An entrance to the Moscow Ring Road along Putilkovsky Highway was created directly from the new buildings.  It is planned that the transport system in the future will become even more convenient.  Metro stations are located in relative proximity to new buildings - only 15-20 minutes by car.  Also around the complex there are two forest park zones at once.  There are no large industrial facilities in the area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  This aspect is worth exploring in the first place.  The housing estate under discussion is located northeast of Krasnogorsk, in the small village of Putilkovo.  The plot on which the complex is being built is adjacent to Putilkovskoye Shosse.  The Moscow Ring Road passes one kilometer from the houses, the Khimki reservoir and the Northern Tushino area are located behind the road.  Also close to the complex are such large roads as Leningradskoye and Pyatnitskoye shosse. </p><div class="photo" data-original="megabaz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Putilkovo on the map" class="if uuid-3103155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/3103155.jpg"></div><p>  Putilkovo microdistrict is being built on the territory of the former poultry farm.  The building plot is located directly between the Skhodny riverbed, forest and highway.  In the neighborhood there is a low-rise housing complex "Greenwood" and the quarter "New Tushino", built by FSK "Leader". </p><p>  The sales office of Putilkovo residential complex is located at the following address: Moscow Region, Krasnogorsk, Putilkovo highway, 61. Specialists are always ready to provide any information on the project, as well as help you choose the right apartment and complete the deal.  The sales office is open every day from 9 to 21 without days off and lunch breaks </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><div class="photo" data-original="rway.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apartments in putilkovo" class="if uuid-3099643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/3099643.jpg"></div><p>  Let's dwell on this in more detail.  Many are interested in how far the Putilkovo residential complex is located far from the main routes, how to get to the complex using public transport.  New buildings are located in the immediate vicinity of Putilkovskoe highway.  From it you can easily go to the Moscow Ring Road, which is only 1 km away.  Also nearby is the Leningradskoe and Pyatnitskoe shosse.  Traveling by car under normal circumstances usually takes no more than 10 minutes.  However, every year the two-lane highway copes with the increasing load worse and worse.  At rush hours in a traffic jam on Putilovskoye highway, you can stand for more than an hour.  Similar problems arise due to the active development of the area.  In the future, it is planned to put into operation another 1000 square meters of housing, which could significantly aggravate the problem. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Moscow Region Government, together with the Samolet Development company, promise to expand Putilkovsky highway by 2024 and build a new road connecting the residential complex with Pyatnitsky highway.  However, it should be borne in mind that by this time in connection with the active settlement of the area, the number of cars will increase.  Therefore, residents will have to put up with traffic jams for several more years. </p><p>  The transport collapse in Putilkovo was formed for the most part due to the fact that there are no railway stations and metro nearby.  The entire load falls on vehicles.  To get to the nearest metro station "Mitino", you have to spend at least half an hour.  It will take as much time to get to Planernaya. </p><p>  The critical transport situation makes the apartments in Putilkovo residential complex not very attractive for buyers without their own vehicles. </p><h2>  Construction progress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Putilkovo infrastructure" class="if uuid-3099627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/3099627.jpg"></div><p>  So what do you need to know?  Holding "Aircraft Development" in conjunction with the PIK Group is actively engaged in the construction of Putilkovo microdistrict.  The company has been operating since 2014.  The holding is a full-cycle developer specializing in comfort and economy class housing.  The company is actively cooperating with the Government of the Moscow Region on the implementation of housing programs for deceived equity holders.  She is also involved in the construction of a new road in the area.  Samolet Development is also involved in the construction of <span>Sputnik,</span> Khimki 2019, Tomilino 2018 <span>residential complexes</span> . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  According to official documents, the housing complex under discussion is being built by the construction company LLC Samolet-Putilkovo.  She acts as the owner of the land.  At the moment, work is underway on the construction of the first phase of the project.  It involves the construction of 6 buildings with a height of 12 to 25 floors.  According to the project, the developer should also erect a comprehensive school, a kindergarten and a parking lot on the territory.  Completion is planned in the summer of 2020.  In total, there will be 20 high-rise buildings, 10 kindergartens and 4 secondary schools in the allocated territory.  The developer plans to fully implement this project in 2024. </p><h2>  Architecture and Technologies Used </h2><div class="photo" data-original="novomoscow.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lc putilkovo peak" class="if uuid-3099654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/3099654.jpg"></div><p>  Let's dwell on this aspect and consider it in more detail.  Houses in the Putilkovo residential complex in Moscow are being built using monolithic-brick technology.  A strong reinforced concrete frame acts as a building support.  The service life of monolithic buildings is on average 150 years.  Residential buildings in the complex have an energy efficiency class C. In such houses it will be comfortable both in winter and in summer.  Windows are planned to be installed with double-glazed windows. </p><p>  As for the concept of the Putilkovo residential complex, the developer chose the option of quarterly construction.  New buildings of different heights will be built around a spacious detached courtyard, divided into thematic zones.  Thus, the complex is divided into two large microdistricts with their own infrastructure and large recreational spaces.  As for the appearance of the buildings, here the developer preferred to use a minimalist style.  Thanks to the clinker brick finish, the new building will retain its aesthetic appearance for a long time. </p><p>  In the courtyards of the residential sections, it is planned to organize playgrounds, as well as areas for sports and leisure.  Ornamental shrubs and trees will be planted in the courtyards, and in summer whole floral arrangements will be created.  The developer also announces a partial use of terrace design.  Landscaping will not be limited to yards.  The center of attraction for all residents of the microdistrict should be two city squares.  They will house two lounge areas, cafes, restaurants, a promenade and shops.  Near the residential complex will be equipped with a river embankment with all the necessary attributes for picnics. </p><h2>  Halls </h2><p>  The company "Airplane Development", which is building new buildings in Putilkovo, promises its customers to create a unique design of entrance groups.  Sales managers say they will be bright and very spacious.  If we analyze the experience already available with the developer, we can assume that most likely we are talking about modern stepless entrances with high-quality comfort-class finishes. </p><h2>  Layout and decoration of apartments </h2><p>  This aspect should also be given special attention.  Why are many potential buyers considering buying real estate in Putilkovo residential complex?  Customer reviews confirm that the company "Airplane Development" offers a large selection of apartments of various sizes - from 24 to 78 square meters.  There are budget options for sale - studio apartments.  You can also choose housing for young couples and large families.  Apartments are available both with a draft finish and with a finishing one.  10 thousand square meters in a residential complex allocated to provide housing deceived equity holders. </p><p>  On each floor of a new building, on average, there are 5 apartments.  Developers very rarely show such concern for future residents during the construction of multi-storey residential complexes.  This factor is decisive for many, because the fewer neighbors, the quieter it will be in the house. </p><p>  Many are interested in how housing looks without decoration.  This is easily explained - this option is much cheaper.  The premises with draft finish will have windows, radiators and an entrance door.  Electricity is brought to the shield in the hallway.  The developer also provides apartments with rough finishing with bends for the subsequent installation of water supply and sewerage.  But the main advantage that apartments without finishing offer is the possibility of free planning.  There are no interior partitions in the room.  This allows future residents to distribute living space at their discretion.  However, when choosing this option, it should be borne in mind that installing floors will require additional costs. </p><p>  In buildings with numbers 1 and 6, the developer offers to purchase apartments with a fine finish.  Electricity was carried out in them, draft and finishing repairs were done, interior doors were installed, and bathrooms were equipped with everything necessary.  When choosing such a housing option, the owners will only have to start appliances and furniture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avaho.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="project lc putilkovo" class="if uuid-3100208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/3100208.jpg"></div><p>  What do the layouts look like in Putilkovo residential complex?  Customer reviews of Samolet-Development confirm that the complex consists mainly of economy class apartments.  This is especially true of budget studios, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly 24-26 squares.  At the same time, the choice of residential property offered is quite large.  For sale there are linear and swing apartments with windows facing both sides.  As for the studios, they have comfortable square layouts.  This option is more convenient for arrangement than the rectangular shape.  The dimensions of the premises comply with all applicable standards.  The apartments also have loggias and balconies.  But there are no separate pantries and dressing rooms.  Bathrooms are compact, there are also separate options.  At the same time, the bathroom and toilet can be located both adjacent and separate. </p><h2>  Commercial property </h2><p>  The Krasnogorsk district is currently attractive for the purchase of both residential and commercial real estate.  The project of the comfortable Putilkovo complex involves the construction of an elevated multi-level parking in the south-eastern part.  It is also planned to sell commercial premises intended for doing business in a residential complex. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mosnovostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lc putilkovo how to get" class="if uuid-3099644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/3099644.jpg"></div><p>  What is it and what is its feature?  Another reason why many people choose to buy housing in the Krasnogorsk district is the developed infrastructure.  Putilkovo is far from the only residential complex in this territory.  Greenwood Business Center is nearby.  A little north of the place of future development is another microdistrict on the territory of which there are already shops and social facilities.  Also within walking distance from the residential complex there are 3 schools and 6 kindergartens.  In the Putilkovo microdistrict, the construction of a general clinic for children and adults is already underway.  The facility is scheduled to be commissioned at the end of 2019.  This means that by the time the complex in question is fully populated, the clinic will already be operating at full capacity. </p><p>  The construction progress of the Putilkovo residential complex also includes the construction of four own schools and 10 kindergartens in the microdistrict.  The first school for 1250 students and a kindergarten for 250 children will be already built along with the first stage of development. </p><p>  A good shopping and entertainment infrastructure is another reason why many customers prefer Putilkovo residential complex.  Responses from residents of nearby areas confirm that you don‚Äôt have to go far to make daily purchases.  Within walking distance is the O'key hypermarket, as well as the WayPark shopping center.  In the neighboring microdistrict of Khimki there is a huge shopping complex Mega Khimki with shops.  It includes such stores: </p><ul><li>  Auchan </li><li>  Stockmann </li><li>  IKEA. </li></ul><p>  As for recreation areas, the Putilkovo residential complex is surrounded by Novogorsky Forest Park and Aleshkinsky Forest.  Within walking distance is the protected natural area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Skhodnya River Valley.  These recreational areas are perfect for walks and picnics in the fresh air.  Also near the residential complex is the Khimki reservoir, where a natural park with ponds is equipped. </p><p>  Another aspect that potential buyers are usually interested in is the environmental situation in the Putilkovo residential complex.  Feedback from real estate investors confirms that there are no industrial facilities nearby with buildings under construction.  The main source of pollution for this region is the Moscow Ring Road.  The road is located at a distance of only 650 meters from the houses.  A large rocket-building plant NPO Energomash is located 5 km from the microdistrict, but forest tracts protect it from the harmful effects of the Putilkovo residential complex. </p><h2>  Residential Property Terms </h2><p>  How to buy an apartment in Putilkovo residential complex?

Upon conclusion of the contract, the buyer becomes an interest holder, whose rights are protected by Federal Law No. 214. </p><p>  On the official website, the developer of the PIK group of companies, Putilkovo residential complex, provided potential buyers with complete information on the property.  Here you can find project declarations, documents proving ownership of the land, a sample equity agreement, and so on.  You can also familiarize yourself with these papers by visiting the sales office. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dsk1.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microdistrict putilkovo" class="if uuid-3099640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/3099640.jpg"></div><p>  At present, the Putilkovo microdistrict is considered one of the most promising in terms of buying real estate in the immediate vicinity of Moscow.
