The latter is engaged in the production and sale of mobile gadgets in Eastern Europe.  The company's products are of quite acceptable quality at its more than affordable cost. </p><p>  Many probably know Digma from tablets and e-books.  A good half of the models are in the budget segment and pleases consumers with attractive price tags.  And if things are not so clear with tablets, then the reviews about Digma e-books are mostly positive. </p><p>  Gadgets of such a plan from Digma have shown themselves well, they are quite worthy of coping with the tasks.  The brand offers a wide range of models for reading, and getting lost in all this diversity is quite easy.  We will try to understand this issue and outline the most popular and most sensible gadgets. </p><p>  So, here's a quick overview of Digma e-books.  Consider the main characteristics of the devices and their capabilities.  We take into account the opinions of specialists in this field and the reviews of ordinary book users. </p><h2>  Digma e500 / e501 </h2><p>  These are models with a five-inch screen, and they differ from each other only in the type of matrix.  The e-book Digma e500 is responsible for the graphic component E-Ink Vizplex, and e501 - Pearl.  In the first case, we have colder tones, and in the second - warm.  This is how to compare a fluorescent lamp with a conventional bulb.  Both matrices are almost equally popular, so here everything depends on personal preferences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="mcgrp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="digma ebook" class="if uuid-2772293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2772293.jpg"></div><p>  Managing the device is very simple, you can even do without reading the long instructions for the Digma e-book.  The keys located under the screen on the sides are responsible for turning pages.  There, in the center, there is a joystick designed to navigate menu branches.  The interface of the device is intuitive, so there should not be any problems with its development.  In addition, the platform received competent Russian-language localization. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  E-books Digma e500 and e501 series have a resolution quite comfortable for their diagonal - 600 by 800 pixels, with a pixel density of 200 ppi.  So, as such, pixelation is not here, and individual points are noticeable only with careful consideration. </p><p>  Users mostly leave positive reviews on the Digma e-books of these series.  The interface of the models does not slow down, the local codec supports a solid list of text formats (including graphic), and the visualization is quite tolerable, as well as the battery life (up to 1600 pages to view). </p><p>  The only drawbacks that consumers sometimes complain are the lack of backlight and a glossy screen.  The latter does not allow normal reading on a bright sunny day, acting as a mirror.  So here we have home gadgets, and for travel they are clearly not suitable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Digma r63S / e63S </h2><p>  These are two almost identical devices, where the critical difference between the Digma r63S e-book and e63S is the presence of backlight in the first case.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãpowered by E-Ink Carta technology (16 shades of gray) and produces a 800-by-600 dot scan.  For a six-inch screen and for reading this is enough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dns-shop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="digma ebooks review" class="if uuid-2772299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2772299.jpg"></div><p>  The main controls are located at the bottom of the device.  In the middle under the screen there is a joystick for navigating the menu, there are function keys on the sides, and at the ends you can see symmetric buttons for turning pages.  The location is quite convenient, especially for those who are used to reading in a vertical orientation. </p><p>  The interface of the Digma e63S and r63S e-books has received competent Russian-language localization, so there are no problems with the development.  Getting confused in it is quite difficult: the menu branches with sections, according to users, are intuitive and simple. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the series </h2><p>  The device reads all the popular text and graphic formats, and the latest firmware updates for the Digma e-book allow you to work with archives and web-browsing - ZIP and HTML.  The internal memory is enough for about 5000 books, and the battery capacity for 3-4 thousand pages to read. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Users leave warm feedback on the Digma e-books of these series.  Here, convenient adjustment of fonts, formats and other visual qualities, a long battery life, ergonomic control, as well as a fairly high-quality assembly.  Some consumers sometimes complain about the flickering backlight when it is turned on at a minimum level, but this is not critical. </p><h2>  Digma r634 </h2><p>  The Digma r634 e-book differs from previous devices primarily in its attractive appearance.  The device finally became like a serious device, and not like a plastic toy.  Streamlined forms and attention to detail made it competitive against other gadgets of this kind. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.citilink.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="e-book digma e63s" class="if uuid-2772295" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2772295.jpg"></div><p>  The book received a standard matrix with E-Ink Carta technology and an 800-by-600 dot scan, which is enough for a 6-inch ‚Äútext‚Äù device.  It is also worth noting that the screen here is matte and does not fade on a bright sunny day or in good sunlight.  So the book can be safely taken on trips and long trips. </p><p>  The controls have a familiar layout for Digma.  In the middle under the screen there is a joystick for navigating the menu, on the sides are function keys, and at the ends there are symmetric buttons for turning pages.  You can deal with all this without instructions. </p><h2>  Device features </h2><p>  The e-book reads all popular text formats, as well as image files, ZIP archives, and a simple HTML web-based layout.  There is enough memory for about 5000 books, and battery life for 3-4 thousand pages.  The last point is largely dependent on the intensity of the backlight. </p><p>  Users mostly leave positive reviews about the Digma r634 e-book.  In addition to the attractive exterior, it can offer a good visual component (16 shades of gray), trouble-free operation in well-lit rooms, convenient control and ‚Äúomnivorous‚Äù formats.  The only fly in the ointment that consumers often complain about is the brakes when the device is turned on or when it wakes up from sleep mode. </p><h2>  Digma s602 / s602W </h2><p>  Both models come with a matrix built on E-Ink Pearl technology (16 shades of gray), and are distinguished by the presence of a Wi-Fi module.  The gadget s602W has it, coupled with a browser.  In all other respects, they are identical and have no differences. </p><div class="photo" data-original="market.yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Digma s602" class="if uuid-2772300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2772300.jpg"></div><p>  The matrix gives a full HD-scan with a resolution of 1024 by 768 pixels, which is enough for the eyes of a 6-inch gadget.  The density of dots per inch in the region of 212 ppi, so that the pixelation is not visible to the naked eye. </p><p>  One of the main features of these series is the presence of normal speakers and a full QWERTY keyboard.  With its help, you can easily type text and surf the Internet.  Despite the QWERTY format, the key layout is specific, and you will have to get used to it.  If on the usual keyboard the buttons are "herringbone", then in the case of the "Digma" we have a strict rectangular positioning. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of models </h2><p>  In the lower right part of the working area are the keys "Menu" and "Home", and on the left side of the button are turning pages.  The interface itself remained the same simple and straightforward, only functionality for surfing was added in the case of s602W models.  The firmware provides, albeit a small, but rather useful instruction without extra water, so there should not be any serious problems with the start of work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ixbt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="e-book with keyboard" class="if uuid-2772296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2772296.jpg"></div><p>  Books of these series are read by all popular text and graphic formats, ZIP archives, as well as audio files with the MP3 extension.  Internal memory is enough for about 5000 books, and the battery charge for 2-3 thousand pages or a day of surfing on the Internet. </p><p>  Users generally respond positively to these series and model capabilities.  Gadgets attract not only a pleasant exterior, but also an abundance of features and settings "for themselves."  The disadvantages here are a short cable, a mediocre case, which really does not protect the book, as well as the ‚Äúleisurely‚Äù operation of the device. </p><h2>  Digma s683g </h2><p>  The Digma s683G e-book differs from the above models by the presence of a sensor substrate.  That is, in addition to the usual mechanical controls for such gadgets, there is also a capacitive touchscreen.  Judging by the user reviews, the latter noticeably facilitates and simplifies the work with the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.forum3.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="e-book digma s683g" class="if uuid-2772297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2772297.jpg"></div><p>  The device received a matrix working on E-Ink Carta technology and issuing a resolution of 1027 by 768 pixels, which is more than enough for a 6-inch gadget.  Pixelization is not visible here, if you do not look very closely (212 ppi).  There is also a built-in backlight, greatly facilitating the operation of the book. </p><p>  The set of controls is standard.  In the lower part under the screen there is a joystick, on the sides there are function keys.  At the ends are buttons for turning pages.  Users in their reviews separately mention the ergonomic component.  The book is convenient to hold and thanks to its balanced design, there is no discomfort even with prolonged use. </p><p>  The book works with all popular text formats, as well as graphic extensions and ZIP archives.  On an HTML layout, the device sometimes stops and adapts it not always correctly.  Also, users note that the menu does not provide for adjusting bold fonts.  The manufacturer listened to the reviews and in the latest updates made the necessary amendments.  So those who purchased the model this spring or earlier should upgrade the firmware. </p><h2>  Device Features </h2><p>  The interface of the book is simple and intuitive.  The menu branches are made in the style familiar to the manufacturer, so those who switch from older models will be very easy to navigate.  In any case, there is a rather sensible help section, where, step by step, the main points on working with the device are explained. </p><div class="photo" data-original="goodster.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="digma s683g" class="if uuid-2772294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2772294.jpg"></div><p>  The built-in memory is enough for a library of 5000 books, and the battery life is 3-4 thousand pages.  It is also worth noting that the battery charges surprisingly quickly and discharges slowly, so there should be no serious problems with autonomy.  Especially if you do not use the backlight. </p><p>  In general, users respond warmly about the model and its capabilities.  Here we have a good visual component, excellent ergonomic indicators, and most importantly - touch input, which greatly facilitates the usability of the device.  Of the minuses, users note the ‚Äúthoughtfulness‚Äù of the gadget from time to time. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  When choosing e-books from the Digma brand assortment, you need to understand that the manufacturer produces devices for the budget segment, and you should not count on something pretentious here.  There are mid-price and premium categories for this. </p><p>  Users in their reviews often complain about the mediocre assembly and quality of the materials used.  But you can close your eyes to this by looking at the cost of Digma e-books.  If you are an accurate user and take care of your things, then the build quality is not so critical here, especially if there is a desire to save money. </p><p>  The performance of budget devices and Digma gadgets is also not very high.  But here, in general, it is not needed.  It is enough if the device has a good matrix, as well as a decent picture, quickly turns the pages, and you can close your eyes to everything else.  Still, we do not have a gaming tablet in our hands, but an electronic book - a specific product aimed primarily at organizing reading. </p>
