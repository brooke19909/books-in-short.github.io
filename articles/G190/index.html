    <p>  Forex Club is one of the centenarians of financial trading in the CIS.  Due to its consistent high-quality work and support services, the company is well known.  Skillful and novice brokers in this system were interested not only in a reliable option and the presence of an NDD account, where it is possible to trade and be sure of outputting results to the interbank market, but also in the Libertex platform, where they can use the same trading calculations. </p><h2>  What is this platform? </h2><p>  The Libertex program is a trade and investment software, which is provided in a browser version.  It can be used exclusively for web trading.  The terminal can also be used in the form of an application on Android and IOS systems.  This makes it possible to use it instead of the well-known MetaTrader4, which is also recommended for online trading. </p>

    <h2>  Difference of "Libertex" from MT4 </h2><p>  Typically, trading platforms use balance, funds, brand and margin level as the state of the account.  Libertex uses the balance sheet, portfolio value, profit / loss, and detailed information about each portfolio instrument. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__wd3"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__wd3"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__wd3"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__wd3"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__wd3"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is not necessary to switch to such platforms if you trade, for example, on Alpari.  This makes no sense.  After all, each broker has its own specific innovations to attract customers.  What platform to be on is up to you.  The most important thing is to get a stable profit and transfer to the sphere of Forex the main source of income. </p><h2>  Trading Platform Overview </h2><p>  Before using the platform, you must register at the "Forex Club".  After registration you need to fund your account.  Then you can start investing on the new platform.  The advantage of the Forex Club is that it makes it possible to evenly distribute money among trading instruments. </p><p>  How to trade on Libertex?  The rating of the best popular instruments can be seen after opening an account.  Today, the most popular are Gold, DowJones and DAX.  The entire rating is formed solely according to the preferences of investors. </p>

    <p>  When you have chosen the tool you need, click the ‚Äúinvest‚Äù button.  For clarity, you can give the following example.  So, for example, you wanted to buy Oil.  To do this, you should find the appropriate item in the investment window, where you can leave the amount.  After you have chosen it, we select the multiplier - leverage in the Meta Trader 4 terminal.  To make it more convenient for you to work, choose a factor of no more than X20.  Next, click "buy" and wait as much as you want to keep the position open.  Someone has a month, someone has a year.  After purchasing one instrument, you can buy the following.  Thus, you will form your investment portfolio, which should contain several types of instruments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  As you can see, the investment scheme is in any case simple and affordable.  A trader can perform many operations on exchanges in easier modes, which allows applying almost any <span>trading strategy</span> on Libertex.  Since the platform works automatically, the trader‚Äôs personal time will be significantly saved.  The reason is simple - with this program you no longer need to spend time on manual market analysis.  All information is systematized by default and displayed separately.  Copying deals to existing other contracts is also available. </p><h2>  Start and practice </h2><p>  Libertex Forex Club is a modern trading market, which is provided entirely in Russian and in a simplified interface.  For beginners, an additional training course is offered in the form of an extended glossator and 23 videos. </p>

    <p>  Of the specifics of Libertex, the following features can be noted - leverage, lack of lot and spread.  Leverage, as in other platforms, is presented as a leverage mechanism, with the highest value of x500.  However, this is beneficial even at lower rates.  So, you can invest $ 500, and when using the x10 multiplier, the contribution turns into $ 6,000.  It should be noted that the highest amount of potential risk is limited by the amount of investment.  It is precisely this quality that differs from the usual trade of Libertex.  How to earn more here?  In order to limit the size of possible losses and manage risk, on specific trading mechanisms, you can reduce the leverage scale to a minimum - less than x1. </p><p>  There is no standard lot and spread.  The usual lot here has been replaced with a minimum bid of $ 10.  The standard commission replaces the spread, and its size is up to 0.03 percent. </p><p>  For trading activities, more than 10 trading mechanisms are used, in particular, 54 currency pairs, 72 CFD indices and stocks, various precious metals, as well as cryptocurrency.  It is proposed to try different timeframes and scalability options, changes are also available in the way the asset price is displayed - line, zone, Japanese candles. </p><p>  You can also use the reduced version of the quotation chart and manage the auxiliary functionality of this platform. </p><p>  In addition, the trading platform is equipped with an excellent set of industrial indicators from more than 45 groups, which are freely selected with the same button.  Here you can find three groups of pointers. </p>

    <p>  Pay attention to the set of graphic devices, where there are classic functions (trending directions, Fibonacci degrees), and an additional tool for identifying graphic persons in the form of some templates. </p><p>  The main special feature of the ‚ÄúForex Club‚Äù platform ‚ÄúLibertex‚Äù is that it is equipped with trading signals, the generation of which is carried out by methods of technical analysis and asset price estimation built into the terminal. </p><h2>  Trade and investment </h2><p>  For trading, the dispatcher gives a personal trading account, which is used both for independent conclusion of transactions and for investing special ready-made ideas, which you can join at the Forex Club trading terminal ‚ÄúLibertex‚Äù. </p><p>  This type of investment is carried out by distributing trader signals for opening and closing positions on a dedicated investment decision.  It is impossible to single out the lack of a minimum contribution, as one may encounter this on the platforms of competitors. </p><p>  Also on the trading platform there is the opportunity to become a manager.  Other traders will invest in his account.  For these opportunities, the platform has a portfolio designer with which you can create personal portfolios for investments from assets, which are considered the most optimal for the chosen strategy. </p><h2>  Pros and cons of this platform </h2><p>  The Libertex platform, reviews of which are mostly positive, has both pros and cons.  The absolute plus of the terminal is ease of use, a large informative base and technical support that can be used on many mobile gadgets (it can be downloaded to Android). </p><p>  However, Libertex Forex Club has some disadvantages. </p><p>  Firstly, trading advisers and scripts will not work on it, so it will not be suitable for high-class traders. </p><p>  Secondly, the browser terminal is also able to periodically "slow down", since it is considered a web application to the browser.  This minus, however, is not too significant for long-term traders, for whom this service will probably be one of the best solutions. </p><p>  Finally, a significant minus of the trading platform is the lack of ‚Äúsocial trading‚Äù.  To do this, there are functions of duplication of transactions of other investors of the company.  At the same time, the Forex Club regularly improves the web application, and in the future, the Libertex trading platform will significantly surpass the currently known MetaTrader. </p><h2>  What are the main points to keep in mind? </h2><p>  The minimum bet is from 10 USD, the minimum deposit is from 1 USD.  As mentioned above, leverage can be equal to 1: 500.  System commission - from 0.03%. </p><p>  There is also training at Libertex, thanks to which it will not be difficult to understand the system.  As already noted, the company offers 23 free video tutorials, as well as an expanded glossary that reveals the essence of various trading operations.  The platform interface is completely Russified, which can be attributed to significant advantages. </p>

    <p>  If we analyze all of the above, we can safely conclude that the Libertex platform is the undisputed leader among competing developments.  With the right competent investment and up-to-date fundamental analysis, the trader can get tangible profits. </p><p>  If you touch on the technical analysis of quotes, the platform is also able to provide very detailed information, through which it is easy to note the optimal entry points into the market.  Thus, an experienced trader is able to get up to thirty percent of profit in one contract, without taking into account the multiplier.  If you use the multiplier, then the profit volumes can grow several times.  Throughout the year, up to 300 percent of the profit from the initial investment is possible. </p><h2>  Funds withdrawal / deposit methods </h2><p>  Reviews on Libertex also mention a significant selection of deposit and withdrawal methods.  This is a definite plus, as various services and systems are popular today.  How to withdraw money from Libertex?  The platform works with many services: </p><ul><li>  Visa and Mastercard. </li><li>  QIWI. </li><li>  Yandex.Money. </li><li>  Skrill. </li><li>  Monetka.ru. </li><li>  WebMoney. </li><li>  Euroset. </li><li>  SMS Payments. </li><li>  Bank transfers. </li></ul><p>  So in this regard, no problems should arise. </p>
