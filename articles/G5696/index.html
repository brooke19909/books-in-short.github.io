She lures with azure sea waters, amazing nature and favorable climate.  Thanks to all this, as well as clean ecology, this country is suitable for the younger generation.  So, in the field of our attention is Greece, rest with children.  <span>Where better to relax?</span>  It remains to decide only on this issue and the cost of permits.  Then buy them, get visas (most likely, with the help of a travel agency) and go with your family to get real pleasure in the most tender sunshine.  After all, winter is coming, and gray days will begin again. </p><h2>  The benefits of family vacations in Greece </h2><p>  Anyway, the best rest is the one you spend with your family.  It is clear that taking small children under two is undesirable.  The hot sun is contraindicated for them.

Without even knowing your native language, these people will always try to understand you, to explain themselves.  The sea is amazing, the beaches are excellent, the sea water is cleaner than in some pools. </p>
