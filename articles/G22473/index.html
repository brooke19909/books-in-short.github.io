Therefore, the application of the seeds will be a great option for an interesting craft that can not only be sent to the contest of creative skill, but also presented to relatives and friends. </p><h2>  Do not list </h2>

    <p>  For example, large seeds, like watermelon and pumpkin seeds, which not only have an interesting color, but also cope with moisture and glue, are especially popular.  Application from legumes, such as peas or chickpeas, is very textured and embossed.  And if you are looking for material to create a smooth, uniform surface, semolina, millet or buckwheat will do the job perfectly. </p><h2>  We take reliability </h2><p>  Now let's talk about glue, one of the main components of any creative crafts.  If we take into account the whole variety of adhesive materials that the real product markets offer us, we should carefully look at some options. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The first glue that comes to mind is PVA.  This is a good old classic, used by our parents for different types of creativity.  Yes, maybe the composition has become more caustic, but still the result of working with PVA glue justifies it.  Thanks to its fluid consistency, he manages to capture all the smallest details of which the application of seeds can consist.  In addition, drying time plays a big role: if you are not satisfied with the composition, you simply move the objects along the glue, and then let them dry. </p><p>  Nowadays, hot glue, which comes complete with a small gun, which facilitates all the work several times, is gaining more and more popularity.  This type of glue can also be useful when creating applications and crafts, when you need to attach large seeds quickly and reliably.  But it is hardly suitable for children's creativity, since the high temperature of the adhesive component significantly increases the risk of working with it. </p><p>  And finally, clay is the safest and easiest option.  You can choose any colors, fashion any shape, and in case of failure, just crumple everything into one ball and start again. </p><h2>  Seed and cereal application </h2><p>  The first idea for creativity is very simple and quick to implement, so even a small child will cope with it.  And it will include maple helicopters, which are easy to find in the city, several rowan berries and white paper. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="leaf and seed applique" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2098337.jpg"></div>

When the seeds are neatly distributed, we plant a drop of hot glue in the center of the flower.  It should be enough to fix all the "petals". </li><li>  And immediately put in the center of the rowan berry.  In this way, we will not only make the flower brighter, but also hide unnecessary traces of glue. </li><li>  After drying, put the leaf with maple "chrysanthemums" in the frame, and that's it, our craft is ready! </li></ol><p>  This unusual postcard looks very original and interesting.  It‚Äôs not even a shame to give this craft to anyone, because the application of seeds and cereals complete with a wooden frame is no worse than any purchased gift from the store. </p><h2>  In honor of the holiday of spring </h2><p>  And now we will offer you to make a beautiful, but no less simple craft with a symbol of a women's holiday.  This, of course, is a beautiful mimosa, the smell and color of which is simply impossible not to recognize. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maple seed application" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2098340.jpg"></div>

    <p>  And in our case, mimosa flowers are an application of leaves and seeds found at home, because the buds will be made from ordinary dried corn, and the leaves will be imitated by indoor fern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Let's start again with the preparation of the working canvas - paper.  We will arrange it vertically to pay attention to the density and volume of the bouquet. </li><li>  When everything is ready, create a composition of fern (it is best if it is dried, then the application will be almost eternal).  Do not place it in only one place, otherwise the bouquet will turn out bald.  You can fix the leaves with both PVA glue and a hot gun. </li><li>  As soon as the green areas have dried, gaps between them are liberally coated with glue.  It is unlikely that a glue gun is suitable in this case, since it dries very quickly, so a thick PVA is ideal. </li><li>  On a glued surface, we lay the corn seeds in a layer, creating an uneven, tuberous texture of mimosa flowers.  Seeds can also be partially applied to leaves. </li><li>  The craft needs to be allowed to dry for a couple of hours, after which it can be safely inserted into the frame, signed as a postcard or even presented to others, since the application turns out to be truly beautiful and warm in spring. </li></ol><h2>  A miracle will come out of the carriage </h2><p>  Now we will be engaged in the main component of autumn pumpkins - seeds.  They are usually dried for food, but because of the difficulty of cleaning, they are usually thrown away.  We, on the contrary, will save them and show what application of pumpkin seeds can turn out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pumpkin seed applique" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2098341.jpg"></div>

    <ol><li>  After drying the pumpkin seeds in the oven (which is much faster than the old classical method of drying on the windowsill), we take them out of the oven and allow to dry. </li><li>  Now we will prepare the basis - a circle of white solid cardboard.  Then glue the seeds on the outer edge of the disk, leaving no gaps, so that their sharp edge looks out.  It is best to glue on hot glue: firstly, instantly, and secondly, very firmly. </li><li>  When the seeds are set, paint them with yellow paint.  The brighter the color, the better.  You can also tint the back side so that the application looks neat from all sides. </li><li>  After the paint dries, generously lubricate the inside of the circle with PVA glue and immediately sprinkle it with onion seeds.  Thanks to their dark color and small size, they look amazingly like real sunflower seeds. </li><li>  If the result after the first layer does not please you, then re-grease the surface with glue and sprinkle with seeds. </li><li>  After the application has dried, it can be safely used as a table stand for something or a small home-made decoration of your interior. </li></ol><h2>  Fall, fall </h2>

    <p>  Using purely autumn materials, we did not create any crafts specifically on the theme of this time of year.  Therefore, the application on the theme of "Autumn" from the seeds will be very useful.  As the main material, we will again use pumpkin seeds, which are very convenient in work.  In addition, stock up with colored paper, paint and glue. </p><ol><li>  We divide the seeds into three equal parts, each of which is painted in its own color.  This is convenient to do if you dilute bright gouache or acrylic with water and thoroughly stir the seeds in this liquid. </li><li>  Having given them a little time to dry and soak up the paint, we prepare the silhouette of a tree from brown or gray colored paper.  It will also be beautiful if you cut a few branches, which are later glued to the main part. </li><li>  We place the tree trunk on thick paper or cardboard and fix it in place.  Only after complete drying can you begin to glue the "pumpkin leaves", alternating all three colors. </li><li>  In addition, you can depict several leaves at the foot of a tree or at the time of their fall.  Again, let the applications dry out and enjoy the finished result. </li></ol><h2>  For the smallest </h2>
