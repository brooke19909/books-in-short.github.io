Many of them are gradually becoming the territory of the so-called "pilgrimage".  For example, Red Square, Tsaritsyno, embankment. </p><p>  And there are those where they often come in order to take a break from the hustle and bustle of a huge city.  Otradnoe is a metro designed just for such purposes.  It has its own small theater and a park with a river.  You can, without leaving the district, make purchases in one of the shops, watch a new movie in a movie theater or just take a walk without thinking about anything. <strong></strong></p><h2>  Section 1.

    <p>  Otradnoye station is a metro station located on the section of the Serpukhov-Timiryazevskaya line between two other stations - Bibirevo and Vladykino. </p><p>  Even the name makes it clear that this is the territory of the district of the same name, which is located on the territory of the Northeast administrative district of Moscow. </p><p>  Locals know that behind the station there is the so-called ‚Äúdouble-track reversal dead end‚Äù, which is used for turning around and overnight sediment of metropolitan trains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, it should be noted that the Otradnoye station is a metro that has only one direct island-type platform.  There are not so many in the city.  This, as they say, is its uniqueness. </p><h2>  Section 2. The history of one of the Moscow metro stations </h2>

    <p>  This metro stop was opened relatively recently, in 1991, that is, shortly before the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ceased to exist.  And to be more precise, on the very first day of spring - the first of March, on the same day with several more, namely, Dmitrovskaya, Timiryazevskaya, Petrovsko-Razumovskaya and Vladykino. </p><p>  Its pit was partially located on the site of the Beskudnikovskaya branch line allotted in 1987.  Construction at that time was carried out by SMU-12 and SMU-14, which also created other Moscow metro stations. </p><h2>  Section 3. Station design </h2>

Volovich and L. N. Popov, and T. A. Zharova was appointed design engineer.  They were engaged in the implementation of the project of a single-vault type station, which was supposed to be shallow underground. </p><p>  As a result, Otradnoye is the metro of the so-called "shallow laying", and it was built at a depth of nine meters. </p><p>  Its arch is made by specialists from monolithic reinforced concrete.  The floor of the platform is paved with slabs of black granite, and the track walls are faced with the same black marble.  The walls of the vault are decorated with panels of artists Annenkova and Nikolaev, made in the style of primitivism.  They depict the great figures of Russian culture, science and art of the century before last, as well as the attack of the grenadiers of the Russian army during the war of 1812 and the <span>uprising of the Decembrists of</span> 1825.  The faces of the wives of the Decembrists also attract attention.  What a range of feelings can be read in their eyes! </p><h2>  <strong>Section 4. What can be seen outside?</strong> </h2><p>  Metro Otradnoe (the metro map shows it splendidly) is often visited by both Muscovites themselves and numerous guests of the Russian capital.  Although there are still some nuances here.  How without them? </p><p>  It is worth taking into account the fact that, for example, like many other Moscow stations, Otradnoye is a metro that does not have ground lobbies.  This means that you can go down to it only through the <span>underground passages</span> on Northern Boulevard and the streets of Sannikov, Dekabristov and Khachaturian. </p><h2>  Section 5.

In a word, this is a very comfortable place to live, in some cases, there is also work on the spot.  Metro Otradnoe, by the way, according to real estate agents, is a very popular destination.  Why not?  Indeed, within a large metropolis, all this can be considered undeniable advantages. </p><h2>  Section 6. Interesting and little-known information </h2><p>  Russia, Moscow ... The Otradnoye metro, like all other stations in the capital, has its own serial number, known not to everyone.  Employees call it facility 131. </p><p>  <span>Statistical indicators</span> show that every day through this <span>public transport stop a</span> stream of about 77 thousand passengers passes. </p><p>  Take a close look at the decoration of the station.  Especially to the panel, which is dedicated to the events that took place in 1812.  Do you notice anything?  But each observant visitor in the end draws attention to the fact that the number of legs of soldiers marching in formation has <span>an odd number.</span>  This is a flaw in the art designers, which they decided to put up with so that they would not have to close the station for repairs again. </p><h2>  Section 7. <span>Schedule</span> and services provided by the station to its passengers </h2>

    <p>  Otradnoye is a metro that opens its doors to visitors in the morning at 5 hours and 45 minutes, and closes it at night, at 1:00.  A few years ago, the station worked only until midnight, but then, taking into account the wishes of the population, it was decided to increase the operating time by one hour.  Now, local residents, even those who work on the second shift, have practically no problems associated with getting home without resorting to taxi services. </p><p>  Among other things, on the territory of the metro stop, you can use the cellular communications of all the most common operators in the city, namely MTS, Beeline, MegaFon. </p><h2>  Section 8. Things to see in the vicinity of this Moscow metro station </h2><p>  Many people know that those who are fortunate enough to find themselves in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe capital should definitely visit the Joy Park and the MEL Theater. </p><p>  The first is known in many respects thanks to the so-called ‚ÄúComplex of three religions‚Äù.  But that is not all.  In the beautifully equipped park area along the banks of the river Likhoborka young mothers with prams and couples love to walk.  Pensioners often rest on benches in the shade of trees, old people at the tables, as in the days of the Soviet Union, play chess, dominoes and cards.  In winter, local residents sometimes fill a small rink on their own, and a ski track is laid. </p><p>  The MEL Theater, although it appeared relatively recently, in 1993, already has a well-deserved fame as one of the most visited places in Moscow.  And this is far from accidental.  Today it has turned into a real center of youthful creativity.  Actors in theatrical productions of various genres are most often schoolchildren or first-year students of metropolitan universities.  During intermissions, you can not only enjoy pleasant classical or jazz music, but also enjoy a cup of coffee in a modest but cozy enough cafe. </p><p>  An art school is waiting for young lovers of art in general and painting in particular.  And the Luxor and Baikonur cinemas are visited not only by local residents of the region, but also by those who decided to come here from other parts of Moscow. </p><h2>  <strong>Section 9. ‚ÄúOtradnoe‚Äù - Moscow metro with excellent transport interchange</strong> <strong><br></strong> </h2>
