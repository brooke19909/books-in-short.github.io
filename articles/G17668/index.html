The beach of the hotel is the biggest pride of the establishment.  The wide sandy coast of the ocean is the best place to relax with children.  The coastal area is very clean and has a wonderful entry into the water.  The beach is equipped with sunbeds with soft mattresses and umbrellas.  It has a bar. </p><h2>  Radisson Blue Fujairah: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Speaking about the complex, I want to pay attention to the reviews of tourists who visited it.  The Radisson Blue Resort Fujairah has a very favorable location.  According to tourists, the beach is the main advantage of the hotel. </p><p>  The modern building of the complex consists of only four floors.  It is built in such a way that all hotel rooms have a wonderful view of the ocean.  The highlight is the glass wall that separates the room from the balcony.  Without leaving the terrace from the apartment, you can enjoy stunning views of the coast. </p><p>  According to tourists, the hotel itself and the entire number of rooms are in perfect condition.  The work of the staff is at a high level.  Very high-quality cleaning is done daily, towels are changed every day, and bed linen every other day.  The quality of service is in no way affected by the presence of tips.  If you wish, you can leave them, but this is not necessary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="radisson blue fujairah reviews" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1777154.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Guests unanimously recommend the institution for those who are planning a trip to the UAE in the near future.  The Radisson Blue Fujairah Hotel can be a great place for a relaxing and measured vacation.  There are all the necessary conditions for this. </p><h2>  Catering reviews </h2><p>  According to many tourists, the food is organized in the hotel at the proper level.  The only complex in the whole region offers to take advantage of All Inclusive.  Experienced tourists do not recommend taking breakfast only, as this is completely unprofitable.  If you plan to travel actively, then you can pay half board.  However, the best option is <span>All Inclusive.</span>  The main hotel restaurant offers a good breakfast buffet.  The range of dishes is large, so there is always a choice.  The rest of the time, guests have the opportunity to eat in a la carte restaurants offering a wide variety of international dishes.  A great advantage of the all-inclusive system is the fact that drinks are included.  If you prefer half board, you will have to constantly buy water.  There are not enough bottles left in the room for a day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="radisson blue uae fujairah" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1777156.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks are also included only in All Inclusive meals.  If you prefer a different option, then you will have to pay for tea, coffee and alcohol.  Tourists note that the cost of drinks is clearly overpriced.  So, for example, tea costs $ 5. </p><p>  The rest of the food is organized perfectly, the tables always have meat dishes, seafood and fruits.  Young guests of the resort have a separate menu, so there is no problem with eating kids. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  An ideal option for a family holiday can be the UAE (Fujairah).  The Radisson Blue Resort Hotel, located on the coast itself, is perfectly suited for children.  The wide sandy coast with a good sunset in the sea is as if created for children.  Of course, sometimes there are storms and excitement at sea, but in a quiet time, swimming in it is a real pleasure.  The water on the coast is always clean and clear. </p><p>  Opposite the hotel, there is a coral reef in the ocean where turtles live.  Educational excursions are organized on the island that are worth a visit.  The reef is even visible from the windows of the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Radisson Blue Fujairah Hotel" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1777158.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The wide beach of the hotel is well equipped.  It has a large length, due to which there is never a rush of crowds, there is no need to occupy sunbeds.  There are much more sun loungers on the coast than vacationers themselves.  The beach has all the conditions for a comfortable stay. </p><p>  The hotel has five pools, among which it is worth highlighting a heated pond for kids.  Young tourists are satisfied with visiting the club, in which animators play with them. </p><p>  Experienced vacationers recommend using a free shuttle service and a trip to Dubai or Fujairah.  There you can take a walk, do some shopping and enjoy the local sights.  The main attraction of Dubai are the stunning light and music fountains that begin the show program in the evening.  If you want to see this beauty, you will have to use a taxi, because the shuttle bass leaves back to the hotel much earlier. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Resort guests recommend the Radisson Blue Resort Hotel as a great place for families.  If you are going on vacation in search of entertainment and outdoor activities, then perhaps you should choose another complex.  The resort area of ​​Fujairah is a quiet place for a relaxing pastime.  There are no big cities and skyscrapers in this region, but all the conditions have been created for tourists who want to relax from the hustle and bustle of megacities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Radisson Blue Resort Fujairah" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1777163.jpg" width="600"></div>
