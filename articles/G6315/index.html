  <section class="page js-page"><h1>From north to east: where will Omsk go</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Arrangements for gas supplies have been prepared for a very long time, so it is not surprising that in the near future industry representatives will intensively migrate to the Far East for projects developing at a frantic pace.  Blagoveshchensk may become a key arrival point, where according to the plan an important unit of the Power of Siberia pipeline will be located - with a gas processing plant and a gas chemical complex. </p><p>  Colossal construction will begin in the near future, and if Gazprom is not going to involve contractors in the construction of the pipeline, the question about factory complexes remains an open question.  Supplies of equipment, building materials, as well as installation, commissioning and much more - all this or that will be carried out with the help of contractors. </p><p>  Omsk, which is traditionally associated with the industry through many years of experience in oil refining and production, gets another growth point.  Although it is much further than the usual Muravlenko and Noyabrsk, volumes remove the problem of distance.  The only question is whether the companies will manage to carry out certification according to STO Gazprom in order to switch from one type of resources to another. </p><p>  To make an idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãBlagoveshchensk, it makes sense to start not only with geography, but also with the solution of the issue of residence.  Few in a small town <noindex>  <span>hotels photo</span> </noindex>  they provide their own, but they still need to be looked for.  Both panoramic surveys of the city and traveler reviews, which, again, are far from as numerous as impressions of Khabarovsk, and especially Vladivostok, can help.  Besides the fact that it is a military city in the past and has recently survived the floods, little is known about it at all.  It is expected that, in anticipation of a global construction, changes will also appear in other areas, and <noindex>  <span>hotel blagoveshchensk</span> </noindex>  in a year it may turn out to be a more resounding phenomenon, like the culture of the city, and much more.  Gasification is supplied by default. </p><p>  In this regard, the question again arises as to why Omsk with its colossal potential lags behind modern growth points.  Blagoveshchensk has a simple reason for growth: its ideal geographical location, like that of Novosibirsk, through which the western route of the pipeline will be implemented.  Since our city borders exclusively and exclusively on Kazakhstan, it is necessary to build our own development path, and at the same time, of course, it is advisable not to lose the accumulated practices in the processing industry.  But this is a completely different story, and it is unlikely that simple Omsk people will write it.  In the meantime, one thing is clear: a new, eastern one has already been added to the northern vector of shifts.  It's time to pack your bags. </p></div></article>
