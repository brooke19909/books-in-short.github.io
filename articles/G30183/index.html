For this, the residents of Novosibirsk do not need to travel far, because right in the borders of their wonderful city there is a small but very pretty Lake Medvezhye.  The Leninsky district in which it is located is rich in natural sites.  The Ob flows through its territory, there are park areas, pits and tributaries where the townspeople like to spend time.  But rest on Lake Medvezhye is perhaps the most popular.  Firstly, it is very easy to get to this reservoir, secondly, everything here is comfortable and ennobled, and thirdly, very hospitable and friendly people work here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bear Lake Novosibirsk" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1639722.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  There is not only a lake in Novosibirsk, but also a company called Bear Lake.  Her office is located directly near the pond of the same name, at the address: Leninsky district, Stantsionnaya street, building No. 84/2.  This place is well known to many residents of the city.  Nearby is the street Yagodinskaya.  It leads to the garden association "Birch" located just above the lake.  There is a convenience store.  A little lower, literally on the opposite side of Station Street, is the Golden Autumn Gardening Partnership.  Before reaching the reservoir about 1000 meters, you can see the <span>Novosibirsk Hippodrome,</span> and one kilometer from the lake towards the airport is the Expocenter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Residents of the city just need to come to Lake Medvezhye.  Novosibirsk is the largest city in Siberia with a developed transport network in its infrastructure.  Buses No. 10 (coming from Akatuisky housing estate), No. 111E (from the bus station to the airport), No. 112 (route from STS "Mega" to the airport), No. 340 (should be to the village of Rechnik) run along Stantsionnaya Street.  You need to get off at the Bear Lake stop.  Easy access to the pond and by car.  You need to go from the city towards the airport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Leninsky district" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1639702.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Perhaps the name "Bear Lake" (Novosibirsk) was given to the reservoir, because about two hundred years ago the taiga was noisy around it and bears roamed.  But the old-timers do not remember anything like that.  Where the lake is now splashing, there was a swamp, drying up in the summer and filled with dirty slurry in the mud.  At this time, only hordes of mosquitoes dominated here.  But the city authorities decided to ennoble this territory, brought a dredger here and in a couple of months created a wonderful reservoir at the place of the swamp.  Its length is only 620 meters, the minimum width is 111 meters, and the maximum is 220 meters.  Since the dredger created the lake, its depths are very uneven.  There are places where they reach only a couple of meters, but there are also those where more than 10 meters to the bottom.  The shores of the lake are grassy, ‚Äã‚Äãin some places shrubs grow.  From the side of the Berezka c / t, closer to Yagodinsky Street, a beach and park zone is equipped.  On the opposite side, the coast is less equipped, but there is a birch grove. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The bottom of the reservoir is sandy, fairly clean, but the water in it is still muddy.  In summer, you can see a lot of algae in it.  It is forbidden to swim here, as the tablets warn, but few pay attention to them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beach park area" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1639707.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Rest on the lake </h2><p>  Most citizens come to Lake Medvezhye (Novosibirsk) in the summer.  The recreation center of the same name works here.  On its territory you can remove a cozy covered gazebo equipped with a power outlet.  There are several pavilions on the shore, each one has a table and chairs, and there are barbecue facilities nearby.  The price for an hour of rent is 350 rubles, and for the whole day - 2000 rubles.  At the recreation center you can also rent a separate house or a Russian bathhouse, rent a catamaran.  It is good to come here to both companies and parents with children.  The places here are beautiful, the area is clean, the sand is yellow on the beach, a sandbox is equipped for children, and booths for changing clothes are installed for adults. </p><p>  In winter, the employees of the recreation center arrange an ice track on the lake, hold competitions with awarding of winners.  In addition, in the winter months there are also gazebos with barbecue facilities and baths, next to which bathing bathtubs are equipped. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays on Lake Medvezhye" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1639703.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  Fans of fishing have long appreciated Lake Medvezhye (Novosibirsk).  Fishing here at one time became paid, because private entrepreneurs launched grass carp and carps into the pond.  The price was 500 rubles for each fishing rod.  But, according to the latest reports of fishermen, now the board has been canceled.  On the lake, medium-sized crucians, perches and crayfish were always well caught.  Along the pond, away from the beach, there are equipped bridges, but some are caught simply from the shore. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  The townspeople really like their small but picturesque Lake Medvezhye.  Novosibirsk is a city where dozens of enterprises work, and thousands of cars rush through the streets.  All this worsens the environment.  Therefore, every natural object is so valuable here, where people can breathe plenty of clean fresh air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Medvezhye Novosibirsk fishing" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1639709.jpg" width="489"></div>  Novosibirsk noted such advantages of the lake:

    <ul><li>  Beautiful places; </li><li>  everything is clean and comfortable; </li><li>  cozy arbors; </li><li>  Friendly staff of the recreation center, the head of the beach and park area on the lake; </li><li>  acceptable prices; </li><li>  transport accessibility. </li></ul><p>  The main disadvantages are as follows: </p><ul><li>  among vacationers there are strong drinkers who interfere with others and create a nervous atmosphere; </li><li>  individual vacationers leave trash after themselves, spoil the beauty of the surrounding places. </li></ul><p>  So, what can we conclude?  Both the adults and the children have a good rest on Lake Medvezhye in Novosibirsk, and all the available remarks do not relate to the reservoir, but to those people who have not yet learned to value and protect beauty. </p>
