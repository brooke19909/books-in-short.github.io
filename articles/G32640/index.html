Of course, every craftswoman wants to give her creation beauty and liveliness.  This effect can be achieved in various ways, for example, using the kanzashi technique to decorate embroidery, knitting or sewing.  Or go further in the search for the use of kanzashi - to make a wonderful accessory, for example, a hairpin or bracelet by making flowers from satin ribbons.  In a word, the kanzashi technique will help both decorate the finished product, and make an independent toilet item.  You will find in this article the answer to the question of what kind of technique, step-by-step instruction on how-to, training videos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful flowers" class="if uuid-2420166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78854/2420166.jpg"></div><h2>  Flower making: what techniques exist </h2><p>  There are many ways to create beautiful flowers that can serve not only as a decoration for something, but also as an independent composition.  The technique of their execution is a great variety, for every taste and any complexity of manufacture.  Moreover, flowers can be made not only from fabric or satin ribbons.  For instance: </p><ul><li>  whole bouquets allows you to get beadwork; </li><li>  macram√© and tatting - nodular weaving techniques - may be preferred for unusual, airy inflorescences; </li><li>  You can also resort to knitting, three-dimensional embroidery, sewing. </li></ul><p>  The most important thing is to have a desire and show imagination.  However, it is generally accepted that the most realistic and beautiful flowers are obtained if they are made using kanzashi. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted rose" class="if uuid-2425207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78854/2425207.jpg"></div><h2>  What is a kanzashi technique? </h2><p>  By name, it is easy to guess that this technique has Japanese roots.  Indeed, the birth of kanzashi began precisely in Japan.  However, initially this term refers exclusively to jewelry for hairstyles - hairpins, combs, rims, pins.  Japanese women adorned their hairstyles with accessories, the wealth of which was determined by the position of the woman in society, her wealth (the wealth of her husband, family). </p><p>  The most expensive material for making kanzashi was the crane bone.  With the help of special tongs and rice glue, Japanese artisans created not just petals from squares from silk fabric, they created whole compositions, unique and unusually beautiful.  Over time, the meaning of the term has changed, now the technique of kanzashi is called flowers made of satin ribbons, cloth flaps, which are used not only as decoration for hairstyles, but also for interior decoration, embroidery, jewelry boxes, etc. Not only flowers can be made using this technique.  It also allows you to create birds and butterflies.  However, it is flowers, petals and leaves that are the most popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful flower" class="if uuid-2425220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78854/2425220.jpg"></div><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  To make flowers using the kanzashi technique, you do not need any expensive materials.  Everything you need is quite accessible to everyone who wants to do needlework.  So, first of all, satin ribbons are needed.  Size can be chosen arbitrarily.  Most often, tapes are used, the width of which is from 2.5 to 5 centimeters.  Of course, you need scissors convenient for you, which cut well, that is, sharp.  To work with small elements, as well as in order to hold the petals, you need tweezers.  Although it would be more correct to say that tweezers are needed, first and foremost, to hold the petals at the stage of their formation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You will also need threads with needles, a ruler, tongs or pliers, a set of pins, a pencil (it is best to take a dressmaker), glue ("Superglue"), a lighter or a candle - this is needed to melt the trimmed edges of the ribbons.  And you need a product that you are going to decorate - a hairpin, an elastic band with a metal insert, a bracelet, a bezel.  But if you are only interested in learning the kanzashi technique, then in this case, nothing is needed in addition to the basic materials. </p><h2>  Don't be afraid to try something new. </h2><p>  There is nothing wrong with wanting to change a hobby, find a new hobby, try to do something new, or simply expand your horizons, improve your skills.  New does not mean bad.  The Kanzashi technique for beginners is quite simple.  But only on condition that you will be diligent, assiduous, follow the instructions exactly and be patient.  So, the kanzashi technique of satin ribbons for beginners, or rather a description of the necessary steps for the successful manufacture of flowers, are given below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hairpin with flower" class="if uuid-2425188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78854/2425188.jpg"></div><h2>  Kanzashi step by step technique </h2><p>  There are two varieties of petals: sharp and rounded.  The kanzashi technique (making jewelry with your own hands, namely making flowers) includes the processing of slices with the flame of a candle or a lighter.  It is necessary to strictly observe safety precautions, and also not to bring the flame too close and long to the fabric in order to avoid fire and, as a consequence, fire. </p><p>  So, from the tapes you need to cut even squares.  Their size depends on what width you choose the tape - if the width is 5 centimeters, then the length must be 5 centimeters.  Sections must be flame treated. </p><p>  The number of squares depends on how many petals you want to get.  Using tweezers (you need to hold the ends of the square), you need to fold an even triangle so that the fold is on top. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to collapse" class="if uuid-2425156" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78854/2425156.jpg"></div><p>  Then fold the right and left corners of the resulting triangle together.  Then the newly formed corners add up in exactly the same way.  If necessary, the places of the bends are corrected.  Cut the ends a bit so that there are no sharp corners.  Now you need to lightly fasten the ends of the fabric together, holding a petal over the flame of a candle or lighter.  The edges are clamped with tweezers, everything must be done quickly, without waiting for the fabric to ignite.  It is important to remember that it is the ends of the fabric that are fastened together, that is, not along the entire length of the cut, but only sharp ends! </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flower petals" class="if uuid-2420314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78854/2420314.jpg"></div><p>  The photo shows a more complex version - petals, consisting of two fragments.  However, you can clearly see what should happen.  In another embodiment of the manufacture of sharp petals, it is necessary to cut out a circle from the square and fold it exactly as indicated in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lovesussexweddings.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="example how to fold" class="if uuid-2420181" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78854/2420181.jpg"></div><p>  The way the finished petal is different is different - in the first embodiment, the hole between the walls of the fabric, in the second embodiment, fastening with threads and a slightly different folding, as a result, the petal looks solid. </p><h2>  Round petals </h2><p>  In order to make the petals with a rounded end, it is necessary to fold the square from the tape with a triangle so that the fold is on top, while holding the ends with tweezers.  The lateral edges of the resulting triangle are reduced to the lower end.  In this case, the folds are obtained from above, on the sides.  Next, the lateral angles that turned out from above on the bends must be taken back, you need to check that the edges are evenly folded, all ends are held with tweezers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fold a round petal" class="if uuid-2425163" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78854/2425163.jpg"></div><p>  Now, as in the variant of sharp petals, sharp sharp corners are cut off, which are held by tweezers, and then slightly fused.  The edges of the petal also need to be melted and glued.  You can press the fabric with your fingers while it is still hot after contact with the flame. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="round petal" class="if uuid-2425167" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78854/2425167.jpg"></div><h2>  Flower picking </h2><p>  After the required number of petals is received, work begins on the assembly of flowers.  For this, a needle with threads is needed.  However, you can resort to a glue base, but in this case the product is less accurate. </p><p>  So the circle is the base of the flower.  It is cut out of thick paper or cardboard, then tightened with a cloth.  It is advisable to take the fabric of the same color as you want to get the product.  On the wrong sides, glue the base and the flower together.  If desired, you can make a core, leaves, curls.  The resulting flowers can be attached to a hairpin, decorate them with a gift box or create a small bouquet. </p><h2>  Educational videos </h2><p>  In order to better understand the technique of making flowers, as well as in order to get ideas that may turn out to be more original than those originally selected, you can and should watch instructional and orientation videos. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="wLkqoYHZJnU" data-url="https://youtu.be/wLkqoYHZJnU" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/6/2/5/2625.jpg"></div><p>  For clarity, it's worth watching more than one video.  Perhaps someone more clearly sets out the information, but someone does not know how to explain.  This is the second reason why you don‚Äôt need to dwell on a single video.  The so-called DIY, in which the use of the obtained colors is given directly, closes the video sequence. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="-gbRMODFVwI" data-url="https://youtu.be/-gbRMODFVwI" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/6/2/9/2629.jpg"></div><p>  So, fantasize, create, develop, everything is in your hands! </p>
