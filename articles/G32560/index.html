Moscow is the most densely populated city in Europe.  More than 10 million people live here.  The capital of Russia is also considered one of the oldest cities in European territory.  By 1147, the first written evidence of her belong.  Moscow in the 13th century became the center of a separate principality, and by the end of the 14th century - the capital, which unites the entire Russian state.  Since that time, it has been the center of the country's cultural and political life.  This is where typography begins, the first Russian-language newspaper is published, and the first public theater in Russia, the Kremlin comedy temple, opens in Russia. </p><p>  Consider the main attractions of Moscow.  A photo with the names and a description of them will be presented below.  We will tell only in general terms about the Russian capital, which can be talked about for a very long time. </p><h2>  Opening of Moscow University </h2><p>  Peter I, as you know, in 1713 moved the capital to Petersburg.  But Moscow remained the center of art and science.  It is no accident that it was in this city in 1755 that the first university of the country, Moscow, was opened.  Moscow since 1918 regains its lost status of the capital. </p><h2>  A variety of architects of the capital </h2><p>  Composing a description of Moscow, it should be said that all the milestones of Russian history were reflected in the architecture of the city.  The modern capital is a mixture of narrow lanes and wide highways, ancient palaces and high-rise buildings, vast forest parks and industrial areas.  It is so diverse that getting to know it gives the impression of traveling in space and time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of Red Square </h2>

The unusual landscape of the capital begins to be seen already here, in the city center.  These are the steep bends of the Moscow river, hilly reliefs, radial-ring layout.  All this is presented against the background of numerous churches and temples with sparkling gold domes.  Not only museums and temples are located inside the Kremlin walls.  Composing a description of Red Square in Moscow, one cannot but note two large pedestals: Tsar Bell and Tsar Cannon, which amaze the imagination of many tourists. </p><h2>  GUM </h2><p>  The pearl of Red Square is the sparkling fire of many bright colors St. Basil's Cathedral.  Here is GUM - a department store consisting of three floors.  It is one of the main local attractions.  Transitions in the form of arches connect three GUM lines.  When you walk here, it seems that you find yourself in a special ancient city. </p><h2>  Museums of the capital </h2><p>  <span>The sights of Moscow, the</span> description of which we are compiling, is not only Red Square.

    <p>  In the center are numerous theaters.  Many of them are monuments of architecture.  Various performances are being staged in Moscow: from opera to operetta and musical. </p><h2>  Arbat </h2><p>  Arbat is one of the most interesting places in the central part of the city, which presents many of the sights of Moscow.  Description of it will be interesting to many readers.  It should be said that Arbat is not only an old street.  Arbat is a whole district enclosed between Malaya and Bolshaya Nikitsky streets and Kropotkinskaya embankment.  Many great artists and writers lived here.  This area was repeatedly chanted in songs and poems.  On Arbat lived Leo Tolstoy and Pushkin, Bulgakov and Bunin, Okudzhava and Rybakov.

    <h2>  Kolomenskoye </h2><p>  Moscow is interesting not only for its center, where secular and cultural life is in full swing.  A brief description of the city should include information on parks and estates.  Moscow forest parks and estates deserve special attention.  One of them, the Kolomenskoye Museum-Reserve, is located on the site of an old estate of the great Russian princes and tsars.  On a rather small territory there is a complex of <span>monuments of archeology,</span> architecture and geology.  In the museum-reserve you can see huge boulders that have been preserved since the ice age.  However, its main feature is the monuments of tent architecture, which attract many tourists who fill Moscow at any time of the year.  A brief description of the city continues with a story about the park and the estate. </p><h2>  Tsaritsyno Park and Kuskovo Estate </h2><p>  Tsaritsyno Park is located in the south of Moscow.  It is interesting for a large ensemble of palace buildings.  Catherine II ordered the development of Tsaritsyno.  As a result, the Empress did not use these buildings, designed by Matvey Kazakov and Vasily Bazhenov, two great Russian architects.  The Grand Palace was not completed.  He is one of the largest in Moscow.  170 meters is the length of its facade.  In the Grand Kremlin Palace, for comparison, the length of the facade is 120 meters. </p><p>  Manor Kuskovo is located in the east of the capital.  It used to belong to Count Sheremetyev.  This manor is famous for its ceramics museum and its unique architecture.  You can see her photo below. </p>

    <p>  These monuments of Moscow are very curious.  A photo with the description above will help you get to know them better. </p><h2>  Ostankino </h2><p>  In the north is Ostankino.  This manor attracts tourists with its classic palace, which was built in the 13th century.  The white-boreal birch forest, typical of the landscape near Moscow, is located next to it.  The Ostankino tower rises above the park and the estate. </p><h2>  The face of the metropolis in the 20th century </h2><p>  In the 20th century, Moscow has changed a lot.  A description of the city should be made taking into account these transformations.  Many old buildings were demolished.  As a result of the construction of the same type of new buildings, the city has expanded greatly.  However, changes in the capital‚Äôs architecture were not only negative.  New sights of Moscow appeared.  We will introduce the names and descriptions of them to the reader. </p><p>  Seven monuments of Stalinist architecture became its symbols.  These are famous high-rise buildings.  Moscow University on Sparrow Hills is located in one of them.  The main viewing point of Moscow is an observation deck located on the Sparrow Hills.  The best panorama of the city is revealed from here. </p><h2>  VDNH (Moscow) </h2><p>  We will continue the description of the city with a brief acquaintance with another interesting place.  VDNH is a famous architectural monument of the Soviet period.  Later it was renamed VVC.  This is a whole complex of exhibition halls that are distinguished by a majestic appearance.  Between them are the famous fountains.  The most famous is the Friendship of Nations fountain.  It is decorated with golden figures.  Moscow can be proud of this fountain.  The photo with the description does not convey, unfortunately, all its splendor. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel "Cosmos" </h2><p>  Cosmos Hotel is located near the exhibition center.  Its name reminds us that the history of astronautics in our country began in this area.  Here, near Prospect Mira, domestic rocket science was born.  This is also reminded of by an obelisk crowned with a rocket, and a monument to Tsiolkovsky, the ancestor of astronautics, and the avenue in which there are busts of academicians Mstislav Keldysh and Sergey Korolev.  All these are important monuments that should be included in the description of Moscow. </p><h2>  Manege </h2>

    <p>  One of the best monuments of the period of late classicism is the Manege building.  It is distinguished by restrained power and breadth of design. </p><p>  The building was built in 1817 in honor of the fifth anniversary of the victory in the war of 1812.  The authors of the project were <span>architects Montferrand</span> and Beauvais, engineers - Kashperov, Betancourt, Carbonier.  The rhythm of the Doric columns located along the side facades allows you to forget about the great length of this building.  The usual tribute to the victory of Russian weapons at that time was the depiction of military regalia on them. </p><p>  The opening of the Manege was marked by a parade of troops who returned with victory shortly before from Paris.  Interestingly, the Moscow governor-general demanded to fill the building facades with sculptural compositions.  However, the urban planner Beauvais did not succumb to this seductive order, although it was the Manege that determined the face of the city‚Äôs development.  According to his plan, the building of Moscow University, located next door to it, should become the compositional center of the entire Manege Square. </p><p>  The huge hall of the Manege was blocked by a wooden suspended roof without supporting columns.  It was considered at that time a miracle of technology. The Manege was originally intended for parades, shows and exercises. Since 1831 it began to be used for other purposes - for concerts, folk festivals, exhibitions. Wooden rafters were replaced with metal in 1940. After a new reconstruction , in 1957, opened the Central Exhibition Hall, where various exhibitions are held to the present. </p><h2>  Moscow subway </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of the city is metro station, which is called the "underground palaces" of the capital.  They are distinguished by the splendor of the underground halls and vestibules.  The decision to build was made in 1931.  And the first project, shortly before the start of World War I, was approved by the City Duma.  In May 1935, on May 15, the first metro <span>line (Sokolnicheskaya line)</span> was opened for passengers <span>.</span>  Lublin entered into service last (in the 20th century).  This happened in 1995.  More than 20 types of marble were used in the construction of the subway, as well as onyx, rhodonite, porphyry, granite, labrador and other types of stone.  Reliefs, statues, monumental and decorative compositions adorn underground complexes.  They were created by leading masters of the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow museums description" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/316074.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <p>  The builders and architects of the Moscow Metro sought to not only create conditions comfortable for passengers, but also to give an individual look to each station.  One of the best is Mayakovskaya.  It was opened in 1938.  The pillars of the underground hall are made in the form of <span>metal columns</span> lined with stainless steel and granite.  Mosaic panels created according to the sketches of Deineka are located in the domes.  At an exhibition in Paris in 1937, the first-stage metro stations in Moscow received a prize for urbanism, and Mayakovskaya was awarded the Grand Prix. </p><p>  Among the great architectural monuments of the 30-50s belong the Kropotkinskaya, Novoslobodskaya, Mayakovskaya, Komsomolskaya stations with Korin mosaics, the ‚ÄúRevolution Square‚Äù, which is decorated with 76 bronze sculptures of Masiner, and others.  Metro during the Great Patriotic War was used as a bomb shelter.  New stations are notable for their strict design and simplicity. </p><p>  In order to navigate the subway, there are its schemes.  They are available in all lobbies.  Light pointers and automatic help devices also help. </p><h2>  Crimean bridge </h2>

    <p>  We continue the description of Moscow with a story about such a landmark of the city as the Crimean bridge.  In 1783, on the site of the Crimean ford, a wooden <span>Nikolaev bridge was built.</span>  After 100 years, it was replaced with metal with trellised trusses. </p><p>  In 1935, the Moscow River was decorated with six new bridges.  We will not make a description of them all.  However, the Crimean bridge deserves special attention.  He connected the Gorky Culture Park and Kaluga Square with the Garden Ring highway.  Krymsky, like other new bridges, blocks the embankments, thereby providing interchanges of transport at different levels.  It differs from others in the type of suspension structure.  This bridge is the only one hanging over the Moscow River.  Its length is 671 m. </p><h2>  Mansion F.O. Shekhtel </h2><p>  In 1896, the architect Shechtel built a private mansion.  It is distinguished, first of all, by the picturesque free composition of the building, which resembles a medieval castle.  In architecture, romantic trends preceding modernism were reflected. </p><p>  Living rooms overlook the garden, living rooms - onto the street.  In the center of the house is the main staircase.  The main rooms are arranged around it.  Above the side staircase and entrance are pointed peaks.  Mosaic of V. A. Frolov is located above the entrance.  She depicts 3 states of the iris: the disclosure of this flower, its flowering and wilting.  Wood of various species is widely used in interiors.  A fireplace decorated with relief is located in the square living room.  A balcony rises above it.  The building is used today as an embassy.  Soviet high-ranking officials lived here in the 1920s, including Bubnov, the People‚Äôs Commissar. </p><h2>  Ministry of Agriculture </h2><p>  This building, consisting of 8 floors, is made in the style of late constructivism.  It is located in the hub of the city, at the junction of several traffic flows.  Its basis is a <span>reinforced concrete frame</span> with hinged walls lined with plaster.  Remotely, the ministry as a whole resembles Mendelssohn's compositions.  It successfully harmonizes with the neighboring Central Union and Gostorg.  Along with elevators, constantly moving cabins are used in the building. </p><p>  These are the main attractions of Moscow.  Photos with names and descriptions will help you imagine the modern look of the Russian capital. </p>
