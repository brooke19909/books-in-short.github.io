    <p>  In addition, they are distinguished by the presence of powerful capacitors and resistors.  The controllers in the device are installed the most diverse.  To eliminate various interference in the system, electromechanical filters are used.  Today, many are interested in installing low-power transceivers at 50 watts. </p><h2>  Shortwave Transceivers (HF) </h2><p>  To make an HF transceiver with your own hands, you need to use a low power transformer.  Additionally, you should take care of the amplifiers.  As a rule, in this case, the signal permeability will increase significantly.  In order to be able to deal with interference, zener diodes are installed in the device.  Most often used are transceivers of this type in telephone exchanges.  Some make a HF transceiver with their own hands (tube), using an inductor that must withstand a maximum resistance of 9 ohms.  The device is always checked in the first phase.  In this case, the contacts must be set to the upper position. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Antenna and unit for HF transceiver </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself antenna for the transceiver using various conductors.

    <p>  In order to make the transceiver power supply yourself, you need a <span>high-frequency generator</span> that works in conjunction with a mixer.  Additionally, specialists use capacitors of various capacities.  The maximum voltage the device must withstand at a level of 50 V. The limit frequency in this case does not exceed 60 Hz.  To solve problems with electromagnetic interference, special circuits are used.  In the device, they are also designed to <span>double voltage.</span> </p><h2>  Ultrashort Wave Devices (VHF) </h2><p>  Making a VHF transceiver with your own hands is quite difficult.  In this case, the problem is finding the right inductor.  She is obliged to work on <span>ferrite rings.</span>  Capacitors are best used in various capacities.  Only phase controllers are used for phase change.  The use of multi-channel modifications for transceivers is not advisable.  Inductors in the system are needed with high frequency, and zener diodes are used to increase the accuracy of the device.  They are installed in transceivers only behind the transformer.  To prevent transistors from burning out, some experts advise soldering electromechanical filters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Models of long wave transceivers (LW) </h2><p>  You can make long-wave tube transceivers with your own hands only with the participation of powerful transformers.  The controller in this case should be designed for six channels.  The phase change of the receiver is carried out through a modulator that operates at a frequency of 50 Hz.  To minimize interference on the line, a wide variety of filters are used.  To increase the conductivity of the signal for some is obtained through the use of amplifiers.  However, in such a situation, care should be taken about the availability of capacitive capacitors.  It is important to install transistors in the system behind the transformer.  All this will improve the accuracy of the device. </p><h2>  Features of medium wave devices (CB) </h2><p>  It’s quite difficult to make do-it-yourself medium-wave tube transceivers yourself.  These devices work on LED indicators.  Bulbs in the system are installed in pairs.  In this case, it is important to fix the cathodes directly through capacitors.  The problem of increasing the polarity can be solved by using an additional pair of resistors at the output. </p>

    <p>  A relay is used to close the circuit.  The antenna to the microcircuit is always mounted through the cathode, and the power of the device is determined through the voltage in the transformer.  Most often, transceivers of this type can be met on airplanes.  There, control is carried out through the panel or remotely. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Antenna and unit for CB transceiver </h2><p>  You can make an antenna for a transceiver of this type using a conventional coil.  Its external winding should be connected to the amplifier at the output.  Conductors in this case must be soldered to the diode.  Buy it in the store is not difficult. </p><p>  To make a block for this type of transceiver, a relay is used, as well as a 50 V generator. Only field-effect transistors are used in the system.  The throttle in the system is required to connect to the circuit.  Feed-through capacitors in blocks of this type are used very rarely. </p><h2>  Modification of the transceiver VHF-1 </h2><p>  You can make this transceiver with your own hands on lamps using a 60 V transformer. The LEDs in the circuit are used to recognize the phase.  Modulators in the device are installed the most diverse.  <span>High voltage</span> transceiver is maintained by a powerful amplifier.

    <p>  In order for the device to successfully pass calibration, it is important to very accurately adjust the position of all transistors.  As a rule, the locking elements are placed in the upper position.  In this case, the heat loss will be minimal.  Lastly, a coil is wound.  The diodes on the keys in the system are checked before switching on necessarily.  If their connection is poor, then the operating temperature may increase sharply from 40 to 80 degrees. </p><h2>  How to make a transceiver VHF-2? </h2><p>  To properly fold the transceiver with your own hands, you must take the transformer to 60 V. The maximum load it must withstand at 5 A. To increase the sensitivity of the device, only high-quality resistors are used.  The capacitance of one capacitor must be at least 5 pF.  The device is ultimately calibrated through the first phase.  In this case, the locking mechanism is first set to the upper position. </p><p>  It is necessary to turn on the power supply, observing the display system.  If the limiting frequency exceeds 60 Hz, then a reduction in the nominal voltage occurs.  The signal conductivity in this case can be increased by an electromagnetic amplifier.  It is usually installed next to the transformer. </p><h2>  HF Slow Scan Models </h2><p>  It is not difficult to add the HF transceiver with your own hands.  First of all, you should choose the necessary transformer.  As a rule, imported modifications are used that can withstand a maximum load of up to 4 A. In this case, the capacitors are selected based on the sensitivity indicator of the device.  <span>Field effect transistors</span> in transceivers are quite common.  However, they are not without flaws.  They are mainly associated with a large error in the output. </p>

    <p>  This is due to an increase in the operating temperature on the external winding.  To solve this problem, transistors can be used with the LM4 marking.  Their conductivity is pretty good.  Modulators for transceivers of this type are only suitable for two frequencies.  The connection of the lamps is standard through a choke.  To achieve a fast phase change, amplifiers in the system are needed only at the beginning of the circuit.  To improve receiver performance, the antenna is connected through the cathode. </p><h2>  Multichannel Transceiver Modification </h2><p>  You can make a multi-channel transceiver with your own hands only with the participation of a high-voltage transformer.  It is required to withstand the maximum load up to 9 A. In this case, capacitors are used only with a capacity of more than 8 pF.  It is almost impossible to increase the sensitivity of the device to 80 kV, this should be taken into account.  Modulators in the system are used on five channels.  To change the phase, microcircuits of the PPR class are used. </p><h2>  Direct conversion SDR transceiver </h2><p>  To fold an SDR transceiver with your own hands, it is important to use capacitors with a capacitance of more than 6 pF.  This is largely due to the high sensitivity of the device.  Additionally, these capacitors will help with negative polarity in the system. </p><p>  For good signal conductivity, transformers of at least 40 V are required. At the same time, they must withstand a load of about 6 V. Microchips are usually designed for four phases.  Checking the transceiver begins immediately with a limit frequency of 4 Hz.  To cope with electromagnetic interference, field resistors are used in the device.  Two-way filters in transceivers are quite rare.  The maximum voltage in the second phase of the transmitter must withstand 30 V. </p>

    <p>  To increase the sensitivity of the device, variable amplifiers are used.  They work in transceivers for a couple with resistors.  To overcome <span>low-frequency oscillations</span> , stabilizers are used.  In the anode circuit, the lamps are installed in series through the inductor.  Ultimately, the device checks the closing mechanism and display system.  This is done for each phase separately. </p><h2>  Models of transceivers with L2 lamps </h2><p>  A simple transceiver is being assembled with its own hands using a 65 V transformer. Models with the indicated lamps differ in that they can work for many years.  The parameter of the operating temperature on average fluctuates around 40 degrees.  In addition, it should be borne in mind that they are not able to connect to single-phase microcircuits.  The modulator in this case is better to install on three channels.  Due to this, the dispersion rate will be minimal. </p><p>  Additionally, you can get rid of problems with negative polarity.  Capacitors for such transceivers are very diverse.  However, in this situation, much depends on the maximum power supply capacity.  If the operating current in the first phase exceeds 3 A, then the minimum capacitor volume should be 9 pF.  As a result, it will be possible to count on the stable operation of the transmitter. </p><h2>  MC2 resistor transceivers </h2><p>  In order to properly fold the transceiver with your own hands with such resistors, it is important to choose a good stabilizer.  It is installed in the device next to the transformer.  Resistors of this type can withstand a maximum load of about 6 A. </p><p>  Compared to other transceivers, this is quite a lot.  However, the payback for this is the increased sensitivity of the device.  As a result, the model is able to malfunction with a sharp increase in voltage on the transformer.  To minimize heat loss, the device uses a whole system of filters.  They should be located in front of the transformer so that the resistance ultimately does not exceed 6 ohms.  In this case, the dispersion rate will be negligible. </p><h2>  Single band modulation device </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself transceiver is assembled (the diagram is shown below) from a 45 V transformer. Models of this type are most often found at telephone exchanges.  Single-band modulators are quite simple in structure.  Phase switching in this case is carried out directly by changing the position of the resistor. </p>

    <p>  The ultimate resistance is not sharply reduced.  As a result, the sensitivity of the device always remains normal.  Transformers for such modulators are suitable with a maximum power of 50 V. It is not recommended to use field capacitors in the system by specialists.  From the point of view of experts, it is much better to use the usual analogues.  Transceiver calibration is carried out only in the last phase. </p><h2>  Model of transceivers on amplifier PP20 </h2><p>  You can make a transceiver with your own hands on an amplifier of this type using field-effect transistors.  In this case, the transmitter will transmit signals only short-wave.  The antenna for such transceivers is always connected via a choke.  Transformers are required to withstand the <span>maximum voltage</span> at 55 V. Low-frequency inductors are used to stabilize the current.  They work perfectly with modulators. </p><p>  A chip for a transceiver is best selected in three phases.  With the above amplifier, it is operated well.  Sensitivity problems with the device are quite rare.  The disadvantage of these transceivers can be called a low dispersion coefficient. </p><h2>  Transceivers with unbalanced power antennas </h2><p>  Transceivers of this type are quite rare today.  This is mainly due to the low frequency of the output signal.  As a result, their negative resistance sometimes reaches 6 Ohms.  In turn, the maximum load on the resistor is around 4 A. </p><p>  To solve the problem with negative polarity, special switches are used.  Thus, the phase change occurs very quickly.  You can even configure these devices for remote control.  The above antenna on the relay is installed with the marking K9.  Additionally, the inductance system must be well thought out in the transceiver. </p><p>  In some cases, the device comes with a display.  High frequency circuits in transceivers are also not uncommon.  Problems with oscillations in the circuit are solved by the stabilizer.  It is installed in the device always above the transformer.  At the same time, they must be separated from each other at a safe distance.  The operating temperature of the device should be around 45 degrees. </p><p>  Otherwise, overheating of the capacitors is inevitable.  Ultimately, this will lead to their inevitable damage.  Given all of the above, the case for the transceiver should be well ventilated with air.  Lamps to the chip are standardly mounted via a choke.  In turn, the modulator relay must be connected to an external winding. </p>
