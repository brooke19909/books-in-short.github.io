    <h2>  Guests on Nutrition </h2><p>  People who have been at the Royal Kenz Hotel Thalasso &amp; Spa 4 *, reviews about restaurants leave extremely positive.  They assure - here is a completely different ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù, not the same as in the hotels of other popular budget resorts.  Tables burst with frills, and everything is good, fresh, high-quality.  There are not even four stars, but five.  All in abundance. </p><p>  For breakfast, omelettes with various fillings and scrambled eggs are served - everything is fried directly at the guest, after his order.  There are boiled eggs, sausages, cheese and meat slices, sausages, yogurts, granola, hot chocolate pancakes and pastries, fruits, and much more.  For lunch and dinner - a variety of meat, ethnic dishes, king prawns, barbecue, grill, mussels, squid, fish, all kinds of pizzas and side dishes.  It is impossible to list everything.  Desserts also abound - ice cream, cakes, cakes, puddings, muffins, croissants.  And every evening here it takes shape somehow thematically. </p><p>  By the way, many people say that they calmly typed a little of everything in a plate and carried away to the room - they did not say anything.  And in terms of food with alcohol there are no restrictions - the dishes on the buffet are constantly replenished, and the waiters with bartenders are ready to serve visitors at any time.  So hungry to stay at this hotel just does not work. </p>

    <h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  Royal Kenz Hotel Thalasso &amp; Spa 4 * (Tunisia) has excellent modern apartments decorated in a pleasant style.  The rooms have a large comfortable 2 double bed, a dressing table, mirrors, a seating area, access to a private furnished balcony, and a bathroom with a separate shower and bath.  A flat-screen TV, Wi-Fi, a hairdryer, a telephone and air conditioning are all such amenities in the rooms. </p><p>  The apartments have excellent soundproofing.  But, if you want quiet rooms, then it is better to ask yourself for an option not with a view of the pool or animation zone.  Since there is always noisy. </p><p>  Prices are always different, as they vary depending on the season.  In winter, they are half as much - not only at the hotel, but throughout Tunisia.  Since there are many tourists here only in the summer.  After all, most people have holidays at this time of year. </p><p>  But on average, the price of a room per day with the all-inclusive service and all taxes is about 5,500 rubles for two people.  Only 38,500 rubles a week comes out.  For such a quality of service and excellent service, the price is very modest.  It is not surprising that many people come here. </p>

    <h2>  Important information </h2><p>  All purchases that a person makes at the hotel should only be paid in cash.  Also, if guests come to rest at the end of December, they will have to pay the obligatory dinner on December 24 and 31.  True, everything is already included in the reservation price, so guests should not be surprised at the slightly overpriced price tag. </p><p>  For an extra charge (for another guest or child) an extra bed can be provided.  A safe, by the way, is also offered, but only for 30 TND.  This is its cost for the entire stay. </p><p>  By the way, the Royal Kenz Hotel Thalasso &amp; Spa 4 * (Tunisia) has a dress code.  There are even announcements warning of this.  However, the dress code is soft - you just do not need to appear in the hall in swimming trunks or a swimsuit. </p><h2>  About service </h2><p>  Reviews for Royal Kenz Hotel Thalasso &amp; Spa 4 * (Sousse) are a special concern for staff.  Here he is welcoming and smiling.  Upon arrival, guests are greeted with cocktails, escorted to the room and make sure that they are happy with everything. </p><p>  Apartments are cleaned every day and towels are changed.  Bottles of clean water are also left.  If the number is not satisfied with something, it will be changed without problems and surcharges. </p><p>  The entertainers who host the show are also very perky and friendly people.  They really try and arrange interesting shows - with dances, performances by Kenyan acrobats, drawings on the sand, etc. </p><p>  The contingent at the hotel is pleasant.  Mostly adults, very few families with children.  Most of all Germans, French and Italians.  Russian is not enough.  For some it‚Äôs a plus, for others it‚Äôs a minus. </p><p>  By the way, the hotel still has great prices and tariffs.  They are not overpriced.  Even currency is better and more profitable to change here.  But not all at once.  Since back to dollars or euros, dinars can only be exchanged at the airport.  And there is a high course.  And the currency from Tunisia, by the way, can not be exported - only coins, perhaps. </p>

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  In general, this hotel has a lot of good reviews.  The complex is located on a large landscaped area, the purity of which is constantly monitored.  Everything is provided.  Even the pools have different depths. </p><p>  The beach is clean, which always has free sun loungers.  The sea is pleasant, but it is worth taking an ointment for burns with you.  Because sometimes in the water you can meet a jellyfish and get burned.  However, there are lifeguards on the beach who can be approached, and they themselves will smear the skin of the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù. </p><p>  The beach is private, and the entrance to it is closed late in the evening.  And also in the early morning.  But inventive Russian tourists have found a way with which you can get there if you really want to.  The road is close, but dark, so it‚Äôs better to bring a flashlight with you.  You need to leave the hotel on the street, turn left.  Take a little walk.  And turn into the first left turn.  Then walk along the wall again.  And after a couple of minutes of walking, the person will be near the sea - at the gate, into which he enters the beach during the day, but only on the other side. </p><p>  By the way, there is a port near the hotel.  It can be reached on foot.  On the streets of Tunisia in the evening it is safe, even for girls - they treat tourists here well.  Near the hotel there is local cooking.  It can be found if you cross the road from the complex and go to the right.  They sell incredibly delicious and fresh oriental sweets.  Ideal for a gift. </p><p>  In general, to summarize, we can say with absolute certainty that the hotel is excellent.  With reasonable prices and excellent after-sales service. </p>
