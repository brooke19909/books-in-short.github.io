    <h2>  1703 in the history of Russia: St. Petersburg </h2><p>  On May 16 (27), by decree of Emperor Peter I Alekseevich, the first stone of the new city was laid at the <span>mouth of the</span> Neva River.  The foundation of St. Petersburg was a strategic decision of the Russian emperor, since at that time there was a war between Russia and Sweden, and access to the Baltic Sea was a necessary condition for a future victory over the Swedes. </p>

    <h2>  City on the Neva </h2><p>  In the future, St. Petersburg became the most important city in the Russian Empire.  Thanks to its foundation, Peter the Great and his followers managed to establish trade and diplomatic relations with many European countries.  In domestic history, this event is ambiguous.  Some call Pyotr Alekseevich ‚Äúa great reformer‚Äù, others - a ‚ÄúWesterner‚Äù, who destroyed the sacred identity of our country.  The name of the city was chosen with an orientation towards the Orthodox St. Peter, but over time it became associated with its founder </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Geographically, St. Petersburg is located in the northwest of the modern Russian Federation, at the mouth of the Neva River.  In addition, the city is a key naval hub, where the main command of the Navy, as well as one of the administrative districts of the Russian armed forces, is located. </p><p>  It is officially accepted that the foundation of St. Petersburg is associated with the foundation of the Peter and Paul Fortress on May 27, 1703.  At the beginning of the 18th century, Russia entered the war with its adversary Sweden.  By the beginning of 1703, Peter the Great was able to conquer the land near the Neva.  To keep the acquired territories, it was necessary to thoroughly gain a foothold in the area. </p><p>  Although the <span>Nyenschanz fortress</span> already existed there <span>, the</span> Russian government decided that this was not enough to maintain its newfound position.  Tsar Peter Alekseevich and his associates chose the site of the foundation of the city Zayachy island.  At this place the famous Peter and Paul Fortress was laid.  It is interesting that the king himself was absent on the day the fortress was laid.  The supervision was carried out by the closest adviser to Peter the Great Alexander Menshikov. </p><h2>  What is significant in the history of Russia in 1703? </h2>

    <p>  At the foundation of the Peter and Paul Fortress, the construction of a whole city was not supposed, not to mention the future capital.  They decided to build fortifications from the earth and trees.  The project of a unique earthen-wooden fort was independently painted by Tsar Peter.  This attraction includes both a unique exterior and a masterfully decorated interior. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The highlight is the carved gilded iconostasis and the altar canopy - a gift to the Peter and Paul Cathedral, located in the fortress, from Peter I. The iconostasis was created in Moscow based on drawings by D. Trezzini, its design was made by Peter I and the Novgorod <span>group of carvers</span> under the direction of I.P. Zarudny.  The riches of the fortress are also the gifts of military glory of Russia - trophy banners, keys to cities and fortresses captured by Russian troops, but later some of the banners were lost or transferred to the collection, and copies remained hanging in the fortress. </p><h2>  Other events </h2><p>  But not only the beginning of the construction of the city on the Neva is significant in 1703 in the history of Russia.  What events have occurred yet?  Less well-known, but no less significant event was the construction of an arms factory.  The shore of Lake Onega, near the Lososinka River, has become a location.  The prince and part <span>-time governor-general of St. Petersburg</span> A. Menshikov was chosen as the construction manager. </p>

    <p>  In connection with the frequent visit to the plant by Peter the Great, such structures as a two-story wooden palace, a marching church of Peter and Paul, a pond, and a garden were specially erected for him. </p><p>  Subsequently, an urban settlement was founded around the plant.  Among the settlers there were ascribed peasants, Ural and Tula artisans sent to build a plant for the production of weapons.  Thus, the history of the city of Petrozavodsk - the capital of the Republic of Karelia, a region with an amazing history and nature began. </p>
