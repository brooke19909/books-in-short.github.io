  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Legal doctrine: definition and essence</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Legal dogma implies generally accepted basic provisions on the operation and establishment and provisions of positive law.  The doctrine of legal dogma (the justification and development of a general concept, individual provisions and the system as a whole) is called legal doctrine.  This concept is collective, denoting the totality of scientific legal judgments and interpretations of positive law, which forms the basis of the legal dogma. </p><p>  The legal doctrine substantiates and develops the main cognitive legal forms (concepts, principles, constructions, terms, means, methods, techniques), interpretations of positive law (its structure and system, sources, application and action, restoration and violation).  The entirety of these cognitive legal forms that interpret <span>positive law</span> is the content of the legal dogma. </p><p>  Thanks to these legal cognitive forms, the doctrine of law logically orders the chaotic and contradictory empirical material of existing law in the form of an internally coordinated and holistic system of positive law (with corresponding relationships and structural elements).  Thus, the legal doctrine comprises a mental (logical), legal model of positive law (method, method and theoretical and logical construction), used for the doctrinal proper interpretation and understanding of positive law, as well as for its action and actual establishment in reality. </p><p>  The described model of law is formed through a specific legal doctrinal dictionary, or using a specific system of special interconnected logical categories, concepts, definitions, verbal constructions and terms. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The semantic meaningful feature of the legal professional language is due to the fact that with its help the logic of generally binding requirements (norms and rules) of positive law is determined and characterized.  Legal language is used not only to describe this or that actual state, but also interprets (interprets) it from the legally due side. </p><p>  In fact, the legal doctrine and its legal language are descriptive (descriptive), prescriptive (prescriptive) in nature.  In addition, the legislative language, which expresses the effect and creation of positive law, is the generally accepted legal language created by the legal doctrine and expressing the normative general nature and legal doctrine. </p><p>  Therefore, proper use and mastery of the legal professional language, clarity and accuracy in the use of legal relevant terms, concepts, definitions, verbal language, ratings, characteristics, etc.  are the primary goal of <span>legal education</span> and an indispensable requirement of compliance in all areas of practice and theory of law with a legal culture. </p><p>  For a long time, the doctrine of law has appeared in various <span>legal systems as</span> one of the main, and in some cases, the main source of positive existing law.  And at present, doctrine is a category that plays a significant role in the processes of application and establishment of positive law.  And in many systems it is officially used as a valid source of law. </p><p>  In general, the legal doctrine of its logical legal interpretation not only reflects, but also determines, expresses, actively participates in the process of its implementation and creation.  Without the doctrine of law, there can be no definite <span>system of</span> positive <span>law</span> .  And even in cases where the legal doctrine is not an official <span>source of law,</span> in fact its provisions are present in all forms and content of its application and action. </p>
