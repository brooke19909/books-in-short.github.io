    <h2>  Near East </h2><p>  The new mandate system came into force after the <span>Treaty of Versailles</span> was signed in 1919 <span>.</span>  Article 22 of the document stipulated the fate of the colonies of the defeated empires. </p><p>  Turkey lost all of its possessions in the Middle East.  The Arab ethnic majority still lived here.  Winning countries have agreed that mandated territories should gain independence in the near future.  Until that moment, they were under the control of European powers. </p><p>  Mesopotamia was given to Great Britain.  In 1932, these territories became independent and formed the kingdom of Iraq.  Things were more complicated with Palestine.  This mandated territory also became British.  International jurisdiction here lasted until World War II.  After its completion in 1948, the lands were divided between <span>Jewish Israel,</span> Jordan and the Palestinian Arab government.  Features of the mandate system did not allow to resolve the conflict between the two warring parties.  These were Jews and Arabs.  Both of them believed that they had legal rights to Palestine.  As a result, throughout the second half of the 20th century (and today also), this armed dispute took place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Syrian provinces surrendered to France.  A mandate system was also established here.  In short, she reiterated the principles of British governance in neighboring countries.  The mandate ended in 1944.  All the Middle Eastern territories that were part of Turkey were united into group ‚ÄúA‚Äù.  Some lands of the former Ottoman Empire immediately after the end of the war fell into the hands of the Arabs.  They formed modern Saudi Arabia.  The British helped the Arab national movement during World War I.  Intelligence sent here the famous <span>Lawrence of Arabia.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Africa </h2><p>  Germany lost all of its colonies that it had captured over the past few decades after the <span>Second Reich</span> was formed <span>.</span>  African Tanganyika became mandated territory under British rule.  Rwanda and Urundi moved to Belgium.  <span>Southeast Africa</span> was transferred to Portugal.  These colonies were assigned to group ‚ÄúB‚Äù. </p><p>  A long decision was made on the colonies in the west of the continent.  As a result, the mandate system was confirmed by the fact that they were divided between the UK and France.  <span>South-West Africa</span> or modern Namibia came under the control of South Africa (the forerunner of South Africa). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The mandate system had a number of unique features for its time.  The states under whose control the territories fell guaranteed the observance of the charter of the League of Nations in relation to the indigenous inhabitants.  The slave trade was forbidden.  In addition, the state that received the mandate did not have the right to build military bases on the acquired lands, as well as to form an army of the local population. </p><p>  Most African mandated territories became independent after World War II.  Since the League of Nations was dissolved in 1945, the jurisdiction on these lands was temporarily transferred to the UN.  Especially many colonies gained independence within the <span>British Empire.</span>  The mandate system ceased to exist - the Commonwealth of Equal Members was created in its place.  In all countries of this organization, English and British culture have left a serious imprint.  The Commonwealth successfully exists today. </p>

    <h2>  Pacific Ocean </h2><p>  Also, before the war, Germany owned colonies in the Pacific Ocean.  They were divided at the equator.  The northern part was given to Japan, and the southern - to Australia.  These territories passed to the new owners as full-fledged provinces.  That is, in this case, the state could dispose of the new land as their own.  These were the so-called mandated territories of the ‚ÄúC‚Äù group. </p>

    <h2>  Other sanctions </h2><p>  Other restrictions affecting Germany included the denial of any privileges and concessions in China.  Even in this region, the Germans had rights to the Shandong province.  They were transferred to Japan.  All property in Southeast Asia was confiscated.  The German government also recognized the acquisition of allies in Africa.  So Morocco became French, and Egypt - British. </p>
