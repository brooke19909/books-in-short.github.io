The inhabitants of ancient Greece called him a free artisan, and according to myths, this is a deity who creates the universe from chaotic eternal chaos.  Adherents of epistemology call him the creator of the physical world with the initial elements of evil and the fall.

    <h2>  Demiurge - who is it? </h2><p>  The demiurge is a mythological character who is engaged in the creation of people, the world, the cosmos as a whole.  If we compare his work with the human, then his activity has much in common with the work of a craftsman.  Often the representatives of the <span>professions of a blacksmith</span> and potter, as well as a weaver, represented the Demiurges in myths.  However, his tasks will be somewhat more ambitious. </p><p>  For example, Hephaestus creates a shield that personifies the model of world existence.  A blacksmith deity named Ilmarinen made the moon and the sun.  Khnum, a god from Egypt, recreates cosmos, earth, and human beings in his <span>potter's wheel.</span>  Visvakarman from India is a carpenter, sculptor, blacksmith, ancestor of all things, a powerful creator of this world. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Divine destiny </h2><p>  God Demiurge, represented by the history of philosophy as the creator and progenitor of the Universe, does not create the world out of nothing.  He is engaged in the transformation of chaos into order, the restoration of harmony between the objects of space, the creation of the immortal component of the human soul.  He is often identified with God from the Old Testament. <br><br>  The Demiurge man (according to the theories of Mazdeism) is the first immortal man who was deprived of eternal life and expelled from the <span>Gardens</span> of <span>Eden</span> for sinful misconduct.  This is the oldest ancestor of the human race, who became the progenitor of all people on the planet, gave them the right to exist, and also gave them a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuffering. </p>

    <h2>  Good or evil? </h2><p>  In a literal way, the demiurge is the creator, creator of this world, but his personality can be identified in completely different ways.  From a Christian wheelbarrow, this is a god.  But in accordance with a certain number of philosophical and religious teachings, the Demiurge appears in various forms.  For some of them, it is characterized not at all from the positive side, but, on the contrary, is the dark beginning of everything. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Adherents of such a theory justify this by saying that the world is unfairly arranged.  The animal world is incredible cruelty, as representatives of the fauna, forming food chains, ruthlessly eat each other.  People also do not differ in exemplary behavior and humanity.  If you look at the world from such a terrible side, then it is not at all divine providence, but a real bloody feast. </p>

    <h2>  Demiurges among us </h2><p>  Feel like a demiurge, creator of your own universe!  It would seem that gods are common in people, but if you try, then imagine yourself in a role is not so difficult.  In human form, the demiurge is the creator.  Demiurges can be called people with an incredibly rich inner world, they are not considered like everyone else, otherwise they look at the space around them.  In their imagination, they are able to create whole worlds and universes, cities, seas and oceans, people or someone like them.  At such moments, they feel themselves immortal and omnipotent.  Demiurges live among people, and they don‚Äôt even notice them. </p>

    <h2>  Demiurges - a living embodiment of creativity </h2><p>  Such people are always single, they are not interested in a company of peers, they are always busy creating something important for them, their own world, where everything happens according to their will and consent.  In this case, it is not necessary to do something with your own hands, much more can be done by the power of imagination.  This attitude is typical for people of such a profession as, for example, a writer.  One of these authors can be called a science fiction writer by the name of Elterrus Iar, who wrote a book called Demiurges.  Landfill of the gods. " </p><p>  The so-called demiurges are people of creative professions who love and know how to create.  For example, musicians can also be called a kind of writers, because they write words for songs, as well as music, and this is also a kind of musical language.  "Demiurge of Dreams" is the name of the famous song and the whole album of one musical group. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="demiurge proving ground of the gods" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/871741.jpg" width="359"></div></h2><h2>  Psychological characteristics of the demiurge </h2><p>  There is an opinion regarding the impeccability and self-sufficiency of the demiurges, their activity is carefully thought out, and everything that they do is perfect.  This point of view may well be considered erroneous.  Why should they create other worlds if they themselves are already ideal and self-sufficient beings?  Such individuals can be characterized as striving for perfection and idealization, not of the real world, but of their own, invented.  That is, those who lack something in everyday life can calmly think of it in their imagination. </p><p>  Such people try to never copy or repeat anyone‚Äôs ideas and designs, nor do they create images like themselves, copying of any type is excluded.  This is the main point - to create something new, unique, not yet created.  It is interesting that most demiurges do not consider themselves as such, and interpret their activities as fun, entertainment, or game. </p>

    <h2>  Distinctive features </h2><p>  The most important value for demiurges is the life of sentient beings who must settle on the planet.  Elements such as mountains, seas, caves and sky are themselves secondary and serve only to sustain life.  The elements of fire, water, earth and air give the inhabitants power, and the sun, moon and other celestial bodies are needed only for making horoscopes. </p><p>  The prudent demiurge turns his attention to everything, not a single detail will slip away from his gaze.  He will certainly show his concern for humanity by creating those (gods in mind) to whom people could direct their prayers and hopes.  The good demiurge does not want people to despair, realizing that they have no one to count on in this life.  He also does not deprive people of their right to desire immortality. </p>

    <p>  If you raise the question of dreams, which people regard as something not very important, then anyone can become a demiurge for several hours.  Every night, a huge number of the most diverse worlds are born, and people still believe that the most important thing happens to them only in reality.  The demiurge of dreams is a rather interesting question, which is a mystery to humanity and encompasses a huge niche of the human subconscious - dreams.  Do they arise on their own or is someone actually creating them?  Such questions will remain unanswered for a long time to come. </p>
