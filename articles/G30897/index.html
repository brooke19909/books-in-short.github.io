Feedback from employees and customers gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe quality of services and the level of personnel management. </p><h2>  Normative base </h2><p>  A financial company conducts business on the basis of three perpetual licenses of the Federal Securities Commission of the Russian Federation for the implementation of activities: </p><ul><li>  brokerage; </li><li>  depository; </li><li>  dealership. </li></ul><p>  Permit forms received in 2002. </p><p>  The company cooperates with the <span>Moscow Exchange, the St. Petersburg Exchange</span> and other exchanges.  In 2016, OB customers performed operations worth 14.5 trillion rubles.  This is the second result.  The company took the same position in 2016 in terms of ‚Äúnumber of customers‚Äù and ‚Äútransaction volume‚Äù in the FORTS market. </p><p>  The company is part of the same group as Otkritie Bank.  The broker is forced to listen to reviews of the problem bank.  And then explain to the client that the bank is one organization, and the broker is another independent office. </p>

    <h2>  Customer base </h2><p>  The company's location in accordance with the charter is the city of Moscow.  Branches are located in 27 cities of Russia from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok.  The published customer reviews of Otkritie Broker can be sorted by good / bad.  Maybe this is the machinations of competitors, but there are criticisms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is laborious to apply the saying about diversity of opinions to the analysis of assessing the quality of work of this company.  It takes 1104 days, or 4.4 working years, to talk with each client for 5 minutes.  The amount of printed information will exceed the novel of the mirror of the Russian revolution.  According to the audit report, in 2016 the number of customers exceeded 94 thousand.  The semi-annual report for 2017 showed that customer flow is approaching 106 thousand.  With the reduction in the number of actors in the banking sector, confidence in the Otkritie Broker organization is growing.  And you need to be careful. </p><p>  Responsible people who want to enter into a relationship with a financial institution first study the company's annual balance sheet.  As a resident of the capital of the South Urals said, at first he was attracted by advertising - posters, stands, banners, the local press with the words ‚ÄúOpening‚Äù and ‚ÄúOpening Broker‚Äù.  Commission costs are low.  The Quick and Meta5 terminals provide.  Sit down and work.  But, having experience in financial and economic work, a person went to the site where the organization‚Äôs annual reports are posted and saw the results for 2016: </p><ul><li>  Dealer - at a loss. </li><li>  Depository - in the red. </li><li>  Consulting - surprisingly, but the bottom line is negative. </li></ul><p>  In addition, they worked on brokerage, market-making and leasing of property. </p><p>  Cons outweighed, and the year ended in an accounting loss.  The citizen did not dare to choose a loss-making company.  The man turned around and went to the office of the rating leader, BKS. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Preference is given to customer reviews - "physicists".  Legal entities have their own services for building relationships in the field of the current law.  And if there is no competent lawyer, then there will be funds to solve disputed problems.  Individuals are left to their own devices.  In a risky industry such as trading, you have to rely on yourself.  Therefore, caution in choosing a broker is important. </p>

    <h2>  How to open a brokerage account </h2><p>  The account ownership process is advertised for half an hour.  A model contract with sixteen annexes was last brought into compliance with the law in December 2017. </p><p>  You can open a brokerage account: </p><ul><li>  through the state website  services if the person has an account there; </li><li>  without state website  services by preparing an identity card, TIN and retirement number. </li></ul><p>  In the customer reviews of Otkritie Broker, the topic of contract execution is discussed.  In December, the author spoke with a man who was trying to embark on the path of exchange trading through the state.  services.  Profanity is not subject to publication.  From the rest of the words a sentence is drawn up: ‚ÄúI spent half a day - it didn‚Äôt work, we have to go to the office‚Äù. </p><p>  The account was offered to replenish by 50 thousand rubles.  In pensions, this is four payments; in average South Ural salaries, this is one and a half monthly income.  Regardless of which broker office the trader will carry the money to, experienced and beaten by trading citizens advise their colleagues not to play for the latter.  No matter how European the company may look, a person carries his own money, Russian rubles, earned by honest labor.  And it should be funds free of obligations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In fact, the company positions itself as an office working with professional large players, which is shown by the annual report.  Accordingly, individuals are expected with funds. </p><h2>  Fantasy client plus broker experience </h2><p>  Let's consider reviews about the structural products of ‚ÄúOpening Broker‚Äù.  SP is a paraphrased proverb about eggs in one basket.  Since investing is an event with a high level of risk, the broker suggests minimizing possible losses from operations with securities. </p><p>  For example, a person is not ready to play shares, then such a client is offered a coupon product.  The bottom line is the purchase of shares in sustainable companies.  Guaranteed income above the bank deposit rate.  These are liquid blue-chip issuers that have been working for a long, long and long-term.  Let stocks go down due to market forces.  An investor in a structural coupon product is accrued income.  The size of the income rate is discussed with a broker representative.  Because for each issuer threshold price values ‚Äã‚Äãare selected. </p><p>  The company itself, as a positive example, cites operations with Gazprom and Sberbank shares from 2013 to 2015.  When customers received income from rising stock prices and guaranteed income from investing in this particular product. </p><p>  An example of minimizing losses are <span>structural products</span> for precious metals.  The broker suggested customers invest in gold.  For an average term.  With investment protection.  As often happens, the price went the wrong way.  Decision makers are moody.  Customers who invested in a protective structural product at the end of the contract received all of their funds back.  Costs amounted to 10 rubles - the office commission. </p>

    <h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  How to get access and what is the use?  When executing a contractual relationship, together with the contract, the user receives a password and login from a personal account. </p><p>  Through the LC, the trader can choose the services of a broker, adjust the list - include and delete.  You can also confirm voice instructions.  There were times when orders sent to the broker from the phone had to be executed in writing at the office.  Now you just need to go to the LC and enter the code that came from the broker to the phone as an SMS message. </p><p>  In the office are available: </p><ul><li>  reports on the activities of the trader; </li><li>  message lists; </li><li>  lists of orders. </li></ul><p>  If the memory failed and the password is lost, then there is no need to go to the office for a new envelope.  You can recover your password through the broker's website. </p><p>  Ease of use of the LC fades when the word "server" is mentioned. </p><p>  In private conversations, traders admit that the server often freezes before the end of the trading session.  And not only in those moments when the exchange as a whole is turned off.  An individual office brokerage trip last time was November 30th.  Technical support calls the reasons streamlined-standard.  And traders endure emotions on the forums.  Through the forums, the entire trading community learns the reliability of hardware and programs from a particular broker.  After all, apologies in the wallet do not ring and do not gurgle in the glass. </p><p>  Another observation is that the fees in the contract are written in petit.  The trader earned profit on transactions, wants to withdraw and withdraw by the New Year holidays, but the amount is credited to the current account somewhat less - by the size of the withdrawal commission.  And you can‚Äôt say that you didn‚Äôt warn.  Therefore, comrades who have gone through the crucible of interaction with the "Opening Broker", are advised to read the contract before signing.  Including small letters, which later turn into large payments. </p>

    <h2>  Personal broker </h2><p>  Opinions of Discovery Broker employees in Moscow about clients are concise, diplomatic and correct.  It cannot be any other way - a person brings capital to the office, which, with skillful management, can be increased for the client and for himself. </p><p>  "Opening Broker" offers: </p><ul><li>  a set of services of excellent quality; </li><li>  personal manager for investments in securities; </li><li>  tailored solutions and action plans specifically for this client; </li><li>  Fresh ideas on investing through Russian and foreign markets. </li></ul><p>  A personal broker appoints a professional with extensive experience.  The most intriguing responses are obtained from the answers to the question about the personal discovery broker.  Reviews were given by three people - one from the Moscow region, two from the Chelyabinsk region.  They shared their thoughts on the personal broker service. </p><p>  People quite legally accumulated a large amount of Russian money in the real sector of the economy.  Bank deposits in the amount of 5-6% seemed a trifle.  In addition, they all had experience working with vouchers.  Therefore, the idea came to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãplacing available funds in the securities of Russian and foreign issuers.  By the will of fate, with all the wealth of choice, they turned their eyes on the Otkritie Broker company. </p><p>  The reception at the office was cordial, in accordance with the funds proposed for placement.  Appeal by name and patronymic, conversation in a separate office, confidential intonation, coffee cookies.  LB was ready to answer all customer questions.  He suggested not to put the eggs in one basket.  He recommended a long-term investment plan with exciting returns. </p><p>  Workdays began <span>.</span>  Everyone has their own work.  Periodically, meetings were held under coffee.  The friendly and gracious tone of the conversation inspired hope for a transition from a black strip to a white one.  One of the interlocutors said that his deposit for the year decreased by 32%.  The other two had lower drawdowns, but still more than losses from inflation.  Replica of one of the respondents: ‚ÄúI was recommended this top manager as the best professional.  If this is the best, then what are the advice of others who are without regalia? ‚Äù  In the end, one of the interlocutors closed the account and left to look for the best share in BCS.  The other two, having acquired over three years experience in the bond market, decided not to play Vovka in the Far Far Away kingdom anymore, but to make decisions on their own. </p><p>  The man who opened the large deposit emphasized the following: ‚ÄúIt is convenient for me to work on the basis of the‚Äú Opening Broker ‚Äù, the commission is satisfied, the terminals are available.  But I‚Äôm not using the LB service. ‚Äù  Maybe these are isolated cases of sad reviews about personal brokers.  Still, the customer base rolls over a hundred thousand.  And among this army of dealer traders, a whole division uses the services of a personal consultant.  But most people think about their money with their own heads. </p>

    <h2>  IIS </h2><p>  Noteworthy is the strategy of working with IMS in the ‚ÄúOpening Broker‚Äù.  Reviews about <span>individual investment accounts of the</span> fresh spill will come in the reporting period from February to April.  The feasibility of the promised, the actual percentage of profitability for three years of ownership, bureaucratic delays, stories of failures - everything will be in the first half of 2018. </p><p>  To attract customer flow, solutions have been developed for both rogues and oligarchs.  Alas, the reality of life is this - 50 thousand earnings in terms of exchange trading - poverty. </p><p>  The company appreciates the development of financial literacy of citizens.  At the same time, the organization understands that the layer with a free million in the zashashnik is small.  Therefore, there are no restrictions for opening an <span>investment account</span> .  Do not immediately pay 400 t.  or one million.  Account replenishment is allowed monthly, quarterly or once per reporting year.  The rules stipulate that during the year more than one million cannot be deposited into the account. </p><p>  The IIS contract is concluded for three years.  You can use the deduction from the amount of 400 thousand rubles only once for a three-year period.  The benefit is 13% or 52,000 rubles. </p><p>  The brokerage company offers a choice of option: </p><ul><li>  for independent management - a person selects tools for trading; </li><li>  trade in finished samples - for those who are at the beginning of a dive into a trade; </li><li>  trust broker - six varieties of the plan. </li></ul><p>  When working through a personal account, a client can perform operations on the stock and currency markets, on the derivatives market inside the IIS.  The main thing is that by the end of December, funds should be recorded on the IIS for processing a tax deduction. </p>

    <h2>  What will happen when the license is revoked </h2><p>  No one is 100% insured against failure.  Another revolution may happen with the change of government and business owners.  War may begin.  Against such divergences there is no opposition. </p><p>  Consider the less tragic reasons: the regulator's decision to terminate the Opening Broker.  Revocation of the license affects the fate of deposits.  IIS and brokerage deposits of individuals are not protected by the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).  During the bankruptcy of the company, all placed money will burn.  The hope of the impossibility of the above circumstances promises the inclusion of Otkritie Bank on the list of systemically important banks.  State protection of the bank guarantees the protection of related structures. </p><h2>  Employee Messages </h2><p>  Official reports provide food for thought about the frames of the Opening Broker.  Employee reviews are a private sight.  The report with the audit report reports: staff turnover.  In the annual financial report for 2016, figures were published - 792 employees at the end of the year.  Moreover, the average number in the last year amounted to 643 people. </p><p>  No feedback from employees was found.  Because the company is watching over the quality of the material in the press.  Positive feedback about the employer ‚ÄúOpening Broker‚Äù is regarded as advertising.  No sane citizen will voice a negative opinion.  Nobody wants to lose their jobs because of talkativeness.  Therefore, only opinions of former employees are available to the review. </p><p>  Positive moment - the company pays attention to improving the educational level.  Seminars and conferences replenish the luggage of knowledge of all participants: both employees, customers, and users of the services of the Otkritie Broker company. </p>
