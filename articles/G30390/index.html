For example, one of the most common problems is revoking a license from a lender.  As a result, many are simply at a loss as to who and how to pay the loan.  This is exactly what happened with such an organization as Probusinessbank.  In order to reduce the passions among panicking borrowers, we decided to tell in detail where to pay loans to Probusinessbank after its liquidation.  We will tell you more about this later. </p>

    <h2>  Short Bank Summary </h2><p>  Probusinessbank was founded in early 1993.  Since its inception, this <span>lending</span> <span>institution</span> has embarked on <span>lending to small and medium-sized businesses.</span>  Later, she introduced car loan programs into her universal portfolio of services and began to issue loans to individuals.  It was these innovations that helped the bank to occupy a leading position in this niche by 1998. </p><p>  At the end of 2006, JSCB Probusinessbank joined the large holding Life, continuing to focus on customers operating in various business structures.  Closer to 2015, in addition to this financial institution, other banks joined the Life group.  And the lending institution itself has acquired an enviable retail network of 230 offices and branches, and a full-fledged operating cash desk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What services did the bank offer its customers? </h2><p>  During work, JSCB Probusinessbank offered its customers the following types of services: </p><ul><li>  deposit programs; </li><li>  project and <span>tender lending</span> ; </li><li>  overdrafts; </li><li>  factoring and leasing; </li><li>  acquiring </li><li>  currency operations; </li><li>  rental of safes and cells; </li><li>  REPO operations; </li><li>  letters of credit; </li><li>  remote service and many others. </li></ul><p>  At that time, among the regulars of this financial organization were noticed such companies as Moscow Coffee Shop on Shares, Bogorodsky Delicatessen, Izhora Plants, Volga Shipbuilding Plant and others. </p>

    <h2>  Deprivation of the license: what are the reasons </h2><p>  Despite the high ratings and great popularity among business representatives, the bank still lost its license.  It happened in early August 2015.  The main reason for this decision by the regulator was a systematic violation by Probusinessbank of federal law.  And of course, the financial institution could not do without conducting a high-risk credit policy with the subsequent investment of money in low-quality assets.  In a word, "finita la comedy."  And so the activity of the center player of the credit policy of the Life group, better known as Probusinessbank, ended.  How to pay a loan after revoking a license from this financial institution, we say further. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where can I find the details of credit organizations for payment? </h2><p>  Revoking a license from a beloved lender was a real shock for the bank's customers.  Most of the borrowers, as we have said, were quite large entrepreneurs, so none of them fell into despair.  However, among them were individuals who were interested in where they should turn now in order to pay off the ill-fated loan.  Many of them at one time even gathered near the bank‚Äôs Moscow office and picketed the entrance to the building.  They demanded clarification from the management of the company and, of course, the return of money on deposits. </p>

    <h2>  Which banks can pay a loan without commission? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Deposit Insurance Agency has already appointed several financial organizations that are ready to accept payments on bankrupt bank loans, many borrowers prefer to pay a loan at the nearest financial institutions, most of which are clearly not ready to work for ‚Äúthank you‚Äù.  Taking the opportunity, they set their commission for servicing third-party customers.  And this is, after all, an additional cost.  In order to avoid them, you must first find where to pay Probusinessbank loans without commissions. </p><p>  In order to facilitate your task, we name the most basic of agent banks: </p><ul><li>  PJSC Russian Capital. </li><li>  PJSC Transcapitalbank. </li><li>  OAO Tatfondbank. </li><li>  PJSC Sovcombank. </li><li>  Payment Center LLC (using the Golden Crown service). </li></ul><p>  Here's where to pay loans from Probusinessbank <strong> </strong>  can <strong> </strong>  no additional fees. </p><h2>  How to find the addresses of agent banks for payment? </h2><p>  In order to find out where the nearest branch of the agent bank is located, you should go to the DIA main page, select ‚ÄúBank liquidation‚Äù, go to the ‚ÄúMember banks‚Äù tab, open the alphabetical list and search for the appropriate organization.  For example, one of the branches of PJSC Russian Capital is located in Moscow on Bolshaya Molchanovka Street, 21 / A. </p><p>  A representative office of Transcapitalbank PJSC can be found, for example, in Bryansk (Sovetsky District), on Proletarskaya Street, 1. The branch of Tatfondbank OJSC, where to pay Probusinessbank loans, is located in Kazan, on Vosstaniya Street, 31/26. </p><p>  Offices and branches of Sovcombank PJSC can be visited, for example, in the city of Alexandrov.  There is a bank representative office located on Lenin street, 24, building 1. The second branch of the financial organization is located on Tereshkova street, 6. </p><p>  In turn, Payment Center LLC is another agent representing Probusinessbank.  How to pay a loan in this organization (in cash or by card), you decide.  The main thing is to contact the network partner salons.  Among them are the following intermediaries: </p><ul><li>  Euroset. </li><li>  Beeline. </li><li>  Frisbee. </li><li>  MTS. </li><li>  Maximus </li><li>  Kari. </li><li>  Agent.Ru. </li><li>  "Tsifrograd". </li><li>  "Sangi Style". </li><li>  "Division" and others. </li></ul><p>  In addition to the DIA website, detailed contacts of credit payment acceptance points can be found on the official website of the Zolotaya Korona service credit-korona.ru.  To do this, it is not at all necessary to look for information regarding the bankrupt organization Probusinessbank.  How to pay a loan will tell you the tab "Where to pay."  By clicking on it, you will see a list of the nearest offices displayed on the map. </p><p>  So, if you live in Moscow, you can pay the loan at one of the Euroset representative offices.  It is located at 4 Oktyabrskaya Street. </p>
