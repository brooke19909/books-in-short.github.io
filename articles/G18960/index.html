    <h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  <span>Adler railway station</span> appeared a very long time ago - in 1929.  It was built long before the moment when this area became part of Sochi.  The building was built in the Stalinist style, I must say, it is not as large as the modern version.  The station belongs to the North Caucasus Railway and, by the way, is considered one of the largest and largest railway terminals in all of Russia.  The station also has one key feature, which is that the building is located almost on the shore of the Black Sea.  In order to be near the sea, you must cross the path.  Many are surprised at this location, but everything is really simple.  After all, Sochi is a city that stretches along the coastline for many tens of kilometers, so the sea here, you can say, is everywhere. </p>

    <h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  Only five years ago they began to build a new station building, it was decided to place it east of the old one.  It all started due to the fact that the 2014 Winter Olympics were to be held in Sochi.  As a matter of fact, not only the Adler station has undergone changes.  Four years of large-scale work was carried out over all Sochi - <span>hotels, hotels</span> were built, roads were reconstructed, and freeways were built.  So, the architect group, headed by A.P. Danilenko, was engaged in the creation of the project of the adler station.  The passenger distribution hall was placed at a height of ten meters above the railway tracks.  And the complex itself was divided into two parts - sea and city.  Thanks to this distribution, it turned out to create a comfortable and modern station.  It meets all the requirements for such buildings - it is competently equipped from a technical point of view, has an interesting design and harmoniously fits into the environment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Project </h2><p>  Railway station "Adler" as a project appeared in 2009.  It is interesting that initially the architect's development caused a lot of questions and comments.  Therefore, the project had to be transferred to the Sochi branch of the NGO Mostovik, so that other experts reanalyzed it and corrected the shortcomings.  The deadlines were tight, no one was going to move the Olympics, because the construction was to begin as soon as possible.  Therefore, the station had to be designed in parallel with its construction, which had already begun by then.  It was difficult, since the foundation already being erected was used as a basis for coming up with a new layout and image of the entire building.  There were risks, and considerable ones - in just eight hours, with the help of powerful jacks, it was possible to raise just a giant roof, which had previously been assembled at the lowest level of the station.  The deformation of the structure at the time of installation was about 1.5 meters, however, as soon as the lift was completed, all the marks were occupied, as expected.  The architects from the GMP company helped this in the Sochi specialists - this is a German company whose employees built <span>the Tegel Airport in Berlin</span> and the central station of the German capital.  Their experience helped to apply new technologies in the construction of the Adler station and to develop its logical scheme.  In general, a few months after the start of construction, the work was adjusted, and everything went according to plan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Station "Adler" is very beautiful and attracts the attention of everyone, no matter who passes by.  However, this design may have remained un embodied in reality.  The fact is that German architects saw the building more simple, rectangular, one might say ‚Äúdry‚Äù.  However, the author of the project insisted on his own.  Indeed, against the backdrop of the majestic <span>Caucasus Mountains</span> , a building made in a special picturesque design should rise.  The station, located right next to the sea, should not be ordinary.  It should be reflected in the Black Sea.  It was this idea that influenced the architect‚Äôs decision to implement the theme of the sea wave in the building.  The author of the project insisted on his own, and we can see the result today. </p>

    <h2>  Popularity </h2><p>  Every day, more than ten thousand people pass through the Adler station.  Both suburban and intercity trains depart from the station.  Express trains and aeroexpresses are especially popular.  This direction is from Sochi to Krasnaya Polyana and to the Airport.  Suburban trains also run from Tuapse to Adler and vice versa.  And, of course, there are still many directions to such points as: Saratov, Kiev, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, <span>Moscow, Krasnoyarsk,</span> Murmansk, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Irkutsk, Novokuznetsk, Barnaul, Arkhangelsk, Blagoveshchensk, Severobaykalsk, Cherepovets and etc. And this is by no means a complete list of cities to which you can leave from the Adler station.  The main problem for locals has always been the search for a place in an unfamiliar city.  It will take only one thing to find the "Adler" (station) - a map.  And getting to it is also easy - from the center to the station there is a bus number 125 and a fixed-route taxi number 124. And you shouldn‚Äôt worry about the stop either - the driver always stops at the right point: ‚ÄúAdler Station.‚Äù Just in case, the address is also remember - there is a station on Lenin Street, 113. </p>
