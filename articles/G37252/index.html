And their originality is that these are two bridges, united by one name, which they borrowed from the third.  It will be about Sergievsky, Pushkin, Novoandreevsky bridges in Moscow.  Let's see what they are today and in the past. </p><h2>  Novoandreevsky bridge in Moscow.  Today </h2><p>  Novoandreevsky (Andreevsky) bridge - the railway crossing of the Small Ring of Moscow railway (leads to the Kanatchikovo station) and part of the automobile crossing of the 3rd transport ring.  Thrown across the Moscow River. </p><p>  Type of construction - arched.  The main material is concrete.  The total length is 264 m, of which 135 m are in the main span.

    <p>  Why is Novoandreevsky?  It is located near the place where the Sergievsky (Andreevsky) bridge was built in 1905-1907.  the buildings.  The main arch of the old building is decorated with the pedestrian Pushkinsky (Andreevsky), which connects Gorky Park with the Frunze <span>Embankment of the Moscow River.</span> </p><h2>  Sergievsky (Andreevsky) bridge </h2><p>  It is known that the first railway trains of the Small Railway Ring of Moscow between the Vorobyovy Gory and Kanatchikovo passed through a wooden crossing.  Its length was 278 m, and truss spans - 32 m. The construction of the "Lembke system" at the same time had full channel abutments.  And its construction cost 100 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, then a permanent bridge was built in place of the wooden one, which stood until 1999.  We will deal with his names.  Initially, the building was named Sergievsky - in honor of the capital's Governor General, Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich Romanov, who was killed by the Socialist Revolutionaries.  But after the February Revolution, it was renamed Andreevsky.  This name was given by <span>the Andreevsky Monastery</span> located nearby on the banks of the <span>Moscow River,</span> which was subsequently closed. </p>

    <p>  The bridge was built in 1905-1907.  according to the plans of the architect A. N. Pomerantsev and engineer L. D. Proskuryakov.  The construction had a main span with a crescent arch and two side spans.  On the consoles arranged sidewalks for pedestrians.  I must say that the foundations of the crossing relied on the foundations of wooden piles, which, even in 1999, were in satisfactory condition! </p><h2>  Andreyevsky railway bridge </h2><p>  And now let's move on to the modern Novoandreevsky bridge in Moscow.  It was erected as a necessary component of the 3rd transport ring parallel to the Small Railway.  It was necessary to lay both an 8-lane automobile and <span>railway bridge.</span>  To do this, the railway was moved north from the historic road.  It was also necessary to move the supports of the old bridge at 22 m.  However, an analysis of his condition showed that this was impractical. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The former Sergievsky bridge was eventually moved one and a half kilometers downstream.  In its place, the Novoandreevsky bridge of Moscow was built - the automobile, which was commissioned somewhat earlier, and the railway.  The chief engineer was S. S. Tkachenko. </p>

    <p>  Thus, two electrified highways of the Small Moscow Railway Ring pass along the bridge.  They are located within the Kanatchikovo station, while the main route development begins already behind the Gagarinsky tunnel.  Until 2016, railway traffic was only freight traffic.  Then, as a result of the reconstruction of the Small Ring, the passenger was also established. </p><p>  The Novoandreevsky bridge in Moscow, the photo of which we presented, is not only automobile and railway.  A pedestrian path passes along its northern side, along which you can get from one shore to another, to Gagarinsky Square. </p><h2>  Pedestrian Pushkin Bridge </h2><p>  In conclusion, we want to tell you about another crossing.  The pedestrian Novoandreevsky bridge is also called the <span>Pushkin bridge.</span>  It connects Frunze embankment with Pushkinskaya near Gorky Park. </p><p>  Why is he also Andreyevsky?  It is based on the main arch of the Sergievsky bridge.  This structure, weighing 1,500 tons, was transported by three barges in an hour and a half to its current location.  In addition, in connection with these events, on the side of the Neskuchny Garden, a sign was installed near the crossing telling about the history of the Andreevsky Bridge.  Therefore, the formal name "Pushkin" is rarely used.  In many reference books, on maps this bridge is called Andreevsky, Novoandreevsky. </p>

    <p>  This is the story of three metropolitan crossings.  The old Sergievsky (Andreevsky) bridge was replaced by the railway and automobile Novoandreevsky.  And its main arch "gave life" to the pedestrian Pushkinsky (Andreevsky). </p>
