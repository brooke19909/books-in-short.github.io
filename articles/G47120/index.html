    <p>  The solution to a number of problems was as follows.  The messenger copied your contacts from the address book to your list, and took phone numbers for unique user IDs.  At the same time, the SIM card number became a login, and messages from users arrived on it.  No registration is needed, as the messages were in the form of SMS, but much cheaper. </p><p>  So, the Watsapp program - what is it?  This is a messenger that is starting to outstrip Quipa, ICQ and Skype in popularity. </p><h2>  Is it possible to install "Whatsapp" on iPad </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the iPhone and iPad are the products of one company, there have been problems with installing our application on a second device until recently.  It required a jailbreak.  Now this issue has been resolved.  To complete the task we need: the iPad itself, an iPhone (for registering the application) and a computer.  In this case, it is completely indifferent under what operating system the PC is running.  It can be both Windows and OS X. The difference in installation is so insignificant that you can ignore it. </p><p>  We bring to you information that this method has been repeatedly tested almost and is completely suitable for iOS7, starting with iOS 4.3.  So, let's get started. </p><h2>  Install "Whatsapp" on iPad </h2><p>  Our procedure with the installation of "Vatsapp" for iPad is performed in stages and consists of 12 points: </p><ol><li>  First of all, you need to install iFunBox - a manager for managing files <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="whatsapp for computer" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/384267.jpg?1398700156203" width="600"></div>  between Apple devices and a computer.  You can download it from his own site. </li><li>  Next, launch native iTunes, go to the App Store and download the necessary Watsapp application from there. </li><li>  We find the downloaded file on the PC and place it on the desktop. </li><li>  We connect the tablet to the computer and start the iFunBox file manager. </li><li>  Click the “Install App” button.  In the window that opens, you need to specify the Vatsapp file from the desktop and open it using the special button.  As a result of this, the program through iFunBox will be downloaded to the device.  Remember that before using the messenger, it must go through the activation procedure. </li><li>  To do this, open it on your tablet computer and activate via SMS via iPhone. </li><li>  Now be sure to connect the same gadget with the activated application to the computer. </li><li>  On the left side of iFunBox, select the connected phone and the User Application file section, on the right - "Whatsapp". </li><li>  We are looking for two folders, Library and Documents, we also copy them to the desktop. </li><li>  After completing the copy operation, turn off the iPhone you are using and connect our new device on which Watsapp is already installed. </li><li>  Once again, you need to run the iFunBox manager.  On the left, select your device and the already known section User Application.  On the right is Watsapp. </li><li>  Finally, delete the folders with the names Library and Documents, and also copy the two directories that were previously placed on the desktop. </li></ol><p>  We did without a dreary jailbreak and can now run the program without any problems. </p><h2>  Conclusions on the use of the messenger </h2>

What is it, billions of users around the world know.  Few programs can boast such popularity.  To all the above messenger functionality, you can add the possibility of <span>parental control.</span>  That is, you can track all the correspondence of your child, what files he receives and sends.  To do this, you must additionally install one of the special programs.  Also, spouses can track each other, because applications are invisible to users.  But here you need a lot of accuracy.

    <p>  In general, “Vatsapp” most people praise, are satisfied with its use.  Of the shortcomings, it should be noted that you need to download the program very carefully, only from official sources, since there is a chance of getting a virus or "getting" for money.  Also, users complain that they constantly need an Internet connection.  Although the farther, the easier this question becomes. </p>
