    <h2>  The history of unusual knitting techniques </h2><p>  The name of the technique comes from the English noun swing, which in translation sounds like ‚Äúswing‚Äù, ‚Äúswing‚Äù.  We can say that this fashionable knitting is just a new interpretation of the well-forgotten old.  Indeed, back in 1984, the famous art professor Hilda Sandner published the book ‚ÄúKnitting in a Different Way‚Äù, where she showed her readers-needlewomen non-standard techniques, including swing. </p><p>  Another author of books on knitting, Heidrun Ligmann, compares swing knitting to music!  Comparison is, by the way, very accurate.  Ligmann writes that in this style, strict lines acquire softness, rough angular elements become mobile and smooth, dynamics and harmony appear in knitting. </p><h2>  The benefits of swing </h2><p>  Why do many needlewomen love this unusual technique?  First of all, for the attractive and exotic look of the finished product.  But swing has other advantages.  The main thing is <span>knitting from the remains of yarn.</span>  Not one, even the smallest yarn of yarn, will be lost - everything will go into action!  Another plus - with this technique of knitting, the yarn does not get tangled, which means you do not have to waste time unraveling complex knots. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Other names </h2><p>  In various books and master classes, you can find various variations of the name of the swing: for example, "partial knitting", "knitting in short rows."  The essence of this does not change.  Each color fragment is knitted separately from the canvas and knits seamlessly into the product. </p><h2>  Swing elements </h2><p>  Let us explain to beginners: knitting in the swing style consists of only two elements - stanzas and pauses.  Pauses are usually performed in stocking and stanzas are performed in garter stitches. </p><p>  Pauses are called rows running along the work and visually separating the stanzas from each other.  Pauses are knitted with yarn other than that used for stanzas. </p><h2>  Light and dark: types of stanzas </h2><p>  There are two types of stanzas in swing knitting: light and dark.  They fit equally.  The description of the knitting process is more like explanations for a musical work: the basis of a stanza is a shortened row having a certain length of melody.  And the length of the melody is the required number of loops.  Each stanza consists of measures.  Knitting tact is called a double row (that is, a row consisting of two rows) in which the shortened row must be shifted by a strictly defined number of loops.  The rhythm of the knitting melody indicates which beat you need to knit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The light stanza begins to move from the right to the left.  On the front side of the work, such a stanza goes up, on the wrong side - on the contrary, down.  The dark stanza moves from the left side to the right.  Unlike the bright one, it goes up the seamy side, and down - along the front. </p>

    <h2>  Schemes and samples </h2><p>  In order to master the knitting in the style of swing, you need to get acquainted with the composition and color.  For each work, it is necessary to prepare patterns - this will make knitting convenient. </p><p>  The next step is knitting a pattern.  Many craftswomen skip this step - and in vain!  It is with the help of the sample that you can calculate the number of loops, pauses and stanzas! </p><h2>  Knitting features </h2><p>  In knitting in the style of swing, needlepoints are helped by English pins: with their help, the craftswomen designate turns in shortened rows.  There is an interesting feature - on the front side of the product light pins are used, and on the wrong side - dark pins. </p><p>  Markers are used to ensure that the canvas is smooth and does not bubble;  it is best to designate both the first loop and the last.  So that when the color changes, the work looks beautiful, you need to knit the first and last two rows on the petal of the same color with facial loops.  There is a scheme for the intermediate rows: two rows knit front, one - purl loops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are other principles of this fashionable knitting: </p><ul><li>  the first loop following the turn must be double knit; </li><li>  the edge loop always fits in the same way as the entire row; </li><li>  five loops at the beginning of a row and the same number at its end - this is an edge zone;  markers are not installed on them; </li><li>  Well and most importantly - the choice of melody and knitting rhythms depends only on the imagination of the craftswoman. </li></ul><h2>  Marvelous bird: knitting pattern swing </h2>

    <p>  One of the most beautiful and useful gizmos associated in this interesting technique is a shawl with the poetic name ‚ÄúMarvelous Bird‚Äù.  At first glance it seems that work on it will take a lot of time, but the craftswomen are encouraging - by the middle of the canvas, the scheme is already imprinted in memory. </p><p>  For a shawl, you will need two types of yarn.  For the main fabric, ROWAN Kidsilk Haze yarn consisting of the most delicate mohair (70%) and shining silk (30%), 210 meters, 25 grams can be folded in two strands.  For colored feathers, you can take MILLE COLORI BABY LANG YARNS (100% merino wool), 190 meters, 50 grams.  On average, 7 skeins of yarn for the main fabric and about 2.5 - colored ones go to the shawl. </p><p>  Knitting needles number 4, circular.  The whole product is made with a garter stitch, that is, front loops are knitted on both sides. </p><p>  Description of the knitting process in the swing style: </p><ol><li>  First you need to dial 130 loops of the main color yarn.  In the first row you need to knit 125 loops, without tying the last 5, knitting needs to be deployed. </li><li>  Then you need to introduce a thread of the second color into the product - for feathers of a miracle bird.  Please note: in the diagram, feathers are indicated in blue and the main canvas in green.  The second color you need to knit 95 loops, 30 loops to the edge you need to make a U-turn again. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="swing knitting pattern" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/1843404.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Then you need to knit another 40 loops and deploy knitting.  After turning, knit another 45 loops. </li><li>  Next, you need to knit according to the scheme: in a row, which can be conditionally called facial, you need to leave 5 loops unbind.  You need to do this at every turn.  And in that row, which we arbitrarily call purl, each subsequent row should be five loops longer than the previous one.  You need to continue knitting to the outer edge of the shawl.  This is the 15th row. </li><li>  In row number 16, it is necessary to knit 44 loops, without tying one loop to the reversal, which was previously.  Then you need to knit according to the pattern, however, with one difference - now you do not need to knit five loops on the outside of the product.  That is, each row is knitted five loops further, towards the narrow edge of the shawl. </li><li>  Row number 26 must be knitted to the narrow edge of the product, without tying the last 10 loops, you need to break off the colored thread, make a turn and switch to the main color yarn. </li><li>  In row number 30, you need to close 15 loops, and do not tighten them tightly so as not to spoil the appearance of the feather.  Then you need to knit according to the pattern to row number 70. </li><li>  In row number 71, you need to close 10 loops, tie the row to the end and dial 25 loops.  Then you need to knit 125 loops and turn the knitting five loops to the end of the row. </li></ol>

    <p>  <em>Knitting sleeves</em> </p><p>  For sleeves, you need to dial 73 loops in turquoise-mottled color.  To expand the canvas, you need six times alternately in each eighth and tenth row of a set of loops to add one loop from two sides.  The result should be 85 loops.  When the sleeve reaches a height of 16.5 cm, five loops must be closed on both sides.  Then in each second row 1x5 and 5x6 loops.  With a sleeve height of 19.5 centimeters, five loops should remain.  They also need to be closed. </p><p>  <em>Assembly</em> </p><p>  The sleeves must be sewn into the backs connected according to the scheme and before the knitted summer blouse.  The next stage is the neck of the product.  For it, you need to dial 96 loops of turquoise yarn on circular knitting needles.  Then it is necessary to knit one circular row with purl loops, and then close with facial loops.  It is important to tie all the edges of the product with a crochet - two rows of edges with a picot element. </p><p>  <em>Edge with picot</em> </p><p>  The pico element gives the blouse a special elegance.  You need to crochet it in a circle.  Each circular row must begin with one air loop and end with a connecting loop. </p><p>  The first row is knitted as follows: 1 single crochet, with one air loop skip one loop of the previous row.  This pattern needs to be repeated the whole row.  The second row fits a little differently: 1 single crochet in the air loop of the previous row, 1st pico skip the single crochet of the previous row, repeat until the end of the row. </p><h2>  <span>Knitting swing:</span> interesting ideas </h2><p>  With this unusual knitting technique you can create real works of art!  Experienced needlewomen can tie whole pictures in short rows!  Craftswomen in a more practical way knit socks, shawls, sweaters and even pillows using the swing technique! </p><p>  An interesting idea for knitting in musical technique is a wedge pillow.  She fits, of course, in shortened rows. </p><p>  First you need to determine the diameter of the pillow, and then dial the loop - half the diameter.  You need to start knitting the first wedge from two rows.  All loops should be front.  Then you can start tying the wedge. </p><p>  The first shortened row looks extremely simple: 1 loop - edge, 1 front.  Then you need to remove, without knitting, one loop on the right knitting needle.  The working thread should be located in front of it.  The row is finished, knitting needs to be turned. </p><p>  The second row must be started with the first loop - it is removed back without knitting.  The remaining loops are knitted with a garter pattern. </p><p>  The next row increases immediately by two loops.  That is, the first is edge, then three face.  Another loop must be removed on the right knitting needle.  Turning the work, you need to remove the first loop, and the remaining four knit facial.  Each subsequent shortened row must be increased by two loops.  The last row lags behind the starting row by two loops.  Therefore, when knitting, you need to wrap the penultimate loop with a working thread. </p>

    <p>  When the first wedge is ready, a new color thread joins the edge.  Two rows also fit with facial loops.  It is necessary to continue knitting in the swing technique according to the scheme of the first wedge. </p><p>  When the required number of wedges is ready, the loops of the last wedge are closed, the beginning and end of the future pillow are sewn together on the wrong side.  The hole remaining in the center of knitting can be simply sewn up, or it can be decorated.  A tied large button is suitable for this. </p><p>  By the way, you can knit an unusual pillow not only with knitting needles!  Crochet swing looks no less interesting! </p><h2>  Crochet Swing Scarf </h2><p>  And you can crochet an incredibly beautiful swing scarf!  To do this, you need 185 grams of NORO Silk Garden yarn, which consists of 45% mohair and silk and 10% wool, and a special Tunisian hook number 4. First you need to dial 150 air loops.  You need to continue knitting according to scheme A. </p>

    <p>  In the first row of the future scarf, you need to knit the first two loops, in each next row two more are added.  When there are 40 loops in a row, the craftswomen recommend closing ten loops with connecting columns and again starting partial knitting with two loops - already according to scheme B. The loops are added first from the previous row, and then from the loops of the initial chain. </p><p>  Knitting must be continued from row number 21 to row number 40, all loops of the initial chain should be used.  For a scarf you will need 12 corners.  To make the finished product look neat, you can tie it with one row of single crochet columns. </p>

    <h2>  Skirt in cropped rows on a machine </h2><p>  It is quite possible to implement the technique of unusual swing knitting on a machine!  For example, knit such a cute skirt! </p><p>  You can knit it across, loop immediately dial the entire length of the skirt.  It is best to dial the number of loops, a multiple of ten, - so it will be more convenient to divide it into sectors.  The first two rows need to be knitted with dark yarn - along the entire length.  Then you need to switch to pink yarn.  It is important to include partial knitting levers; the carriage should be on the right.  On the right, you need to leave 15 loops in the working position, remove the remaining loops to the front idle position.  Then you need to knit 15 loops, twisting around, back 15. Two loops are pushed to the front idle position, 13 loops are knitted, wrapping, back again.  It is necessary to continue until 5 loops remain in the working position on the right edge. </p>

    <p>  The next step is to switch levers.  Here the whole row is knitted twice, then two more rows with a dark thread.  We continue to move to the right row, again turn on the levers of partial knitting.  On the right side you need to leave 15 + 10 loops in the working position, set the rest out of service, knit.  On the left side from the edge of the side, remove 15 loops to the idle position and knit as follows: on the right side, push 2 loops to the front idle position, and vice versa, from the idle to working position.  That is, 10 loops are always in operation, all of them are shifted to the right side.  The last half-comb should be knitted in the same way as the first, only in mirror image. </p>
