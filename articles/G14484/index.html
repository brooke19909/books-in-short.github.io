    <h2></h2><h2>  The first model: a jacket with openwork inserts for the full (photo 1, 2) </h2><p>  Agree that most of the models presented in knitting magazines are designed for slim people.  And for ladies with curvaceous forms, it is quite difficult to choose the right style.  The presented model is ideal for women who have a size of 50. It simultaneously hides the fullness and is stylish.  By the way, <span>knitting sweaters with</span> knitting needles for women provides an individual selection of colors, style and ornament.  It should be borne in mind that when modeling products of "large" sizes it is categorically impossible, for example, to use patterns that increase the volume: braids or transverse ornaments.  The presented silhouette has a trapezoidal shape due to the original clasp only at the top of the jacket.  Also, the image is light and romantic due to the length of the sleeve "three quarters" and some of its expansion down.  The back and shelves also have a similar shape.  Let us consider in more detail ways to obtain this silhouette. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Features of knitting ornaments </h2><p>  A small assembly from under the openwork inserts does not at all fill the figure, but conceals its shortcomings.  So, we will analyze how such knitting of sweaters by knitting is performed.  For women a bit overweight, this silhouette involves the use of original ornaments.  Start work from the bottom by typing the number of loops needed to get the whole canvas: the back and two shelves at the same time.  Knit a few rows with an ordinary rubber band, and then go to the <span>front surface.</span>  Edging of the edges on both sides will be carried out by the border after receiving the product in an already finished form.  When the working height reaches 10-15 cm, it is necessary to distribute the hinges so that the front canvas alternates with openwork inserts.  Keep in mind that the ornament on the back will be double.  Before starting to knit openwork, make a hem from several rows of <span>stocking knit, the</span> first of them should contain a decrease.  In this way, an assembly under the ornaments is formed.  Perform sleeves in the same way, using openwork that is equal in width to the patterns on the shelves.  And select the pattern of inserts as you wish. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Second model: jacket with embossed yoke (photo 3, 4) </h2><p>  It is not necessary to be an experienced craftswoman to create something special.  It is enough to use at least one original element when creating the product.  How can you diversify knitting sweaters with knitting needles?  For women, models with embossed yokes will be interesting.  Let‚Äôs figure out in what ways you can perform them.  First, decide on the direction of work.  In most cases, knitting is from the bottom up.  The first stage: it is necessary to "reach" the level of the armhole by separately performing the canvases of the back, shelves and two sleeves.  Then, using circular knitting needles, all the loops are knitted at the same time.  As a rule, after 5-10 centimeters they switch to an openwork yoke.  For its implementation, it is most expedient to use any of the ‚Äúbraids‚Äù ornaments.  Since interlacing ornaments and the wrong side of the surface are usually alternated with this knitting, it is easy to narrow to the neck.  This happens by reducing between the braids.  For example, at the beginning of the coquette the relief alternates with 8-10 wrong loops, and at the end of the lace they decrease to 1-2.  The neck usually consists of several rows of gum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  How to make a silhouette fitted? </h2><p>  This model has a slightly tight shape.  To obtain it, it is desirable that there is a general <span>scheme of knitting.</span>  <span>Sweatshirts with</span> needles in this case do not contain a decrease on the edges.  Slimness is obtained by obtaining reliefs.  Work begins with a flat canvas.  At a distance of about 10-15 centimeters from the edge, distribute the loops into three parts, marking with pins the location of future darts.  Reduce by narrowing the canvas slightly and gently.  Periodically apply the blank to the pattern and, if necessary, adjust the number of loops to be loosened.  Having reached the waist level, begin the increase.  It is advisable to perform it in a hidden way: not with the help of extra yarn, but by knitting between the loops.  The expansion of the canvas usually ends without reaching the level of the chest.  Some experienced needlewomen are able to perform not only vertical reliefs, but also horizontal tucks on the shelves, similar to those when sewing fabrics. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Third model: summer version of the vest (photo 5) </h2><p>  What are the main features of the implementation of light models for the warm season?  First of all, attention is paid to the choice of yarn.  The most popular material is, of course, cotton.  The second feature is the choice of knitting technique.  Without a doubt, crochet patterns are the most beautiful.  But no less popular also, in order to perform "easy" knitting, knitting needles.  Thanks to them, summer sweaters can be obtained much faster, reducing density due to the use of large-volume tools.  The third thing you should pay special attention to is ornament.  As a rule, summer models are performed using openwork technique or a combination of a continuous canvas with original inserts.  Using this model as an example, it is shown how a vest that looks ordinary in appearance can become a <span>summer blouse.</span>  To do this, you can use, for example, drawings that resemble braids in appearance, but do not have a dense and voluminous structure.  Consider the features and principles of the implementation of such patterns. </p><h2></h2><h2>  The method of tying braids in a lightweight way </h2><p>  It is not necessary to use patterns in which there is volumetric weaving of the canvas to perform summer blouses.  What does it mean?  When tying ordinary braids, an overlay of one ornament on another occurs.  What lightness can then be discussed if the product turns out to be as two-layer?  But, to create an original openwork pattern, usually for summer models a slightly different method is used.  Using the example of this model, we can consider how lightweight braids are obtained.  There are many different ornaments, the knitting of which uses the proposed trick.  Changing the direction of the main fabric in a type similar to weaving is obtained by a simultaneous combination of yarn and decreases.  Due to this, the canvas has an additional openwork in the form of holes.  The main principle of the relief is the alternation of the front and back loops and its shift to the side.  Imagine and use new drawings, creating unique and stylish models! </p>
