However, not everyone succeeds in getting what they want.  Most people have to make considerable efforts to earn at least some penny.  However, they cannot accumulate wealth with their labor.  But there is another category of people.  They seem to float money in their hands themselves.  These include <span>the richest people in the</span> world.  They have been in the history of mankind at all times, and we still admire these tremendous successes, trying to draw something useful for ourselves from their experience. </p><h2>  Planet Billionaires </h2><p>  The stories of the richest people in the world tell us that one way or another, they had to work hard and at the same time they certainly believed in their future.  For many years, billionaires of all time have been studying the structure of their activities and gaining invaluable experience, which allowed them to make a subsequent contribution to their development.  First, let's get acquainted with the 10 richest people in the history of mankind, who lived in antiquity. </p><h2>  Solomon </h2><p>  This ruler, who lived in 1011-931.  BC, was able to accumulate 680 billion dollars in modern equivalent.  King Solomon stood at the head of the Israeli-Jewish state.  It was believed that he excelled all the rulers who lived in those days, his wisdom and wealth.  That is why other kings visited his palace, bringing gifts.  One of them was the Queen of Sheba.  According to legend, she came to Solomon to test his wisdom in riddles.  At the same time, she brought a whole caravan, which was loaded with jewelry, gold and incense. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.myjewishlearning.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="king solomon" class="if uuid-2580704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2580704.jpg"></div><p>  The merits of King Solomon to the people consisted of administrative reforms.  He was able to centralize the Christian cult by completing the construction of the shrine of the Jewish people - the temple in which the relic of the Jews - the Ark of the covenant of the Lord was stored.  The palace of King Solomon was distinguished by flashy splendor and luxury.  Moreover, such fabulous wealth could not boast of many rulers who lived in the ancient world in later times. </p><h2>  Crassus Mark Licinius </h2><p>  It turns out that the richest man in world history could have been BC.  And this clearly confirms the life of the ancient Roman commander and the politician Mark Licinius Crassus (115-53 BC).  The main merit of this statesman was that under him, the Roman Republic was transformed into the Roman Empire.  But besides this, he also became the richest man in history.  How did Crassus achieve this? </p><p>  The stories of the richest people in the world about how they got their fortune are quite interesting.  Crassus was raised as an aristocrat from a very young age.  Having matured, he married his late brother's wife.  This union provided him with a connection with the ruler of Rome Sulla.  From this moment Crassus began to earn his fortune.  He mined silver, traded in slaves and leased land. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ancient.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mark Licinius Crassus" class="if uuid-2580773" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2580773.jpg"></div><p>  The pursuit of wealth has become Crassus's inherent character trait.  He even started making good money on fire.  In those days, fires often occurred in Rome.  Fire sometimes destroyed entire neighborhoods.  To become the richest man in the history of Ancient Rome Crassus helped enterprise.  He specially trained slaves who put out fires for money.  This made it possible to preserve neighboring houses.  In addition, Crassus literally bought a burned-out housing for a song, rebuilt it, and then rented it out or resold it with a big profit.  Consisting in friendship with government officials, he acquired the estates of people executed for their negative statements about the government. </p><p>  Mark Licinius Crassus was considered a very greedy person.  It was even rumored that it was at his direction that houses were set on fire, which subsequently brought good profit.  It is believed that Crassus was executed by pouring molten gold into his mouth, as a symbol of greed.  The state of this man at the end of his life amounted to $ 170 billion in current prices. </p><h2>  Vasily II </h2><p>  This Byzantine emperor is also considered the richest man in the history of mankind.  The years of his life are 958-1025.  The amount of wealth accumulated by Basil II amounted to $ 169.4 billion. This native of the Macedonian dynasty, being the son of Roman II and the successor of John Tsimiski, was already proclaimed emperor at the age of two years.  However, he received real power in his own hands only at the age of 16.  Vasily II had a rebellious character and all the time strove for leadership.  Because of this, he began to single-handedly rule the state, but when he realized that he lacked experience, he took the advice of Vasily, who was considered one of the smartest people in those days.  He taught him the necessary tricks.  After this, the emperor sent his teacher into exile. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.artstation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vasily the Second" class="if uuid-2580786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2580786.jpg"></div><p>  During his reign, Vasily II constantly fought.  And he became the richest man in the history of mankind after the conquest of Bulgaria.  The plunder of this country allowed the Byzantine emperor to further increase the already impressive legacy left to him by the predecessors of the throne. </p><h2>  William I the Conqueror </h2><p>  This duke of Normandy, and later the king of England, was able to save $ 200 billion.  This is the largest politician in Europe in the 11th century.  lived from 1027 to 1087. William I was the organizer and leader of the Norman conquest of foggy Albion.  He began to fight for the throne after his rights to the throne were not recognized by one of the powerful vassals of the reigning Anglo-Saxon king Edward Harold Godvinson. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.anglotopia.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="William I the Conqueror" class="if uuid-2580805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2580805.jpg"></div><p>  <span>William I</span> gathered an impressive, well-armed army, which was composed of knights of the northern French principalities.  In order to overcome the English Channel, he hired, requisitioned and built the necessary number of ships.  After the siege of London, William won the throne, becoming the first English king from the Norman dynasty. </p><h2>  Alain Red </h2><p>  This Breton knight (1040-1089) was able to accumulate 163 billion dollars.  He took part in the wars unleashed by William for the conquest of England.  Allen Ryzhiy was especially distinguished in 1070-1071, when fights were fought in the north of the country.  He became the richest man in history, having received from the newly made king of possession 1000 square kilometers. </p><h2>  Wilhelm de Varenne </h2><p>  This Norman aristocrat, who lived between 1055 and 1088, was able to earn $ 134 billion.  Wilhelm de Varennes was one of the largest English magnates of the late 11th century.  He was also one of the advisers to William the Conqueror, actively supporting the Norman army's invasion plan in England.  For this support, the king granted Wilhelm land holdings that were in thirteen counties of foggy Albion.  The most significant of them were those located in Yorkshire and Norfolk. </p><h2>  Henry Grosmont </h2><p>  This ancient "oligarch" was an outstanding diplomat, commander, politician and member of the English royal family.  Henry Grosmont lived in 1310-1361.  In the list of the richest people on the planet in the history of mankind, he got, having accumulated $ 80 billion.  At the heart of his condition was a rich inheritance received from his father and uncle.  After Henry Grosmont became Earl of Lancaster, he was considered the richest and most powerful man in the kingdom. </p><h2>  Musa I </h2><p>  This richest man in history lived in the period from 1312 to 1337.  The size of his fortune is estimated at 400 billion dollars.  Mansa Musa is the richest man in the history of mankind, who ascended the throne of the empire of Mali in 1312. Almost nothing was known about him outside of West Africa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="respectyourlegacy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mansa Musa" class="if uuid-2580817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2580817.jpg"></div><p>  However, the emperor‚Äôs hajj to Mecca, which he carried out in 1324, could not fail to attract much attention due to his extravagance and demonstration of great wealth.  The journey of Musa I was accompanied by a retinue, numbering 60 thousand people.  In addition, he was surrounded by 12 thousand slaves.  Five hundred of them, walking in front of the emperor, were dressed in silk robes and shackled in gold shackles.  The ruler‚Äôs caravan, consisting of 80 camels, transported 12 tons of gold, which was in bullion, staves and sand.  Musa handed out precious metal to everyone he met.  In Cairo, it was difficult to find a person deprived of his generosity.  Such actions brought down the precious metals market.  After that, for another 12 years, the capital of Egypt had to recover from the blow inflicted by the golden procession of Musa. </p><h2>  John Gaunt </h2><p>  This "oligarch" of antiquity lived in the period from 1340 to 1399. His wealth was $ 100 billion.  John Gaunt was the son of King Edward III.  However, the condition of this man was an inheritance received from his father-in-law Henry Grosmont. </p><p>  At one time, Gaunt was one of the largest European feudal lords.  In his possessions there were 30 castles with estates located not only in England but also in France.  Shingle was appointed regent of the minor King Richard II.  However, he later initiated a conspiracy to seize the throne.  The coup failed, and the state of Gaunt was confiscated to replenish the royal treasury. </p><h2>  Genghis Khan </h2><p>  The above list with the life stories of the richest people cannot be considered complete.  The fact is that it includes only those personalities whose condition was albeit approximately, but calculated by modern experts.  But we can confidently continue this list with the famous Genghis Khan, the well-known conqueror of vast territories.  One can only guess about the size of his fortune, as well as about the wealth of, say, representatives of the Indian Rajas or famous Chinese emperors. </p><h2>  Nicholas II </h2><p>  Among the richest people in the history of Russia is the last Russian Tsar.  In 1917, he had to abdicate after the power in the country was seized by the Bolsheviks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tashusik.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicholas II" class="if uuid-2580837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2580837.jpg"></div><p>  In 1918, Nicholas II was shot dead with his family.  The fortune of the last Russian tsar was estimated at 235 billion dollars.  Nicholas II inherited it. </p><h2>  Joseph Bezos </h2><p>  We will now familiarize ourselves with the oligarchs, who are in the first lines of the list of 100 richest people in the world, compiled in 2018. Joseph Bezos opens this list, whose fortune is estimated at 112 billion dollars.  Today, he is the richest man on our planet.  Bezos accumulated his fortune by successfully managing Amazon, as its founder and CEO. </p><div class="photo" data-original="eldia.com.do" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Joseph Bezos" class="if uuid-2580843" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2580843.jpg"></div><p>  To rise to the very first step in the ranking, which includes the richest people in the world, has allowed a sharp increase in the value of shares of a company operating in the electronic sales market.  In just one year, their price increased by 59%.  This allowed Bezos to increase his fortune by almost $ 40 billion. </p><h2>  Bill Gates </h2><p>  The fortune accumulated by the creator of Microsoft today is $ 90 billion.  And his name will probably be on the list of the richest people in the world for a long time to come.  Over the past 23 years, he has been called a billionaire as many as eighteen times.  Today, Microsoft is the world's largest PC software company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnbc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bill Gates" class="if uuid-2580848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2580848.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the state of Gates is 4.7 times more than that owned by the richest man in Russia.  At the same time, the American oligarch invariably participates in charity affairs.  He organized the Gates Foundation, which regularly allocates funds aimed at improving the health and lives of people in different countries of the world. </p><h2>  Warren Buffett </h2><p>  This American oligarch has a fortune of 84 billion dollars.  He earned it with his ability to combine the amazing abilities given to him by nature in the ways of allocating capital with simple folk wisdom.  Warren Buffett is considered the greatest investor of our time.  He is able to masterfully analyze the figures at his disposal and at the same time works tirelessly, honestly and is considered a very strong personality.  Buffett believes that investing is primarily a partnership.  This oligarch perfected his methods throughout his career. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thenational.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Warren Buffett" class="if uuid-2580859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2580859.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, he works, as a rule, only with stocks that have a growth prospect.  Studying Buffett's methods may be of greater interest than the size of his income.  Understanding its rules and principles is a valuable lesson for any private investor.  Successful activities of the oligarch are not facilitated by communication with the ‚Äúright‚Äù people, but by the ability to read and analyze annual business reports.  The beginning of the income of this "Oracle from Amahi" was laid by him in childhood.  At the age of 11, he bought three stocks on the US stock market.  Each of them cost 38 dollars.  After their sale, Buffett made $ 15 profit.  A few days later, the value of these securities rose sharply to $ 202.  A similar bad experience has become a science for the future billionaire.  Subsequently, he stopped chasing short-term benefits. </p><h2>  Bernard Arnault </h2><p>  This successful businessman has 72 billion dollars in his account.  It all started with the sale of the inheritance inherited from the father, who was an ordinary construction company.  Ahead of this future billionaire was waiting for the game of big business.  While studying in America, he gained extensive theoretical knowledge regarding mergers and acquisitions.  At first, he began to prove himself in this field, and then, with an increase in money capital in a bank account, he thought about creating an industry for the production of luxury goods.  Today, <span>Bernard Arnault</span> controls many famous companies that are fashion sharks, producing Swiss watches, luxury alcohol and jewelry.  Moreover, the French oligarch is not going to stop there.  He is constantly expanding his domain. </p><h2>  Mark Zuckerberg </h2><p>  The condition of this person is estimated at 71 billion dollars.  Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook and is currently its CEO.  The rise in the value of shares of this social network helped him to obtain such fantastic wealth, for the purchase of a share in which many investors are fighting.  With billions of dollars, Zuckerberg is not at all like the classic "greedy capitalist."  He is on the list of the three most generous people in the world.  So, in 2015, he donated $ 35 million to eliminate the threat of the spread of Ebola.  In addition, the couple Zuckerberg donated shares of $ 100 million to improve the school system in New Jersey.  As you can see, the stories of the richest people in the world are quite different.  Each of them came to the accumulation of state in his own way.  Some inherited it, others put considerable effort and knowledge to create it. </p>
