Almost every hotel here is modern, fashionable, giving its guests maximum comfort and convenience.  This list also includes the hotel Larissa Club Saphire 5 *.  The reviews of those who rested here in 2015 are so different, as if people wrote about two not only different, but completely opposite hotels.  Let's take a short walk around this hotel and try to figure out what conditions of relaxation are offered here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  First, I would like to clarify that the Larissa Club Saphire 5 * hotel (Turkey, Antalya) was previously called the Jeans Club Hotel Saphire, but this year the management changed, and with it the name.  The hotel is located in the village of Tekirova, not far from its center.  The Rixos Hotel is very close on one side, and on all other sides of the Larissa Club Saphire is surrounded only by amazing nature.  The nearest airport to the hotel, where planes arrive from Russia, is located in Antalya.  Before him - 75 kilometers, or about 1.5-2 hours on a tourist transfer, which is obliged to provide a travel agency where tickets were purchased.  Such a long road turns out because the bus enters tourists to other hotels along the way, because you have to go through Goynuk and Kemer, which are also very popular among Russian tourists.  To the famous tourist center Kemer from Larissa Club Saphire 5 * - about 18 kilometers.  You can get there on dolmushi.  The road is located next to the hotel.  Public transport stops on demand anywhere.  Quite close to the hotel are the famous Camyuva village and Tahtali mountain with a unique cable car, as well as the ancient city of Phaselis. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Larissa Club Saphire 5" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1031379.jpg" width="584"></div>

The territory is very green, well-groomed, causing only positive emotions.  Among the trees surrounding the hotel, pine and citrus fruits prevail, which creates a unique cocktail of wonderful aromas in the air.  On green lawns, in the shade of trees, there are hammocks and small gazebos under <span>thatched roofs,</span> where it is pleasant to relax alone or together.  Also on the beautiful territory of Larissa Club Saphire 5 * there is a parking zone, a large pool for adults and a small one for kids, retail outlets where you can buy souvenirs, beach accessories and some Turkish goods.  Between the trees there was a place for sports fields, a restaurant and bars. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Hotel Larissa Club Saphire 5 * (Kemer, Tekirova) has a rich infrastructure to ensure a complete and interesting stay for its guests.  The reception is located in the central building and works around the clock, however, not all the time you can find Russian-speaking staff here.  At the reception there is the opportunity to hand over laundry or dry cleaning personal items, order a taxi, room service, exchange currency, rent a car, buy sightseeing tours.  In the spacious lobby of the hotel there are soft sofas, armchairs, as well as coffee tables, and each such corner for relaxation is individually designed.  Here, in the lobby of the central building, there are shops with goods of leading brands in Turkey, a large billiard room, slot machines, a lobby bar.

    <h2>  Rooms of the main building </h2><p>  Hotel Larissa Club Saphire 5 * for accommodation of its guests has a central building of 6 floors and four separate buildings (bungalows) in two or three floors.  All rooms are cleaned according to the schedule, towels are changed every two days, and sheets and pillowcases are changed every three days.  The design of all rooms is based on the principle of minimalism, that is, there is nothing superfluous in the rooms, everything is done in restrained colors, the only thing you can hold your eyes on is reproductions on the walls.  The ground floor of the central building is occupied by infrastructure facilities (a hall, shops, entertainment complexes, restaurants).  Rooms start on the second floor.  Room categories and living conditions in all buildings are different. </p><p>  The rooms of the central building of the Larissa Club Saphire <span>5 * Standard</span> Hotel (Kemer) all have an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 22 square meters, all are equipped with the necessary furniture (beds, wardrobe, bedside tables, chairs, table) and electrical equipment (TV, free safe, telephone, small fridge, replenished daily with drinks, telephone for communication with hotel services, air conditioning).  The floors in the rooms are carpeted, and the windows have solid curtains that do not allow light to pass through.  Almost every room has a balcony.  But despite the seemingly equal amenities, relaxation in the rooms of the main building of the Larissa Club Saphire 5 * Standard hotel (Kemer) is very dependent on their location.  So, in the hotel all rooms up to the fifth floor (No. 100-499) are connected to central air conditioning, that is, if there are malfunctions in the system, you can reduce the heat in the rooms only by opening the balcony for the night.  In those rooms with windows facing the road or to the neighboring Rixos Hotel, or located above the hotel‚Äôs technical facilities, where noise from the machinery working there is constantly present, it is very difficult to relax in the absence of noise isolation.  The standard rooms of the main building, located on the very top floor (No. 500-599), have an individual air conditioning system, and such guests do not have such problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Larissa Club Saphire 5 reviews" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1031380.jpg" width="561"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition to standards, the hotel has family rooms up to 36 square meters.  They are two-room (there is an internal door).  Equipment - necessary furniture (beds, sofa, armchairs, bedside tables, table, chairs) and electrical appliances (TV, small fridge, safe, telephone, air conditioning). </p><p>  In the hygiene room of any room there is a toilet, a washbasin with a countertop, a shower cabin or a bath with shower, a hairdryer, a set of personal hygiene products. </p><h2>  Bungalow Rooms </h2><p>  These free-standing buildings do not differ in any exquisite appearance, but they all harmoniously fit into the overall design of the territory.  The rooms of the Larissa Club Saphire Hotel 5 * standard category (No. 600-999) in the bungalow differ from those in the main building in more compact sizes and the presence of individual air conditioning.  The furnishings and equipment of the rooms are the same as in the main building.  Their minus is almost constant dampness, especially in rooms located on the ground floors.  Their plus (except for an individual air conditioner) - there is no need to use an elevator, which in the main building is busy or crowded almost all the time.  In addition to ordinary standard and family rooms, the bungalow has 27 rooms of the so-called Bunk bed room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã26 "squares".  They are designed for four vacationers.  The highlight of these rooms is the bunk beds. </p><p>  Another plus of the bungalow is the availability of two rooms for disabled people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Larissa Club Saphire 5 Standard Kemer" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1031383.jpg" width="557"></div>

Many sites indicate that in 2014 the last reconstruction was made here, but in fact it affected only some of the rooms and services.  Complete innovation in this hotel was made in 2008, and therefore many problems arose.  In 2015, innovation is again being carried out in this institution, so in the next, 2016, everything should be wonderful here. </p>
