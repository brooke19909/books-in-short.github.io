Neuchatel Lake deserves special attention, which fascinates with wonderful views both in winter, and in summer, and in the off-season.  In general, this town is definitely worth a visit. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="46.9899874" data-lng="6.9292732000000115" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/6/8/6/10686.png"></div><h2>  Canton of Neuchatel </h2><p>  The Kingdom of Neuchatel in Switzerland is located in the west of the country, bordered by France.  The name of the canton (territorial-administrative unit, principality) comes from the French and German new castle.  The neighborhood with France and the long period of Neuch√¢tel‚Äôs history associated with this country have caused the majority of the population to be French-speaking Swiss. </p><div class="photo" data-original="reveriechaser.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="neuchatel university" class="if uuid-2922695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2922695.jpg"></div><p>  The principality was first mentioned in the will of Rudolph III the Lazy, King of Burgundy, in 1032.  Two years later, the city and surrounding lands entered the reign of Count Ulrich von Fenis.  By 1373, the prosperous dynasty had concentrated all the lands of the canton in its possessions.  Subsequently, the territories belonged to the Lords of Freiburg, then passed into the possession of the house of the French aristocrats Orleans-Langville.  At the end of the first third of the sixteenth century, the French preacher Farel brought here the ideas of the Reformation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The French house did not have worthy heirs, so the principality came under the control of Frederick William III, the Prussian king.  Napoleon ruled here for several years.  In 1815, the canton joined the Swiss Confederation, the monarchy was replaced by the republican system, and the confederation was transformed into a federation.  The Prussian king tried several times to establish a counter-revolution, because he did not want to put up with this state of affairs, but in the end he abandoned his claims in 1857. </p><h2>  City in Switzerland </h2><p>  The capital of the canton is the village of the same name located between Saint-Blaise and Peso.  In the Middle Ages, the castle was the residence of local counts, descended from the German dynasties of Urachs and Tseringen.  Despite the overwhelming French population of this area, until the mid-nineteenth century the city was in association with the Prussian crown.  Today Neuch√¢tel is considered the largest French city in the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="c1.staticflickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="neuchatel switzerland" class="if uuid-2922693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2922693.jpg"></div><p>  The canton of Neuchatel in Switzerland is known for the watch and jewelry industry.  A native of the city was Breguet, the founder of the luxury watch brand of the same name.  Tourists who appreciate watch art can visit many museums and manufactories, those who wish will be allowed to look into watch workshops and even try to make watches on their own.  Tourism, by the way, has been actively developing here recently.  There are tobacco industry enterprises, several wine-making and high-tech companies.  Neuch√¢tel has a small but fairly well-known University of Neuch√¢tel and the Swiss Center for Microtechnology and Electronics.  This makes the city not only historical, but also modern. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Neuch√¢tel (Switzerland) attracts tourists with several interesting museums, beautiful examples of the architecture of the Middle Ages (fairly standard for that era, but well preserved), religious monuments made in the Gothic style, and a wonderful atmosphere.
