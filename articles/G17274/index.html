    <p>  In addition, in many hotels you can rent a stroller for the entire period of rest, or even for a few days or hours.

Among such a variety, even for the most demanding parents, there is something to feed their child. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Impressions of travelers about the hotel Kirman Hotels Belazur Resort &amp; SPA 5 * are different, but mostly positive, with a few wishes.  Due to the fact that the hotel opened only two years ago, its first vacationers could remain unsatisfied.  But at the moment the hotel is working on a well-functioning system. </p><p>  Not all staff at the reception and in other structures of the hotel speak Russian, because of this, misunderstandings are possible.
