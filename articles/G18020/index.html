Some consider the hotel terrible and do not recommend going there.  Others, on the contrary, praise him and argue with negative reviews about this hotel.  In the article below we tried to figure out what is the matter here and what is the actual service in this tourist complex.  The hotel is mainly designed for youth recreation, and not for families with children, which is probably worth considering if you plan to spend a vacation here.  The hotel is liked by picky tourists who come to Turkey for the sun, sea, excursions, color and positive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.google.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Millennium Palace 4 Address" class="if uuid-2282551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2282551.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get and location </h2><p>  Hotel Kemer Millennium Palace 4 * is located not at the sea, but at the foot of the mountain.  Between it and the beach lie the road and the houses of the village of Beldibi.  Perhaps this causes the biggest discontent of tourists, especially in the hot season, because from the hotel you have to get to the sea for about a quarter of an hour.  Package tourists from Antalya International Airport bring a transfer.  If you travel on your own, then first of all take the city transport, which will take you to the bus station.  From there, regular buses and dolmushi literally every half hour, or even more often go towards Kemer.  You need to go out in the resort village of Beldibi.  Here is our hotel, just a few tens of meters from the highway.  So it‚Äôs not long to go.  It is 13 kilometers from the hotel to Kemer, and 34 to Antalya. It takes less than an hour to drive along the narrow serpentine road from the bus station. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.celojumubode.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer Millennium Palace 4" class="if uuid-2282398" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2282398.jpg"></div><h2>  Beldibi </h2><p>  In this village is located the Kemer Millennium Palace 4 * hotel.  It is very easy to get to Kemer from it, minibuses travel often.  The resort is very interesting, located in the midst of beautiful natural attractions.  It is here that the Taurus Mountains come closest to the sea.  The village itself exists practically in order to serve the numerous hotels stretching along the sea.  By the way, German investors were the first to notice this place, who began to build the first beach resorts.  There are many shops, restaurants and authentic taverns and coffee houses.  The resort is named after a local river.  There are several beautiful coastal parks in the village, which are located along the sea towards Antalya.  Beldibi is mainly visited by people who are fond of hiking, rafting and hiking in the mountains.  Moreover, here they are so picturesque that the guests of many hotels ask the administration so that the view from the windows is not on the sea, but on the rocks. </p><h2>  Territory and settlement </h2><p>  Hotel "Kemer Millennium Palace" 4 * has a small but well-groomed garden with paths, in the middle of which there are two four-story residential buildings.  The lobby has a shop with souvenirs and beach accessories.  The lobby is beautifully decorated in Turkish style.  A lot of trees and shrubs, beautiful lawns.  There is a pool on site.  The hotel is surrounded by forest and mountains.  Next to it is a mosque.  Some tourists consider this a minus, but others write that it is better to wake up to calls for prayer than to drunken cries and pop songs.  Check in at this hotel and early in the morning, without waiting for the checkout time.  And if you have a late departure, then often you are allowed to not leave the room until you are picked up.  However, you do not pay extra. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="wrs.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel courtyard" class="if uuid-2282734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2282734.jpg"></div><h2>  Kemer Millennium Palace 4 *: room description </h2><p>  This hotel is not too large.  It has a little over a hundred rooms.  They vary in categories.  Most of them are standards, there are several suites.  The hotel has family, connecting rooms and facilities for the rest of people with disabilities.  All rooms are air-conditioned and equipped with an individual split system.  Linen is changed twice a week, although this also causes complaints from tourists.  But the rooms are not cleaned every day.  However, the rooms are clean and comfortable.  If you want to clean out of turn, just leave a request for reception.  Air conditioners cool well in the heat.  Drinks in the minibar are chargeable, as is a safe.  The rooms have amenities - bathroom, bathtub, hairdryer.  Depending on which floor tourists will be accommodated, the room has a balcony or terrace.  There is a table and two chairs.  There is hot water in the daytime - it is turned off at night.  The TV is small but flat-screen.  There is one Russian channel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.celojumubode.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer Millennium Palace 4 room description" class="if uuid-2282423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2282423.jpg"></div><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  The guests of the Kemer Millennium Palace 4 * hotel are fed, as in most Turkish resorts, according to the "all inclusive" system.  But since this is a "four", then there are some peculiarities.  Firstly, ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù ends at 10 pm, and all drinks and snacks that you take at the bar are already paid.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served in the main restaurant.  All inclusive only includes Turkish alcohol.  Fresh, ice cream and brewed coffee, as well as imported wines and distillates - for a fee.  Adequate food - soups, chicken, fish, lamb cutlets, stewed vegetables.  There are many salads, especially with cucumbers and tomatoes, fruits (mainly watermelon and oranges) and sweets, although these are specific Turkish desserts.  For breakfast, pancakes and fried eggs are fried.  Some tourists often complain that the food is monotonous.  Although others contradict them and write that they feed very balancedly, although without frills.  Connoisseurs praised Turkish dishes - lentil soup, stewed chickpeas, ayran.  From alcohol in the bar there is red and white wine, vodka, gin and whiskey.  Tea and coffee - around the clock. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.celojumubode.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer Millennium Palace 4 Kemer" class="if uuid-2282405" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2282405.jpg"></div><h2>  Kemer Millennium Palace 4 *: service </h2><p>  At this hotel you can exchange currency, rent a car or bike.  The hotel has a hairdresser and beauty salon.  Much attention is paid to the health of guests here - they have a good gym at their disposal.  You can play volleyball here, football, table tennis, billiards.  The hotel has a team of animators.  In the afternoon, they organize gymnastics, aerobics, and dance classes.  In the evenings, various entertainment shows and disco programs are organized for guests - but not every day.  The Kemer Millennium Palace 4 * hotel has a spa that offers massage, relaxation in a sauna or Turkish hammam.  But this is an additional paid service, and is not included in the price.  There is also a children's animation and a mini club.  The hotel allows pets with small pets - cats or small dogs.  So, you can take your pet with you, after agreeing this with the administration.  Wifi catches only in the lobby, but at the same time it has good speed.  Music in the hotel plays only until eleven in the evening, then everything turns off.  But if you want to have fun further, the animators can take you to a disco or a night club in Kemer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wrs.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="spa at the hotel" class="if uuid-2282739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2282739.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach, sea and pool </h2><p>  The sea is a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel.  But the problem is that in order to get to it, you need to cross the Antalya-Kemer highway, and then go through the village.  The road mainly lies in the shade, among the orange and pomegranate trees.  The beach is pebble, like everywhere in the Kemer region.  He does not belong to the Kemer Millennium Palace 4 * hotel, but sun loungers and umbrellas are provided to guests free of charge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wrs.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel beach" class="if uuid-2282736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2282736.jpg"></div><p>  On the shore there is also a canopy and a cooler with drinking water and juices.  The sea is very good, the water is warm, clear.  Swimming in it is nice.  Pebbles on the beach are a bit big.  However, near the sunbeds there is a special entrance to the water for bathers.  Nevertheless, tourists are advised to purchase aquatic facilities.  They are sold here at every step.  If you want to walk, you can find several secluded bays with white sand.  True, they are surrounded by sheer cliffs, and it will not be easy to go down there.  But the company is worth it!  The hotel has an outdoor pool with a scheduled slide.  Open and small "paddling pool" for children.  Pools are good, they are often cleaned. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.celojumubode.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Millennium Palace 4" class="if uuid-2282446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2282446.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  First of all, take a walk around the hotel, namely walk along the Beldibi River.  You will be fully rewarded.  Thickets of wild oleanders, caves, picturesque cliffs and canyons - all this is literally a stone's throw from the hotel.  There is also a picturesque waterfall.  And in one of the caves even drawings of primitive people were preserved.  It is better to buy trips that are offered at the Millennium Palace 4 * hotel not from the tour operators of the hotel, but in the stalls or on the street.  You will go on the same tour, only two to three times cheaper.  Be sure to visit Kemer - the center of the resort area.  Not far from it is a wonderful place - the ancient city of Phaselis.  It is a luxurious archaeological site in a shady forest.  There you can walk, buy souvenirs, see the ancient ruins of the Greco-Roman period, and even swim in the sea against the background of ancient buildings.  And, of course, take at least a day to travel to Antalya. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  And what the guests of Kemer Millennium Palace 4 * take home.  Turkey is a country from which they don‚Äôt leave without shopping, even if you have a small budget.  Beldibi itself has a wide variety of shops, and they work until midnight.  There is also a market here.  It is located at the very beginning of the village, by the river.  But the market only works on Mondays, and the rest of the time its area is empty.  It sells clothing, knitwear, leather goods (especially bags and wallets).  They buy olive oil, Turkish cheeses and sweets, fruits at the market.  Of course, you need to bargain, because the price that you will be asked for initially is just a check - how much you understand the real value of goods.  In stores, it is best to purchase furs, cotton products, as well as gold and silver jewelry. </p><h2>  What tourists write about the hotel </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the reviews about Kemer Millennium Palace 4 * are very different.  Some write that the staff is indifferent, others - on the contrary, friendly and welcoming.  Animators were especially praised - they are positive and witty.  There is a Russian-speaking administrator who is trying to help guests as much as he can.  Requests to fix something in the room are answered immediately and readily.  In any case, the remoteness of the hotel from the beach has its advantages.  You live in the middle of beautiful nature, not far from the forest.  Mountain air.  Nearby there are noisy discos and cafes.  The views of the mountains from the windows and balconies are amazing.  The atmosphere is comfortable, homely.  The choice in food is small, but everything is fresh and tasty.  The price of the ticket is inexpensive.  Moreover, the fact that the hotel is far from the sea, was taken as a bonus by tourists who didn‚Äôt have a rest during the hot season - especially in September.  You can walk around the village, look at the local flavor, buy something along the way.  The hotel has an excellent spa.  Especially good massage with aromatic oils. </p>
