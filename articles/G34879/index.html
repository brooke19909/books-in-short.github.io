It is similar to chess in complexity and fascination.  Therefore, it was valued by aristocrats.  Writers, musicians, artists were keen on her.  Currently, the number of people who are interested in preference is growing every day.  For them, this is an entertaining hobby.  In general, a rather interesting preference.  The rules of the game here are peculiar.  More on this later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="   " class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/636087.jpg" title="preference game rules" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rights and Obligations of the Dealer </h2><p>  In this regard, there are many nuances.  It does not depend on who gives the cards what will fall into the buy-in.  But the value of playing cards affects his reward or punishment.  If the buyback does not suit the participant and he returns it to the dealer, then he will be punished with penalty points uphill.  Their number depends on which game was ordered.  This is important to know.  Bonus points or whists also depend on the game ordered.  Owners are due: </p><ul><li>  For an ace in the draw, whists equal to one bribe.  It corresponds to the ordered game. </li><li>  For a lady and a king of the same suit, whists, in the amount of one bribe.  This combination of playing cards is called “marriage”. </li><li>  For an ace with a king of the same suit, whists equal to two tricks. </li><li>  For two aces, certain points are also due.  They are like for three bribes. </li><li>  An unplayed order is followed by a “for picking” penalty. </li></ul><p>  The dealer can participate in the order called "minuscule."  This is when you can not take bribes at all.  If invited by the partner playing the game.  This happens when the cards for the "meager" are dealt not very successful, but there is hope that in the buyout suitable.  Although, perhaps this is not so.  It all depends on the case.  The loss then signs for two.  However, the victory points are also divided in half.  This is very attractive for the dealer in the invitation to the minuscule.  If he agrees to play, then they give him familiarity with the layout of the customer’s cards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The dealer must ensure that the purchase does not light up until the end of the auction.  Also, he himself should not watch it.  Of particular importance is when the dealer is invited to play "in half."  This is important to remember. </p><h2>  Classification </h2><p>  The minimum game in preference is “six”.  This is when a participant must take a certain number of tricks.  Namely six.  The remaining four are shared among his partners.  Moreover, the distribution of bribes between the whistlers does not matter: each has two;  one has three and the other has one;  or all in one hand.  In any case, the game will be considered played.  She will be certified even when the participant took more bribes than he undertook.  Only in this case is there a certain condition.  Namely, the whistler, who will have fewer than two bribes, writes himself points uphill.  This should be remembered.  The game is unplayed if the participant has bribes less than ordered.  In this case, he is fined and points are written to him uphill.  And whistlers get points for extra tricks and for picking. </p><p>  Next come the games, named by the number of bribes ordered.  Namely: “ten”, “nine”, “seven”, “eight”, or “totus”.  It is also important to know.  “Totus” is a game that is absolutely opposite to “miserable”.  It was mentioned earlier.  There is also the highest game.  But card combinations for her are extremely rare.  It is she who is called "preference."  It is announced when the participant, after receiving the buy-in, has three cards of the highest face value of the same suit.  Or four of the youngest.  This is also in the same suit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The conditions of “six” and “nine” variations in preference are rather stringent.  The rules of the game here should also be strictly followed.  That is, whistlers must take the declared bribes.  Namely: four with a six-game and one with a nine.  Variations such as the semerik and the octal have more flexible rules.  That is, whists may have a certain number of tricks.  Two in the seventh game and one in the eighth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt=" " class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/636086.jpg" title="Card deck" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Distribution of cards </h2><p>  In this case, everything is pretty simple.  The deck of cards is shuffled by the dealer.  This has been indicated above.  Distribution of cards is made in pairs.  That is, three players in 10 pieces and 2 in the buy.  In this case, the last pair of cards should be average.  Namely, not the first and not the last. </p><h2>  Trade </h2><p>  After reviewing the cards, players begin to bargain for the type of game.  The first application is made by the participant sitting at the dealer in a clockwise direction.  Beginning of bidding is carried out with a minimum game.  Namely, "6 peak" and beyond.  Each player declares a game higher in suit than the previous one.  Or he passes and goes out of trade.  Games increase from 6 to 10. The seniority of suits goes in a certain order.  Namely: peaks, clubs, tambourines, worms.  Older than any suit, a game without a trump card.  Although the number of bribes remains the same as announced.  It is impossible to declare a “minuscule” if the player has already been bargaining for another game or passing.  But this can be interrupted by an application for a nine-game.  Then the bargain ends in preference.  The game rules also provide for other options.  Namely, when a miser is announced without a ransom, then it can be interrupted by an application for nine.  With a “pass”, all participants play “passes”.  This should also be known.  If there are no “minuscule” and “breakdowns”, then participants are traded until the last player.  Next, we consider this in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Game varieties </h2><p>  There are three variations: </p><ul><li>  For bribes. </li><li>  Minuscule. </li><li>  Raspas. </li></ul><p>  Their detailed description will be described below. </p><h2>  Playing cards preference for bribes </h2><p>  There are certain conditions.  That is, whoever won the bargain is obliged to play with the declared trump card (or without it).  He also needs to collect bribes as much as ordered.  The participant, taking the buy-in and discarding two cards that are unnecessary to him, says what trump card he will play with (or without).  He also reports on how many bribes he undertakes to take.  In this case, there is a certain limitation.  It consists in the fact that it is impossible to order bribes less than what was stated at the auction.  For example, a tambourine who has reached the price of 7 can play from 7 tambourines and above, 8 spades, etc. However, it cannot play 7 spades or 6 other suits of any kind.  The rest all play together against him.  However, of these, everyone decides whether to whistle or pass.  It all depends on the desires and capabilities of the participants.  The whistler also agrees to take the amount of tricks determined by the game.  If both partners do this, then the game goes in closed.  If the whisting one, then you can play open.  Then both open the cards.  The whistler walks for two.  That is, for himself and for the one who saved.  The goal of the game is always and for all to fulfill their obligations.  That is, you need to collect the agreed number of bribes.  And also try to force the enemy to collect them less than he ordered.  Or give as many tricks as possible if a minuscule is played.  This is a certain tactic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the value of playing cards" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/636413.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Minuscule </h2><p>  It is also a peculiar look.  A game without bribes is called a minuscule.  Its whole essence is visible by name.  Many people use such a view as a "miserable".  Preference in this regard has a certain criterion.  That is, opponents play openly and without obligation.  Their goal is to foist the enemy as many tricks as possible. </p><h2>  Raspas </h2><p>  In this case, everyone plays on himself.  At the same time, trying to take as few bribes as possible.  Or at least no more than a partner.  This is a "Rostov" option.  The buy-in cards may determine the suit of the first two tricks.  They may also belong to the dealer.  This is a four-player game.  Or they may not open at all ("growths", "hussar"). </p><h2>  Raffle </h2><p>  This should also be known.  It’s very important to play a bribe in preference!  Players in a certain order put each one card.  This is clear.  The first card sets the suit.  Next, put the rest.  That is a card of the same suit.  Or put a trump card.  This is if there is no suit.  Or any other card.  This is if there is no trump card.  The player who put the highest card takes the bribe.  This is a definite fact.  Bribes are counted by their number.  This is regardless of the face value of the cards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="  " class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/636082.jpg" title="preference photo" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Score </h2><p>  For the game played, the player records for himself a certain number of points in the bullet, and the whistler records on it.  Excess obligations are recorded only last.  For each violation of the application, the players are recorded in the mountain a certain number of points.  Bribes received in the “rations” are also entered there.  Or the player who took them least of all, records whists on other participants (“growths”). </p><h2>  Games for seven — ten </h2><p>  Consider these variations in preference.  The rules of the game in this case are quite simple.  Whistlers on the "seven" are obliged to take one bribe.  This is a certain condition.  On the "eight", both rarely whist.  One usually says: “Pass.”  However, he still whistles.  Although for this he does not receive any reward.  If both whistlers saved, then they do not throw cards.  They play for free.  That is, for the sake of checking the opponent.  This is called forced whist. </p><p>  This test combination is required for the "nine" and "ten" games!  In this case, the winner is debited as much as he ordered.  And whistlers get points for bribes, which depend on what game was played.  "Nine" and "ten" are rare. </p><p>  "Seven" or "eight" becomes controversial when two participants want to play it simultaneously.  The advantage in this case is senior suit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt=" " class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/636084.jpg" title="card combinations" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Smashless game </h2><p>  Here the name itself speaks for itself.  In this <span>form</span> , the preference <span>game</span> , the photo of which is provided in this text, is in the face value of the cards.  In this case, trump cards are not relied upon.  The peakless cap interrupts any game.  60 "poins" are written off for her. </p><p>  You can order a game without trump cards if the player has such a set of cards in his hands: </p><ol><li>  Ace, king, queen, etc.  One of any suit. </li><li>  King, queen, jack and ten.  Also of the same suit.  In this case, there is a game of an ace of another suit.  This is with empty cards.  This should also be known.  If this is the first move of the customer, then the first card must be king.  To “knock out” an ace of the opponent.  And also intercept the course of the game and beat with your ace any card of the same suit. </li><li>  Ace, king, queen, jack.  This also includes a small card of the same suit.  And also another ace. </li><li>  There is still a combination.  And namely: ace, king, jack, ten and a small card of the same suit.  This also includes two aces.  Here you can go to a trump-free game, but it's risky.  This is because if a third lady of the same suit happens as your aces, on one hand, the jack will be beaten.  And so he will become a bribe. </li><li>  Playing without trump cards is dangerous.  To be completely sure, you need to have four aces on hand and at least one of them has a margin.  But that rarely happens. </li><li>  To whistle on a capless one is only during the course of a whistler.  Otherwise, there is a risk of losing.  A faithful whist will be when there are two aces on the hands, either an ace and a king, or an ace of the same suit, and a marriage of the other. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="  " class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/636083.jpg" title="seniority of stripes" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  Giveaway Preference </h2><p>  Many tricks have preference.  Numerous varieties with new rules developed later.  For example, initially with three passes, the change was not counted.  The deck of cards passed on to the next participant in the new game.  It was unfair.  Since the first dealer "lost" his hand.  And instantly mixed cards were hidden.  Revision of the game was not allowed.  This is if one of the players with good cards did not play, but passed in the hope of “encumbering” partners.  There are such. </p><p>  To prevent this, they came up with a certain condition.  Namely: with general passes, do not throw cards, but play the game as a giveaway.  In this case, the winner is the one who has not taken a bribe.  It is also important to know.  In this case, you must try not to take more than three tricks.  They are subject to amnesty. </p><p>  For each bribe in excess of three, 10 remises are given.  For 4 bribes - 10. For 5, respectively, 20, etc. For the renonance - the absence of any suit on the hands - they also put 10 remises.  The test game inspires players with some caution.  Not everyone likes it.  Therefore, it is not popular. </p>
