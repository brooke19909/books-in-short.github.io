But this does not always happen.  Sometimes we know very little about where we are going.  Lack of information can lead to the fact that the planned trip will be ruined.  Therefore, it is very useful to read articles, reviews and forums in advance about the place where such long-awaited vacation days are planned.  Next, you will find the most complete information about the hotel Chanalai Hillside Resort 4 *. </p><h2>  Golden Buddha Country </h2><p>  The Kingdom of Thailand is located in Southeast Asia, or rather, on the <span>peninsulas of Indochina</span> and Malacca.  The large extent of this territory from north to south makes Thailand very diverse in terms of climate.  Tropical, equatorial and <span>subequatorial belts</span> bring diverse weather here. </p><p>  It is not the first year that Thailand has attracted Russian tourists to its fabulous landscapes, <span>azure shores</span> and impenetrable jungle.  Resorts, one of the most famous of which is Karon Beach, invite everyone to enjoy the beauty and originality of Thailand.  The country is incredibly rich in beaches and hotels that are looking forward to their customers. </p>

    <h2>  Wide range of entertainment </h2><p>  The hotel has 3 restaurants.  Thai and international cuisine can be sampled at Hillside Restaurant.  It will be difficult to go past fragrantly prepared dishes.  The menu is carefully thought out and suitable for every taste. </p><p>  Thai spa treatments and a fitness center will help bring your body in order, rejuvenate and improve your body.  If necessary, you can take advantage of medical care.  This question is especially interesting for families with children.  You can be calm, a child or an adult will be able to receive qualified medical care at any time. </p><h2>  Guest reviews of hotel Chanalai Hillside Resort 4 * (Thailand) </h2><p>  Phuket Karon is quite popular among tourists of our country.  After relaxing at the hotel, they leave reviews that will help make a choice for those who are still planning their holidays and have not decided.  In order not to overshadow the long-awaited vacation, for a start it is worth getting to know the opinions of other people.  This will help to make a general impression of the proposed place of rest and determine how it suits you. </p><p>  Mostly tourists note that the hotel staff is very attentive.  For example, if something unexpected happened, and you have to wait a little while they prepare the room, they will definitely bring coffee and something to eat.  The rooms are exactly the same as in the picture, which is quite important, because there are often cases when a client arrives at a hotel and observes a completely different situation than he was presented at a travel agency or on the website of the receiving party.  The rooms have everything you need (hairdryer, iron, air conditioning, etc.).  Only here in the shower and toilet glass doors.  This is a little unusual, strange and uncomfortable.  Many visitors are very confused.  On the door there is a sign that says "Do not enter!"  turn over by the wind, so the service staff can disturb at the most unnecessary moment.  The beach is about 7 minutes walk, and the hotel is quiet and calm.  Many of the vacationers note a large number of Chinese, who are found literally at every step.  However, this presence is unobtrusive and usually lodges them in one wing.  It is also worth noting that Russian tourists live in a separate building, which avoids discomfort when communicating with representatives of other countries.  One of the pools is located on the roof.  His visit allows you to experience simply unique emotions. </p>

    <p>  I would also like to mention a good breakfast (eggs cooked differently, Chinese noodle soup, fruits, vegetables, etc.), the cost of which is included in the stay.  No need to think in the morning than a snack.  Then, during the day it is easier to do.  However, many say that breakfast is not very diverse.  Dispensaries with shampoo and soap sometimes fall to the floor, so be careful when using.  Impressive food design and staff attention.  Most tourists remain satisfied with their rest and hope that someday they will definitely return here. </p><p>  Chanalai Hillside Resort 4 * on the map of Thailand is one of the most visited places by Russian tourists.  This is a great choice for those who want to relax inexpensively and tastefully.  Be sure to visit it if your choice fell on Thailand.  We hope our tips come in handy, have a good rest. </p>
