He is a famous terrorist from the Dagestan Republic, who led the Islamic gang "Jamaat Sharia" after Magomedov died.  Avarian by nationality, he was a two-time European champion, as well as the world champion in Wushu Sanda.  Died March 21, 2013 in the village of Semender. </p><h2>  The history of the terrorist organization "Jamaat Sharia" </h2><p>  According to police reports, in 2002 Rasul Makasharipov was sent to Dagestan from Chechnya, where he was to create a detachment to organize sabotage and robbery in law enforcement agencies.  The formation was aimed at destabilizing the situation in the republic.  Over 50 murders of police and military personnel, as well as officials, lie on the conscience of a detachment called "Jennet" ("Paradise").  The military who attacked the trail of Makarshipov captured and defeated the group in 2003, but the leader and several accomplices were able to lose sight of. </p><div class="photo" data-original="direct-press.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One of the groups" class="if uuid-2669786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/2669786.jpg"></div><h2>  The beginning of the way </h2><p>  After a while, the organizer of the group reassembles a team of accomplices, and now a group called "Jamaat Sharia" is fighting on the Caucasian front for armed Wahhabi detachments.  Earlier, the president of the republic of Chechnya, Sadulayev, who replaced <span>Aslan Maskhadov,</span> announced their creation <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A detachment of bandits was operating on the territory of Makhachkala and nearby cities, undermining patrol cars and attacking police crews.  Moreover, the group blew up the building of the prosecutor's office in Makhachkala, planting two bombs in the building.  The investigation team, which dealt with this case, also claims that they are responsible for the killings in 2005, when the deputy minister of internal affairs, the head of law enforcement bodies of public security and the minister of national politics were shot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kavtoday.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Action Detention" class="if uuid-2669784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/2669784.jpg"></div><h2>  First change of power </h2><p>  In the process of capture on July 6, 2005, the leader of the gangster group was shot dead by a police unit.  Rappani Khalilov was appointed to his post.  On September 24, 2006, he began commanding the armed forces under the name ‚ÄúDagestan Front,‚Äù according to the instructions of the newly-made president of CRI, Dokku Umarov.  In 2007, in September, he was destroyed, after which Ilgar Mollachiev was immediately put in his place.  But he was killed just a year later. </p><p>  The president, who had previously abolished the CRI and proclaimed the so-called Caucasian Emirate, which included Dagestan as one of the vilayats, appoints Umar Sheikhulaev, the commander of the regional front, nicknamed Amir Muaz.  According to police reports, the newly-made leader was shot dead on 02/05/2009. In April of the same year, Umalat Magomedov, who was killed on the last day of that year, becomes the "emir" of the Republic of Dagestan.  Six months later, in mid-2010, Magomedali Vagabov, who organized a double terrorist attack in the subway in central Moscow, was appointed the amir of the regional front. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="novayagazeta-ug.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One of the terrorist groups" class="if uuid-2669788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/2669788.jpg"></div><h2>  Beginning of the End </h2><p>  In August of that year, in the village of Gunib, Magomedali Vagabov was killed during a special operation by employees of the FSB special forces center of Russia.  For almost two years, the militant was wanted, and every time he seemed to be found, he managed to hide. </p><p>  Since September 2010, according to the President‚Äôs decree, Israpil Validzhanov (Amir Khasan) became the emir of the ‚ÄúDagestan governorate‚Äù.  He used to rule the Southern Republican Front. </p><p>  In April 2011, in the Levashinsky district, at the request of the police, the cars in which the militants and Israpil Validzhanov were located did not stop.  As a result of the battle, all four died. </p><p>  On May 9, 2011, a candidate is again selected for the title of amir, and Ibrahimkhalil Daudov (Amir Salih) becomes one, who, after a video address at a meeting of the armed forces, confirmed the oath to the emir of the Dagestan Republic and chose his assistants from among those present.  The first deputy is Amir Abu Muhammad, the commander of the central region of the republic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="read.feedly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The detention of terrorists" class="if uuid-2669785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/2669785.jpg"></div><p>  In mid-February 2012, the Emir of the Dagestan Republic, Ibragimkhalil Daudov, was killed with a gang of four people as a result of a major special operation by security forces in the <span>Karabudakhkent district.</span> </p><p>  The President appoints Rustam Aselderov (Abu Muhammad) on August 6, 2012 as the Amir of the Republican Front. </p><p>  In the settlement of Semender, on March 21, 2013, Ibrahim Hajidadayev was killed. </p><p>  At the end of December 2014, Aliaskhab Kebekov removed Rustam Aselderov from the post of Amir Vilayat Dagestan and appointed Kamil Saidov (Said Arakansky), who was killed on August 11, 2015 during an operation in Untsukul district. </p><h2>  The end of the Jamaat Sharia </h2><p>  In early December 2016 near Makhachkala in the village of Talgi, Rustam Aselderov was shot dead, until the end of December 2014 he remained the amir of the Vilayat of the Dagestan Republic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="academ.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Autopsy of the militants' caches" class="if uuid-2669789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/2669789.jpg"></div><p>  According to the head of the republic <span>Ramazan Abdulatipov,</span> in 2017 all the terrorist groups that conducted their activities in Dagestan were liquidated. </p><h2>  Biography of Ibrahim Hajidadayev </h2><p>  The head of the family of Hajidadayev was the school principal, and his uncle was appointed mayor of Buinaksk, the other uncle was a historian.  It is known that after the head of the family found out what his son was doing, the whole family moved and broke off communication with other relatives.  Therefore, to date, nothing is known about the Ibrahim family. </p><h2>  Activities of Hajidadayev </h2><p>  Since 2005, a photo of Ibragim Hajidadayev has been put up for search at the federal level.  The reason for this was his participation in illegal gangs.  He instilled fear in many regional businessmen, forcing him to pay the so-called tribute.  In February of the same year he became commander of the Republican Front. </p><div class="photo" data-original="life.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ibrahim Hajidadayev" class="if uuid-2669790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/2669790.jpg"></div><p>  In 2007, he personally killed the deputy Gazimagomed Magomedov.  In 2009, Ibrahim Gadzhidadayev announced his responsibility for the death of the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Republic Magomedtagirov, who organized an explosion in the subway of the Russian capital in 2010. </p><p>  He was involved in organizing an attempt on the life of the head of the Internal Affairs Directorate of Makhachkala, Akhmed Magomedov in early 2010. Moreover, he confessed to the murder of Garun Kurbanov on 06.2011, who was the head of the department of the political information center. </p><h2>  Action death </h2><p>  As a result of the operation to detain Ibragim Gadzhidadayev and Khabib, organized as an assault on a building in Makhachkala, information appeared about the death of the militant, which was immediately denied by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Dagestan Republic. </p><p>  The news that Gadzhidadayev was shot dead while taking a gang by assault on the territory of a private property in the village of Semender quickly spread throughout the republic, but it was denied by Jamaat Sharia himself.  According to the FSB, Ibragim Gadzhidadayev and Said Amirov with their accomplices fled through the irrigation canal, using scuba gear and other equipment.  The battle lasted three days, five resistance members died on the spot, including the chairman of the assembly of deputies of the Untsukulsky district Magomedkhabib Magomedaliev.  Six special forces were injured, two died on the spot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novayagazeta-ug.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="FSB detention" class="if uuid-2669787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/2669787.jpg"></div><p>  In April, data leaked again that Ibragim Hajidadayev was among the corpses of terrorists.  Other information said that there was a brother of the leader of the Gimrinsky detachment of militants.  Official sources were silent on this score, because a genetic examination was conducted, on which they took biomaterial from relatives who participated in a group of terrorists.  As a result of the research, the fact of the death of Ibrahim Hajidadayev and several other well-known and wanted FSB militants was confirmed. </p>
