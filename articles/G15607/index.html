The following types of it are distinguished: electrical, mechanical, gravitational, nuclear, chemical, electromagnetic, thermal, and others. </p><p>  The first is the energy of electrons moving along a chain.  Often, it is used to obtain mechanical using electric motors. </p><p>  The second is manifested during the movement, the interaction of individual particles and bodies.  <span>This is the energy of</span> deformation under tension, bending, twisting and compression of elastic bodies. </p><p>  Chemical energy occurs as a result of <span>chemical reactions</span> between substances.  It can be released in the form of heat (for example, during combustion), and can also be converted into electrical (in batteries and <span>galvanic cells).</span> </p><p>  Electromagnetic appears as a result of the movement of magnetic and electric fields in the form of infrared and <span>X-rays,</span> radio waves, etc.  Nuclear is found in radioactive substances and is released as a result of fission of heavy nuclei or synthesis of the lungs.  Gravitational - energy, which is due to the gravitation of massive bodies (gravity). </p><p>  Thermal energy arises in connection with the random movement of molecules, atoms and other particles.  It can be released as a result of mechanical action (friction), a chemical <span>reaction (combustion)</span> or nuclear (nuclear fission).  Most often, thermal energy occurs as a result of burning various types of fuel.  It is used for heating, evaporation, heating and other technological processes. </p><p>  Thermal energy is one of the forms of energy that occurs as a result of mechanical vibrations of the structural elements of a substance.  The parameter that allows you to determine the possibility of using it as an energy source is the energy potential.  It can be expressed in kilowatts (thermal) hours or in joules. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sources of thermal energy are divided into: </p><ul><li>  primary.  The energy potential of a substance is due to natural processes.  Such sources include oceans, seas, fossil fuels, etc. Primary sources are divided into inexhaustible, renewable and non-renewable.  The first include thermal waters and substances that can be used to produce thermonuclear energy, etc.  The second includes the energy of the sun, wind, water.  Still others include gas, oil, peat, coal, etc .; </li><li>  secondary.  These are substances whose energy potential directly depends on the activities of people.  For example, these are heated ventilation emissions, municipal waste, hot waste heat carriers of industrial production (steam, water, gas), etc. </li></ul><p>  Thermal energy is currently produced by burning fossil fuels.  The main sources are crude oil, coal, <span>natural gas.</span>  <span>Natural resources</span> account for 90% of total energy consumption.  However, the use of atomic energy is increasing every day. </p><p>  Renewable sources are almost never used.  This is due to the complexity of the technology of their conversion into thermal energy, as well as the low energy potential of some of them. </p><p>  Thermal energy arises as a result of the interaction of infrared photons with external electrons.  The latter absorb photons and move to orbits far from the nucleus.  Thus, the volume of the substance increases.  Thermal energy is transmitted through infrared photons.  In particular, photons during collisions of molecules and atoms with each other jump from the zone of increased concentration of carriers of thermal energy to those zones where it is lowered. </p><p>  Thermal energy can be expressed in the formula: ŒîQ = cmŒîT.  C - denotes the specific heat of the substance, m - the mass of the body, and ŒîT is the temperature difference. </p>
