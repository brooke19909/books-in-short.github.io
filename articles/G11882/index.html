It was built in 1994 and attracts couples and families with its all-inclusive offers and entertainment venues located right at the hotel.  There are not many of them - two restaurants, several pools, as well as a small spa, but you can get into the clubs and restaurants of vibrant Hersonissos by taxi.  True, many vacationers complained about the quality of food and wine, so it may be worth considering the option of paying only for accommodation. </p><h2>  Bella Beach Hotel 5 *: description </h2><p>  This quiet resort on the Anissaras Peninsula has access to one of the best sandy beaches in the region.  Bella Beach Hotel 5 * is built in the style of its partner hotel Silva Beach.  It is popular with families and older couples, most of whom come from Eastern Europe.  The hotel has a spacious lobby with plenty of seating and several shops.  It enters the territory of a large pool surrounded by freely broken lawns and flower beds, as well as brick facades several floors high. </p><p>  The objects of the resort area, which are not crowded during the hours of heat, are usually filled by the end of the day.  In two all-inclusive Pergola rooms, Greek and international dishes are served as a buffet.  And from the slightly more exclusive √† la carte restaurant, ‚ÄúOlive Tree,‚Äù which has a Mediterranean menu, it overlooks the pool, which is beautifully lit after sunset. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Framed by the sandy beach of Anissara, Bella Beach Hotel 5 * Deluxe is located in the central part of the northern coast of Crete.  It is a 10-minute (4 km) taxi ride from the shops, bars and restaurants of the vibrant Hersonissos resort and a half-hour drive from <span>Heraklion</span> International <span>Airport</span> (28 km).  Nearby are several large water parks, as well as the <span>island of Spinalonga,</span> described in the best-selling book of Victoria Hislop.  You can get there by boat from the nearby beach resort of Elounda.  Other highlights within a 20-minute drive include the vibrant Mecca Malia and the legendary ruins of the ancient city of Knossos from the Minoan civilization. </p><p>  For a few euros you can take a bus to Heraklion, a stop is 700 meters from the hotel.  From there, you can take a train tour of Old Hersonissos and the port.  Both trips are very pleasant and inexpensive, so you should not spend money on planned excursions to these places. </p><p>  The hotel has excellent conditions, and it is located in a great location on the shores of the gentle warm sea. </p>

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  Although the main pool of Bella Beach Hotel 5 * is popular during the daytime, the place where most guests bathe and sunbathe when the sea is calm is the beautiful sandy beach of this small resort.  On cool days, the indoor pool with a sauna, jacuzzi, hammam and spa is full.  Tennis courts and a gym are often crowded.  Regarding the latter, it can be noted that the range and quantity of sports equipment must be increased. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Children tired of the beach can head to the grassy playground next to the hotel.  There are swings and slides, as well as a small children's club where you can draw or play board games. </p><p>  For lunch and dinner, vacationers head to the main restaurant "Pergola" with a buffet made up of Greek dishes and regular evening entertainment.  For a more exclusive service, there is an a la carte restaurant "Olive Tree" with tables by candlelight, a menu and views of the pool.  The all-inclusive option is criticized by guests for the quality of food and wine. </p><p>  Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel and the business center, but its speed is poor.  Quick Internet access is available at the reception. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The beach is beautiful, large, just 150 meters from the hotel.  Tourists spend a lot of time sunbathing on sunbeds or diving.  In the sea you can see some colorful reef fish.  Sun loungers, umbrellas and towels are provided free of charge.  Loss of beach towel is subject to a charge of 20 euros. </p><p>  According to vacationers, the condition of the beach is good.  The sand is clean, there are wooden footpaths, a volleyball court and a small passage to the sea from the hotel.  The lifeguard is watching everything. </p><h2>  Not at all 5 stars </h2><p>  Some tourists believe that the Bella Beach Hotel 5 * (Crete) is not really a 5-star hotel.  And they suggest considering the possibility of lowering its category to 4 stars or, possibly, even to 3, since it definitely does not reach 5.  Five-star hotels provide an appropriate level of luxury and although they provide many services, Bella Beach Hotel simply does not provide the required level of comfort. </p><p>  Restaurants, a bar, a pool and rooms are just too mediocre to be five-star.  For example, a restaurant has a good selection, but a low level of food quality.  Very mediocre ‚Äúpaddling pool‚Äù with several broken sunbeds.  The gardens are average, and some areas are overgrown with weeds. </p><p>  According to vacationers, the hotel rooms are a bit outdated and need updating, the restaurant has a lot of flies, the so-called orange fresh is something mixed with a lot of water, wine is served from a self-service tap, and red wine is especially terrible.  The food is fresh but mediocre.  Drinks are served in small plastic cups, while mojito, prosecco, coffee and frappe are not included in the all-inclusive package price. </p>
