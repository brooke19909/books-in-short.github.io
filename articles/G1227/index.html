There is a resort town located on the Black Sea coast.  It is called Gelendzhik and is famous for the mountains surrounding it.  Read about it in the article. </p><h2>  Mountain relief </h2><p>  When going to the mountains in Gelendzhik, it is important to learn about them as much as possible.  This will help not only to plan the route correctly, but also to protect yourself along the way.  So, the rocks and mountains surrounding this place from all sides were formed in the Cretaceous period.  Although they may seem high from afar, they are quite low.  This is because the beginning of the Main <span>Caucasian Range</span> is located here. </p><p>  The bulk of the rocks of which they are composed are sedimentary.  The mountains <span>in Gelendzhik, tours in</span> which are in great demand, are formed by ocher, clay, sandstone, limestone.  You can also find some iron ore here.  In these mountains there are a number of deposits of precious metals.  Gemstones are also mined here. </p>

    <p>  It is from the territory of the mountains located around Gelendzhik that the ridge called the Caucasus originates.  Its length is more than a hundred kilometers, or to be more precise - 1100. The highest point here is Thab.  It is located at an altitude of 905 meters above sea level.  The rest of the massif, as a rule, reaches only 750 meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Travelers traveling to the mountains in Gelendzhik notice that their relief is not uniform.  In some places closer to the sea, they form dangerous cliffs, while in others, on the contrary, they are flat areas. </p><h2>  Water in the mountains </h2><p>  People gathering in the mountains in Gelendzhik are surprised at how many rivers originate here.  The longest of them is Pshada, whose length is 33 kilometers.  In addition to it, there are channels of such rivers as Mezib, Janet and Adebra. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the weather, as well as the change of seasons, have a great influence on the nature of water bodies.  In the summer, when the flow of many rivers ceases to be intense, some of them dry up.  However, as soon as autumn comes into its own and the rivers are often fed by heavy rain, all water open spaces wake up, and their course becomes stormy.  In this state, they move from the beginning of autumn to the end of spring. </p>

    <p>  Showers not only make rivers move faster.  Numerous waterfalls, the number of which totals more than seventy objects, most often wake up after heavy rains.  The most beautiful waterfalls that every person who is going to visit the mountains in Gelendzhik should visit are those that are located on the largest rivers of this mountain range.  Among them are Pshad and Achib waterfalls.  A number of other water bodies are located here, bearing more poetic names, such as ‚ÄúBowl of Love‚Äù and ‚ÄúEmerald‚Äù.  These waterfalls are located on the <span>river Janet</span> and are very picturesque. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mount Sail </h2><p>  Every person who is going to the mountains in Gelendzhik must visit a rock called Sail to make the trip memorable.  This natural monument is fraught with many mysteries.  One of them is a small hole located above the base.  It is believed that it appeared due to the pool that broke through the mountain during the war between Russia and the Oman Empire.  There is a legend that it was to the rock under the poetic name Parus that the protector of people from the gods, Prometheus, was chained. </p>

    <p>  There are several ways to get to this natural monument, which gained its status in the 1970s: </p><ul><li>  On foot.  Then the path will lie through the beach. </li><li>  On the boat.  This tourist ship leaves Gelendzhik daily, it must have a guide. </li><li>  By car, you can reach a place located near the cliff.  And then you should go on foot. </li></ul><p>  Mount Sail in Gelendzhik is a popular destination.  Its atmosphere attracts not only tourists, but also creative people, for example, writers and artists. </p><h2>  Mount Olympus </h2><p>  Mount Olympus in Gelendzhik is one of the most popular peaks of the entire massif.  It rises above the sea by almost seven hundred meters, which is why it is inaccessible to hiking.  However, this problem was successfully solved: in Gelendzhik there is a cable car called the Olympus. </p>
