Their big plus is that here you can relax and heal.  Such opportunities are open to people planning a vacation in the popular village called Kabardinka, which lies in a quiet, cozy bay of the Black Sea.  There are several excellent health resorts, for example, the boarding house of the same name with the village “Kabardinka”, “Victoria”, “Primorsky” and others.

    <h2>  Location, how to get </h2><p>  The resort city of Gelendzhik, located about 25 km south of Novorossiysk, is unusually popular with tourists.  13 km from Gelendzhik towards the same Novorossiysk is the village of Kabardinka.  It is located in the famous <span>Tsemess Bay,</span> in a lagoon surrounded by the spurs of the Markot Range.  Here the Victoria boarding house was built. </p><p>  <span>Kabardinka, Gelendzhik</span> are famous for their unusual air, which is called a natural doctor.  And juniper groves make it healing.  The mountain range protects the village from cold air masses, the sea refreshes in the summer and warms in the winter.  Already at the entrance to the village can offer a good pension Kabardinka.  "Victoria" (as it is called) has such an arrangement that it is convenient to get here by private car or by public transport.  In Gelendzhik there is an airport that accepts flights from many Russian cities.  Buses and minibuses No. 30, 31, 103 go to Kabardinka from him. Of course, they are always ready to offer their taxi services.  From Novorossiysk, where passenger trains come, it is very convenient to get to the boarding house by ordering a paid transfer.  Travel to the boarding house costs about 500 rubles.  You can also get there by public transport, but you will have to do a lot of transfers.  First, from the railway station on trolleybus No. 6, get to the bus station, take the bus to Kabardinka and take a taxi to the boarding house in the village. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pension Victoria Kabardinka reviews" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1007756.jpg" width="530"></div>
