Bugulma city history and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are many beautiful cities in Tatarstan.  Among them, Bugulma is one of the largest regional centers of the country.  Its history is rich in memorable events, among which is the famous <span>Pugachev uprising.</span>  This beautiful and interesting regional center is worth a visit to get acquainted with its rich history and see the sights.  The delightful nature of the city offers long walks along its quiet, well-groomed alleys and lush vineyards.  And here you can go fishing and swimming in clear river water.  We will find out where Bugulma is and how to get there. </p><h2>  Village on the Zai River </h2><p>  It was this status that the modern provincial town of Bugulma had in 1736.  A few years later, a Bugulma settlement appeared on the site of the village, inhabited by yasak peasants and exiled soldiers.  During the Pugachev uprising, the city was the epicenter of mass protests against the government.  Soon the Bugulma settlement got a new status - a county town.  At first it was part of the Ufa governorate, then it became part of the Orenburg province (1796).  In 1850, Bugulma passed to the Samara province.  Since that time, the city has become a major shopping center, and all thanks to its good geographical position: through it passed the road-roads to Kazan from Orenburg and Ufa.  In Bugulma, fairs were constantly organized, so people from neighboring cities and weights went here to sell livestock and leather goods.  Where is Bugulma located now?  A large regional center can be found in the southeast of Tatarstan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

The Museum of J. Hasek can be seen only in two countries: in Tatarstan and the Czech Republic.  The famous building is located between the old houses.  At the entrance to the museum, guests are greeted by the brave soldier Schweik.  And although this is only his sculpture, from afar it seems that a real military man is waiting for you.  This house used to belong to the merchant Nizheradze.  In 1918, Yaroslav Hasek lived and worked in its walls.  The writer stayed in the city only 2 months, but this time was enough for Bugulma to win his heart.  In the museum there were old chairs on which Hasek sat.  In one of the rooms you can see a forged chest, an old desk with heavy drawers, and, of course, hear the battle of the famous French wall clock.  The museum receives visitors daily from 08.00 to 17.00, except on Sundays.  Lunch break lasts from 12.00 to 13.00.

But the theater troupe existed before - in the 19th century.  So, in 1897, the People‚Äôs House was built in the city, designed for 350 places.  He included a theater with a hall.  Every year, lovers of musical and dramatic art came up with theatrical productions, which by the beginning of 1908 were 20. There were also organized musical and literary evenings.  At the end of the revolution, another circle appeared under the name "Blue Blouse."  Subsequently, the Bugulma Drama Theater was created on its basis.  During the war, he was led by actress Nina Olshevskaya - a student of Stanislavsky.  She was evacuated to Bugulma with her son.  It was in the Tatar town that her successful theatrical career began.  Years later, the city drama theater was named after her.  The theater building was restored to its 70th anniversary.  Now it is a worthy decoration of Bugulma.  The modern Bugulma Drama Theater operates year-round.  It is located at 96 Lenin Street.

    <h2>  Bugulma temples </h2><p>  Where is the city of Bugulma, not everyone knows.  But many have heard of the beautiful Bugulma temples: </p><ul><li>  Kazan-Bogoroditskaya church. </li><li>  Church of St. S. Sarovsky. </li><li>  Temple of the Nativity I. Baptist. </li><li>  Church of the Holy Great Martyr G. Victorious. </li></ul><p>  It should be noted that in Tatarstan there are both Orthodox shrines and mosques, which will be written about below. </p><p>  The Orthodox Kazan-Theotokos Church was built between 1988 and 1993.  It was erected in honor of the 1000th anniversary of the baptism of Russia.  Now this picturesque building with a four-tier bell tower is not only a place for prayers, but also a tourist attraction. </p><p>  The Church of St. S. Sarovsky was built in 2006 with charity funds.  Divine services are held here on Sundays and public holidays.  The basement has a baptismal room. </p><p>  The church in honor of I. the Forerunner is made of wood, therefore a special atmosphere of warmth and comfort reigns in it.  The temple is very attractive both outside and inside.  It was lit in 1997 by Bishop Anastasiy of Tatarstan and Kazan.  Now it hosts Sunday and holiday services. </p><p>  The Church of the Holy Great Martyr G. the Victorious has been operating since 1999.  It is made in white.  A Sunday school is open at the temple, and services are held here on Sundays and public holidays. </p><h2>  Central mosque of the city </h2><p>  The largest mosque in the city is designed, like most Muslim religious buildings, in snow-white colors.  It is fenced with an openwork fence made of cast iron.  This is a modern Muslim building with a characteristic volumetric, planning solution.  In the design of the building, motifs are traced not only of eastern Muslim, but also of Bulgarian architecture.  Adherents of Islam come here to pray.  Tourists visit the mosque to admire its beautiful design and join the ancient culture.  Look again, how beautiful Bugulma is.  A photo of the city and its central mosque is presented below. </p>
