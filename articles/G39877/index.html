It is 280 km from Orenburg and is closer to the border with Bashkiria. </p><h2>  Short review </h2><p>  The city is located among the picturesque nature of the Urals.  This location provides people with clean air and a favorable climate.  For lovers of fishing and just wild relaxation, the Tiris water stream (a tributary of the Ik River) flows here.  Its waters are also used for other needs, for example, for irrigation.  The <span>Orenburg region</span> has long been famous for its beautiful landscapes <span>.</span> Abdulino is a city where the population as of January 2016 was about 19.3 thousand people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orenburg region abdulino" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1205830.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Historical excursion </h2><p>  The mention of this settlement was first found in 1795.  This is considered the date of birth of Abdulino.  The village received the name in honor of its founder - the lucky merchant Abdula Yakupov.  For 100 years, this village was just a small village. </p><p>  Like other parts of the Russian Federation, the Orenburg region captivates with its beauty.  Abdulino transformed from a rural settlement.  After the railway was held in 1811, business life in this city noticeably revived, which led to an increase in the local population.  The legendary Orenburg tract passing through the village (now the Kazan-Orenburg federal highway) contributed a lot to the prosperity.  Since 1923, Abdulino turns into a city, then becomes a district center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  Transport links play a large role in the development of cities and areas.  Due to this industry, the Orenburg region is also of considerable importance.  Abdulino has the same railway station.  Most of the business life of the city is connected with the railway.  Moreover, this is not just a station, but a whole railway junction, on which all the routes to the European part of our country and to the Urals are tied.  They come from the Far East, from Siberia and Kazakhstan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orenburg region Mr. Abdulino" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1205840.jpg" width="399"></div>

    <p>  Therefore, one of the largest enterprises of our country for the repair of track machines and the production of spare parts is located here.  By the way, this is also imprinted on the city emblem: a gear is depicted on a red background, and inside it is a locomotive.  On the flag of the city you can see bread ears. </p><p>  Livestock and agriculture are the basis of the Abdulinsky district.  However, these industries are developing well throughout the entire administrative center.  Orenburg region (the city of Abdulino) is famous for the cultivation of many crops.  There is also a plant for the production and repair of machinery for agriculture. </p><h2>  Culture and education </h2><p>  Many cultural sites of the city still bear the imprint of a glorious merchant's land.  For example, locals call the culture park Zhogolevsky, in honor of the merchant who planted the first trees.  Many beautiful, old buildings are the former homes of wealthy people. </p><p>  An interesting historical site is the railway station, created in 1895.  In Abdulino there is a museum-apartment of the remarkable Russian engineer Florenty Kazantsev, who invented, as you know, an automated railway brake system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof abdulino, Orenburg region" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1205839.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  One of the most beautiful buildings is the Church of the Holy Blessed Prince Alexander Nevsky, erected in 1912. After the revolution, the church was closed, it was revived only in 2008.  The city of Abdulino, Orenburg region, boasts a mosque. </p><p>  It has its own museum of local lore, a monument was erected to railway workers who died in the Great Patriotic War.  Not far from the Zhogolevsky park there is a square dedicated to the memory of fellow countrymen who fought in Afghanistan. </p><p>  From educational institutions, one can distinguish a branch of Moscow State University of Technology and Management.  The city also has its own television center and newspaper. </p>
