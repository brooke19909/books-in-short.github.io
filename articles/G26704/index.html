  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bodies of Russia - Pastora Lake: description, features, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the extraordinary places in Russia is Pastora Lake.  It is interesting not only for its beauty, but for its origin.  Despite its small size, the reservoir has a rather interesting and rich history.  In the 19th century, near the lake there was a factory of the Olkhins family, which produced the best paper products in our country, sold not only in Russia and the CIS countries, but also in Europe.  Its owners were repeatedly awarded the highest awards for their work.  The company operated on water that came from a local reservoir.  According to local legends, this name was acquired due to the fact that a pastor who came from Switzerland once lived in this area. </p><h2>  Location and natural features </h2><p>  In the settlement of Sadovodstvo, Vsevolozhsk district of the Leningrad region, there is Pastorskoye Lake (on the map below it is clearly visible).  Its dimensions are very small.  The length of the reservoir is not more than 1 km, and the width is about 250 m. In some areas it is rather shallow, the depth does not exceed several meters.  In the deepest places, there are up to 6 m. </p><p>  The bottom of the lake is covered with peat and silt.  Due to the presence of peat in it, the water takes on a reddish hue.  Through the whole lake passes a stream, which has the same name Pastorsky.  It is replenished due to rains and other precipitation.  Pastoral Lake, like many others, was created in a natural way.  Food is also provided by peat keys. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pastoral lake" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1151802.jpg" width="600"></div>

They are famous for organizing various sporting events there at different times of the year. </p><h2>  Beaches on the Lake </h2><p>  The main attraction of the lake are the beaches, since they existed over the time of children's camps.  Sandstones are located on the south and east sides.  The names of the beaches are also striking in their originality.  For example, "Automotive".  It has a similar name due to the fact that tourists and athletes who come to competitions very often relax on it.  Beach "Birch" is called in this way because of the birch groves growing on it.  This place is very popular among vacationers who come to Lake Pastors, as you can sunbathe both in the open sun and in the shade of trees if you wish. </p><p>  There is also a "Dog Beach".  People very often bring their animals there for a walk and for swimming together.  Many beaches got their name in honor of the children's camps that were located on this territory, such as "The Seagull", "Squirrel". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pastoral fishing lake" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1151794.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <h2>  For fishing lovers </h2><p>  Fans of fishing know Pastora Lake firsthand, as it contains large quantities of valuable fish - catfish.  Professionals know that it is perfectly caught in cloudy weather.  But on a clear sunny day, the catch may not be very successful.  It is worth noting that in the evening the catfish comes closer to the shore, and, sitting near the water, you can hear a characteristic sound, similar to gurgling. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pastoral lake on the map" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1151793.jpg" width="600"></div>
