They have quite a few reviews of basic level DSLR models, but the abundance of information only increases confusion.  If you plan to purchase the first digital SLR camera for beginners, the choice should be made from the devices presented in this review, since they really are the best. </p><p>  DSLR cameras are renowned for their versatility and high-definition images.  And although they may be slightly more expensive than other digital cameras, they justify their price.  When choosing a SLR camera, it is very important to understand its features in order to know what to expect from it.  Below is a list of models, familiarization with the functionality of which will make the right decision. </p><h2>  Pentax K-S2 </h2><p>  If you need a brand a little more conservative than the rest, then this DSLR camera will definitely like it.  Pentax K-S2 is the best SLR camera for beginners.  And this model is one of the latest additions to the Pentax line. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pentax K-S2 DSLR" class="if uuid-2290273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2290273.jpg"></div><p>  Key camera features include a 3 ‚Äùswivel screen and wireless support.  The camera is also offered complete with removable lenses.  Although Pentax K-S2 is considered one of the manufacturer‚Äôs most innovative models, it retains many of the great features of its previous DSLR cameras, including a glass pentaprism viewfinder, hermetic seals and two control dials. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pentax K-S2 - a portable SLR camera.  The choice of this option is supported by the convenience of handling and control, as well as the presence of a magnificent viewfinder.  The quality of the image created by the 20.1-megapixel APS-C sensor with a stabilization system will undoubtedly ensure the capture of professional-grade images.  In addition, those who are willing to experiment with various compositions will certainly appreciate the features that are not available in other DSLR cameras.  A standard 18-50mm complete lens can easily jam when folded.  Also, users complain about a slow Wi-Fi connection, which sometimes does not work at all, the presence of only 11 autofocus points, the video quality and burst options that do not match the competitors' models. </p><p>  If you plan to purchase Pentax K-S2, please note that there are 2 possible purchase options.  You can purchase both the body itself and a kit with a lens.  In the second case, the camera is equipped with Pentax-DA L 18-50 mm f / 4.0-5.6 optics (27.5‚Äì76.5 mm in 35 mm equivalent). </p><p>  The model entered the market in March 2015 and costs 40-50 thousand rubles.  The camera comes in a variety of exciting colors.  The camera provides the ability to mix settings, which makes it attractive for beginners, who, as they acquire skills, can switch from automatic to manual control. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nikonrumors.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D5500" class="if uuid-2292362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2292362.jpg"></div><h2>  Nikon D5500 </h2><p>  The choice of a SLR camera for an amateur is always ambiguous.  You need to navigate the many brands available on the market today, and a large number of options make it difficult for beginners to make decisions.  But one model of a world famous brand offers something more.  This is the Nikon D5500, equipped with a 24.2-megapixel image sensor and a highly efficient noise reduction system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Compared to the previous model, <span>Nikon D5300,</span> this camera is smaller and 60 g lighter, equipped with an improved holder that provides a comfortable and more reliable grip.  Unlike other Nikon SLR cameras, the D5500 is made of composite carbon fiber reinforced with plastic fibers, not polycarbonate or magnesium alloy, but its durability is no worse than its predecessors. </p><p>  Two manual dials give an excellent sense of balance and control. </p><p>  The model has everything you need for a novice photographer.  Manual controls and an ergonomic design are just a few of the advantages of the camera.  The 3.2 ‚Äùtouch screen can be tilted at different angles, making it easy to take pictures from unusual angles. </p><p>  Nikon D5500 is a relatively cheap SLR camera.  The choice of this model does not entail a deterioration in image quality - only GPS is sacrificed for a low cost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imaging-resource.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D5600" class="if uuid-2292369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2292369.jpg"></div><h2>  Nikon D5600 </h2><p>  Nikon's product is also another best SLR camera choice for hobbyists.  The D5600 is designed for beginner photographers looking for a camera that combines excellent image quality with creative controls.  This is a novelty in the entry-level digital camera line, replacing the Nikon D5500.  A feature of the model is that it comes with SnapBridge technology, which allows owners to easily transfer pictures from the camera to tablets, computers or phones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The camera is compact and very versatile, it is easy to carry without straining your hands.  Compared to the D5500, the Nikon D5600 has improved, but the resolution remains the same - 24.2 megapixels, as well as the size of the APS-C CMOS sensor.  The EXPEED 4 image processing processor has not changed either. The ISO 100‚Äì25600 sensitivity range allows the camera to be used in various lighting conditions. </p><p>  The optical viewfinder of the camera covers the frame by 95%, so you need to carefully check the <span>composition of the frame</span> to be sure of the purity of the picture. </p><p>  The model is different in that it allows you to crop images and videos during playback.  And those who like to experiment with video will surely enjoy the function of accelerated frame-by-frame shooting. </p><p>  Although most of the cameras in this review allow you to record video in 4K format, the Nikon D5600 does not cope with this, since it only supports 1080p.  The model‚Äôs microphone (compared to its predecessor) has become smaller, but a 2.5 mm jack is provided for installing an external audio capture device. </p><p>  The D5600 is a great choice <span>for a beginner</span> SLR <span>camera;</span> it is certainly worth the money.  It can be purchased without optics or complete with a VR lens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D3400" class="if uuid-2292401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2292401.jpg"></div><h2>  Nikon D3400 </h2><p>  Although not the most expensive entry-level camera, it is one of the best.  The Nikon D3400 is based on the well-established D3300, which until recently has been a leader among basic SLRs.  The camera has the same design and specifications as its predecessor, but got the ability to connect via Bluetooth to transfer images directly to the user's device, greatly simplifying the procedure for sharing photos. </p><p>  An image sensor with a resolution of 24.2 megapixels provides tremendous detail. </p><p>  Using the D3400 is very easy, as the smart training mode explains the important functions of the camera in real time.  Although the location of the controls, according to users, hinders the professional growth of the photographer, and the 3 ‚Äùscreen of the camera is neither touch nor tilted, there is no microphone port, overall this is an excellent entry-level model with a reliable autofocus system that allows you to make nice pictures - crisp with rich colors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dpreview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon T7i" class="if uuid-2292384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2292384.jpg"></div><h2>  Canon T7i </h2><p>  The T7i is a great <span>Canon SLR camera</span> choice for beginner amateurs.  Outside the US, the model is called EOS 800D and is one of the latest innovations of the manufacturer.  Compared with her, all previous representatives of the Rebel line seem hopelessly outdated.  The closest in its characteristics to T7i is the Canon T6i camera, which has established itself as one of the best entry-level DSLR cameras, but the new version left T6i in the past. </p><p>  The DSLR comes with an 18-55 mm STM lens and features many innovations.  Both 7i and 6i have the same resolution of 24.2 megapixels, use technology similar to the EOS 800D.  With it, even beginners can create highly detailed images of a professional level.  The Canon 7i is equipped with a new sensor coupled with the DIGIC 7 photo processing system. This has improved noise reduction and autofocus. </p><p>  ISO sensitivity is supported in the ISO100‚Äì25600 range, which matches the Canon T6i.  If necessary, it can be expanded to ISO 51200. T7i is equipped with a 3.0-inch touch screen with a resolution of 1.04 million pixels, which can be rotated and tilted at different angles.  Like the Nikon D5600, the Canon T7i does not support 4K video capture and can only work with Full HD. </p><p>  The camera can shoot video at a frame rate of 60p.  Given the presence of a good image stabilization system, this allows you to shoot sports events.  What really sets the Canon T7i apart is the new autofocus feature.  The manufacturer has installed a Dual Pixel system, which significantly speeds up focusing in real time. </p><p>  Despite the low video resolution, the T7i is a good SLR camera for beginners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kenrockwell.com" data-author=": Ken Rockwell, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon 77D" class="if uuid-2290429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2290429.jpg"></div><h2>  Canon 77D </h2><p>  Like the T7i, this DSLR model outside the US is known as the EOS 900D.  The functionality of the camera corresponds to the Canon T7i / EOS 800D.  The camera has the same 24-megapixel resolution and the same 45-point autofocus system.  However, the 77D comes with an updated DIGIC 7 GPU. </p><p>  In terms of weight and size, the Canon 77D is slightly larger than the T7i / 800D and lighter.  This model fully justifies the investment invested in it, providing better capture and a more manageable screen layout.  An additional LCD screen is installed on the top side of the camera on the right side. </p><p>  One of the many great features of this model is the quick control dial located at the back, it can be locked.  This functionality is only available in Canon mid-range and high-end SLR cameras; there was no function in the Rebel line.  The camera also allows you to easily control the exposure.  The LCD display has not changed compared to the previous model - its diagonal size is 3 "and the resolution is 1.04 million pixels. </p><p>  In the video recording mode, touching the camera screen allows you to automatically focus on the desired subject.  Dual Pixel autofocus makes the 77D look like an EOS 800D.  The camera has a standard Canon user interface, but if you need something more convenient for beginners, so you can use the camera without constantly referring to the instructions, you can go to the T7i interface. </p><p>  A special button is provided for the screen sight mode, which differs from the button in the Rebel line.  It is located to the right of the viewfinder.  The Canon 77D also offers excellent quality, high-definition video in 1080p / 60p format.  If you need to improve the sound quality, you can use the microphone port located on the side panel. </p><p>  The Canon 77D is a great choice for the amateur SLR camera, which allows you to explore different shooting methods without the help of a professional. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dslrbuyingguide.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D5300" class="if uuid-2292654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2292654.jpg"></div><h2>  What to look for? </h2><p>  Buying a DSLR is a serious matter.  This gadget is quite expensive, and I would not want to get something that will not be used, so you need to know how to choose the right SLR camera for beginners. </p><p>  Firstly, you should weigh the pros and cons of buying a camera complete with or without lenses.  In a kit with digital cameras, an 18-55 mm lens is most often offered.  If you purchase only the case, then you will have to buy optics separately. </p><p>  Secondly, before choosing a good SLR camera, you need to pay attention to the image sensor.  Is it full-frame or APS-C?  The first option is popular among professionals, but for those who are just starting to learn the art of photography, such a choice may be too difficult.  But APS-C sensors allow even beginners to take high quality pictures. </p><h2>  Main Features </h2><p>  The next thing to find out is the number of megapixels that the image sensor of the purchased camera provides.  This indicator characterizes the resolution of the image.  The higher it is, the better the composition of the frame. </p><p>  Of course, when deciding which SLR camera to choose, it is necessary to take into account the image processor, since it is the brain of a DSLR camera.  It is difficult to compare products of different companies, but a good processor combined with excellent software surprises with the quality of the images. </p><p>  When it comes to camera manufacturers, you can name a lot of reliable brands, users familiar with them should definitely know what best suits their preferences. </p><h2>  The most important features of DSLR cameras for beginners </h2><p>  Before choosing a SLR camera, in addition to resolution, processor and image sensor, more general things should be taken into account.  Firstly, you need to check whether the camera lies well in your hand. </p><p>  The user must make sure that he can access the various controls, how easy it is.  You should evaluate how heavy or light the camera is, feel the texture of the surface and check if it is sufficient so that the camera does not slip in your hands.  One of the most important features of the DSLR, which is also worth considering, is the material from which the camera body is made.  You should not spend a large amount on a device that does not even meet industry standards. </p><p>  You also need to check the flash control system so that you can easily activate it.  Consideration should be given to operating modes and editing functions.  All DSLR cameras, both entry-level and professional, support various scenes, of which the most popular are night, portrait, landscape and sports photography.  The new modes are panorama and shooting food, so you may want to choose a SLR camera for beginners that supports them. </p><p>  Relative aperture and shutter priority are just as important as manual mode.  This will allow you to switch from an independent study of focus and allow the camera to set the image sharpness on its own. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  People of different ages and different preferences may have different options.  It should be remembered that the best SLR camera may not be the same as that of a friend, so you need to decide on your preferences, and not the preferences of others. </p><p>  Those who previously used only their smartphone or smaller digital camera will welcome new opportunities.  Digital SLR cameras give you more creative freedom, creating much better photos than ever before. </p>
