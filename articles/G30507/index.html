Such a "home away from home" can both become the best memory of a vacation and completely ruin it. </p><p>  To study offers, consider photos, read reviews of real tourists, it is possible these days literally without leaving home.  However, there are thousands of hotels, the opinions of vacationers are sometimes polar different.  How not to get lost in this variety? </p><h2>  Hotel Stars </h2><div class="photo" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://travelask.ru/blog/posts/1472-chto-na-samom-dele-znachit-zvezdnyy-status-oteley"><img itemprop="image" alt="star hotel" class="if uuid-2627004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96741/2627004.jpg"></div><p>  The "star" of the hotel is for many the very first selection criterion. </p><p>  But for starters, it‚Äôs worth deciding not on the level of the hotel, but on its purpose.  Imagine if you are going to relax in a beach resort, but have ended up in a city hotel focused on business travelers.  It can be luxurious, "starry" and comfortable, but still will not meet your expectations. </p><p>  All hotels are conditionally divided into 3 categories. </p><ul><li>  Resorts.  Hotels for rest.  Usually located on the seashore, river or lake, outside the city, have a large adjacent territory with many areas for rest and relaxation. </li><li>  City &amp; Business.  City hotels.  Suitable for tourists who want to explore the sights of the city or organize business meetings.  They are located not just within the city, but within walking distance from the historical center, or other infrastructure. </li><li>  Transit  Hotels located directly on the territory of airports, train stations and other transport hubs.  Convenient for transit passengers.  They may also have the category of ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù with the necessary set of services. </li></ul><p>  Only having decided on the purpose of the trip, you can proceed to the choice of the level of the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Europe, stars are assigned to a hotel by a special commission that considers the applicant according to 21 criteria.  It includes the size of the rooms, the frequency of cleaning, and the availability of additional amenities: a bar, restaurant, spa, gym.  Personnel qualifications are also evaluated separately.  The presence of such an ‚Äúoptional‚Äù unit as a doorman, porter or concierge may bring an extra star to the hotel. </p><p>  Nevertheless, this categorization is very arbitrary.  Of course, in a five-star hotel you will receive a guarantee of comfort, and the amenities will certainly not be on the floor.  But even the "five" may not live up to your expectations. </p><p>  In an unfamiliar country, it's better to trust familiar brands. </p><h2>  Monobrand Features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="filmotzyv.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://filmotzyv.com/odin-doma/"><img itemprop="image" alt="frame from the movie" class="if uuid-2627050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96741/2627050.jpg"></div><p>  A hotel chain is not just a name, but also a certain quality standard.  Moreover, management monitors this quality uncompromisingly.  After all, only one negative experience is the loss of a client for the entire network.  The management team usually has clear criteria for design, the size of the rooms, and the range of services.  Personnel training is also centralized.  Therefore, if you enjoyed your stay in one of the hotels in the chain, you can safely book a room in another. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is also worth considering that the usual categorization by stars is the European system.  For example, Asia and some southern countries have their own criteria for assigning stars.  Therefore, the hotel may surprise you, both pleasantly and not very. </p><p>  Turning to a familiar brand, you will at least avoid disappointment. </p><h2>  Direction - Turkey.  Looking for familiar names </h2><p>  Turkey in the summer - Mecca for the Russians.  The famous All Inclusive, the sea and children's animation attract lovers of "relaxation without worries."  There is a downside.  With such an influx of tourists, the hotel business in Turkey is in full swing, there is no need to talk about any individual approach.  There are also very extreme cases of poisoning by stale food, dirt in the rooms and other amenities. </p><p>  However, there are chain hotels in Turkey that ‚Äúkeep the brand‚Äù. </p><p>  The most famous Turkish chain is Crystal Hotels 5 *, which won many awards.  Hotels are in all popular resorts: Belek, Side, Kemer, Bodrum. </p><p>  Crystal hotels specialize in marine recreation and spa.  "Your" hotel can be found by any traveler.  Some of them are a paradise for families with children.  For the most demanding tourists Nirvana Lagoon Villas Suites &amp; SPA is recommended - impeccable service and complete privacy guaranteed. </p><p>  Another famous Turkish network is Delphin.  Seven hotels of the chain are located in the most popular resorts.  All of them are marked with five stars.  The main distinguishing feature is the beaches, huge landscaped areas with exotic plants and plenty of entertainment for children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Rixos in Turkey is the most ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù network.  Designed for wealthy tourists, however, the vacation is worth it.  Nine unique hotels of the chain are mini-cities with all the infrastructure, their unique style and color.  The list of services is huge, the staff does everything to make you feel like a guest of royal blood. </p><h2>  What attracts hoteliers to the capital </h2><p>  Chain hotels in Russia are represented by almost all world brands.  Moscow is a tidbit for hoteliers all over the world.  Millions of tourists, annual exhibitions, conferences and sporting events make the network fight for the right to open their hotel there. </p><p>  Among the luxury five-star chain <span>hotels in Moscow,</span> you can list Hilton, Kempinski, Hayatt, Sheraton. </p><p>  A little lower class, but with good service and a premium location - Radisson and Novotel.  An option for the average budget is Ibis, Park Inn. </p><h2>  Quality mark SLH.  Luxury for the discerning </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.theatlantichotel.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.theatlantichotel.com/about-the-hotel/small-luxury-hotels-of-the-world"><img itemprop="image" alt="network logo" class="if uuid-2627053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96741/2627053.jpg"></div><p>  ‚ÄúThe smallest luxury hotels in the world‚Äù - this is how the abbreviation SLH is translated. </p><p>  Strictly speaking, this is not a network, but rather a quality mark, such as the Michelin star for restaurants, a kind of club for the elite.  But there is no doubt about the level of hotels marked with the SLH sign.  The main selection criterion is uniqueness.  Two identical do not exist.  Brand SLH marked and ski, and exotic, and city, and historical hotels.  Combining their luxury and service beyond comprehension.  These are truly the best chain hotels in the world. </p><p>  One of the most amazing, secluded residences of the SLH club is located on the island of Muhu (not everyone has heard of this place) in Estonia. </p><h2>  Piadaste Manor.  Hidden pearl </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitestonia.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.visitestonia.com/en/padaste-manor-spa"><img itemprop="image" alt="Piadaste Manor" class="if uuid-2627058" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96741/2627058.jpg"></div><p>  Piadaste Manor is a 15th-century historic estate owned by Baron von Knorr.  Now it is a luxurious hotel complex with the main building of the estate, a park, gravel paths and a gardener's house.  You should not describe the style and architecture of the estate, you can only say that Estonians have a very careful attitude to history.  Want in the 15th century with plumbing and an iPad instead of a key?  To you there. </p><p>  Rooms are not a good word for this hotel.  Apartments, rooms, everything, just not numbers.  Two identical do not exist.  The medieval architecture of the building is complex, therefore the layout of the rooms is unusual, with <span>niches, alcoves.</span>  Wooden floors, woven walkways, hand-embroidered bedspreads in traditional Estonian style.  On the other hand, an interactive bed with a remote control at the head.  Press the button - the TV ‚Äúhidden‚Äù at the foot ‚Äúpops up‚Äù, another press - the lighting scenario changes.  The bathroom is behind a glass wall that becomes opaque ... yes, yes, again at the touch of a button.  An integrated audio system, a call button for personnel ... it's easier to say what is not there. </p><p>  The pacifying northern nature, bicycles for walks, a bathhouse on the seashore and a video library with old films - complete relaxation is guaranteed. </p><p>  SLH hotels are the quintessence of a chic, aristocratic vacation.  One minus is the price.  But they are worth it. </p><p>  What about the budget option? </p><h2>  Radisson Blu Latvija, Riga </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.inyourpocket.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.inyourpocket.com/riga/Valentines-Day_73031f"><img itemprop="image" alt="View from Radisson" class="if uuid-2627070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96741/2627070.jpg"></div><p>  This complex of the world famous Radisson chain is a typical representative of the class of city and conference 4 * hotel.  Perhaps the best combination of price and quality offers.  Located in the center of the Latvian capital, a couple of blocks from the Old Town.  It has several <span>bars, restaurants</span> and conference rooms.  From the upper floors of the hotel offers unforgettable panoramic views of the city.  The highlight of the hotel is the best Espa Riga spa center in the Baltic countries. </p><h2>  Pleasant persistence bonus </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pitert.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://pitert.ru/news/programmy-loyalnosti-otel"><img itemprop="image" alt="loyalty program" class="if uuid-2627090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96741/2627090.jpg"></div><p>  Wherever and for what purpose you go, hotels of famous chains will take you with maximum comfort. </p><p>  Probably all well-known networks offer their own loyalty program.  Be sure to join the club.  Membership in it is usually free, and significant savings. </p><p>  Firstly, hotels inform about special discounts, promotions and hot offers.  Secondly, a membership card usually gives a constant discount even in high season.  Often hotels give loyal customers gifts in the form of services, flowers and sweets in their rooms, free transfers, dinners and much more. </p><p>  You should never be afraid to ask for a room a class higher, or to require relocation if something does not suit you.  Hotel managers are more willing to meet regular customers. </p><p>  And remember: one dissatisfied client is a loss for the entire network.  Even if something has overshadowed your stay, branded hotels are more likely to listen and accept your complaint.  And, of course, they will try to correct the situation. </p>
