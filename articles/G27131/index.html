In fact, this device was expected by both our compatriots and users from different parts of the world.  It is also worth considering that the UMI company has created a grand and memorable advertising company that has flown around the world and is remembered by many.  The gadget has a lot of advantages.

The review should begin with design.  Firstly, you should pay attention to the external parameters of this device, in our case they are unique.  The case is quite thin, its back is made of metal.  Secondly, the device has an excellent filling, here the developers have already paid attention to all the smallest nuances and created a smartphone almost perfect.

To a big plus is the fact that manufacturers and test managers were still able to notice vulnerabilities in the software, after which it was quickly and successfully fixed, and now every interested buyer can notice such a device on the windows of store shelves.

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  Take a look at the opinions of the owners of Umi Iron.  Reviews indicate that this device is not only multifunctional, but also has high performance and reliability.  In terms of pricing, the gadget really justifies the cost, and you can now see for yourself.  It is worth talking about the features of Umi Iron.  The review will continue by listing a few interesting features.  The first one is eye recognition, the developer called it Eyeprint ID.  Another interesting feature is the heart rate monitor, which you simply can‚Äôt see in any of the latest smartphones.  In reality, these capabilities are unique, but I wonder how accurately they work.  The manufacturer of UMI also announced that the new smartphone has a Hi-Fi sound level.  In fact, this is exactly so. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We can note the ultra-modern cameras, because in our case, the developers did not stint and installed professional sensors from world manufacturers OmniVision and Sony.  On the one hand, there can be no complaints about this smartphone, but not everything is as good as it might seem at first glance.  There are still drawbacks to this gadget, and we will talk about them a little later.  Now let's talk about the characteristics of Umi Iron.  An overview of the technical part of the device is given below, since we have already described the external parameters, as well as additional features.  After purchasing this gadget, you get a cardboard square box.  The device packaging consists of two parts.  The first is located at the top and contains the device itself.  She pushes to the side.  This box is made in silver color, which is able to simulate metal.  The inside of the box is completely black, you can see the Rootjoy logo on it. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

So, the first is the smartphone itself, a connector for charging and a cube for outlets under a current power of 1A.  Also included are branded USB and OTG cables.  There is also a clip for removing the SIM card from the device, of course, the instruction manual for the mobile phone is also included in the kit.  You should immediately pay attention to the left side of the mobile device, since it is almost completely covered with glass.  Most likely, this is Dragontrail, but these assumptions may be inaccurate.  Nevertheless, the device looks presentable in appearance, and the most important thing is that it is very convenient and easy to control.  At the bottom of the device you can see a small indicator that is responsible for missed events by the user.
