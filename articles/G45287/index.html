    <p>  Arkaim is a city that can be compared to the Druid Stonehenge.  By the way, both monuments are located at the same <span>geographical latitude.</span>  So, Arkaim, where it is a pleasure, is an amazing city, Russian Troy, the stronghold of the Pre-Slavs.  Who and when discovered him? </p><p>  The hillfort, as well as the reserve created in its place, is located in a picturesque green river valley.  Here is the magic around: in amazing nature, landscapes.  No wonder the ancient people believed that this is where the place of power is located.  On this territory, you can make wishes, ask for love, prosperity, happiness, cleanse your aura and soul from sins.  Knowledgeable people say that the gods will certainly hear your requests.  The unique archaeological and natural monument has no analogues in Russia.  That is why Arkaim is so popular among scientists, historians and just curious, where it is interesting and simply pleasant to be.  See for yourself by visiting it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Where is Arkaim located on the map?  Finding it is pretty simple.  You need to go to the Magnitogorsk region, to the Southern Urals.  It is necessary to overcome about ninety kilometers from the city to the reserve.  You can also get from Chelyabinsk - regular bus service will help you to be there instantly.  But it‚Äôs not at all necessary to know where Arkaim is and to get there yourself.  From any city, you can order a tour by phone or via the Internet to walk along the narrow streets of the settlement. </p>

    <p>  If you translate the name of the city into Russian from the language of the ancient Slavs, you get the "City of the Bear."  The beast ("arch" means "bear") was a symbol of the god Veles - the patron of power, wealth, knowledge.  He was considered the grandson of Rod, the only god, and the guardian of Navi - the world of the dead.  According to legend, the city was built by the wife of Bohumir Slavun, the great-granddaughter of Roda, the granddaughter of Barma, daughter Manna.  And it happened around 3000 BC  But scientists date the monument using the radiocarbon method 3600-3900 years. </p><p>  Since 1987, the city of Arkaim, where to be - means to touch the past, has become open.  Literally four years later, the entire territory was declared protected.  But there really is something to see.  The oldest observatory known to the world, narrow maze streets, houses, stoves, all buildings are built according to the solar plan - they have a clear round shape, geometric proportions.  The level of development of ancient civilization, <span>the water supply system,</span> which does not fit into generally recognized norms, and the very fact that the Aryans left their settlement, is also striking.  Like the Trypillians, they happily lived in the city for fifty to one hundred years, after which it was burned.  But after the same period of time, they returned back and rebuilt the village again.  The reason for this behavior could not be military operations, nor pestilence, or anything else, since in the burials around Arkaim only the remains of elderly people who died their deaths were found. </p>

    <p>  So what is Arkaim?  The city of priests, an observatory, the center of ancient culture?  No one can give a definite answer.  It is only clear that Arkaim, where it is always interesting to be, is truly the greatest discovery of the end of the twentieth century. </p>
