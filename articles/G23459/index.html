Once upon a time, during the Middle Ages, the lands of this region were part of the Novgorod Republic.  During its existence, the state experienced financial booms and the crisis that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union.  The consequences of difficulties affected the current situation, which is why the <span>population of Komi,</span> although at a slow pace, is declining.  The only thing that pleases is the sights of the Komi Republic, which are abundant here.  In the region there are many natural objects as well as monuments built by people.  Many tourists come here who admire the beauty of the local nature and the splendor of the local architecture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of the Komi Republic" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1547256.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Biosphere Reserve </h2><p>  The main attractions of the Komi Republic are <span>objects of nature.</span>  Some of them were created by people, for example, the Pechora-Ilych Biosphere Reserve.  It is located on the western slope of the Ural Mountains.  On the east side, the reserve borders the Belt Stone ridge.  And on the western, northern and southern sides it is limited by the rivers Ilych and Pechora.  On the territory of the biosphere reserve is Mount Torreporreiz, the Manpupuner Range and virgin forests, which are included in the list of World Natural Heritage Sites. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pechora-Ilychsky reserve was created in 1930.  It was equipped in order to preserve the natural complex of the north-eastern side of the European part of the Union.  Basically, it was intended to preserve the natural living conditions of the sable.  Many attractions of the Komi Republic, parks, reserves and reserves were created precisely in order to preserve certain species of animals or plants. </p><h2>  Coal City </h2><p>  In the north-west of the republic is a small town of Inta.  Its population barely exceeds 30 thousand people.  And if you go through this settlement, you will not be able to find anything surprising in it: a small area surrounded by impassable forests and beautiful lakes.  His story is amazing in this village, which is really incredible.  Nature has awarded this area with chic coal deposits.  People were destined to learn about such a treasure only in the century before last.  And drilling here began only on December 17, 1931. </p><p>  Prisoners were sent to Intu for such hard labor.  The first results - 5300 tons of coal - were issued in 1942.  The city of Inta developed quite rapidly and in 1944 received the status of a working village.  During 1953-1954, the city built one of the few architectural monuments here - a water tower.  The monumental object was built of red brick.  Inta acquired the status of the city in 1954. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="inta city" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1547258.jpg" width="600"></div>

They are seven remnants with a height of 30 to 42 meters.  No one really knows the history of the appearance of these stones.  They are surrounded by many secrets, legends and mysteries.  One of the legends tells that once upon a time an omnipotent Mansi tribe lived in Komi.  The men of this tribe were skillful and powerful hunters.  Mansi leader was a wise leader.  He was always helped by spirits who were closely friends with all members of the tribe.  Thanks to this, friendship, peace and luxury reigned in each yurt mansi. </p><p>  The leader had two children: a son Pigrychum and a daughter, Aim.  Aim was so beautiful that the giant Torev decided to take her.  When the girl refused to laugh with him, he and his brothers attacked the Mansi tribe.  They brought a lot of trouble to the people, but Aim was smart and managed to outwit the giant.  She asked the spirits to endow her brother with unknown strength and help the tribe.  Pigrychum, with the help of the weapons that the spirits gave him, managed to turn Torev and his brothers into stone idols, which now stand on Man-Pupu-Ner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weathering pillars Komi Republic" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1547259.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Relic Ice Cave </h2><p>  There is the Ledyanaya cave in Komi, which, unfortunately, is still poorly understood.  It is a complex system of moves and halls.  In the republic, this is the only open cave in which there are burial sites of relict ice.  In most of the halls and passages located in the grotto, the floor, walls and arch are covered with countless openwork large crystals, as well as branches of cave ice crystals.  Many crystals have a diameter of three to four centimeters.  And in the far corner of the hall rise 70-90-centimeter <span>ice mountains.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ice cave" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1547260.jpg" width="600"></div>
