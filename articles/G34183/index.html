  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to measure a step seam: instructions and tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you are fond of tailoring, but do not have special professional skills, you may have various problems with understanding the terms used and taking measurements.  In order to sew trousers or shorts, you will need to determine the step or inner seam.  Only with the right measurements and correctly constructed pattern will the product differ in perfect fit.  Let's consider in more detail how to measure a step seam. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  A step or inside seam is a seam located on trousers or leggings on the inside of the thigh.  In other words, this is the distance from the groin to the end of the legs.  It should be noted that the inner seam will always be shorter compared to the outer seam.  On breeches and shorts, internal seams are also considered stepping.  The measurement of internal seams is necessary not only when sewing the product, but also to determine the size in certain sports, for example, for cyclists.  Knowing how to measure the length of a step seam with an assistant or independently will make the sewing process much easier, the resulting product is more convenient.  And the process of acquiring a new pair of trousers or leggings will become much easier.  Try one of the methods below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thetallgirlsguidetofashion.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to measure a step seam" class="if uuid-2235229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2235229.jpg"></div><h2>  How to measure a step seam using ready-made pants </h2><ol><li>  Choose pants that fit you better than anyone else.  They should be comfortable, tight-fitting and normal in length, not shortened and not long.  To make the correct measurements on the pants, you need to make sure that they are perfect for you. </li><li>  Fold them in half as if you are going to iron the arrows so that only one leg is visible.  Lay the trousers on an ironing board or other flat surface and smooth them carefully so that there are no wrinkles or irregularities (the crease should be perfectly even). </li><li>  Next, you will need a tailor's tape or tape measure.  Attach the tip to the lower intersection of the wedge of the inner seam.  Next, take measurements by pulling the tape until you reach the very bottom of the trousers.  If you used roulette, then it is better to fix the measurements.  The tailor's tape can be pinned with a pin or a needle.  Check again the accuracy of the measurements.  The length from the wedge of the inner seam to the floor is the length of the stepping seam.  Here's how to measure a step seam across your trousers. <div class="photo" data-original="dungarees.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://dungarees.com/blog/2014/11/18/carhartt-sizing-for-women/"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to measure the length of a stepping seam" class="if uuid-2235231" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2235231.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Step measurement with a second person </h2><ol><li>  For a more accurate measurement, you need to undress.  After that, put on tight leggings or tights.  Measurements on regular clothing may not be accurate enough. </li><li>  Ask you to help a friend or acquaintance. </li><li>  Go to the wall, lean on it in order to stand completely straight, and keep your posture.  If you bend at least a little, the measurement will be inaccurate.  Take a paper tablet or thin hardcover book. </li><li>  Place it strictly perpendicular to the wall between the legs (as tight as possible to the pubic bone). </li><li>  Ask your assistant to place the edge of the tailor's tape on the top of the book near the crotch and thigh. </li><li>  Lower the tape along your leg to the floor. <div class="photo" data-original="www.oasisamor.org" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.oasisamor.org/what-is-inseam-on-jeans/pictures-of-what-is-inseam-on-jeans-how-to-measure-your-inseam/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Step Seam Measurement" class="if uuid-2235602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2235602.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  This is the second way to measure a step seam.  If all measurements have been carried out accurately, then this option gives the most correct values. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  Depending on what clothes you want to sew and its purpose, the length of the inner seam will vary.  For example, a close-fitting leg leg leg will be smaller than suit pants. </p><p>  If you plan to wear pants with stilettos or winter boots, the seam will be 5-10 centimeters longer, depending on the height of the heels. </p><p>  Shorts and breeches, respectively, have a step seam shorter than pants. </p><p>  If you are interested in how to measure a step seam in overalls, then the sequence of actions and methods will be similar to that of ordinary trousers. </p>
