Routing: tips, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The cost of portable devices that can interact with the signals of navigation satellites has decreased so much that even schoolchildren have gadgets with <span>GPS (Global Positioning System)</span> .  It is not surprising that their owners want to know how to properly use the capabilities incorporated into the device. </p><h2>  Luxury or necessity </h2><p>  There is still an opinion that a navigator is necessary, first of all, for those people who, by the nature of their work, are forced to drive a car. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="    " class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/710415.jpg" title="" width="398"></div>  Taxi drivers, truckers, private carriers - all of them without satellite navigation are quite difficult to navigate in the streets, roads and cities.  Of course, you can expand the paper sheet card and look for the addressee.  But if you have access to a modern navigation device and know how to get directions to Navitel, you can solve this problem much faster.  Pedestrians also often have to resort to GPS.  For example, sometimes only the exact address is known, but not its location on the city map.  In this case, knowing how to set a route to Navitel, you can easily pave the most optimal way.  This opportunity is indispensable for those people who first visited this village.

First you need to do the preparation.  For the navigation program to work, it must have access to maps of the country or area where the route is planned.  If various Internet services of a similar orientation (Google Maps) constantly load the necessary data from the Web, then Navitel, on the contrary, uses the appropriate files from the device‚Äôs flash drive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="    " class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/710418.jpg" title="" width="425"></div>  The advantage of this approach is obvious - complete freedom from Internet providers while traveling.  If you are in another country or in an area where there is no access to the Network, this is a decisive factor in favor of Navitel.

    <p>  There are several ways to get maps for GPS navigators.  The easiest way is to purchase a device where they are already preinstalled.  This is a fairly common practice and, admittedly, effective.  Having bought such a solution, you can be sure that everything will work without failures and various incompatibilities.  You can also purchase the licensed Navitel program and a map of Russia directly on the developer's website for just 800 r. </p><p>  The next option is to download the appropriate files from the Internet.  The source can be both the developer's site and third-party resources.  Nm7 files (new version) must be placed in NavitelContent / Maps. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Satellite Tracking Activation </h2><p>  It is not enough to download maps and run the program.  The device must be connected to navigation satellites.  In most highly specialized navigators, the GPS function is always activated.  But communicators require the inclusion of this feature.  In Android systems, you need to lower the curtain and click on the satellite image - GPS. </p><h2>  Satellites </h2><p>  After the initialization of the navigation program, a <span>dialog box</span> will be displayed allowing the user to decide whether to use the Internet service about the current state of traffic jams.  This is a very useful feature, but it requires a network connection, which is not always possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="    " class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/710419.jpg" title="" width="600"></div>  If everything is done correctly, an image of a map with roads and objects will appear on the screen.  Also a prerequisite for the operation of the navigator is the "capture" of satellites.  In the upper bar of the menu of the program "Navitel" there is an image of a <span>satellite dish.</span>  If it is red, it means that the device has no communication with the satellite or the function is disabled.  The yellow color indicates that the signal is caught, but for some reason it is impossible to work with it.  And finally, the green color of the image is a signal that everything is fine and then you can figure out how to set a route to Navitel.  Cloudy skies, the roof of a building or car, poor location - all these are the reasons that satellites and the device will not be able to communicate.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Among the not very successful models can be noted Prestigio GeoVision 350, which has too flimsy connector for an external antenna.  Also "famous" Mio C520, not responding quickly enough to a change of direction.  And finally, judging by the reviews, the BBK N3501 discharges the battery too quickly.  The same can be said of Chrome 1010, which eats a charge of minutes in 40. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="    " class="if" height="481" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/710416.jpg" title="" width="600"></div>  The Explay ROAD model is a "pig in a poke", as one comes across an excellent batch, and the other - a frank marriage.

    <p>  Of the good ones, it is worth noting the <span>Garmin Dakota 20</span> - lightweight, small in size, downloading updates, and supporting flash drives.  Also great solutions are iMap and iTrex20.  In general, the most common indicator is the cost of the device.  Junk prices are a reason to think about the quality and performance of the navigator. </p><h2>  Starting point determination </h2><p>  After the satellite signal is registered, data is matched and a dot appears on the displayed map - the current position of the device.  Depending on a number of factors, an error of several tens of meters is possible.  From this moment, you can begin to pave the desired path.  Since this stage is very important, it is recommended to provide the device with reliable communication with the satellite, at least for the first time leaving the shelter (roof), or to install it near the window itself. </p><h2>  Direct indication </h2><p>  There are several ways to get directions to Navitel.  The simplest of them is to indicate the points of the beginning of the path and its end.  In the desired location of the card, you need to put a label (most conveniently, if the device supports touch input) and press the Cursor button in the lower menu that appears.  Next, ‚Äústretch‚Äù the terrain to the destination and put another mark.  The street name and the ‚ÄúLet's Go‚Äù button will appear below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="  gps " class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/710417.jpg" title="" width="600"></div>  After clicking on it, Navitel will show on the map the proposed route, the length of the path and the distance to the nearest turn.  It also shows the speed of movement.

    <h2>  Additional opportunity </h2><p>  However, it‚Äôs not enough just to know how to get directions to Navitel.  This navigation program has another great opportunity - to calculate the estimated time of arrival based on the speed of movement.  To do this, click on the menu button (in new versions, three parallel white stripes on a green background) and select ‚ÄúRoute‚Äù.  A screen with data on the time for the road, the distance and the remaining path will be displayed.  In addition, you can visually assess how much is passed.  It is recommended to use this feature - in many cases it is indispensable. </p><h2>  Exact indication </h2><p>  The next way, which is most often used by those who are just learning how to get directions to Navitel, is to directly indicate the destination.  It is often known where to go, right down to the house, entrance and floor numbers.  In this case, to lay the path, you need to click on the "Menu" button and select "Route".  Further, everything is very simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt=" " class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/710421.jpg" title="" width="600"></div>  Clicking on the ‚ÄúCreate Route‚Äù item will open a dialog where you need to select ‚ÄúBy Address‚Äù.  Having indicated the country, city, street and building, it remains to activate the navigator with the "Let's Go" button.

      <p></p>
    <p>  If you want to fill the car with fuel, eat yourself, withdraw money from an ATM or something else, then you need to choose not the "By Address" item, but "Nearest - Cursor".  The path to the specified institution will be paved. </p><h2>  Making settings </h2><p>  Before using the navigation program, it is recommended to make certain adjustments to the algorithm of its operation.  Having pressed ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù, you need to proceed to ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù and select ‚ÄúNavigation‚Äù.  Here you need to specify the <span>type of transport;</span>  decide whether it is permissible to drive on <span>dirt roads</span> and opt for short or reliable routes.  In the "Online Services" section, you can configure <span>automatic updates,</span> synchronization and other services that require access to the Internet.  The ability to make adjustments should not be ignored. </p><h2>  Save way </h2><p>  Sometimes it becomes necessary to make the path along which the movement was made available during other sessions.  Navitel allows this to be realized.  If during the movement the program is closed, then after it is restarted, it will be proposed to continue moving along the previously indicated route or abandon it. </p>

You need to open ‚ÄúRoute - Route Properties‚Äù, click on the lower icon and select ‚ÄúExport‚Äù.  If it is necessary to restore it, there is another team here - ‚ÄúImport‚Äù.

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  And finally, one can not help but say how to save the route to Navitel using direct recording.  At the beginning of the movement, you need to click on the image of the cassette, which activates the saving of the track.  Upon arrival, a second press disables the recording.  There will be a purple stripe on the map ‚Äî the route. </p><h2>  Gemini, but so different </h2><p>  New versions of the Navitel program are constantly appearing.  Some features are disappearing, and in return they are offered updated.  Management methods on the Android and Win CE systems albeit slightly, but vary.  Maps of different versions are not compatible with each other.  Thus, there is no universal solution to any problem associated with the navigation program. </p>
