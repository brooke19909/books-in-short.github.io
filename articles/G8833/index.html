New Moscow is currently attractive to developers and buyers.  But it is unlikely that anyone will refuse an apartment located in the very center of the capital, in the region of the third transport ring.  So where exactly is the Maryina Grove residential complex? </p><p>  Object address: Moscow, 4th St.  Maryina Roshcha, d. 3. From the house to the metro station of the same name, only 3 minutes walk, if necessary, 10 minutes you can walk to <span>the metro station "Riga".</span>  Near the house there are stops of public land transport, from where you can get to anywhere in the capital. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
