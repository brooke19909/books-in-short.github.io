    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are offered at the a la carte hotel restaurant.  It serves visitors like a buffet - a long counter with many options of dishes will satisfy the taste of the most sophisticated gourmet - everything is cooked tasty and satisfying.  In any case, the reviews on food and service in the TUI Magic Life Belek Hotel 5 * restaurant (TUI Magic Life, Belek, 5 stars) are the best.  The highlight of the hotel is themed dinners: Alpine, Italian, Glance, Asian, surf and turf and many others.  There is an opportunity to get to know different cuisines of the world firsthand.  However, an alternative is always present - the most conservative in food people will certainly find something for themselves from traditional European cuisine. </p><p>  In the intervals between the main meals, the hunger does not threaten the vacationers either - there is another bar near the pool where you can have a drink and a snack.  You can eat more densely at the beach bar.  Another bar is open until late at a local disco.  Each of these establishments offers its own culinary products - you can choose what you like best.  An important point: the restaurant has a special children's menu.  If your baby is naughty and very picky in food, then the dishes from this menu will definitely suit him.  In addition, the owners of the complex arranged a special children's corner with small tables and chairs, beautifully and brightly decorated - the kids love it very much. </p>

    <p>  Many people like the animation - everything is organized at the highest level, excellent dancers and actors.  Always fun and interesting.  Disco every day, so you won’t be bored at night either, which is often the fear of young people.  They also organize dance courses: latin and oriental dances.  Live music often sounds on the beach, where there are also many who wish to dance. </p><p>  However, in any place you can find something bad along with good - you will not please everyone.  What one likes - for example, a large area with many buildings, for others it looks like a negative: you can get lost, they say.  But is this a flaw ?!  Already on the second day, tourists are usually perfectly oriented in the area and easily find everything they need.  Moreover, there is no need to go around the territory for two, the administration takes care of your feet - there is a mini-transport on which you can get to anywhere in the territory for free. </p>

    <p>  Another feature of the hotel, which is noted in the reviews of TUI Magic Life Belek Hotel, is that there are a lot of vacationers who speak German.  There are opinions that they are met better than the Russians.  In fact, the rules are the same for everyone, and the comfort of TUI Magic Life Belek Hotel all inclusive corresponds to the cost of the selected room.  Some, for the same reason, advise them to go on vacation in the fall, explaining that the attitude at this time is better due to the outflow of German guests.  Separately, the reviews point out perfectly clean linen, just snow-white, and also mention the good quality of cleaning. </p><h2>  Rules of residence </h2><p>  The settlement of new arrivals is made from 14:30 local time.  You can register from the age of 18 or with parents.  Departure of departing persons lasts until 12:00.  The hotel provides extra beds for young children, up to 2 years old, a cot is available upon request for free.  For older children extra beds are not given.  The administration does not accept vacationers with pets. </p><p>  Some vacationers pay attention to the fact that you need to be careful on the beach with their things.  There have been cases of theft of towels.  There is nothing wrong with this, only that for some far from new towel you will have to pay out 15 euros later. </p>
