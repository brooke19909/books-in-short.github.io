Reviews, models, specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We have all heard about the Land Rover more than once.  Every time we see a beautiful SUV, which many dream of.  In addition, the car company has long been on the market and has achieved tremendous success in its niche.  For almost 70 years, the British have been creating masterpieces of the automotive industry.  But what does the Land Rover have to do with it - the phone?  He collected a few reviews, but still became popular in a narrow circle. </p><h2>  Feature </h2><p>  If these phones have become so popular, perhaps they have some kind of feature.  At first glance, the device does not look perfect, stylish and expensive.  When you look at the models of this line, remember the phones of 2006.  Then, too, one could come across huge push-button devices of elaborate shapes and unusual colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="land rover phone reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1528135.jpg"></div>

    <p>  So what can these models attract attention now?  After all, there is now a huge number of beautiful and sophisticated smartphones on the market.  It turns out that the manufacturer of Land Rover phones has created a truly indestructible gadget. </p><p>  So, the main feature of the smartphone is its safety.  Each phone of the company is not only shockproof, it is also waterproof and designed for use by these extremals.  In addition, the Land Rover shockproof phone is also a powerful gadget.  Some models have up to 8 processor cores, as well as a well-developed system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Diversity </h2><p>  Of course, phones of this brand can not boast of a huge variety of models.  However, among them there are real flagships that are popular.  For example, a Land Rover X8 phone or two powerful models - A8 and A9. </p><p>  There are among the expensive and budget models.  For example, Land Rover S6 can be bought for only 4-5 thousand rubles.  Also, in addition to the fact that the company represents long-forgotten push-button telephones, the Land Rover swung at the return of previously popular ‚Äúclamshells‚Äù, or flips.  So here we can take the popular X9 model. </p><h2>  Indestructible </h2><p>  The first in our review will be the device, which received eight cores for its filling.  The Land Rover X8 was greeted with skepticism.  Prior to this, users got acquainted with the A9 model, which promised all 8 cores, but testing showed that there are half as many of them. </p><p>  Therefore, when the Chinese again loudly announced the eight cores, no one expected that the promises would be fulfilled.  But it so happened that the company did not deceive.  The device really works on 8 cores and confirms its name. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Speaking about the appearance of the X8 model, it turns out to affect almost all the devices of this Chinese company.  The fact is that style can be traced in all models.  This one also turned out to be stylish, original and quite universal.  Of course, such a whopper cannot be put in a woman‚Äôs handbag.  And not because it does not fit in - just there it will be completely out of place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone land rover clamshell" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1528137.jpg"></div>

Moreover, it looks pretty good with both casual clothes and business suits.  He again received a black and yellow scale.  To some, of course, it seems too pretentious, but the overall impression is quite pleasant. </p><h2>  Top level defense </h2><p>  Like any other smartphone of this company, the Land Rover (phone) received the best reviews about security.  According to the documentation, it has moisture and dust resistance.  Under water, it works much longer than the current flagships from Sony.  The smartphone is certified, and in addition to the IP68 standard, has a military protection MIL-STD 810G.  Thanks to her, he is not afraid of shock, will survive falls, temperature changes, various changes in pressure, vibration and even interaction with chemicals. </p><p>  Of course, the company's style is confirmed by materials.  The phone uses durable shock-resistant plastic, which together with rubber inserts protects the device.  On the side there are rubberized ribbed elements.  Thus, the smartphone is comfortable and safe to hold in your hands. </p><p>  Structurally, the phone consists of three parts, like its previous counterpart.  Panels that hold thanks to 12 screws are attached to the hardware front and back.  The battery cannot be removed, but it is possible to get to the compartment with a SIM and a memory card.  For safety and waterproof, the headphone and charging jacks are covered with a durable rubber plug. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  It is worth saying that this Land Rover phone, whose price is about 25 thousand rubles, also has quite convincing technical specifications.  With all its security, do not forget about the eight cores that make it a competitive smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Land Rover x8 phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1528134.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The model is supported by the <span>Mediatek MT6592</span> chipset <span>.</span>  The cores have a clock frequency of 1.7 GHz.  RAM is 2 GB, which is a fairly standard indicator.  There is only 16 GB of internal memory.  But it can be expanded with a memory card.  Such characteristics allow you to run even quite demanding games.  The phone can play 4K video. </p><p>  A sufficiently powerful 3800 mAh battery was also prepared for this device.  Of course, his brothers have higher indicators, but 4.7 inches for the screen is quite enough for a long time.  As practice shows, the user can charge the smartphone every 2-3 days. </p><p>  Android 4.4.2 is responsible for the operating system.  It is practically ‚Äúclean‚Äù here.  No additional software and applications.  There is a standard package from Google and the necessary utilities.  A distinctive feature of the model are pre-installed travel software: pedometer, compass, altimeter, etc. </p><h2>  Back to the past </h2><p>  A follower of the previous model was the Land Rover X9.  The phone takes us back to the past.  He got a flip shape.  It looks very interesting.  Despite the fact that it has a completely different look than the X8, it still remains the same protected and equipped, but a little cheaper. </p><p>  It is also worth mentioning the presence of the usual variations of this model.  This one is more located towards the female hand.  It has a black color and interesting pink and gold accents.  The shape and dimensions remained almost the same as the X8. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="land rover x9 phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1528132.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Land rover x9 </h2><p>  It is worth saying a few words about this model.  Despite the fact that it is a continuation of the last generation, it no longer has 8 cores.  There are only 4, but they work together with the Qualcomm processor.  The amount of memory remained unchanged.  The display size has changed - 5 inches.  The battery has undergone changes.  Despite the increased screen size, it became 200 mAh smaller, which, of course, will negatively affect the device‚Äôs activity. </p><p>  Protective changes did not affect the smartphone.  It is still dustproof, can work under water for a long time.  It is also resistant to falling from a height of more than 5 meters.  It can withstand external pressure up to four hundred kilograms.  Does not respond to temperature changes, a variety of chemicals.  In general, this aspect has remained unchanged. </p><p>  The main advantage of this model from the past is 4G support.  Most likely, this is why this Land Rover phone, the price of which fluctuates around 30 thousand rubles, has become popular among users. </p><h2>  Cot </h2><p>  But the second variation of this model is generally ideal for women.  It does not look bulky, has an interesting black and orange color.  Lies comfortably in a hand and fits in a trouser pocket.  In general, the Land Rover phone-folding bed for fans of this company is not a surprise.  X9 Flip has become a logical continuation of the line. </p><p>  Compared with the previous model, this one received increased security.  Now the battery cover is securely bolted, rubber plugs on the connectors and the ability to answer a call without opening the cover.  Now on the front panel of the closed phone there are buttons for this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="land rover phone Price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1528136.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Protective properties remained the same.  Although the company was reinsured in case of failure, as the very rubber plugs are talking about.  Otherwise, the phone cannot be drowned, crushed, crushed, or dissolved in acid. </p><h2>  Generosity </h2><p>  In general, the Land Rover X9 - the phone is very generous.  This is especially true for the flip version.  The fact is that two batteries are available to the buyer, whose capacity is 16800 mAh.  Now it is difficult to say whether this is a real volume, nevertheless, the manufacturer claims such indicators.  Also new was the delivery of a set of headphones.  So, finding the adapter will no longer be a problem. </p><h2>  Without changes </h2><p>  The rest of the phone "Land Rover Flip" 8 and 9 modifications have common features.  Both devices have two screens.  External serves to inform, internal - touch, work.  The phone can work with two SIM cards.  The camera here is one, rather weak - only 3 megapixels.  Among other things, there are other functions that you will need for daily use. </p><p>  It is worth saying that there is no operating system, so this is not a smartphone, but a regular cellular one.  But to launch various primitive toys, organizer, radio is possible.  As well as using widgets, calendar, passwords, calculator, alarm clock, etc. </p><h2>  Flagship </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the Land Rover clamshell phone is not a smartphone.  But almost all other models of the company can be safely called flagships.  One of the leaders is Land Rover A8. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone land rover flip" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1528133.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Everyone who has ever held this gadget in their hands can safely call it courageous.  It really is suitable only for men and boys.  By the way, the smartphones of this company really will appeal to children who always drop their devices from the stairs, into the water, etc.  After all, the main distinguishing feature of the device remains safety. </p><p>  Land Rover A8 appeared in 2014.  He collected a lot of positive reviews, as it is considered a powerful and strong device.  Despite its fairly compelling specifications and high protection, it has a reasonable price.  The model is considered affordable, but not budgetary. </p><h2>  The appearance of a man </h2><p>  First of all, this "Land Rover" phone received reviews about its "appearance."  And this is not surprising.  After all, such freaks on the smartphone market are rare.  This, at first glance, a toy device in life seems to be a military gadget.  It is heavy, its dimensions for the modern user are also large. </p><p>  The first thing you want to download when you get acquainted with the model is ‚Äúbrick‚Äù.  Especially the model in black.  With yellow trim, it looks a little more sophisticated, although it still does not hide its dimensions.  All external parts are in place. </p><p>  The screen here is only 4 inches.  With him, of course, it is uncomfortable to watch movies or read books.  Therefore, we can say that this is not a toy, but a business apparatus. </p><h2>  Insides </h2><p>  But in terms of filling, this ‚ÄúLand Rover‚Äù (phone) received average reviews.  There is only a dual-core professor MT6572.  The Mali video chip is very budget.  RAM is currently negligible here - 512 MB.  Built-in enough for a couple of tunes and photos - 4 GB. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shockproof phone land rover" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1528138.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Of course, the smartphone is not super powerful.  Still very comfortable.  It can easily be used in everyday life for simple tasks: see the calendar, time, check mail or social networks. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  It should be understood that any Land Rover phone is aimed only at an audience that does not know how or does not want to be neat with current smartphones.  These models have unique maximum protection.  They are not afraid of overheating or hypothermia.  They work comfortably under water.  Therefore, if you decide to buy a Land Rover phone, do not rely on technical superpowers. </p>
