    <p>  About the author of this titanic work, the average person usually knows nothing but a name.  It is time to fill this gap and learn about the fate of this greatest linguist. </p><h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  <span>The biography of</span> Sergey <span>Ozhegov</span> originates on September 22, 1900.  He was born in the village of Kamennoye, Tver province.  To date, the settlement has grown and received the status of a city, whose name is Kuvshinovo.  The creative path of Sergey Ivanovich Ozhegov began in the family of a technologist of a cardboard factory.  The ancestors of the linguist were artisans and representatives of the clergy.  Mother worked as a midwife in a local hospital. </p><p>  The house in which the scientist was born and raised has been preserved to this day.  A memorial plaque reminds one who lived in the building several decades ago. </p>

    <p>  For this enormous work, by the date of the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of the scientist, a special prize was established A.S.  Pushkin. </p><p>  And it all started with the fact that in 1935 a number of linguists began to create a single dictionary that would simplify the use of the Russian language.  As it turned out later, the scientist moved to Moscow, including in order to participate in the creation of a huge volume. </p><p>  Very quickly Ozhegov became an assistant and right-handed project manager - Dmitry Nikolayevich Ushakov.  Besides the fact that the writers were colleagues, they also became good friends. </p><p>  The result of tremendous work was four volumes of the explanatory dictionary.  Sergei Ivanovich‚Äôs Peru owns more than thirty percent of the total number of articles.  In the future, he himself led the project. </p>
