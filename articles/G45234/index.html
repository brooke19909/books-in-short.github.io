  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Professional walkie-talkies: review, specifications, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The work of rescue teams, law enforcement agencies and various security services requires high-quality and constant communication of employees.  Professional walkie-talkies, in comparison with amateur ones, have a wider range of functions that are necessary when working in extreme conditions.  Unlike a mobile phone, the walkie-talkie guarantees a faster and more stable connection, and this is extremely important in the work of rescuers or police. </p><h2>  Models and Types </h2><p>  Radio stations are divided by type into: </p><ul><li>  amateur radio (unlicensed radios); </li><li>  professional (portable). </li></ul><p>  We‚Äôll talk about professional in more detail.  They occupy the largest share of radio communications and include: </p><ul><li>  automobile; </li><li>  sea; </li><li>  aviation; </li><li>  other specialized models. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.securitas.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Professional focus" class="if uuid-2843484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2843484.jpg"></div><p>  Such walkie-talkies are characterized by high characteristics, huge functionality, communication quality and reliability.  All portable models are equipped with a wide range of optional accessories: batteries, chargers, carrying cases, a headset and much more. </p><h2>  Characteristic </h2><p>  Modern professional walkie-talkies are manufactured in accordance with the international military standards MIL STD 810. Their case is one-piece, the panel is made of shockproof plastic, and the buttons are hidden by rubber, tight-fitting gaskets that prevent the ingress of dust, water and dirt into the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, walkie-talkies for professionals: </p><ul><li>  have a minimum of keys and control buttons (volume control, channel selector and several auxiliary buttons); </li><li>  independent of ambient weather conditions (heat, vibration or frost); </li><li>  fully computer programmable. </li></ul><p>  The cost of such radio communications is usually higher.  This is primarily due to the fact that their functionality and design must be at the highest level and provide: </p><ul><li>  clarity of voice transmission; </li><li>  smooth operation; </li><li>  ergonomic design; </li><li>  simple and logical control; </li><li>  small dimensions and weight. </li></ul><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Like any other equipment, professional walkie-talkies have their own technical limitations and nuances.  For example, for stable high-quality communication, not only the receiver, but also the radio transmitter must have sufficient power to transmit the radio signal.  That is why powerful radios are now very popular, providing the ability to exchange voice messages over long distances. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oleep.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The lineup" class="if uuid-2843493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2843493.jpg"></div><p>  Professional walkie-talkies, according to user reviews, have much more advantages than disadvantages.  It is very convenient to use personal radio stations while fishing or hunting.  This is due to the fact that the walkie-talkie allows you to communicate simultaneously with all members of the group. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, walkie-talkies are often used in hard-to-reach places, far from the city, where an ordinary mobile phone will not be able to help.  Portable radios for cars or hunting have a much higher response speed, and some models can be used without removing from your pocket.  Such equipment has a whole range of unique technical characteristics, and this in turn contributes to their widespread use among rescuers, special services or security agencies. </p><p>  Next, we offer a small overview of professional walkie-talkies with their characteristics and reviews. </p><h2>  Walkie talkie Turbosky </h2><p>  This model compares favorably with others and superbly combines modern technical specifications and a wide selection of functionality. </p><p>  In their reviews, users note the presence of a flashlight, which is extremely necessary in the dark. </p><p>  The "Turbosky T9" radio supports an FM radio operating in the frequency range 88-108 MHz. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novicom.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Turbosky T9 Station" class="if uuid-2843506" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2843506.jpg"></div><p>  The emergency alarm function will help you contact the emergency services. </p><p>  When switching channels, a sound notification of the channel number is heard.  The station is equipped with a button for setting up quick access functions.

It is made on the principle of "reliable, just inexpensive."  Conforms to world standards of use.  Other manufacturers do not have analogues with similar dimensions.  Kenwood used its early audio designs to optimize the frequency components of the voice, so the sound is output over ambient noise.  And companion and noise reduction enhancements provide low distortion and clarity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="radioua.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best models" class="if uuid-2843494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2843494.jpg"></div><p>  Included with the station is an antenna with a lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 1130 mA / h and a charger with an accelerated charging cycle.
