    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Cretan Malia Park is located in the resort town, which is located in the northernmost part of the Cretan island.  And he is called Malia.  The city is located 30 kilometers from Heraklion.  There is the nearest airport.  About the same distance from Malia is Hersonissos.  This is where people come who want to plunge headlong into the vibrant nightlife of Crete.  Malia itself was once the town of the Minoan ancient state.  And now it is a popular resort. </p><p>  The hotel is located 1.5 kilometers from its center.  Right on the beach.  Which, by the way, has been awarded <span>the</span> EU <span>Blue Flag</span> for more than ten years in a row. </p><p>  The hotel itself can be seen from afar.  The whole complex seems to be surrounded by greenery.  By the way, this is one of the most pleasant "highlights" of the hotel - its park area.  The hotel itself was built in 1989, but since then it has undergone two repairs.  The latter ended a few years ago.  Therefore, in the apartments and in the hotel itself, everything looks very beautiful and modern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Infrastructure and Services </h2><p>  Cretan Malia Park is a fully developed hotel in all plans.  On its territory there are many useful and necessary services.  Everything is here.  The reception is open 24 hours a day, so individual check-in is available.

There is a currency exchange, newsstand, business center, doctor‚Äôs office, laundry and dry cleaning. </p><p>  Naturally, the hotel has free Wi-Fi.  A mini market, shops, smoking areas, newspapers and packed lunches are all here too.  By the way, more amenities are offered for people who have problems with their physical capabilities. </p><p>  And the last advantage is multilingual staff.  The people working here are not only fluent in English and Greek.  They also speak Russian (which is important), French, German and Dutch. </p>

    <h2>  For leisure </h2><p>  In Cretan Malia Park, in addition to the pool, which is in the territory of each hotel, there are conditions for various entertainments.  Here you can do aerobics or table tennis (a full-fledged court is also equipped), play beach volleyball, water polo, or go windsurfing.  It is possible to rent a canoe.  Or order tours to the local botanical garden at the reception and go there, enjoy the amazing beauty of nature. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  They also conduct cooking classes (teach the secrets of Greek cuisine).  If this is not to your liking, guests can work out in the gym, play billiards, go for a massage or simply sunbathe on the terrace.  Many just rent bicycles, and then leave in this convenient vehicle to explore the surroundings and local attractions.  No one will be bored while on vacation at the Cretan Malia Park Hotel. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  Many decide to take their kids with them on holiday to Cretan Malia Park 4 *.  Reviews allow you to make sure that this is a good solution.  For children, this hotel has all the necessary facilities.  Namely - a playground and a mini club.  The last of these is a wooden cozy house with air conditioning and entertainment for kids.  There are animators, educators who deal with children.  But only babies under 4 years old are allowed only with their parents. </p><p>  The playground, by the way, has a fence, which is very good.  There are swings, a slide, a water cooler and even a toilet.  And, of course, toys.  In addition, the beach is a very convenient entry for children.  For lovers of depth, this, of course, is not at hand, since they won‚Äôt be able to immediately enter the water and swim, but swimming with the kids is convenient there.  By the way, the hotel has small and shallow pools for them. </p>

    <h2>  Main restaurant </h2><p>  This wonderful hotel has several facilities where you can enjoy great food.  And each one is special in its own way.  Take, for example, the main restaurant.  Breakfast is served there from 7:30 until 10:00.  And guests can enjoy themselves not only in the "buffet".  There is still a so-called American buffet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is a brunch, it lasts for half an hour after the main.  Continental dishes are served.  And then - lunch.  Begins from 12:30 and lasts until 14:30.  There is a buffet, but even here guests can enjoy open cooking for them.  However, for this you need to order the all-inclusive service when booking.  The same goes for dinner.  Only it starts at 18:30, and ends at 21:00.  Guests who were here in the midst of the holiday season are advised to come 20 minutes later - then you will be able to avoid the queues. </p><p>  By the way, there is a dress code.  People should come here dressed in elegant casual wear.  It is also worth knowing that every two weeks there are four thematic dinners - Greek, Mexican, as well as Mediterranean and Asian.  Still, if guests plan to be absent all day, they are better off ordering a lunch basket.  Only this must be done the day before, at 8 pm, at the reception. </p>

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  In the end - a little more detail about what Cretan Malia Park receives reviews.  Guests resting here first of all tell about the location.  The hotel was not located in Malia, but not far from it, which is a plus - because the suburbs are much quieter and calmer.  And also here is a green, park territory, which is rare in many other places. </p><p>  Tourists are advised to be more careful when entering the water.  Yes, there is sand, but there are also large stones on which sea urchins can "rest".  And if you step on them, it will be extremely unpleasant. </p><p>  There is a bus stop nearby, bus travel to the cities of Crete and the airport costs 4 euros per person.  By the way, you should devote one day to travel to nearby attractions. </p><p>  Pleases are the courteous and polite staff, as well as the attentive administration.  If in advance, before arrival, contact them and ask for a certain number (with a specific view or increased sound insulation), then everything will be done in the best possible way.  The same goes for early settlement.  Although, this administration can not guarantee in high season.  Room can be provided only when it is released. </p><p>  By the way, this is rarely prescribed in the conditions, but guests say that the rooms have a kettle, and every day the maids bring cream, sugar, coffee and tea for free.  The rooms are cleaned well, and towels and linen are changed every two days. </p><p>  If you need to buy something, you can go to the hotel‚Äôs mini-market.  Although, there is a large store nearby.  Everything is relatively inexpensive there. </p><p>  To summarize, we can say with confidence: this hotel is perfect for relaxation.  This complex is best suited for families with children.  But, in principle, everyone here can relax and enjoy delicious food, good service and the sea.  Reviews confirm this. </p>
