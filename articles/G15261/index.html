The calling card is the <span>Vorontsov Palace.</span>  Its unique feature is that it combines several architectural styles and trends.  The construction is a palace complex created in the 19th century.  Its construction was carried out during the years 1828-1848.  under the leadership of Prince Vorontsov.  The palace has an unusual layout: the north facade is made in the style of English Gothic, while the south is built with elements of Indian culture.  If you look at the building from the western side, then it is perceived as a European medieval castle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alupka sights photo" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/218346.jpg" width="600"></div>

The sights of this settlement also include Alupka Park, which covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã40 hectares.  If you divide it according to stylistic features, then it has two parts: regular and landscape.  The regular part includes the territory located closer to the palace, and the southern terraces.  The rest is landscape.  On its territory grows about 200 species of trees.  <span>Alupka Park</span> today is a complex of cascades, waterfalls and lakes that complement each other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alupka crimea attractions" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/218348.jpg" width="554"></div>

    <p>  Walking around such a city as Alupka, whose sights are so numerous, do not forget to visit the ruins of the fortress on Cross Mountain.  It rises surrounded by a pine forest.  It will be interesting to visit the Foros Church, which is considered the pearl of the southern coast of Crimea.  This structure is located not in the city itself, but in its environs on the Red Rock.  The building was built in a romantic style, consists of 2 tiers.  In addition, it has 9 domes.  A unique feature of this church is the patterned porch.  No less impressive is the internal beauty: carved oak iconostasis, Italian mosaic, <span>Byzantine ornament.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alupka crimea attractions" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/218347.jpg" width="549"></div>

    <p>  But this is not all the attractive buildings that Alupka is famous for. <strong> </strong>  Attractions (photo <strong> </strong>  presented above) cannot be fully described in words.  For example, the beauty of such a structure as the Yusupov Palace must be seen with your own eyes.  The building was built in the style of a modernized Italian Renaissance.  A distinctive feature of the interior are chairs, small corner sofas and other elements of the Art Nouveau style.  All entrances to the building, stairs and arches are decorated with marble <span>sculptures of ancient Greek</span> mythology.  From all sides the palace is surrounded by marble pools.  In the courtyard there are beautiful fountains. </p><p>  In addition to the architectural structures, there are also other interesting objects that can be seen while relaxing in the city of Alupka.  Attractions include various monuments, for example, a monument to the pilot Ametkhan Sultan, who was included in the list of the top ten military fighter pilots.  Not far from the bus station in a small park there is an obelisk of black marble on the grave of the Gavrilov brothers.  These are young underground workers who were executed in this city in 1942.  In addition, there are a number of religious buildings that deserve attention. </p>
