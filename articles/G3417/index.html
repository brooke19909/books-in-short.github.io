  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Varangian Guard. Army of the Byzantine Empire. Military History of the Middle Ages</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The Byzantine Empire,</span> becoming the heiress of the Great Roman Empire, extended from Italy to Asia Minor, including the territory of Greece and the Balkan Peninsula.  Her wealth and power irritated her neighbors, so she had to wage constant wars.  The Varangian Guard, special forces of the Ancient World, was rightfully considered the most combat-ready unit in the Byzantine army.  These were not just mercenaries.  Their experience, military traditions, discipline, loyalty and structure made these Varangians look like a military formation, as it is imagined by modern man.  However, first things first. </p><h2>  Varangians </h2><p>  First you need to answer the question of who the Vikings are.  This word came to the Greek language in the meaning of "Norwegian".  However, it should be understood that the educated Byzantines perfectly distinguished the Normans, the Vikings, the Russians and the Vikings.  They contacted the latter more often.  In addition, the first guard of the Varangians, or the Varangian guard of the emperor, was formed from the Vikings and the Russians.  They were sent as a gift from the prince as a sign of respect.  Some philologists say: the word ‚Äúvaranga‚Äù came from the ancient Scandinavian language and meant ‚Äúgift‚Äù.  But Tatishchev and Stralenberg were sure that the "Vikings" - a derivative of the word varg - "wolf" or "robber". </p><p>  Max Fasmer does not agree with these conclusions.  In his interpretation, the name "Varangians" comes from the ancient German word wara ("oath").  Varangians are warriors who have sworn an oath.  A rather bold statement, given that the military cultures of many peoples are full of sacred vows and rituals, but for some reason the Vikings must be singled out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In ancient Norwegian there is the word ‚Äúveral‚Äù, meaning unity, the ability to stand up not only for oneself, but also for one‚Äôs brother in arms.  Given the living conditions of such people and their priorities, it can be argued that this version also has a right to exist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nvg-rusland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Varangian Guard" class="if uuid-2522940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2522940.jpg"></div><p>  In general, the question of who the Vikings are remains open.  An analysis of historical sources also did not contribute to a consensus on this issue.  The Scandinavian annals of the Vikings are associated with military service in Byzantium.  Russian chronicles distinguish them as a separate nation, and the ‚ÄúRussian Truth‚Äù by Yaroslav the Wise consolidates their social status. </p><p>  There are many versions of the etymology of this word, and the debate is far from over. </p><h2>  The need for reliable warriors </h2><p>  The Byzantine emperor Vasily 2 the Bulgarian Slayer perfectly understood the danger inherent in the palace intrigues and rebellions of military governors.  The uprising of Varda Foki was so impressed with the basileus that he made a fateful decision to surround himself not just with reliable bodyguards, but also to create a self-sufficient military unit capable of crushing rebellion in any corner of a vast empire. </p><p>  Where to get such ‚Äúmiracle heroes‚Äù?  The emperor did not have high hopes for his Romans.  Roman culture, though giving birth to great warriors, but they were fundamentally vicious, corrupt.  It was decided to bet on the "barbarians".  Moreover, Vasily 2 had something to offer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The choice fell on the Kiev prince Vladimir Svyatoslavovich, the future baptist of Russia, whom the Russian Orthodox Church declared equal apostles (especially distinguished saints in the matter of converting peoples to the Christian faith and preaching the Gospel).  Chronicles and chronicles left a memory of him as a cruel sadist, rapist and murderer (the murder of not only his brother Yaropolk, but also the Polotsk prince Rogvolod with his sons, the rape of Rogneda right in front of his parents) and many other no less ‚Äúgreat‚Äù acts. </p><p>  At the same time, he provided military assistance more than once, perfectly understanding what the army of the Byzantine Empire was like.  Moreover, he was not afraid of her.  It was on such a person that the Byzantine emperor decided to lean. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geatland.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="who are the Vikings" class="if uuid-2522863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2522863.jpg"></div><h2>  Deal with the Kiev prince </h2><p>  Each party at the conclusion of certain agreements pursues its own goals.  Basileus urgently needed reliable warriors, since the military power of Constantinople was significantly reduced.  The throne staggered.  Vladimir Svyatoslavovich had two urgent problems: to strengthen his power over the Russian lands, and for this the monotheistic Christian religion, according to his idea, was best suited.  The second reason is to get rid of violent allies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The appearance of the Varangians in Byzantium was largely due to the fact that at one time they not only granted refuge to the disgraced Prince Vladimir, but also supported him in his fight against the Yaropolk.  Now the urgent need for them has disappeared.  Keeping in check well-trained, brave and strong warriors, accustomed to rob, kill, it became increasingly difficult. </p><p>  Soon Vladimir Svyatoslavovich actually proved that it was better to be friends with him.  When <span>Anna of the Byzantine</span> refused to marry him, the Prince of Kiev besieged Korsun (Chersonesos in Sevastopol).  There was a real threat that Constantinople would fall next to the ‚Äúdistribution‚Äù.  Naturally, in such conditions, the heart of the beauty softened.  The Russian lands, as officially presented, were baptized ‚Äúpeacefully,‚Äù and there was more by one equally apostolic saint.  But that's another story. </p><p>  Byzantium received a Varangian guard (6,000 selected warriors, formed from the Varangians and Russians sent from the Kiev prince) - one of the most experienced and skillful fighters on the planet.  Next, you need to pay attention to some issues related to their weapons and manner of battle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="byzantinemilitary.blogspot.com.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="byzantine guard" class="if uuid-2522924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2522924.jpg"></div><h2>  Sword and shield </h2><p>  Judging by archaeological data, swords were quite widely used.  This is usually a one-handed two-blade crucible steel blade.  His dol was located in the center.  The blade had an average of 80 cm in length and 5-6 cm in width.  Three quarters of its length are double-edged, and the last quarter was sharpened only on one side.  His hilt was short.  The distance between the guard and the top is 9 cm, sometimes reaching 10.5 cm. The weight in the early version was about 1 kg, and in the late - 3 kg. </p><p>  Judging by the design of the sword itself, the Varangian guard used it to inflict mostly chopping blows in the upper and lower levels.  The latter direction is more promising.  Legs, as a rule, did not have serious protection.  The main blood arteries are located there, if damaged, the enemy is guaranteed to fail in the shortest possible time. </p><p>  Most often come across round-shaped fist grip shields.  Their diameter was about 95 cm. Much less often, but nevertheless there are finds of brackets, rings for belt fastening of such protection on the shoulder.  But you can not consider the shield only as a means of protection.  They could be struck by the edges or just knock the enemy to the ground.  This method of battle was known back in Rome. </p><h2>  Battle axes </h2><p>  Very often, in one Viking burial, a sword and an ax are present at the same time.  There were two types of them.  The first type is a short one-handed with a small butt and a narrow blade.  The second type of battle ax was impressive, being a two-handed weapon.  This is the famous Danish ax, or bridex with crescent edges.  The width of the blade varied from 30 to 45 cm. An experienced fighter could easily tear down the enemy‚Äôs head with one blow.  The weapon was convenient to use at long and medium distances. </p><h2>  A spear </h2><p>  This is one of the most beloved ‚Äútools‚Äù of mercenaries in Byzantium.  It could be covered with a shield, delivering stabbing blows.  Such a lance-bearer could be covered by any shield-bearer, and with the coordination of actions their effectiveness increased.  The northern spear was 1.5 meters long.  Its wide tip was leaf-shaped. </p><p>  The trick of any tip of the spear was to stop, this simple "tuning" made it possible to quickly remove weapons from the body when stabbing the enemy.  The weight of such a spear was impressive.  It was convenient in hand-to-hand combat, but when throwing it caused certain inconvenience.  Therefore, throwing spears are worth mentioning separately.  They were shorter in length and had a narrow tip. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wargamesillustrated.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="army of the byzantine empire" class="if uuid-2522874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2522874.jpg"></div><h2>  Bow and arrows </h2><p>  To the small arms, the Varangian guard was highly respected, more than once convinced of its effectiveness.  Before converging in hand-to-hand fighting, the enemy was fired by arrows, darts.  Archery was not carried out aiming, but a canopy.  The tension, according to archaeologists, reached 40 kg.  At a short distance, such an archer could completely break through the chain mail. </p><p>  The stock of arrows was worn on the belt (usually about 40 pieces).  Depending on the tasks assigned to such a unit, arrowheads also varied.  Long and narrow was intended for a well-protected target, for example, it could be some kind of warrior in armor.  There were also assault, incendiary tips - they were much heavier than usual. </p><h2>  Perspectives of Service on the Emperor </h2><p>  The Byzantines would not be Byzantines if they did not know how to extract financial benefits from any situation.  Even when recruiting mercenaries into the ranks of their army, they managed to profit.  So, to get into the ranks of the Varangian Guard, it was necessary to pay a fee.  If the candidate had no funds, he could take a loan from the treasury or ask for help from fellow countrymen. </p><p>  On the other hand, his salary was 10 times higher than that of ordinary warriors.  From 40 to 70 grams of gold per month.  In addition to cash compensation, the guardsman received a share of military production.  And even this was not yet the limit of the generosity of employers.  On major church holidays gifts were to be relied upon, and if the emperor was dying, then the new government allowed him to enter the palace and take any thing he liked.  Such care for mercenaries was dictated by necessity.  They have long been proven effective in the battlefield. </p><p>  The second point - the most wealthy aristocrats themselves acquired their own armies, but the emperor‚Äôs soldiers should not only be well equipped, but only be faithful to him alone.  It was not only the guarantee of his survival, but also the retention of power. </p><p>  Therefore, the European nobility did not consider it shameful to join the Basileus army.  Having gained experience, upon returning home they could apply for higher posts.  The financial side of the issue was also very tempting.  And most importantly, such a leader was surrounded by contacts, useful contacts among the elite of one of the most influential states in the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.realmofhistory.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mercenaries in Byzantium" class="if uuid-2522883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2522883.jpg"></div><h2>  Scandinavian Mercenary Officers </h2><p>  The military history of the Middle Ages knows many examples of how the service of the Byzantine emperors became a wonderful springboard for the ambitious European commanders.  Some of them, like Harald Hartrad, later became a monarch. </p><p>  In the meantime, they gained experience through a harsh school of life.  Selected guardsmen and the junior commanders were called manglobits (from the word "manglobit", which means "club").  They really, besides swords with a golden handle, wore wooden batons.  The Manglobites were responsible for guarding the emperor. </p><p>  The next in importance can be considered spapharocides.  These were mid-level commanders.  Usually they had about 500 people subordinate.  Enough to complete any special tasks.  The Byzantine guard was very mobile.  Some contemporaries noticed one interesting feature: Russ moved mainly on the ground, and Scandinavian troops - on the water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Varangian guard" class="if uuid-2522910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2522910.jpg"></div><p>  Finally, Akoluf is considered the highest position.  He not only commands elite mercenary units.  If necessary, the whole army of Byzantium is reassigned to him.  The emperor's trust in officers with such a position was so great that they even left the keys to the city. </p><h2>  Fidelity and tradition </h2><p>  Not only material gain was the main motivation for such warriors.  Entire dynasties have developed, personally loyal to the shining person.  They were even ready to go to certain death for the sake of their master.  True, this fidelity played a cruel joke with them.  When the next palace coup rose, then after the victory and assassination of the monarch, such guardsmen were not spared.  Apparently, bearing in mind a certain proverb said about Andronicus Comnenus, but it is surprisingly suitable for all Byzantine monarchs: "The Emperor trusts only the dog by the bed, and the Varangian guard outside the door." </p><h2>  Secret police </h2><p>  The British once very accurately noticed the specifics of the Byzantine political culture, they called it that - ‚ÄúByzantine politics‚Äù.  At the same time, hinting at an endless series of various ingenious intrigues and political killings.  The Basileus quickly realized who could be entrusted with this important work - counterintelligence.  This already characterizes the mercenaries in Byzantium from the best side.  Because entrusting such events to ordinary thugs is more expensive for yourself.  Such matters required a delicate approach.  Guards coped with this task perfectly. </p><p>  Along the way, they were engaged in the elimination of political opponents, if the monarch suspected that one of his subordinates became excessively influential. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.realmofhistory.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Varangian Guard Special Forces of the Ancient World" class="if uuid-2522905" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2522905.jpg"></div><h2>  The beginning of the battle route of the Varangian Guard </h2><p>  April 13, 989 the first baptism of fire was sent to the corps of Russians and the Vikings who were with them.  They attacked the rebels suddenly.  Chronicles mention that the supporters of Varda Foki were so careless that they thought nothing about this beautiful morning except wine.  The Taurus-Scythian selective detachment, as Byzantine sources call it, most cruelly prevented this undertaking.  Those who did not die in a skirmish threw all the most valuable and tried to hide.  Someone was caught up, and some were released in shame.  This rebel squad was no longer a threat. </p><p>  This event can rightfully be considered the birth of the Byzantine guard. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="cT4FeLPHKFM" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT4FeLPHKFM" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/3/9/7/6/3976.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Centuries have passed.  Byzantium has long disappeared from the political map of the world.  But much remains imperishable.  For example, the memory of the Vikings in the service of the emperor.  They were remembered not only as dashing grunts, but also as warriors who above all value loyalty to their comrades and basileus.  For warriors, the word ‚Äúvalor‚Äù was not an empty phrase.  They did terrible things on the path to enrichment and fame, but only because historical realities required them to do so.  In their work, the Varangian guardsmen were the best, combining adventurism, strategic thinking and complete contempt for their enemies and death. </p>
