mutual investment funds.</span>  <span>There are others, but these are the most popular and at the same time considered the first step for investment.</span>  <span>Asset management of mutual investment funds is carried out by professionals who, as a rule, receive a certain percentage of income.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to choose, in favor of what to make a choice? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="investment asset management" class="if uuid-2742590" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2742590.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Assessment will help in this difficult task.</span>  <span>It is necessary in order to select exactly the asset that meets all the requirements of the investor.</span>  <span>It should be noted that the assessment procedure can give only a quantitative picture of the situation.</span>  <span>Therefore, it should not be limited to it.</span>  <span>So, if the potential profit is impressive, and the value of the asset is high, then this is not at all a guarantee of the success of investments.</span>  <span>For example, society may additionally negatively relate to it.</span>  <span>A similar thing is observed at the start of industries that poison the environment.</span> </p><h2>  Valuing an asset </h2><p>  <span>How to do it?</span>  <span>In short, the valuation of investment assets should be carried out according to the following principles:</span> </p><p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->  <span>1.</span> <!--[endif]-->  <span>Critical approach to the collection and analysis of information that will be used.</span> </p><p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->  <span>2.</span> <!--[endif]-->  <span>Carefully compare the results of the assessment with the statistical data of enterprises operating in the market.</span> </p><p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->  <span>3.</span> <!--[endif]-->  <span>To get the correct numbers, use several mathematical estimation methods.</span> </p><p>  <span>All this will not allow you to nullify the risk, but significantly reduce it - this is quite possible.</span>  <span>Among the methods you can advise to pay attention to:</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li><!-- [if !supportLists]-->  <span>assessment of conditional requirements;</span> </li><li><!-- [if !supportLists]-->  <span>discounted cash flows;</span> </li><li><!-- [if !supportLists]-->  <span>comparative.</span> </li></ul><h2>  A little about the specifics of different assets </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="investment fund asset management" class="if uuid-2742591" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2742591.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Each species has its own characteristics, due to which their reaction to various external and internal factors, information and news background, political statements and the like are different.</span>  <span>Therefore, the concept of diversification of the investment portfolio was invented.</span>  <span>In other words, it is necessary to have a variety of assets in order to reduce risks and minimize losses.</span>  <span>In this case, if something went wrong somewhere, then the possible losses will always be able to compensate for other investments.</span> </p><p>  <span>From this position, the so-called distressed assets are especially relevant.</span>  <span>They arise from business owners, securities, material forms of ownership due to financial difficulties or even bankruptcy.</span>  <span>Distressed investment assets are of interest if only because they sell them at a low price.</span>  <span>But working with them is better for experienced professionals who are knowledgeable about the market situation.</span>  <span>Indeed, it is highly probable that they will not receive profit, but only one loss (partial or full).</span> </p><h2>  A little more about classification </h2><p>  <span>Attentive readers may have noticed that the investment assets discussed earlier are divided on too general principles.</span>  <span>To understand what is being discussed, this approach will come down.</span>  <span>But for an in-depth study of the situation - no.</span>  <span>Therefore, other approaches are used.</span>  <span>For example, grouping assets into categories (also known as classes).</span>  <span>Here, stocks, bonds, raw materials and currency are highlighted.</span>  <span>Each asset class reacts differently to incoming economic news.</span>  <span>They can also be classified based on specific features.</span>  <span>For example, on a sectoral basis (energy companies, agricultural enterprises, and so on).</span>  <span>If you buy stocks in the financial markets, then they are considered as direct investments.</span>  <span>Whereas bonds are fixed income investments.</span>  <span>At the same time, real estate can be distinguished as a representative of an interesting situation.</span>  <span>Why?</span>  <span>The fact is that they are both a type of tangible assets and a category for investment.</span>  <span>And so it can go on for a very long time.</span> </p><h2>  Work with various attachments </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mutual fund asset management" class="if uuid-2742594" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2742594.jpg"></div><p>  <span>If uncorrelated assets are combined in one portfolio, then risk exposure in different markets is diversified.</span>  <span>This is due to the fact that the dynamics of their prices are rarely synchronous.</span>  <span>For example, if the value of stocks decreases, then the cost of raw materials does not always repeat this dynamics.</span>  <span>Moreover, different classes do not even react to the same news: some may grow, others may fall.</span>  <span>It should be noted that in conditions of economic downturns, problematic assets often arise.</span>  <span>Their value falls even in the absence of a correlation between them.</span>  <span>But at the same time, if there is no long experience, you should start small.</span>  <span>In this case, there are two approaches that should be paid attention in the first place: individual and collective professional.</span>  <span>Let's look at each of them.</span> </p><h2>  Individual investment </h2><p>  <span>In this case, you have to act independently, taking all responsibility, losses and income.</span>  <span>In the Russian Federation, for citizens who want to master this area, a preferential tool is called the ‚Äúindividual investment account‚Äù.</span>  <span>In the case of him, for example, tax breaks are provided.</span>  <span>This is done in order to interest more citizens.</span>  <span>For example, direct benefit in the most optimal case can reach several hundred thousand rubles - you must agree, this is very good.</span>  <span>The most popular reason for such investments is to increase savings.</span>  <span>This is achieved in two ways - by increasing the value of the property or paying interest on investment assets.</span>  <span>If we talk about abroad, then earnings on the price of stocks, bonds and other securities are very common there.</span>  <span>While interest is seen more as a pleasant addition.</span>  <span>Such accounting of investment assets is due to greater instability, therefore these two factors are more or less equal.</span> </p><h2>  Collective and professional investment </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interest investment asset" class="if uuid-2742596" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2742596.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Here, the best example is the activity of a <span>mutual investment fund</span> (Mutual <span>Investment Fund</span> ).</span>  <span>What is its essence?</span>  <span>There is a group of people who want to increase their capital.</span>  <span>But there is no desire to manage it.</span>  <span>In this case, they create an association (without registering a legal entity), deposit funds and transfer them to trust management for professionals.</span>  <span>They acquire the assets of an investment fund.</span>  <span>After a certain time period (usually a quarter), the results of operations are summarized, and all income (loss) is divided between the participants in proportion to their contributions.</span>  <span>Investment management of assets of this type has its risks (fraud, an incompetent specialist), but with proper care and careful selection, it is suitable for beginners.</span> </p><h2>  What do portfolios consist of? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="valuation of investment assets" class="if uuid-2742597" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2742597.jpg"></div><p>  <span>When this issue is resolved, the chosen strategy has a great influence: safe, moderate, risky.</span>  <span>Asset management of investment funds in the first case consists in investing in even not highly profitable,</span> but reliable instruments.  Usually - allowing to block inflation and bringing a few percent profit per year.  Moreover, the probability of loss is minimal.  Whereas a risky strategy involves investing in dangerous assets that could potentially bring big profits in the future.  Most of them are unsuccessful placements of funds.  But with a competent and successful approach, it is possible to find a project that allows you to ensure hundreds and thousands of percent of profit.  This is a desired goal for any investment <span>company.</span>  <span>An asset of</span> this quality can significantly improve the financial situation and get a significant gain.  But all this is accompanied by significant risk. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="asset investment company" class="if uuid-2742599" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2742599.jpg"></div><p>  <span>So it was examined what the main investment assets are, what specific divisions exist, how certain goals are achieved, individual moments of individual and collective activity and interaction.</span>  <span>This is quite enough to get a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe subject of the article.</span> </p>
