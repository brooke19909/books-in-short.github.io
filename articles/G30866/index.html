    <h2>  About the sea in Anapa in August </h2><p>  Reviews about family vacations with children in Anapa are the most positive.  Of course, the impression of him is purely individual for each vacationer, depending on who prefers what.  For some, medical procedures are more important, some are interested in sights, some are more interested in recreational activities, etc. In any case, the cleanliness of the sea and the conditions for a beach holiday excite absolutely all tourists.  After all, the main purpose of a trip over such considerable distances is to enjoy the splashing at sea and from sunbathing under the southern sun. </p><p>  These places are famous for the fact that in August the Anapa Sea literally blooms.  Reviews from almost everyone are about this phenomenon.  This is perhaps the only place where the sea grows so well with marine vegetation during this period.  For many vacationers, this is a pretty strong deterrent to choose this place for relaxation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are, of course, among vacationers and those for whom it is this that represents the opportunity to receive a dose of free and necessary treatment.  How?  Algae and the smell of hydrogen sulfide appear here, which, according to many reviews, help to heal or alleviate the condition with joint diseases, with radiculitis, osteochondrosis and bronchitis (for more details on the properties, see the article below).  Perhaps such vacationers about the sea in Anapa in August have better reviews. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa in August: reviews, sea blooms, photos" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2157112.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It should be noted that flowering does not occur until the water warms up to temperatures of more than 20 degrees.  Due to the fact that the climatic conditions are different every year, the exact timing of flowering cannot be determined.  However, the likelihood that this will happen from late July to early September is large. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that algae appear in different places in different ways - the section of the central beach, which is covered with sand, is subject to the greatest flowering.  The green carpet starts from the Anapka River. </p><h2>  When is the best time to go to Anapa? </h2><p>  Due to the fact that reviews about the sea in Anapa (in August) are not very flattering, you should carefully think about the place and time of rest. </p><p>  For a peaceful mental relaxation with a combination of sunbathing with walks and excursions, a vacation in May, September and early October is wonderful.  In terms of swimming at this time, there are some problems: in May, the water does not have time to warm up, in the fall it can be cold.  To swim in plenty of clean sea water, you should come in early summer (June).  The summer period in Anapa from July to August is characterized by a dirty sea and higher prices. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that the sea for the most part becomes dirty mainly where the beaches are covered with sand.  For example, in Dzhemete (where the central beach) every year they try to clear the coastline, but to no avail.  And in Sukko with a pebble beach, the sea is relatively clean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa in August: reviews, the sea blooms" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2157104.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About the healing properties of algae </h2><p>  Not very good reviews about the Anapa Sea in August.  It blooms (photo above) is quite strong and unpleasant.  But there are positive aspects to this phenomenon. </p><p>  Although the flowering shore looks unsightly and the smell is not good, you should know that Kamchatka alga has excellent healing properties.  Many people come here specially.  It is with kamka that treatment courses are carried out in many Anapa sanatoriums. </p><p>  There is a unique substance secreted from these algae.  It has the following properties: </p><ul><li>  increases immunity and has an antiviral effect; </li><li>  removes toxins from the body </li><li>  able to heal diseases of the musculoskeletal system and respiratory system. </li></ul><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  In addition to the sea, although not always attractive, in Anapa there are many natural and historical attractions: "Gorgippia" (archaeological reserve - the ancient city), lotus valley, "Big Utrish" (reserve), juniper forest, Zhemchuzhny waterfall, Snake and Dolphin lake Mountain Lysaya.  The following excursions can also please holidaymakers: a dolphinarium, a champagne wine factory. </p>
