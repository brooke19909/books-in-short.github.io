    <h2>  Development project </h2><p>  The land allocated for construction is located between the streets of Voroshilov, Latvian shooters and Krzhizhanovsky, which border it from the north, west, south and east, respectively.  In general, construction is divided into phases depending on the time of completion.  Full completion of the construction is planned around 2014-2015.  The first and second stages have already been commissioned, and residents are actively moving into new high-quality houses.  All the houses, and they are planned to be built at least 15, in height from 16 to 24 floors, are located on the border of the site, which ultimately forms a free area in the center, which in due time will be used to the maximum for building social and sports infrastructure.  If you look at the finished model of the Ladoga Park residential complex, you can see that the principles of architectural planning were applied to the project.  Everything looks very concise and harmonious, not only inside the complex: its outlines fit well into the already existing landscape of the region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Technical characteristics of houses and apartments </h2><p>  All buildings of the complex are built in accordance with all modern requirements and </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ladoga park" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13375/378154.jpg?1397994372542" width="600"></div>  norms.  Innovative technologies and high quality building materials are actively used both in Russian and foreign production.  The foundation is a pile field and a monolithic slab, and the building frame itself consists of monolithic reinforced concrete.  The cladding is made of brick, the roof is flat and covered with roll materials, the internal partitions of the apartments are made of aerated concrete blocks and tongue-and-groove plates.  In all apartments, according to the project, modern plastic double-glazed windows, entrance doors, electricity, cold and hot water meters are installed.  As a rule, the delivery is done with rough finish, but at the same time floor screed, in-house electrical networks, television antenna and water supply system are provided;  the balconies and loggias are glazed and decorated with Rosser stone on the outside.  Various companies are involved in the development, including Kapstroy LLC.  Ladoga Park is not only a modern residential complex in a comfortable area, but also high-quality modern housing.

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  In general, the location of the complex is very favorable: in just 10 minutes you can walk to one of the two nearby metro stations, namely the Ladozhskaya and Bolshevik Avenue.  In addition, to the north of the Ladoga Park, according to the detailed planning project, a fast tram route will be drawn and a bridge over the Okkervil River will be built.  This suggests that the area has good </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ladoga park residential complex" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13375/378150.jpg?1397994436470" width="600"></div>  transport links, which will only improve in the future.

    <h2>  Nevsky district </h2><p>  This is one of the old districts of St. Petersburg, it was founded immediately after the revolution of the 17th year, however, it was then called Volodarsky.  It was renamed Nevsky in 1949, and the borders were established only in 1968. Now it borders on the Frunze and Krasnogvardeisky districts in the west and in the north, but the eastern and southern borders coincide with the city limits.  Despite this, the district is very developed, large shopping and business centers are located here, and for the convenience of residents, many hypermarkets such as Lenta and Karusel are open.  There are also many kinds of entertainment venues in the area: these are cinemas and theaters, but the Ice Palace sports and entertainment complex occupies a special place, where sporting events and performances by pop stars take place.  The uniqueness of Nevsky lies in the fact that this is the only area that is spread on both sides of the Neva.  In general, the best place to build a new <span>residential complex</span> could not be found, therefore, choosing an apartment in the Ladoga Park <span>residential complex</span> , you will not lose. </p><h2>  Social infrastructure </h2><p>  It's time to talk about what kind of infrastructure developers plan to create.  First of all, it is worth noting how they approached the parking issue, because this is a rather painful topic for car owners.  Underground parking is provided in each house, in addition, a multi-level parking and an open parking for guests will be built.  Two kindergartens and a new school, as well as children's creativity studios will be built for children.  Bank branches and a post office, as well as shops, pharmacies and beauty salons will certainly appear.  Residents will be provided with everything </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ladoga park" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13375/378151.jpg?1397994460186" width="499"></div>  necessary, you don‚Äôt have to travel far to the center, although at first people may encounter small difficulties, since the construction of all social facilities is possible only after the complete completion of the houses of all the lines.
