Indeed, this name is called one of the most delicious soda. <br><br>  But in addition to the name considered, the word has at least three more meanings.  In the article we will consider Arkhyz more multifaceted: both as a unique natural place, and as a mountain lake, and as a popular ski resort.  Well, do not forget to talk about the unique chemical composition of the mineral water beloved by many. </p>

    <h2>  The Pearl of the Western Caucasus </h2><p>  Arkhyz ... Where is it?  Are you also interested? <br><br>  Arkhyz (where it is, read on) is primarily a geographical area located in the mountains of the Western Caucasus.  It is located on the territory of Russia in the Karachay-Cherkess Republic. <br><br>  Arkhyz is distinguished by its unique nature and comfortable climate.  Locals do not know what serious temperature extremes are.  Weather from year to year pleases people with mild winters and warm summers, when you do not need to escape from the heat under air conditioning or, conversely, wear a warm sweater with the next anticyclone (many regions of Russia are famous for their extremely unpredictable weather, but not Arkhyz). </p><h2>  Unique nature </h2><p>  The hilly landscape is mesmerizing: ranges of majestic mountains go far into the sky, the tops of which are often covered with snow.  Below you can see the green-blue, clear, like tears of a baby, the waters of mighty rivers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  An inquisitive traveler will certainly visit a glacier or <span>mountain lake.</span>  The last Arkhyz is very rich - scientists have about 300 natural reservoirs. <br><br>  The mountain rivers and lakes are surrounded by clear forests.  Majestic firs, beeches and spruces make the landscape of the area harmonious, and the air - useful for the lungs.  The age of some trees reaches two hundred years. </p><p>  Of course, excellent mushrooms grow in such forests.  Already at the end of April, an experienced mushroom picker will be able to pick up a small basket of these forest gifts.  Allsorts will consist of ugly-looking morels (but very tasty and healthy, by the way), cute mushrooms and young boletus. </p><h2>  Inhabitants of Arkhyz </h2><p>  On such a naturally rich territory live animals, sometimes very rare.  Typical inhabitants of mountain forests are: </p><ul><li>  tours </li><li>  Caucasian deer; </li><li>  bison; </li><li>  wild boars; </li><li>  roe deer. </li></ul><p>  One of the most beautiful animals of Arkhyz is an alpine tour.  His appearance is distinguished by nobleness and sophistication.  Males never fertilize females in spring, summer or autumn.  At this time, they are in separate territories.  Only in winter, these animals retire to reproduce the same beautiful and intelligent Turk. </p>

    <p>  The traveler needs to be very careful in late spring and early summer: it is at this time that the reptiles Arkhyz ‚Äî vipers and coppers ‚Äî are especially active.  Therefore, shoes should be closed.  Well, the most important safety rule is to look under your feet and not rush anywhere. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Natural red fish </h2><p>  Trout lives in rivers and lakes.  At Arkhyz, it is not specially grown: it is born in ponds itself.  You can see it on a clear day, when the sun's rays well shine through the water surface. </p><p>  It is still better to admire this unique fish, rather than try to catch it.  Only with a careful attitude to nature will it be preserved in its original form. </p><p>  In the next chapter, read where the city of Arkhyz is located. </p><h2>  Small town in the mountains </h2><p>  You can find the answer to the question of what a mountain settlement looks like by reading our article below.  So where is Arkhyz located? </p><p>  A city is too big a word for a settlement with a population of 400 people.  Arkhyz (where the geographical object is located, you already know) is a small village located in the very center of the mountains of the Western Caucasus.  It is the administrative center of the Arkhyz rural settlement and has a rather interesting history. </p><p>  <span>Archaeological excavations</span> on the territory of Arkhyz date back to the 2nd millennium BC.  The village was part of the Great Silk Road.  In the heyday of the Alanian state, Arkhyz was the center of early Christianity.  Three Christian churches have been preserved on the territory of the settlement.  They were built by the masters of the Byzantine school around the 10th century AD. </p><p>  Now you know how Arkhyz looks and where. </p>

    <h2>  Tourism </h2><p>  Arkhyz today is a major transit point for lovers of mountains, fascinating hikes and the starry sky (in the Caucasus, in clear weather, it is charming). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You can travel here on horseback, on boats (along mountain rivers) and just on foot.  In addition to exciting adventures, everyone can simply enjoy the beautiful nature and improve their health with healing water right from the source. </p><p>  Many tourists are wondering where to relax in Arkhyz.  It all depends on what kind of rest a person likes.  After all, someone relaxes, only experiencing thrills, and someone, on the contrary, gets tired. </p><p>  The latter need ordinary peace, the absence of city noise and the contemplation of nature ... Is it worth the introvert to go to the city of Arkhyz?  Where to stay there?  Things to do?  Definitely worth a ride!  Such people can be advised to rent a small house on the outskirts of Arkhyz.  It is difficult to imagine how happy the introvert will be, having the opportunity to walk, listen to music and enjoy nature unique in its naturalness. </p>

    <p>  For a creative person, this option of relaxation is ideal, as it contributes to the emergence of inspiration.  Under ordinary conditions, this is rare, because there is noise around, daily activities and other obstacles. </p><p>  The thrill-seeker will not be disappointed either.  For him, there are many options for leisure activities in Arkhyz.  For example, skiing, hiking in the mountains and observing the starry sky.  Traveling to the mountains is a rather unsafe activity, therefore it is better to first draw up a trekking route, purchase special equipment, and only then fulfill your dream.  It is advisable to stop at a halt in your tents and eat your own food (this is the safest option for health). </p><h2>  Night sky over Arkhyz </h2><p>  Starry, bewitching and bottomless - these are the epithets that most vividly characterize it.  Contemplating a clear sky, a person is approaching something sublime, eternal and beautiful.  This can be seen in the literature. </p><p>  In Paulo Coelho's book Adultery, the main character suffers from chronic depression (or subdepression scientifically) and looks for ways out of it.  Fate brings her to the wise Cuban shaman, who advises her to heal in a rather original way - by watching the night sky.  The Cuban advises her to literally "get drunk with him" - this means to penetrate, feel and experience new emotions. </p><p>  In the finale, the main character is cured of her mental illness, but in a different way - she decides to jump with a parachute.  Therefore, the method of the shaman is quite controversial, although it uniquely gives rise to new emotions. </p>

    <p>  Also on the territory of Arkhyz is the largest observatory in Europe.  For a small amount, you can go inside it and see a powerful computer telescope. </p><h2>  The chemical composition of everyone's favorite soda </h2><p>  The source of useful water is located at an altitude of 1,507 meters above sea level. </p><p>  It is distinguished by cleanliness, pleasant taste and healthy properties.  Water is carbonated and non-carbonated.  The first is most interesting.  It is Arkhyz mineral water (where the source is located, already mentioned) that is rich in iodine, which is deficient in central Russia, and fluorine.  It is also perfectly absorbed by the body, because its molecular composition is similar to the fluid contained in the cells. </p><p>  Sold in most Russian stores: cheaper and tastier than any imported soda.  And the fact of supporting a domestic manufacturer is pleasing. </p><h2>  Arkhyz Lake: where is it located? </h2><p>  Next, we will talk about Lake Arkhyz (where it is and what is remarkable).  It is a natural reservoir, the history of which is shrouded in mystery.  Located high in the mountains: on the slope of the Morg-Syrty ridge, at an altitude of 2.5 km above sea level. </p>

    <p>  Other names for the lake are Nameless or Frozen.  It is a small natural reservoir in the shape of a heart.  Pure mountain streams filled this mountain hollow, forming a lake of love.  The water in the lake is clear, rich in substances useful to the skin and quite cool (in summer its temperature ranges from +16 to +18 degrees). </p><p>  According to legend, you need to throw a coin in it so that sincere love never leaves your heart.  Some people dare to swim in it, but this is not for everybody. </p><p>  A person who first came to Arkhyz may experience different sensations: someone comes indescribable delight from the mountains and, like a child, admires the crimson sunrises, and someone contemplates this majestic nature and indulges in thoughts about the transience of human life.  Each one has its own personal associations, but one thing can be said with certainty: this land does not leave anyone indifferent. </p>
