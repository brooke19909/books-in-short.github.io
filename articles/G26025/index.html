  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Connecting two computers to the Internet</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Imagine a situation: you purchased a second computer, and you want the Internet to be on it, just like on the first.  Here is the question: how to do this?  In order to connect two computers to the Internet, there are several options, the most common of which is, perhaps, setting up the Internet using a router. </p><p>  All that is needed is a cable to the computer, a router, and a little time.  It is assumed that the Internet is already configured and working on the first computer, so we will not consider its configuration.  Connect the cable from the <span>ISP</span> to the router and one more cable to each computer.  Now configure the router.  When you purchase services from an Internet provider related to opening the Internet for you, you received data that should have been saved.  It's time to get them and read them again. </p><p>  So, open the Internet browser and enter the following address in the <span>address bar:</span> 192.168.1.1 is a static ip address - it is assigned to a personal computer by default.  In the window that opens, we write the username and password, they are the same - admin (remember! The register matters). </p><p>  Now on the actual setup.  Depending on the model of the router, the process will change a little, but in most cases it is almost the same for everyone.  Consider a simple example.  Suppose you have a D-LINK 2500u router.  A window of quick tincture will open immediately.  Focusing on the recommendations provided by the provider, enter all values ‚Äã‚Äãin turn.  In the ip address menu, specify the one that is written in the contract.  Then save the settings and reboot the router.  That's it, the settings are accepted, and now both of your computers have internet. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Connecting two computers to the Internet is possible if you just agree with the provider, in this case, you need to request a second, additional ip address and gateway.  On the second computer, you <span>configure the Internet</span> in the same way as on the first. </p><p>  Recently, another method of setting up the Internet has become widespread - via wifi.  This is the most technologically advanced and convenient way, because computers can be moved, and they are not limited by cable.  Consider connecting two computers to the Internet using wi-fi, and also find out what <span>the wifi</span> windows xp <span>setting is</span> .  To do this, first we need a wi-fi router. </p><p>  After <span>connecting the router</span> to the computer in the list of available connections, a new one will definitely appear - wireless.  We need it.  In addition, below - among the icons - this connection is displayed.  Theoretically, when you click on the icon, you can search for wifi networks and select an existing one if there is a network source within 100 meters.  If not, then create your own network. </p><p>  Click on the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù button and select ‚Äúadd network‚Äù.  So we will create the first wi-fi network.  In the next window, enter the desired name of our future network and uncheck the encryption.  We leave only the condition "computer-to-computer".  Click OK, after which we will have a network.  We select it and enter the properties, select the tab <span>"Internet Protocol</span> TCP / IP", enter the standard data there when entering ip 192.168.1.1, and of course, you need to enter the subnet mask 255 255 255 0. </p><p>  Now you need to save the data.  That's all, you have a network ready, you just have to join it on the second computer.  In addition, in some cases, this may not be necessary, for example, if you have a local network with the first configured on the second computer.  Then all the necessary Internet settings I‚Äôve come to him through a local network.  That, in general, is all. </p><p>  What would you like to add?  If the network suddenly does not work, then two of the probable reasons can be distinguished.  First, you probably made a mistake somewhere in the setup, or simply did not uncheck any.  Look again and redo everything.  If it doesn‚Äôt help, then you need to look at the settings of the anti-virus software or firewall.  In addition, check the entered ip address and try restarting the computer.  As you can see, connecting two computers to the Internet is not such a difficult task.  As soon as all settings are completed, unlimited network spaces will open before you. </p>
