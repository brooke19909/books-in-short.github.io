    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  This hotel was built over 45 years ago.  But, despite the fact that her "age" is quite large, she is modern.  And the rooms, and the hall, and the area - everything looks attractive, stylish and new.  After all, restorations here were carried out regularly, as well as cosmetic repairs. </p><p>  Eden Roc Resort 4 * is located in a place called Kallithea (or, as it is also called, Kallithea).  This is one of the most popular resorts in Rhodes.  The location is good - you can get to the airport in about 15 minutes. It is close enough to get there quickly, but not so much that you can hear airplanes (which is a hindrance for many, so it's a plus). </p><p>  The hotel itself, consisting of 356 rooms of various categories, is located in close proximity to a pebble beach with convenient entry into the water.  There are umbrellas and deck chairs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And nearby (at a distance of 2-5 kilometers) there are various interesting sights.  For example, St. Francis Park, a water park, a clock tower, Knights Street, the Palace of the Grand Masters, etc. There is a bus stop 700 meters from the hotel, so you can get to it from anywhere. </p>

    <h2>  Bungalow </h2><p>  This is another popular apartment option.  Bungalow hotels are popular and Eden Roc is no exception.  Cozy detached apartments are located a few steps from the sea, surrounded by a green, lushly blooming garden.  And nearby is the pool. </p><p>  The bungalows are decorated in a different style, but everything looks just as cozy and attractive.  And the conditions here are like standards.  Only a little more spacious. </p><p>  For two people, 7 days with ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù will cost 50-52 thousand rubles.  If there are three guests, then it will be necessary to give approximately 80-83 thousand rubles.  And for four, the price will be less than 90 thousand rubles.  This is the most profitable option, since only 22 thousand rubles will leave a person per week.  And this is about 3,100 rubles per day, which is a fairly modest price for a Greek hotel with an all-inclusive service. </p><p>  There is, by the way, a bungalow overlooking the pool.  They are slightly more spacious than the option by the sea.  These bungalows have a separate bedroom and living room, and two more LCD TVs and an electric kettle.  For two people the price of a weekly stay will be 58 thousand rubles, for three - 78 thousand rubles, and for four - 100 thousand rubles. </p>
