    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  The Rafs Tower platform ("tower of hooligans" translated from English) was built during the Second World War.  To protect against fascist bombers off the coast of Great Britain, several such platforms were installed.  They had an anti-aircraft gun system, which was guarded and served by 200 soldiers. </p><p>  The Rafs Tower platform, which later became the physical territory occupied by the virtual state, was six miles from the mouth of the Thames.  And the territorial waters of Britain ended three miles from the coast.  Thus, the platform was in neutral waters.  After the war, weapons from all forts were dismantled, platforms close to the coast were destroyed.  And the Rafs Tower remained abandoned. </p><p>  In the 60s of the last century, radio pirates began to actively develop the coastal waters of England.  Roy Bates, a retired British Army major, was one of them.  He organized his first radio station Radio Essex on a different platform, crowding out his colleagues.  However, in 1965 he was fined for violating the wireless telegraph law, and he had to look for a new place for the radio station. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Together with his friend Ronan O'Rahilli, the major decided to occupy the Rafs Tower and create an amusement park on the platform.  However, friends soon quarreled, and Roy Bates began to independently develop the platform.  He even had to defend the right to it with weapons in his hands. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  The idea with the amusement park failed.  But Bates could not recreate the radio station, despite the fact that he had all the necessary equipment.  The fact is that in 1967 a law came into force that made broadcasting a crime, including from neutral waters.  Now even the location of the platform could not save Bates from persecution by the state. </p><p>  But what if the waters cease to be neutral?  The retired major had a crazy idea at first glance - to proclaim the platform as a separate state.  On September 2, 1967, the former military proclaimed the platform an independent state and named it Sealand, and declared himself the ruler of the new country, Prince Roy I Bates.  Accordingly, his wife became Princess John I. </p><p>  Of course, Roy initially studied international law and spoke with lawyers.  It turned out that the actions of the major would indeed be difficult to challenge in court.  The newly-made state of Sealand had a physical territory, albeit a small one - only 0.004 square kilometers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the same time, the construction of the platform was completely legal.  A document prohibiting such buildings appeared only in the 80s.  And at the same time, the platform was outside the jurisdiction of Britain, and the authorities could not legally dismantle it. </p>

    <h2>  Relations with the UK </h2><p>  In the territorial waters of England remained three more similar platforms.  Just in case, the government decided to get rid of them.  The platforms were blown up.  One of the ships of the Navy, performing this task, sailed to Selenda.  The ship's team said that this platform will be destroyed soon.  To which the inhabitants of the principality responded with warning shots in the air. </p><p>  Roy Bates was a British citizen.  Therefore, as soon as the major stepped ashore, he was arrested on charges of illegal possession of weapons.  A lawsuit has begun against Prince Bates.  On September 2, 1968, an Essex judge issued a historic decision: he ruled that the case was outside of British jurisdiction.  This fact has become official evidence that the UK has abandoned its rights to the platform. </p><h2>  Coup attempt </h2><p>  In August 1978, a coup d'etat almost happened in the country.  There was a conflict between the ruler of the state, Roy Bates, and his closest assistant, Count Alexander Gottfried Aachenbach, over the policy of attracting foreign investment to the country.  The men accused each other of unconstitutional intentions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When the prince went to Austria to negotiate with potential investors, the count decided to seize the platform by force.  At that moment, only Michael (Michael) I Bates, the son of Roy and the heir to the throne, was in the territory of Sealand.  Achenbach, along with several mercenaries, captured the platform, and the young prince was locked for several days in a windowless cabin.  After that, Michael was taken to the Netherlands, from where he was able to escape. </p><p>  Roy and Michael soon reunited and were able to regain power on the platform.  Mercenaries and Achenbach were captured.  What to do with people who betrayed Sealand?  The Principality fully respected international law.  <span>The Geneva Convention</span> on the Rights of Prisoners of War stipulates that after the cessation of hostilities all prisoners must be released. </p>

    <p>  The mercenaries were immediately released.  But Achenbach was accused of attempting a coup d'etat under the laws of the principality.  He was convicted and removed from all government posts.  Since the traitor was a citizen of Germany, the German authorities became interested in his fate.  Britain refused to intervene in this conflict. </p><p>  A German official arrived in Sealand to speak with Prince Roy.  As a result of the intervention of the German diplomat, Achenbach was released. </p><h2>  Illegal government </h2><p>  What then did Aachenbach do after a failed attempt to capture Sealand?  The Principality was now inaccessible to him.  But the former count continued to insist on his rights and even organized the exile of Sealand.  He also claimed to be the chairman of some secret council. </p><p>  Germany <span>did not recognize the</span> diplomatic status of Aachenbach, and in 1989 he was arrested.  The head of the illegal government of Sealand was taken by Johannes Seiger, the former Minister for Economic Cooperation. </p><h2>  Territory expansion </h2><p>  In 1987, Sealand (Principality) expanded its territorial waters.  He declared such a desire on September 30, and the next day the United Kingdom made the same statement.  In accordance with international law, the disputed maritime territory is equally divided between the two states. </p><p>  Since there are no agreements between the countries on this score, and the United Kingdom did not make any statements, the Sealand government considered the disputed territory divided according to international standards. </p><p>  This led to an unpleasant incident.  In 1990, a British ship approached the shores of the principality unauthorized.  The inhabitants of Sealand fired several warning shots at the air. </p>

    <h2>  Passports </h2><p>  In 1975, the virtual state began to issue its own passports, including diplomatic ones.  But the honest name of Sealand was blamed when an illegal government in exile participated in a major global scam.  In 1997, Interpol began to search for the source of the vast amount of fake documents allegedly issued in Silenda. </p><p>  Passports, driver's licenses, higher education diplomas and other documents were sold <span>to residents of Hong Kong,</span> Russia, the United States and European countries.  According to these documents, people tried to cross the border, open a bank account, buy weapons.  The Sealand government assisted the investigation.  After this incident, absolutely all passports, including those issued absolutely legally, were revoked and canceled. </p><h2>  Constitution, state symbols, form of government </h2><p>  After Britain recognized in 1968 that Sealand was outside its jurisdiction, the inhabitants decided that this was a de facto recognition of the country's independence.  After 7 years, in 1975, state symbols were developed - an anthem, flag and coat of arms.  Then the Constitution was issued, including the preamble and 7 articles.  New government decisions are drawn up in the form of decrees. </p><p>  The Sealand flag is a combination of three colors - red, black and white.  In the upper left corner - a red triangle, in the lower right - a black triangle.  Between them is a white stripe. </p>

    <p>  The flag and coat of arms are the official symbols of Sealand.  On the coat of arms of Sealand are two lions with fish tails that hold in their paws a shield of flag colors.  Under the coat of arms is a motto that says: "Freedom is from the sea."  The national anthem written by the composer Vasily Symonenko is also called. </p><p>  By state structure, Sealand is a monarchy.  The government structure has three ministries - foreign affairs, internal affairs, and telecommunications and technology. </p><h2>  Coins and stamps </h2><p>  Since 1972, Sealand coins have been produced.  The first silver coin with the image of Princess John and a <span>sailing ship</span> came out in 1972.  From 1972 to 1994, several types of coins were issued mainly from silver, gold and bronze, the obverse of which depicts portraits of John and Roy or a dolphin, and on the reverse - a sailboat or coat of arms.  The monetary unit of the principality is the Sealand dollar, which is tied to the US dollar. </p><p>  In the period from 1969 to 1977, the state issued postage stamps.  For some time they were received by the post of Belgium. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  The first ruler of Sealand was Prince Roy Bates.  In 1990, he transferred all the rights to his son and, together with the princess, went to live in Spain.  Roy died in 2012, his wife John - in 2016.  The current ruler is Prince Michael I Bates.  He has an heir, James Bates, who is the prince of Sealand.  In 2014, James had a son, Freddie, who is the great-grandson of the first ruler of the principality. </p><p>  Who lives in Sealand today?  The population of the principality at different times ranged from 3 to 27 people.  Now on the platform there are about ten people daily. </p>

    <h2>  Religion and Sports </h2><p>  On the territory of the principality the <span>Anglican Church</span> operates <span>.</span>  Also on the platform is a small chapel named after St. Brendan the Navigator.  Sealand does not stand aside from sports achievements.  Despite the fact that the population of the principality is not enough to form sports teams, some athletes represent the unrecognized state.  There is even a football team. </p><h2>  Sealand and the Internet </h2><p>  With regard to the Internet in the territory of the state, a simple law applies - everything except spam, hacker attacks and child pornography is allowed.  Therefore, Sealand, which began as a pirate radio station, is still an attractive area for modern pirates.  For 8 years, the HavenCo servers were located on the territory of the principality.  After the closure of the company, the principality continues to provide services for hosting servers of various organizations. </p><h2>  Legal status </h2><p>  Unlike other self-proclaimed states, Sealand has little chance of gaining recognition.  The principality has a physical territory, it was founded before the expansion of the water borders of Britain.  The platform was abandoned, which means that its settlement can be considered as colonization.  Thus, Roy Bates could truly establish a state on free territory.  However, for Sealand to receive full rights, it must be recognized by other states. </p>

    <h2>  Sale Sealand </h2><p>  In 2006, a fire broke out on the platform.  Substantial funds were required for restoration.  In 2007, the principality was put up for sale at a price of 750 million euros.  The Pirate Bay intended to acquire the platform, but the parties could not agree. </p><h2>  Sealand today </h2><p>  You can not only find out which country is the smallest, but also support the government of the rebellious platform in the quest for independence.  Anyone can donate money to the treasury of the principality.  In addition, on the official website you can purchase various souvenirs, coins, stamps. </p><p>  For only 6 euros, you can create a personal Sealand email address.  For 25 euros order an official identity card.  For those who have dreamed of a title all their lives, Sealand gives such an opportunity.  According to the laws of the principality, anyone who paid 30 euros can become a baron, for 100 euros - a knight of the Sovereign Military Order, and for 200 - a real count or countess. </p><p>  Today, the Principality of Sealand is ruled by Michael I Bates.  Like his father, he advocates freedom of information, and the bully tower remains a stronghold of modern information pirates. </p>
