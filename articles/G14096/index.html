    <h2>  Mysterious Sergievsky district </h2><p>  Sights of the Sergievsky <span>district of the Samara</span> region - this is primarily the <span>Blue Lake</span> (Semiz-kule).  A karst funnel formed this pond.  A strong hydrogen sulfide spring beats from its bottom.  The lake is so transparent that you can see, as they say, all its ins and outs.  This condition is explained by the absence of any life in it. </p><p>  Residents of this region are confident that Blue has healing power.  And there are several legends about him.  So, they say that in ancient times a cart and a horse failed here, but they could not find anything.  According to another belief, from time to time on the surface there appear tarry boards with secret letters. </p>
