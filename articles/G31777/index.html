    <p>  Singapore is a city-state that is located in Southeast Asia.  It consists of a large main island and almost 60 small islands.  The island of Singapore is separated from the peninsula by the Johor Channel.  In the northern part, it is connected to Malaysia by a dam.  In the southern part of Indonesia, it is separated by the Singapore Strait.  Holidays in Singapore are interesting and, if desired, can be very eventful. </p><p>  Singapore is a developed Asian metropolis, surprisingly clean and close in spirit to the European big city.  It‚Äôs not customary to throw rubbish under your feet and appear in public in a half-dressed state - for all such <span>violations of public order, a</span> thousand-dollar fine is imposed. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that Singaporeans were able to instill a love of order not only for people, but also for animals.  In the local zoo, the animals are not surrounded by iron cages: they walk around next to visitors and do not even think about any aggressive actions.  You can take a picture with a lion or a crocodile, just by walking close to it.  Well, of course, if you are so brave.  However, Singaporeans do not even think about it.  Holidays <span>in Singapore</span> are incomparable. </p><p>  By purchasing last-minute tours to Singapore, you get the opportunity to see firsthand the incredible combination of East and West, cultures, prejudices, money and high technology.  The culture of Singapore is a monolithic fusion of Indian, Chinese and Malay cultures. </p><p>  Here you can simply enjoy a <span>beach holiday,</span> or you can participate in various excursion programs that will deliver a lot of new and vivid impressions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are many cultural attractions worth seeing.  You can also stroll through the shopping districts and city parks. </p><p>  Singapore is a real paradise for shoppers.  Here you can buy good electrical equipment at attractive prices, perfumes, textiles, cosmetics and orchids.  From May to July, here for buyers comes the period of total discounts on quality goods. </p><p>  <strong>Beach vacation</strong> </p><p>  A lazy vacation in Singapore is best spent on Sentosa Island.  Here tourists are greeted by <span>white sand.</span>  There are many opportunities for sports right on the beaches. </p><p>  For your stay you can choose a luxury hotel or hotel, as well as youth camping. </p><p>  In the north of the island is a resort area with first-class hotels, created by a joint project of Singapore and Indonesia.  There are all conditions for a luxurious vacation.  Real tropical jungle, well-kept gardens, spa therapy centers, sports training grounds. </p><p>  <strong>sights</strong> </p><p>  Major attractions are located in three areas: Central Business District (CBD), Sentosa Island and Jurong. </p><p>  CBD is the city center, which includes the business, colonial and Chinese districts, the shopping street Orchard Road, neighborhoods with restaurants, fashionable hotels.  In the northeastern part, an exemplary city of the 21st century is being built. </p><p>  Sentosa Island is a fashionable resort with great opportunities for recreation and entertainment.  Here you will be amazed by musical fountains, as well as a museum of rare stones and the museum of the founders of Singapore, a huge Oceanarium, a cultural and historical park called the "Tang Dynasty Village", which hosts theatrical performances, as well as Butterfly Park and much more. </p><p>  Of course, a vacation in Singapore is worth spending 10 hours on a flight.  But once in place, you will immediately forget about fatigue, not ceasing to be surprised at the unusual atmosphere and exotic surroundings.  Choose last-minute trips to Singapore, this will save money on local shopping. </p><p>  <strong>Subtleties</strong> </p><p>  The crime rate is very low.  Therefore, for personal belongings you can not be afraid. </p><p>  During excursions, try to observe the cultural traditions of local residents.  When visiting temples, take off your shoes, and cover your arms and legs with clothing.  Do not take pictures or take pictures of Buddha images. </p><p>  Gambling and chewing gum are prohibited in Singapore.  It is strictly forbidden to litter and <span>smoke in public places.</span> </p>
