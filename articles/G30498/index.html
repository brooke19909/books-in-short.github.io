    <h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Peresyp village is surrounded on all sides by the expanses of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, so the climate here is simply created for relaxation and recovery.  Pure air is rich in particles of iodine, bromine and sodium chloride - all substances that are useful for breathing and maintaining the body's defenses.  The air temperature in the area ranges from 25 to 32 degrees in the summer.  Sea breezes make the air not so dry, so the heat is easily tolerated by every tourist.  Unlike the Black Sea, the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov surprises with the water temperature, here it is from 24 to 28 degrees.  It is shallow, so warm. </p><h2>  Sights of the resort region </h2><p>  The village of Peresyp (Temryuk district, Krasnodar Territory) is a very small settlement, but despite this, it is full of interesting places that tourists constantly visit.  The resort area is famous for the famous wineries "Fanagoria" and "Zaporizhzhya", therefore, as part of the excursions, tourists visit the tastings of real Kuban wines.  Every vacationer can try these sweet drinks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pour Temryuk district Krasnodar Territory" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42517/1353775.jpg" width="600"></div>
