    <p>  The legal one is, first of all, a democratic state in which the rule of law, the rule of law, and the equality of all citizens are guaranteed.  At the heart of his organization is the <span>principle of the separation of powers</span> in the judiciary, executive and legislative.  Citizens of the state have certain regulated rights and freedoms, can participate in the exercise of power (through representatives or directly).  This is possible due to a fairly developed <span>civil society, the</span> presence of functioning political parties and public organizations, freedom of speech, a high level of political as well as legal culture. </p><p>  What are the signs of a state of law? </p><p>  The rule of law prevailing in all <span>areas of public life.</span>  This is a peculiar form of protection and organization of human rights and freedoms.  It regulates rules of conduct binding on all, based on the <span>principles of justice</span> and equality.  The law has the highest legal force.  It regulates other legal acts and controls the most important aspects of social and political life. </p><p>  The Constitution is a set of basic laws of the state.  It reflects the legal principles of public and state life and activities.  The constitution is an ideal model of a legal society. </p><p>  The above signs of the rule of law make it possible to create a regime of legality and a fair rule of law in society. </p><p>  Free development of personality.  The reality of her rights.  These signs of the rule of law are focused on the socio-political life of society.  The freedom of man is his inalienable right.  Therefore, each individual has a certain sphere of freedom, which is not subject to state intervention. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A person has the following rights regulated by law: on immunity, <span>social security,</span> education, judicial protection, etc. </p><p>  The mutual responsibility of the individual and the state.  The relationship between the two parties should be based on the principles of justice and equality.  The state (as the bearer of political power) ensures their observance in relation to each citizen of society.  Authorities, obeying legal norms, cannot violate their requirements, as they bear a certain responsibility for failure to fulfill their duties.  The regulated guarantee systems (responsibility of the government and deputies to voters and state bodies, criminal and disciplinary liability of officials for failure to fulfill obligations, etc.) exclude the occurrence of administrative arbitrariness.  Compliance with the law is mandatory for the state apparatus. </p><p>  The responsibility of a person to the state is based on the same legal foundations.  The use of forms of coercion should not violate the principles <span>of individual freedom.</span> </p><p>  These signs of the rule of law ensure justice and equality. </p><p>  <span>The separation of powers</span> into executive, judicial and legislative.  This principle allows achieving balance, equilibrium in relations between government agencies, and establishing mutual control.  Each branch of government functions independently, within its competence, and does not interfere with the other. </p><p>  The main features of the rule of law include ideological and political pluralism.  It consists in the free functioning of parties, associations, organizations of various kinds, which operate exclusively in accordance with the norms of the constitution.  This principle also presupposes the existence of various ideological trends, concepts and views. </p><p>  All of the above features characterize the rule of law.  Signs of the state structure are the guarantor of stability, law and order in society. </p>
