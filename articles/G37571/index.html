    <p>  The South Korean company Samsung is one of the manufacturers of mobile equipment.  A few years ago, mobile phones manufactured by the corporation from South Korea were not of good quality, quickly failed and were extremely unreliable.  For several years, the South Korean manufacturer managed to make a significant leap in its development, increase production volumes and significantly improve the quality of its products.  All this allowed Samsung to become one of the leading smartphone manufacturers for the first time in many years. </p><p>  One of the most popular line of smartphones of the brand allowed the company to take a leading position in the global mobile industry.  One of the most successful gadgets of the South Korean production Samsung Galaxy-S3, reviews of which are mostly positive, will be discussed in this article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Device delivery set </h2><p>  In most cases, the <span>Samsung Galaxy-S3</span> package reviews are positive.  According to the owners of this stylish device, together with a smartphone, the user receives almost everything that is needed to work with him.  The <span>Samsung Galaxy-S3</span> comes with the following items: </p><ul><li>  the phone itself; </li><li>  charger to it; </li><li>  user's manual; </li><li>  USB cable </li><li>  wired headphones; </li><li>  lithium ion battery. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  The appearance of the device is one of its significant drawbacks (according to the owners of the gadget).  The smartphone looks too simple, its design is almost copied from previous models.  Nevertheless, several color schemes, a thin body that fits well enough in the hand and the relatively small dimensions of the device as a whole create a pretty good impression of the gadget. </p><p>  This model is being promoted under a rather interesting motto of the unity of nature and technology, so we can assume that the rounded shape of the device is somewhat similar to a stone off the sea coast.  The pattern covering the back of the device also enhances the impression.  The smartphone case is presented in white, blue and black colors.  All three versions look quite good and it is really difficult to choose an obvious favorite among them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  As for the dimensions of the flagship smartphone of 2012, it must be said that they are relatively small - 13.66 by 7.06 by 0.88 centimeters with a device weight of 133 grams.  As you can see, the device turned out to be quite thin, and the small mass of the Samsung Galaxy-S3 also pleases.  The device lies quite well in the hand, it easily fits in a trouser pocket, does not interfere with walking and does not take up too much space. </p><h2>  Assembly and controls </h2>

    <p>  There are absolutely no complaints about the assembly of the smartphone.  About it Samsung Galaxy-S3 owner reviews are good.  According to them, the plastic case is very well and tightly assembled.  You can only find fault with the removable panel, which is slightly squeezed in the camera area.  The back cover is hardly removed, since it is very rigidly fixed and pressed close to the surface. </p><p>  There is no backlash over the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe device: neither behind, nor on the sides.  Buttons are great too.  And although the Samsung Galaxy-S3 smartphone, for which reviews are more positive, was rated ‚Äúsatisfactory‚Äù for the materials, it can safely be rated ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù for the build quality. </p><p>  The location of the smartphone controls is typical of most products of the South Korean company Samsung.  On the top panel of the device, the user will find a standard 3.5 mm jack, which is intended specifically for connecting headphones, a microUSB port, as well as a microphone.  On the left side is the volume rocker, while on the right is the display lock button.  I must say that they are very convenient.  It is a pity that the phone does not have a special button designed specifically for taking pictures.  She would obviously not be in the way. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Under the display of the device there is one single key, complemented by two touch zones "Functions" and "Back".  A similar innovation can be observed in the smartphone Samsung Galaxy-S3 mini, reviews about which are even better than about the model described in this article.  These two zones have backlights, which, if desired, can be turned off completely or set the time of their work. </p>

Many users of such a wonderful device are also pleased that the indicator light has finally appeared here.  I must say that the diode shines brightly, it can notify you of missed calls, new messages, and also blinks when charging.

    <p>  The back surface of the smartphone is smooth and even, like pebbles smoothed out by water.  At the top, the main camera protrudes slightly, which is edged with a silver frame.  There is a small gap between it and the body where dust constantly gets.  However, everything is relatively easy to clean up, so only the most picky gadget users will be able to identify this flaw.  Also on the rear panel there is a speaker hole and, of course, an LED flash, which is located in close proximity to the main camera. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  We are all starting to get used to the super-large display diagonals of mobile devices operating under the Android platform.  The Samsung Galaxy-S3 phone was no exception.  And although the diagonal of its screen is not 6, but "only" 4.8 inches, it clearly cannot be called small.  Nevertheless, such a display, if we take into account the reviews of the owners of Samsung Galaxy-S3, was to the taste of many buyers. </p><p>  The device‚Äôs screen is made using HD Super AMOLED technology, has a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels, and also supports up to 10 clicks at a time.  This version of the smartphone from the South Korean manufacturer Samsung could not do without PenTile, which noticeably affects the clarity of fonts.  Most likely, only especially sharp-sighted users will notice this, while other consumers will leave this fact without any attention, since it does not strike the eye at all. </p><p>  With a pixel density of 306 pixels per inch, there is no need to complain about poor image quality.  Shortcomings in the display are visible only at close range, when the smartphone is located at a distance of 10 cm from the eyes.  The picture is bright, but automatic adjustment does not work very well here.  On the street, the screen brightness is practically not lost, although in this aspect the smartphone is slightly inferior to its counterparts in the face of Sony Xperia P. </p><h2>  Main and front cameras </h2><p>  Nowadays, one of the main criteria for competition between modern gadgets is the quality of the camera.  The best devices shoot at about the same level.  Most users like to store captured images on their smartphones, so very rarely photos go beyond the internal memory or memory card of the device.  The capabilities of most cameras of modern phones are so great that they allow you to upload your photos immediately to social networks, not to mention the highest quality video recording. </p><p>  The smartphone from Samsung is equipped with a main camera, the resolution of which reaches 8 megapixels.  The module also has an LED flash and, of course, automatic image focusing.  The smartphone has a quick shooting function when the device takes pictures immediately after the shutter button is touched.  This function, unfortunately, does not always work correctly, so sometimes pictures are blurry.  The maximum resolution of photographs is 3264 by 2448 pixels.  The main camera can also record video in FullHD resolution - 1920 by 1080 pixels. </p><p>  Also, the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S3 <span>phone</span> , reviews of which will give you an additional idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis device, is equipped with a front camera with a resolution of 1.9 megapixels and is designed to make video calls. </p>

    <h2>  Samsung Galaxy-S3: smartphone features </h2><p>  The device runs on a quad-core Exynos-4412 processor - a proprietary Samsung company.  The frequency of this processor reaches 1.4 GHz.  The graphics adapter here is the Mali-400MP.  As for RAM, its volume is 1 GB, while there is plenty of internal memory - 16, 32 or 64 GB, depending on the configuration of the device.  Moreover, if necessary, the user can use <span>a microSD-format memory card, the</span> capacity of which should not exceed the mark of 32 GB. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The device from Samsung is running the Android 4.0.4 platform, which is complemented by a proprietary shell called TouchWiz.  The smartphone is quite fast, and using it is a pleasure. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  Among the communications in the device from the South Korean company Samsung it is worth highlighting the presence of the fourth version of Bluetooth, USB connectors, as well as a Wi-Fi module, which is designed specifically for wireless access to the Internet.  It is also worth highlighting NFC technology and S Beam. </p><h2>  Battery and battery life </h2>

    <p>  The smartphone from Samsung has a lithium-ion battery, the capacity of which reaches 2100 mAh.  The advantages of this battery can be attributed to the fact that it is replaceable and, if desired, consumers can purchase a spare battery if there are concerns that one will not be too convenient. </p><p>  If you go into the settings of the Samsung Galaxy-S3, you can turn on the energy-saving mode, which will significantly extend the battery life of the smartphone.  You can make the processor work at a lower frequency, lower the brightness of the display, or set a different background. </p><p>  The manufacturer claims that the battery life of the device is 9.5 hours during a conversation, as well as 290 hours in standby time.  In normal mode, with not too frequent use, the phone is able to work during the day.  In this case, it all depends on the loads on the device. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, I would like to say that you can read more reviews about the Samsung Galaxy-S3 than negative ones.  The spoken speaker, which clearly and clearly conveys the voice, also pleases.  As for the ringer volume, it is above average, and the vibration is average in strength.  If the case materials were a little better, and the design was not so primitive, we could safely say that the Samsung company turned out to be the perfect smartphone. </p><p>  In any case, a product from a renowned South Korean manufacturer is unlikely to disappoint consumers.  The device turned out to be really high-quality, but it can be purchased at a price approximately equal to 15 thousand rubles.  Of course, the cost is slightly overpriced, but for this money the consumer will get a really high-quality and reliable device that will delight him with his work for a long time. </p>
