    <p>  Do-it-yourself clothing for a dachshund, patterns, knitting of which is presented in our article, will be made on your favorite dog, taking into account the characteristics of his body.  Such things will help to emphasize the beauty and grace of the pet and, at the same time, protect the weather from troubles. </p><p>  DIY patterns for dachshunds can be used by designing products for different seasons.  For example, on the basis of overalls with the size of a pet, you can sew an autumn and winter outfit. </p><h2>  Clothes selection </h2><p>  Each breed of dog has its own characteristics of the structure of the body.  In addition, there are short-haired and long-haired dogs.  All this must be taken into account when sewing outfits for a pet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__qpz"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__qpz"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__qpz"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__qpz"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__qpz"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Owing to the length of the body, clothes for dachshunds with their own hands also have their own peculiarities: patterns, photos show these features very clearly.  Everything that is sewn for dachshund has a large length in the back, and this should be taken into account when cutting. </p><p>  In addition, the dachshund has very short legs, so spring-autumn dresses should be made of waterproof fabric. </p><p>  The creation of any thing begins with the construction of a pattern.  Therefore, starting to create outfits, you must first take measurements from your pet. </p><p>  To build a pattern, you need to measure the length of the back, the length below from the front to the hind legs, chest circumference, chest width, height of the pet at the withers and neck circumference.  Having completed all measurements correctly, you can sew any clothes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Clothing for dachshunds do-it-yourself patterns, photo" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1178934.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Knitted patterns </h2><p>  The creation of such things is suitable for lovers of knitting.  The principles here are the same, the main thing is to take measurements correctly. </p><p>  <span>Knitted blouses,</span> hats, coats - all this clothing for a dachshund with their own hands.  Patterns and knitting of individual details on them will greatly facilitate the work, allow you to create a thing that will sit well on the pet and protect it from wind and cold. </p><p>  <span>Knitwear,</span> as well as sewn, require carefully taken measurements from a four-legged friend. </p><p>  Here is a simple dachshund sweater.  This is only knitting technology, the number of loops is calculated based on the standards of the dog. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Clothing for dachshunds do-it-yourself knitting patterns" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1178857.jpg" width="570"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Knitting begins with the neck (measure neck circumference).  Then, using the raglan method, divide the loops into the back, chest and mitts.  The breast must first be expanded (measure the width of the chest), then narrowed, and it should be longer than the back so that the sweater fits well.  When we connect the back and chest, holes are formed for the sleeves.  We knit them separately.  We knit the body to the desired length (measure the length of the back), reducing loops on the tummy so that the knit fits snugly to the body.  You can put on a hood.  In such a sweater, a pet can walk in dry weather.  If you use cotton threads, you get a summer outfit. </p><h2>  Outfits for the dachshund boy </h2><p>  Warm things for the dog - protection from the weather, the pet should be comfortable in it, nothing should prevent it from moving.  And since the pattern of clothes for a dachshund-boy with his own hands is made according to individual sizes, then it will meet all these requirements. </p><p>  Same-sex dogs can start fights, so dog owners have learned to show the floor of a dog in their outfits.  Things for a dachshund boy will differ in color: they are darker (blue, gray, black).  And of course, there are differences in the cutting of material, taking into account the anatomical features of boys who relieve themselves differently than girls. </p><p>  Patterns of clothes for dachshunds with their own hands, on which things for boys will be sewn, will turn out to be larger, since males are more females.  And jewelry decorations in the form of rhinestones, bows and ruffles are more suitable for girls' clothes, and not for boys. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY clothes for a boy dachshund" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1178975.jpg" width="550"></div>

For a boy, you can sew a tuxedo, a shirt with a tie, and wear a stylish cap. </p><h2>  It is interesting </h2><p>  Patterns of clothes for dachshunds with their own hands will help to make the pet stylish and beautiful.  This is the owner‚Äôs concern for his pet, which is manifested in caring for him and creating good living conditions for him. </p><p>  Here are some facts about dog clothes: </p><ol><li>  The Eskimos and Samoyeds were the first to dress their dogs.  Their dogs flaunted in leather boots with deer fur inside, so that the fingertips would not crack from the frost. </li><li>  In the Renaissance, the heads of dogs were decorated with colored scarves. </li><li>  In the eighteenth century, Madame Pampadur's court lapdogs were dressed in velvet and silk dresses. </li><li>  In the twentieth century, special vests and overalls for rescue dogs were developed in the Alps (Switzerland). </li><li>  Then came the tradition of dressing up dogs for shows. </li><li>  Recently, dog fashion has firmly entered our lives. </li></ol><p>  Do not be afraid to experiment, and your pet will not only be protected from the weather, but also receive unique outfits that no one else will have. </p>
