It is from this year that the history of the Krasnye Vorota metro station begins.  This oldest station, the lobby of which is located on the Garden Ring, has long become one of the many attractions of the capital.  It‚Äôs not so rare that the Moscow metro stations changed their data when the name was opened, and some more than once, but today the Krasnye Vorota metro station is located on the stretch between the Chistye Prudy and Komsomolskaya stations.  These names are still valid.  For some time the station was called "Lermontovskaya", in honor of the great poet, who was once born here.  But in the second half of the eighties, it was returned to its original name - the metro "Red Gate".  The area where it is located is called that way.  And in those years, a company was held to revive Moscow historical place names. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro red gate" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/309653.jpg" width="495"></div>  Since the beginning of the eighteenth century, this place in Moscow had a not official, but quite stable traditional name - "Red Gate".  It was called so because of the <span>triumphal arch of</span> red that stood here, erected in honor of the victory in <span>the Battle of Poltava.</span>

The metro station "Red Gate" has its own unique architectural appearance.  The dynamic lines of constructivism are combined here with the expressiveness of classic red marble.  And most importantly, it does not contradict one another in any way, but is in organic unity.  The external decision of the lobby on the Garden Ring shows a clear reference to the image of the Red Gate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro red gate district" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/309656.jpg" width="499"></div>  This image is also present in the interior of the main hall of the station.  This <span>architectural project</span> was awarded the First Prize at one of the international exhibitions in Paris in the thirties.  By its constructive type, the Red Gate station is a pylon, three-vaulted station.  The depth of its laying exceeds 30 meters.  This made it possible to use the station‚Äôs premises during the Great Patriotic War as the operational headquarters of the Commissariat of Railways.  From here came the control of traffic flows on the railways of the Soviet Union.  Trains passed the station non-stop; the platform was fenced with temporary plywood partitions.  This is just one example of the use of underground facilities for defense purposes.  Taking into account strategic tasks in the Soviet Union, a lot was created, including a metro map.  Red Gate is no exception. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro map red gate" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/309702.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h3>  North Station Lobby </h3><p>  His metro station "Red Gate" found only in the summer of 1954.  It is located on the outside of the Garden Ring.  The lobby is built into the <span>high-rise building of the</span> Ministry of Railways, which was erected on <span>Red</span> Gate <span>Square</span> .  The metro station was connected with this strategic object during the war, when it had to play the role of its underground department.  The building itself is one of the seven famous Moscow Stalinist skyscrapers. </p>
