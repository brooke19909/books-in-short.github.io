Exchange of an apartment for the best or buying it is a rather responsible step, even for a completely successful person.  Most often, this is preceded by the sale of a room or apartment, as well as often the resettlement of communal apartments.  This article will provide information on the apartments of our capital in the form of reviews and analysis based on data from various think tanks, as well as feature articles from the press. </p>

    <h2>  Don't believe your eyes </h2><p>  The secondary market very often (according to the Incom-Real Estate study, more than half of the cases) provides ‚Äúalternative‚Äù, that is, far from reality, information about the free sale of apartments offered by the secondary housing market in Moscow.  Over the past three years, the share of real estate sold in this way has increased to 46% of the total number of apartments offered, including in new buildings. </p><p>  Previously, it was significantly less - only 28% of the total.  This is evidenced by centralized databases.  However, this dynamics is not confirmed by the number of transactions; it is clearly disproportionate.  Experts talk about insufficient demand and huge competition in sales.  That is why legends and myths are compiled about the objects sold, so that the buyer drew attention to it.  That is, in the submitted information, the secondary housing market in Moscow very often gives inaccurate information. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sales: direct and alternative </h2><p>  Real estate can be sold in two ways.  With an alternative, the seller is also the buyer, since he uses the secondary housing market in Moscow not only for sale, but also for the subsequent purchase of another apartment.  And if the sale is direct, the seller simply receives money on hand.  Most often, alternative sales take place in the capital, but they almost always try to disguise themselves as direct.  In any case, one or two goals can be pursued: either simply get money, or improve your home by selling an old one and buying a new apartment. </p><p>  The buyer, of course, likes direct selling more, since it is much more convenient, and it is faster sold and executed.  Demand is much higher for such apartments.  Therefore, the secondary housing market in Moscow sets prices slightly higher than the general level.  A seller who intends to immediately buy another apartment faces some inconvenience when selling directly: you need to temporarily check out some other living space (relatives, acquaintances, etc.), and you need to do this before the sale, otherwise the buyer can be scared away .  In any case, most of the alternative sales are held today as direct. </p>

    <h2>  Alternative </h2><p>  What it is, it seems, is already clear: a deal that simultaneously covers both sale and purchase of housing.  Previously, long chains of dependent transactions were compiled, up to twenty.  In today's times, this is unthinkable.  It‚Äôs very difficult to organize and conduct this whole chain <span>without a hitch</span> , and not all realtors can do it.  Very nervous work, especially when paying.  Putting money into twenty cells at the same time is a huge responsibility.  And the money is not small. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now the longest chain consists of two or three links, but even so, people are very nervous on the financial tab.  An analysis of the secondary housing market in Moscow is simply necessary if only because people often cannot sell their apartment just because they cannot understand the simple thing: you cannot evaluate it the way you want, you need to know the demand, be aware of the competition among sellers , track the volume of offers and, with all this, compare the price of housing for sale. </p><h2>  Example </h2><p>  A fairly frequent case, which has repeatedly demonstrated the secondary housing market in Moscow.  Three-room apartments are sold different, and they are also priced with a wide spread.  An example is this: for eleven months, Inkom-Real Estate has been observing the sale of an apartment of a not very convenient layout and renovated in 1955, where the paint is peeled off with tattered rags, as well as with the corresponding state of communications.  They rated it at fourteen and a half million rubles.  Moreover, the hostess is not going to reduce the price, because she wants to part in two two-room apartments, worth about seven million each. </p><p>  Even if she succumbs to persuasion and tries to sell the apartment for exactly fourteen million, she will not succeed, because the price and quality of housing do not match.  How many years this apartment has already been offered is scary to imagine.  Although the <span>two-room apartments</span> overcrowded the secondary housing market in <span>Moscow, two two-room apartments</span> do not work out of one, not the best three <span>-room apartment,</span> if they wanted to.  Because for ten million this "treshka" will "hang" no one knows how much.  The price must be real, rustic buyers can not be found now. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Few numbers </h2><p>  This year, at the beginning of May, 17,200 objects were put up, which sellers announced for free sale, just 46.4% of the total volume of offers in this segment.  And in 2014, precisely of such lots, the secondary housing market in Moscow through centralized bases presented for sale in the amount of 12043, that is, 28.9% of the total housing for sale.  Researchers are sure that the share of objects for free sale at the moment reaches its maximum value.  As a consequence of this dynamics, the volumes and shares of alternative and direct sales should be redistributed: there are clearly fewer alternative ones, and more direct ones. </p><p>  But judging by the number of transactions, such changes have not occurred, and alternative sales still have an advantage, if we take into account the number of completed ones.  There are about 80% of them, as the specialized department of Incom-Real Estate informs.  In 2015 and 2016, there were even more ‚Äúalternatives‚Äù because demand fell sharply and there was a shortage of direct buyers. </p><h2>  Causes </h2><p>  The seeming inconsistency of such information - the declared and actual data - speaks only about the incorrect nature of the huge part of the information that sellers or their same unscrupulous representatives provide when they post it in the databases.  This trend shows a review of the <span>secondary housing</span> market in <span>Moscow.</span>  Most likely, the reason is the crisis period in the sale of real estate, increased competition, increased competition for the buyer. </p><p>  More than half of the apartments marked as ‚Äúdirect sale‚Äù in the databases will actually be committed as an alternative.  It turns out only on viewing that the owners have nowhere to move, they have no other housing.  Regarding the positioning of sales as direct, no one even makes excuses for lying. </p><p>  They assure that they will move to mom, friends, neighbors, and the buyer will be asked to wait a couple of months before another apartment is picked up.  What is this if not an alternative sale?  Sellers lie in order to attract people to viewings, and already on the spot in any way to interest them in the acquisition of this particular housing.  But the whole secondary housing market in Moscow is noticeably suffering from such a lie. </p>

    <h2>  One-room apartments: "guest rooms", studios </h2><p>  Today, many studio apartments are not only in new buildings, but also in the secondary housing market.  They are extremely miniature, sometimes less than thirty square meters in a single room, which acts immediately in all forms - both as a kitchen, and as a dining room, and as a bedroom, and as a living room.  In the USSR there was a similar format, which was called "hotel-type housing."  And this apartment is not for tourists! </p>

    <p>  Back in the 60s, the active construction of small-sized apartments began, which were like an intermediate stage between a full-fledged apartment and a hostel.  This is how young specialists lived, still familyless (but often lingered in the ‚Äúliving room‚Äù up to the state of many children), so many workers lived.  The number of storeys of such houses was very different - from five to sixteen, most often with one or two entrances and a long corridor inside, where from ten to fifty doors to the apartments were located on different sides.  Above you can consider a diagram that demonstrates this. </p><h2>  "Gostinka" </h2><p><strong></strong>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe "living room" of the Soviet model are from 11 to 25 meters, sometimes there are two-room apartments a little more than 30 meters.  The apartment has a combined bathroom with a small sitting bathtub or shower.  Residents equip the kitchen in the hallway, where there is a small niche - up to 3 m <sup>2</sup> , however there are plans where the kitchen is provided - about 5 meters. </p><p>  Should I buy a Soviet "guest room"?  This is difficult to solve.  Such housing is morally obsolete, and if the room is only 11 meters, even one person will be crowded there.  If dozens of apartments are concentrated on one site, there is a constant turn to the elevator, usually they do not have time to get acquainted with the neighbors, and the contingent of residents is mostly dubious.  Modern studios are, of course, more thoughtful and comfortable than the old "guest rooms", especially those offered by the secondary housing market in New Moscow.  However, there are also a lot of one-room housing of the old type. </p>

    <h2>  Areas </h2><p>  In general, there are not so many hotel-type housing on the market, and this is a popular product.  The Miel real estate agency provided data on the basis of which it can be concluded that among the total supply of "lodging" from a little more than 1% to about 5%, depending on the area.  In the department of real estate appraisal of KG Uphill, they agreed with these figures, but specified that the richest city for such apartments is Moscow. </p><p>  Housing prices on the secondary market of the capital are simply sky-high, and very often many migrants can afford a "living room".  Such housing is concentrated in the areas of the metro stations Kuntsevskaya, Shchelkovskaya, Skhodnenskaya, Petrovsko-Razumovskaya, in the areas of Golyanovo, Solntsevo, near the <span>October Field</span> and VDNH, in Tekstilshchiki, in Ochakovo, on the Enthusiasts Highway.  There are "guestrooms" in the Central Administrative District - pointwise. </p>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  On average, a square meter of such housing costs from 120 to 125 thousand rubles.  One-room apartment in Khrushchev - up to 140. Thus, this is the most budget option - a hotel type apartment.  The total budget is approximately the following: the ‚Äúliving room‚Äù of 18 m2 is a little over 2 million, and the ‚ÄúKhrushchev‚Äù is at least 5 million, depending on the region.  The difference is still two times!  Since the cost is low, and the volume of offers is small, "guest rooms" are in great demand among many categories of buyers, despite all their shortcomings. </p><p>  They are acquired not only by visitors, who simply <span>do not have enough money</span> for a normal apartment.  Some Muscovites do a good business at the ‚Äúgostinok‚Äù, buying once every few years another small living space.  They make repairs there and rent out.  By the way, it‚Äôs not cheaper than a normal one-room apartment.  This turns out to be very profitable, since there will be no increase in prices for the purchase of such housing, because it is attractive with a small budget, otherwise the buyer cannot be held. </p>

    <h2>  "Stalin" </h2><p>  There were times, it seems, recently, when the Stalinist houses were intended for the elite and were considered the most prestigious housing.  Now their demand has naturally decreased, but not by much.  Customers today want to buy just such an apartment.  Prices, I must say, to this day are slightly above average, according to analysts.  The secondary housing market in Moscow notes the high demand for apartments in Stalin's houses.  Of course, such housing is not without flaws, yet it was built from the 30s of the last century to the end of the 50s. </p><p>  But the Stalinist empire, which is alien to constructivism, still attracts with high - four-meter-high ceilings, often with stucco molding, a comfortable, not close layout, huge windows.  In the <span>center of Moscow, the</span> apartments of Stalinist houses were intended for artists, writers, military leaders, prominent scientists and high party workers.  A little simpler, but just as well, houses were built somewhere in Izmailovo or Perovo - for factory engineers and workers.  The only drawback of such apartments is worn out communications.  That is, if you make a good, almost complete overhaul, it is better not to look for this housing today. </p><h2>  Periods </h2><p>  Significant differences can be seen among Stalinist houses of different years.  In the 30s they were built low-rise - a maximum of 6 floors.  The material was usually red brick, and floors between floors were often wooden.  Partitions between rooms were also made most often of wood, on top of which plaster was applied. </p><p>  In the 40s, Stalinist houses added monumentality to themselves: they grew to 16 floors, acquired a steel frame and concrete floors, beautifully, sometimes even elaborately dressed up from the facade, and the layout included rooms for servants.  The 50s, on the contrary, practically returned to their former asceticism, but the space in the apartments did not diminish.  The main drawback of such housing is only age.  The buildings have been preserved perfectly - now the quality of construction can not be found.  However, communications will have to be changed right before the move.  This is electrical wiring, and water pipes, and heating. </p>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The share of Stalinist housing in the total volume of Moscow supply is just over 7%.  The largest number of ‚Äústalinkas‚Äù on the Sokol, in the Tverskaya area, in the areas of Lomonosov, Gagarinsky, Begov, Academic, Butyrsky, Savyolovsky, on the Arbat, in Dorogomilov, in Khamovniki. </p><p>  On average, the price per square meter in the apartment of a Stalinist house is 195,000 rubles, and the average figure is 170,000, which means it is 15% higher.  In modern homes, the price per square meter is far from always equal to the Stalin meter.  And if you consider that the footage in such apartments is much higher than the modern in a similar apartment, then this purchase will cost a lot more. </p>
