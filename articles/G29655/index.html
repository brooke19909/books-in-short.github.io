    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel 5 * Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang is located in the most romantic and beautiful resort of Vietnam - Nha Trang.  This territory belongs to the southeastern part of the country.  The hotel itself has two buildings.  One, administrative, is located on the continental part, and the rest of the hotel with buildings, a park and a beach is located on the unusual island of Hong Che. </p><p>  Access to the accommodation is possible by cable car.  This method of transportation from the city and back is very popular among tourists.  In the evening, when the lanterns are lit, the supporting supports glow like small Eiffel towers.  There is another way to get across the bay - use the services of <span>a speedboat.</span>  But it is a little expensive. </p><h2>  Description of rooms </h2><p>  In Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang 5 * rooms are divided into several categories.  Conventionally, they can be divided into three groups: the cheapest with a view of the hill, a little more expensive with a view of the pool, and the largest price tags for rooms with sea views.  All rooms are designed for two people, and you can always put an extra bed. </p><p>  Upon arrival you will receive a compliment - fruits and champagne.  In room you will find free tea, coffee and mineral water.  But this is not all pleasant moments.  In most rooms, a breathtaking view opens from the balcony, and you can enjoy it while sitting on comfortable rattan chairs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All rooms are equipped with necessary appliances and furniture.  A desk and a safety deposit box are required.  There is satellite TV and more than 50 channels.  All guests are provided with slippers and bathrobes. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Concepts </h2><p>  Few travel agents know at Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang 5 * a description of the concepts.  Standard BB and FB are interpreted differently here. </p><p>  BB has two subcategories: </p><p>  1. BB without park access.  In this case, the hotel offers breakfast and transfer to the place of residence by boat.  Tickets for the cable car and attractions are not included in the price.  You will have to pay for them separately.  For example, an entrance to the park for one adult will cost 600 Vietnamese dollars, for a child above 1.4 m - 500 Vietnamese dollars. </p><p>  2. BB with park access includes not only breakfasts, but also tickets for the cable car and to the amusement park. </p><p>  FB, or <span>full board,</span> involves eating three meals a day, plus some types of juice.  Use of the <span>cable car</span> and boat is not limited.  Entrance to the park for children and adults is free. </p><h2>  Hotel scheme </h2><p>  The hotel complex is so huge that guests are offered to get acquainted with a small map.  With its help, it is much easier to navigate and find the desired object.  The scheme <span>of the Vinpearl Nha Trang Resort</span> 5 * <span>hotel is</span> shown below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The number 1 marks the area "Imperial".  This is the first thing that tourists see when approaching the hotel.  The main administrative building is also located here.  Newly arrived vacationers will first be registered in this building, and then they will be taken to separate residential buildings, where they will be settled directly. </p><p>  Near the "Imperial" square is the beginning of the cable car (2) and the pier of the boat (3). </p><p>  Attractions are located on the sites marked with numbers 4 and 5. The first is open.  Here are carousels, sandboxes, castles and much more.  Number 5 conceals a closed area.  There are also rides here, but they are not in the open.  Tourists recommend trying cars at night.  The track illuminated by lanterns becomes unusually interesting. </p><p>  You can look at souvenirs and various goodies in the shopping pavilions (6). </p><p>  A little further than the shopping arcade is the aquarium (7).  Hundreds of widows of exotic fish are gathered in one place.  Be sure to bring your children here, because this is not just an aquarium, but a whole oceanarium.  By the way, almost all year round there are performances of dolphins and fur seals. </p><p>  Behind the aquarium, on a vast territory, is a water park (8).  This is a favorite place for children and adults.  You can visit it all day, and if you have unlimited access, you can return here at any time. </p><p>  If you go further to the edge of the island, you can stumble upon a small Buddhist monastery (9).  In it you can touch on the cultural traditions of Vietnam. </p><p>  At number 10 are the amphitheater and musical fountain.  This place hosts entertainment under the guidance of animators.  According to reviews, children may also be interested, but adults are usually openly bored. </p><p>  Across the bridge on a small island is the Gourmet Empire (11).  Here is a restaurant. </p><p>  On the territory there is a multifunctional hall (12).  Various events are held here, including conferences. </p><p>  Residential buildings are located on the area marked with numbers 13 and 15. The first are multi-storey buildings with their own beach.  In zone 15, there are single-story bungalows that also have access to a private beach. </p><p>  14 - a golf course.  It is paid separately. </p><p>  Tuk-tuk regularly moves around the territory.  Follow his schedule to freely get to the right place. </p><h2>  Vinpearl Amusement Park </h2><p>  A huge entertainment complex has Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang 5 *.  The water park deserves a separate section. </p>

    <p>  The huge amusement park Vinpearl is the pearl of the whole island.  Even if you are not a hotel guest, you can still get there by crossing the bay by cable car or boat. </p><p>  The cost of visiting for adults is 600 dong, for children above 1.4 m - 550, up to 1.4 m - 500. By the way, everything is very strict about this in the park.  If your child does not reach 1.4 m, for example, only 10 cm lower, then he will not be allowed on most slides, which means that many tears and disappointments are provided. </p><p>  You cannot bring your own food and drinks to the park.  Do not worry, you will not stay hungry.  You can have lunch at any of the cafes offered.  Keep in mind that if you have a very small child, then take a stroller for him.  The territory is very vast, and will have to move a lot.  By the way, for kids there is also a small complex with small hills and fountains. </p><h2>  What is in Vinpearl amusement park? </h2><p>  Guests <span>of the 5 * Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang Hotel</span> recommend allocating two days to visit the amusement park.  It is simply impossible to cover everything in one day.  Come early on Saturday and Sunday to catch the carnival. </p><p>  On the territory of the park there is a water park zone, a slot machine zone, a dolphinarium, an aquarium, restaurants and cafes, as well as singing fountains. </p>

    <p>  Water activities are very diverse.  There is a gloomy "toilet", which is considered the most terrible attraction, high slides with several levels.  For children, small waves are launched in the pool.  And much more unusual and surprising. </p><p>  The entire territory of the park is very green, planted with exotic plants.  The landscape is beautiful, and I want to walk and walk. </p>

    <h2>  Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang 5 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  All comments about the hotel are very positive.  Anyone who comes here will be delighted with the amazing beauty and extraordinary landscape.  Agree, the hotel management knows how to surprise.  Here you can find everything and spend the whole vacation without leaving the complex. </p><p>  Almost nothing to complain about.  When faced with such magnificence, you do not want to pay attention to small details.  Some tourists say that there are too many Chinese people who are noisy and talkative in their own right.  Many Russians from all over the country.  Apparently, the popularity of the hotel is really huge. </p><p>  The food is normal.  No complaints.  There is a variety, although not the same as in Egyptian or Turkish five-star hotels.  If you want something exclusive, visit the restaurants, there are seven of them on the territory. </p><p>  The beach is very clean, wide and comfortable.  Sun loungers, umbrellas and other amenities are free for guests.  There is never a crush on the sand.  Firstly, there are many places, and secondly, there is something to do besides the beach. </p><p>  The sea is also great.  Ideal for holidays with children.  Shallow water allows you to swim without fear, and the water temperature is almost high every year.  The water is gentle and pleasant, tourists much more like swimming on the beach, and not in the pool. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you are looking for a quiet, relaxing holiday, you are definitely not here.  Arriving at the 5 * Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang hotel, you will get a real pleasure from the abundance of entertainment.  Here incendiary lights flicker around the clock, here a child laughs in the air, and the sea whispers kind words in your ear.  Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang 5 * is really the best choice on the entire Vietnamese coast.  Come and see for yourself. </p>
