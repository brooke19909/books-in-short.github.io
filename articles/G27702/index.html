One of them is a novelty for many Russians. </p><p>  The cadastral passport of the premises is one of the most necessary documents for transactions with real estate.  What kind of document is this?

    <h2>  What is a cadastral passport? </h2><p>  Over the past ten years, the rules for accounting for real estate have repeatedly changed.  New forms of documents appeared that fixed the technical characteristics of the premises.  Therefore, before talking about <span>how to get a cadastral passport</span> for an apartment, we will clarify the definition itself. </p><p>  Cadastral passport - an electronic or paper document that contains information from the <span>State Property Committee (State Real Estate Cadastre).</span>  The Rosreestr maintains a unique database with a description of all the facilities.  Each of them is assigned an individual number, the properties, signs and characteristics are described.  Information from this database can be obtained in two ways: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  in the form of an extract, as a response to the request; </li><li>  in the form of a separate document - a passport. </li></ul><p>  This document is often confused with a technical passport, but this is not the same thing.  Since 2014, the technical passport has been replaced by a technical plan that issues the same BTI.  The technical plan contains detailed information about the construction parameters of the property and serves as the basis for the registration of premises on cadastral records.  It is from him that information is brought to the SCN. </p><h2>  Why is it needed </h2><p>  Like any other document, the cadastral passport has its purpose.  Without it, it is impossible to perform any action with the apartment.  Based on this document, the cadastral service enters information into a special register, which contains information about all registered real estate objects nationwide.  This includes data on apartments, private houses, land plots with and without development, as well as information on <span>construction in progress that</span> has not yet been commissioned. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cadastral service" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1338821.jpg" width="600"></div>  Without a cadastral passport it is impossible to perform the following actions:

You can find the following data in it: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  floor plan of the premises; </li><li>  list of materials from which the ceilings, foundation and walls were made; </li><li>  overhaul dates; </li><li>  inventory value of the premises; </li><li>  other information. </li></ul><p>  Having studied this document, you can get comprehensive information about the subject of the transaction, which greatly simplifies the process of its conclusion. </p><p>  It is worth knowing that if you plan to obtain a mortgage loan, the bank will most likely require both documents to study.  You will have to provide both a cadastral passport and a technical one. </p><h2>  Where to order a cadastral passport for an apartment </h2><p>  To obtain a cadastral passport today there are three ways: </p><ol><li>  A visit to the Federal Cadastral Chamber is one of the easiest and most reliable ways. </li><li>  A multifunctional center is a rather long way, because the center is engaged in providing a wide variety of services and serves a large number of people at the same time. </li><li>  The Internet. </li></ol>

    <p>  To apply for a cadastral passport via the Internet, you need to go to the website of Rosreestr and go through the registration procedure.  Now you can download all the necessary documents and proceed to the design.  This method has only one drawback.  To get the document itself, you still have to visit the cadastral office. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In some regions, there is another way - calling the cadastral service employee to your home.  Moreover, for veterans and invalids of the Second World War, as well as for citizens with established disabilities of groups I and II, this service is provided free of charge. </p><p>  In accordance with applicable law, any resident of the Russian Federation can apply to the Cadastral Chamber.  You can also get information regarding any property.  But only citizens who are homeowners or official tenants can register. </p><h2>  Clearance procedure </h2><p>  Now let's talk about how to apply for a cadastral passport.  Whichever method you choose from the above, you still have to go through the following steps: </p><ul><li>  apply to BTI for a registration certificate; </li><li>  on the appointed day, be ready for the arrival of the inspector of BTI for verification and measurement; </li><li>  wait for the manufacture of a <span>registration certificate for the apartment</span> ; </li><li>  collect a complete list of documents; </li><li>  Pay all applicable fees and duties; </li><li>  submit documents for cadastral real estate for review and authentication; </li><li>  get a cadastral passport. </li></ul><p>  In some regions, you may be asked to provide an additional mobile phone number.  This is necessary in order to inform about the readiness of the document via SMS. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cadastral property" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1338828.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Documents </h2><p>  So, where to order a cadastral passport for an apartment, you already know.  Now we pass to the list of necessary documents.  They will require you: </p><ul><li>  application for registration of cadastral passport of the object; </li><li>  a check on the payment of state duty; </li><li>  passport, rights or other identification document; </li><li>  power of attorney from the landlord (if you are not the owner); </li><li>  documents certifying ownership of housing. </li></ul><p>  Securities confirming the right to dispose of an apartment include: </p><ul><li>  certificate of ownership; </li><li>  social security warrant or agreement; </li><li>  the act of acceptance of the house (for new buildings); </li><li>  contract with the developer; </li><li>  registration certificate issued by BTI, as amended during redevelopment; </li><li>  coordination of redevelopments with fire and sanitary authorities. </li></ul><p>  Most often, the original documents should be submitted, but in some cases copies will do.  It‚Äôs best to immediately make several copies of each document so you don‚Äôt waste time later. </p><p>  If you decide to contact the Rosreestr not personally, but through an intermediary, then you need to additionally issue a power of attorney (notarized).  The representative must also provide an additional passport. </p><h2>  Terms of receipt </h2><p>  When all documents are collected, they are submitted for review and authentication.  If everything is in order, the cadastral passport of the apartment is issued.  The term for consideration of documents is from 5 to 10 working days.  It depends on the workload of service workers.  At the time of filing, you will be assigned a day for the next visit.  Along with this, you will receive a receipt from the cadastral service employee confirming the fact of acceptance of your documents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="branch of the cadastral chamber" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1338820.jpg" width="600"></div>  The result of the work of the staff of the cadastral chamber will be:

    <ul><li>  extract from Rosreestr on the assignment of a cadastral number to the real estate object; </li><li>  a package of housing documents returned to you after reconciliation; </li><li>  the cadastral passport itself. </li></ul><p>  On the day appointed for the visit, do not forget to bring along your passport or other identification document, as well as the receipt itself when and what documents you received.  If you do not pick up the package of documents personally, then your representative must also not forget the notarized power of attorney. </p><h2>  Cost of cadastral passport </h2><p>  It does not matter where to order a cadastral passport for an apartment, the document itself does not cost anything.  But you still have to pay.  For a start - a state duty.  It will cost you 200 rubles.  But this is the most meager payment. </p><p>  Registration of the technical plan of the room will cost much more if you do not have it.  The cost of its design is approximately 10 thousand rubles.  True, here you can save a little.  To do this, you can contact private licensed organizations that provide such services.  The cost of the technical plan for them can be from 5 to 7 thousand rubles.  Given the workload of public service employees, contacting a ‚Äúprivate trader‚Äù will help to save not only money, but also time. </p><h2>  Validity </h2><p>  The document issued by the cadastral service has no statute of limitations.  Despite the fact that in accordance with the law, a total inventory of all existing real estate is carried out once every five years, the cadastral service cannot insist on the mandatory replacement of passports.  This means that if you did not carry out any redevelopment in your home and the passport data has not changed, then you do not need to change it.  But if you have lost a document or made repairs with a change in layout, you will have to go through the whole procedure first. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cadastral office" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14322/1338899.jpg" width="582"></div>

    <h2>  Reasons for refusal </h2><p>  Now you know exactly how to get a cadastral passport for an apartment, and you can do it without much difficulty.  Nevertheless, it is worth considering all possible options.  Therefore, let's talk about whether government agencies can refuse to receive a document, and what reason they have for this.  They can be, for example, such: </p><ul><li>  the package of submitted documents is incomplete or contains errors; </li><li>  information submitted by the applicant does not correspond to the data contained in the State Register; </li><li>  There is a dispute about the boundaries of the plot to be drawn up. </li><li>  other reasons. </li></ul><p>  In any case, if a decision is made to refuse to issue a cadastral passport, you will receive a written notice of this fact.  Also, employees of Rosreestr are obliged in writing to explain in detail all the mistakes made and indicate how to eliminate them.  Having corrected all the shortcomings, you can submit documents again. </p><h2>  What to do if there is no information in the inventory </h2><p>  On the website of Rosreestra, you can get information about absolutely all real estate objects registered to date.  But sometimes the situation is such that there is no information.  How can this be and what to do in this case? </p><p>  This situation most often develops in relation to very old housing, departmental housing stock or in cases where there is any dispute.  To rectify the situation, the actual owner of the property must register the property.  Without this action, it is neither possible to buy, nor sell an apartment, nor to take any legally significant actions against it.  To do this, as you already understood, is not difficult.  A paper version of the document will be produced in 10 days, and information has been entered into the electronic database even earlier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to apply for a cadastral passport" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1338824.jpg" width="600"></div>
