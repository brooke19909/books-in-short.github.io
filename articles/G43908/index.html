There are many ways to cope with this task.  Usually, the algorithm of actions is chosen taking into account the life situation.  Below we will consider all possible circumstances and means of recovery / reset "Apple ID". </p><h2>  When is required? </h2><p>  How to delete an Apple ID account?  The answer to a similar question depends on the situation.  The fact is that sometimes you do not need to delete the account, but reset it or restore the password. </p><div class="photo" data-original="profiapple.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Exit Apple ID" class="if uuid-2883755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2883755.jpg"></div><p>  The listed manipulations can be useful if: </p><ul><li>  The mobile device has been stolen or lost; </li><li>  a person bought an ‚Äúapple‚Äù device from his hands, and then found someone else‚Äôs Apple ID on it; </li><li>  password for logging in is forgotten; </li><li>  the user has forgotten the password and answers to security questions; </li><li>  I want to go through authorization in the Apple system under a different account. </li></ul><p>  In fact, everything is not so difficult.  Even a child can manage the Apple ID account, and restore it or reset it too. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Logging in </h2><p>  But first, a few words about how to properly manage the "apple" account.  Consider two main functions: login and logout. </p><p>  Let's start with the first operation.  For her it is necessary: </p><ol><li>  Open the "Settings" of your "apple" smartphone or tablet. </li><li>  Go to the Apple ID block. </li><li>  Tap on the corresponding inscription and indicate in the "Identifier" field the email address to which the account is linked. </li><li>  In the "Required" section, write a password to log into the system. </li><li>  Click on "Login" and wait. </li></ol><p>  After a few seconds, data will be downloaded from the Apple ID account.  The user will be able to work with his account without much difficulty. </p><p>  Important: to log in to Apple ID, you must have an Internet connection on your mobile device. </p><h2>  Sign out </h2><p>  How do I log out of my Apple ID account?  Such an operation can also be useful to modern owners of "apple" devices.  For example, if you need to reset your Apple account before selling. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iphones.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to reset your Apple account" class="if uuid-2883758" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2883758.jpg"></div><p>  It is recommended to act in this way: </p><ol><li>  Visit the main menu of the mobile device. </li><li>  Go to the "Settings" block. </li><li>  Switch to Apple ID section. </li><li>  Click on username.  Information on the owner of the questionnaire will appear on the device‚Äôs display and a small functional menu will light up. </li><li>  Select the "Exit" option. </li><li>  Confirm procedure. </li></ol><p>  In a couple of minutes, the Apple ID account will be reset.  If the ‚ÄúFind iPhone‚Äù function was active on the smartphone / tablet, you will have to confirm the performed operations by repeating the password from the account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Reset and restore methods </h2><p>  Apple ID account settings allow you to reset passwords and security questions, as well as reassign accounts to different email addresses.  If necessary, you can finally get rid of the profile or set up a two-level check in it.  This helps protect your device from hacking. </p><p>  Thinking about how to reset your Apple ID, users often choose between the following methods: </p><ul><li>  work with smartphone settings (normal exit from the profile); </li><li>  Change account settings (reassignment of Apple ID); </li><li>  contacting Apple tech support by email; </li><li>  call to Apple call center; </li><li>  work with iCloud on a computer (using the Find iPhone option). </li></ul><p>  As already noted, sometimes you can simply reset the password and security questions from the "apple" account, then regain access to the profile and exit the account in a "peaceful" way.  As practice shows, it is not always possible to achieve the desired goals.  This is especially true of attempts to reset the profile on someone else‚Äôs Apple device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="support.apple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to regain access to Apple ID" class="if uuid-2883762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2883762.jpg"></div><h2>  Recover password: mail help </h2><p>  Before resetting your Apple ID profile using radical methods, it‚Äôs worth considering how to regain access to the appropriate profile.  In this case, disabling the "account" will be extremely easy.  So, let's start by exploring ways to reset your password.  This operation is also often referred to as resetting the Apple account. </p><p>  The first way to recover your password: use e-mail from your account.  To use this technique, the user must: </p><ol><li>  Go to the Apple account page. </li><li>  Click on the words "Forgot your password?".  It is located under the authorization log in the system. </li><li>  Provide your Apple ID. </li><li>  Choose the team you want to execute.  In our case, this is "Reset Password". </li><li>  Decide on how to restore access to your Apple account.  For example, Email. </li><li>  Wait for the letter to the e-mail to which the Apple ID profile is attached.  The user needs to disclose a message from Apple technical support. </li><li>  Click on the "Reset Password" hyperlink. </li><li>  Go to the tab with the password recovery form and specify the new data for authorization (two times). </li><li>  Submit a processing request. </li></ol><p>  What's next?  In fact, the password has been reset.  You can log in to your Apple ID and unlink your account from the apple device or re-link it to another email. </p><h2>  test questions </h2><p>  How to reset my Apple ID account?  Some people prefer to regain access to their profile first.  If resetting the password by e-mail is not suitable, you can use the security questions.  On them, even when registering the "apple" account, each user gave answers. </p><p>  To reset your Apple ID password, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Go to the page of the account "Apple" and indicate your "Apple ID". </li><li>  Click on the ‚ÄúForgot your Apple ID or Password?‚Äù Section. </li><li>  Check the box next to "Reset Password." </li><li>  Mark the method of data recovery.  This time you need to specify "Security Questions". </li><li>  A log with questions will appear on the screen.  It is necessary to print all the answers in the designated fields. </li><li>  Click Continue. </li></ol><p>  If everything is done correctly, the Apple ID system will let the user into the password recovery form.  It remains to come up with a new combination for authorization, repeat it and save. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.apple-iphone.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to delete an Apple ID account" class="if uuid-2883760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2883760.jpg"></div><h2>  Change mail </h2><p>  How to delete an Apple ID account?  Once access to it is restored, you can choose from several available and fairly quick solutions.  The first is manual logoff; it has already been described.  The second trick is working with the settings of the "apple" account.  For example, you can reassign your Apple ID to a different email address. </p><p>  What is needed for this?  The owner of the "apple" device is recommended to act as follows: </p><ol><li>  Open Apple ID page. </li><li>  Log in to your profile using login and password. </li><li>  Click on the item "Manage ...". </li><li>  Scroll through the menu that appears.  You need to stop near the e-mail section. </li><li>  Click on the "Edit" hyperlink. </li><li>  Enter the address of the new mail to which you want to bind the "apple" account. </li><li>  Save corrections. </li></ol><p>  As a rule, now Apple ID will be re-associated.  The old email address is exempted from the "apple" profile.  Mail can be used to register the new Apple ID. </p><p>  Important: Similarly, you can reassign your Apple ID via iTunes. </p><h2>  Complete removal </h2><p>  How to reset your Apple ID account, we found out.  The techniques described above are the simplest, but if necessary, you can completely delete the Apple ID profile.  It is advisable to first access your profile, then there will be nothing embarrassing in this procedure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.apple-iphone.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Complete removal of Apple ID" class="if uuid-2883761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2883761.jpg"></div><p>  How to remove Apple ID? </p><ol><li>  Go to the official website. </li><li>  Log in to your account. </li><li>  Select the "Delete ..." option. </li><li>  Indicate the reason for getting rid of the profile. </li><li>  Collect data for feedback. </li><li>  Confirm that you deleted your Apple ID account. </li></ol><p>  As soon as the request passes the processing stage, the person will only have to follow the link to delete the Apple profile. </p><h2>  Reset via technical support (mail) </h2><p>  Resetting your Apple ID account can also be done through technical support.  For example, by email or by calling the call center. </p><p>  In the first case, it is necessary: </p><ol><li>  Take photos proving ownership of a particular device.  The pictures should contain checks, boxes of "apple" devices, as well as the mobile phones / tablets themselves.  It is advisable to fit all this in one photo. </li><li>  Generate an inquiry letter for Apple technical support.  It is recommended to indicate the reason for the reset of the account. </li><li>  Download as an application, photos taken in advance. </li><li>  Send the received letter to technical support. </li></ol><p>  If you can prove that the applicant is indeed the owner of Apple products, you can reset your account.  The technical support staff will send the form for this to the indicated mail. </p><h2>  Technical support and call center </h2><p>  Resetting your Apple ID account is sometimes done over the phone.  This is not the best solution, but it helps speed up the process of getting rid of an unnecessary profile. </p><p>  To get rid of Apple ID you need: </p><ol><li>  Call the hotline listed on the official website. </li><li>  Wait for operator response. </li><li>  Say your intent to reset your Apple ID or reset your password. </li><li>  Identify your identity and prove that the mobile device really belongs to the caller. </li><li>  Tell what contacts you can contact a citizen. </li><li>  Go to the reset or restore account form.  She will be sent to the named contacts. </li></ol><p>  At this stage, decisive action ends.  Apple ID will either be reset or restored. </p><h2>  Find My iPhone Option </h2><p>  The latest development scenario is to work with the "Find iPhone" option.  If this feature is activated on a mobile device, you can use it to remotely reset your "apple" account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iphonich.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reset Apple remotely" class="if uuid-2883756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2883756.jpg"></div><p>  You need to act like this: </p><ol><li>  Go to your Apple ID account page and log in to your account. </li><li>  Go to iCloud. </li><li>  Click on the button labeled ‚ÄúFind iPhone‚Äù. </li><li>  In the upper part of the window, select the device that you want to urgently disconnect from the profile. </li><li>  Select the "Erase" command. </li></ol><p>  All that remains is to confirm the operation.  As soon as the user does this, the Apple ID will automatically log out of the selected mobile device. </p>
