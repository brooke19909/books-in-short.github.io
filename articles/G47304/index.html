After all, the Joyetech manufacturers have come up with an advertising motto that this device is for everyone.  The main advantages of the new items are its compactness, reasonable power, stylish appearance, high-quality work and additional functionality.  But you should not think that this little thing has no flaws.  This does not happen in life.  So the described model has its advantages and disadvantages, which we will try to consider and draw an appropriate conclusion. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The miniature performance of the Joyetech 510-CC - reviews emphasize this - makes it easy to place a cigarette in your pocket.  After all, its length is only a few centimeters.  This model is the "reincarnation" of the legendary 510 and 510-T electronic cigarettes, which were popular among users of such compact devices. </p>

    <h2>  Device design </h2><p>  This device has a mouthpiece, clearomizer and button <span>battery.</span>  <span>Appearance</span> goes well with the features of the Joye 510-CC.  Testimonials from people indicate that this model is beautiful not only for its thin forms, but also for the low temperature of the vapor generated by electronic vaporization. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The metal case of the device is not afraid of mechanical damage or breakage when dropped.  The weight of the device is about 20 grams. </p><p>  The electronic cigarette is easy to use and perfectly conveys the aroma of liquid.  The latest vaporizer installed in the design of the cigarette produces a lot of vapor at the outlet and conveys the distinct taste of the liquid mixture. </p>

    <h2>  Rechargeable battery </h2><p>  Judging by what reviews about 510-CC electronic cigarettes are common, you can understand that most users are satisfied with the high reliability and durability of the button battery.  The battery has a capacity of 280 mAh, which is not as much as we would like, but this charge will be enough for the smoker to evaporate 1 ml of aromatic substance.  To fully recharge the battery, you will need to wait one hour. </p><p>  The battery also has a number of properties that help you understand <span>how the</span> Joyetech 510-CC <span>electronic cigarette</span> works.  User reviews indicate the following options: </p><p>  - Battery power is equivalent to smoking one cigarette.  This once again underlines the fact that this model is designed for those who smoke a little. </p><p>  - The battery has a protective function against overdischarge, accidental button presses and short circuits, as well as a 10-second cut-off. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - The battery has the parameter "Passast", thanks to which you can use a cigarette even when it is on recharge. </p><p>  - Reviews of the Joyetech Joye510cc kit show us that people really like the ‚Äúchip‚Äù of the discharge indication.  For example, if the battery charge is more than 60%, then the lamp after 6‚Äì7 seconds of constant burning (charge determination time) goes out, if the charge from 30 to 60% flashes periodically, at 10‚Äì30% it flashes quickly, at 1‚Äì10% - blinks without stopping with high frequency.  If the battery is completely discharged, the light will blink forty times, and the electronic device will turn off automatically. </p><p>  - The device is capable of delivering high power output.  But it should be remembered that power is highly dependent on the resistance of the evaporator.  The battery does not have the function to adjust this parameter.  However, the developers have established a special special function of the battery, which can determine the resistance of the heating component and apply a certain voltage power to it.  Thus, if the evaporator has a resistance of 1 ohm, then the voltage will be 3.75 volts. </p>

    <h2>  Device Features </h2><p>  Manufacturers have invested other qualities in the 510-SS.  The Joyetech 510-CC electronic cigarette has an A-type C1 vaporizer, which can significantly reduce its maintenance costs.  Due to the fact that the cigarette is small in size, a small clearomizer is installed in it, the volume of which is equivalent to 6-7 ordinary cigarettes. </p><h2>  Evaporative system </h2><p>  The electronic device uses a new type of plug-in evaporators with a vertical spiral.  At the same time, there are two such heating components in the kit, which differently affect the manner and quality of soaring.  One of them is perfect for lovers of long and measured puffs, while the other provides a smoking style with short puffs for 1-5 seconds. </p><p>  The Joyetech 510-CC One electronic cigarette has a special adjustment ring at the bottom of the clearomizer, which at the same time is the base for the vaporizer.  By turning the ring, you can open or close the existing slot in order to make traction easy or, conversely, tight. </p><h2>  <span>Additional equipment</span> and construction details </h2><p>  The clearomizer is equipped with glass windows that allow you to control the level of aromatic liquid in the electronic cigarette. </p><p>  Also complete with the device are two mouthpieces - from metal and plastic.  They both have a short length at high steam temperature.  A plastic mouthpiece does not heat up when steaming, unlike a metal one. </p><p>  Filling a cigarette with liquid is very simple and easy.  To do this, unscrew the clearomizer cap and pour the aromatic mixture into it. </p>

    <h2>  Technical recommendations </h2><p>  The 510-CC device, reviews of which emphasize the convenience of self-service, can be charged either through a wall outlet using a special adapter or via a USB port, the cable of which is included.  On an electric network, an electronic cigarette charges quickly enough, in just an hour, and through a computer or laptop - a little longer. </p><p>  At the time of charging, the diode located near the USB input starts to turn red.  After the end, the diode goes out. </p><p>  Users of the electronic cigarette of this model, as, indeed, of any other, indicate that when the liquid in the evaporator runs out, it quickly burns out.  Therefore, it is necessary to control the level of aromatic mixture in the tank. </p><p>  It so happens that during the operation of the 510-CC (reviews, by the way, are often heard about this), a smack of burning appears and thick smoke disappears.  This suggests that the evaporator is out of order and you need to buy a new one.  Find this component is not difficult. </p><p>  To install a new evaporator, a lot of knowledge is not required.  All that is needed is to unscrew the <span>battery</span> and pull out the heater.  Next, a new evaporator is inserted into the battery and attached to the base of the clearomizer. </p>

    <h2>  The disadvantages of electronic devices </h2><p>  Each device created by man is endowed, in addition to its advantages, with disadvantages.  Among the "cons" of cigarettes: </p><p>  - low battery; </p><p>  - A small tank for aromatic liquids. </p><p>  Although, by and large, these are not the cons of cigarettes, but the features of the model. </p><p>  But there is really one serious flaw in the 510-CC.  Reviews of equipment owners tell about unpleasant consequences during the operation of this type of device.  During the pouring of aromatic liquid, the mixture enters the battery connector, which very quickly fails.  There is only one way out of this situation - to act in accordance with the following recommendations: </p><p>  1. Refuel the device without a battery, which must first be unscrewed from the device. </p><p>  2. After pouring, screw the mouthpiece and turn it upside down.  This must be done so that the aromatic component will drain from the evaporator. </p><p>  3. Spin the battery back and immediately begin to ‚Äúsoar‚Äù so that the evaporator dries out a bit and does not let the mixture pass to the battery. </p><p>  4. After this, you need to slightly shake the electronic cigarette, which will get rid of the remnants of the mixture in the duct. </p><p>  5. Wipe the device with a cloth. </p>

    <h2>  Another unpleasant feature of the model </h2><p>  If all this is difficult to do, then you can offer the following option: buy a spare evaporator.  When pouring liquid, change it to dry. </p><p>  Another unpleasant moment is that a small-capacity battery needs to be recharged often, unless, of course, you often like to ‚Äústeam‚Äù, and this leads to the outcome when after 2-3 months it should already be changed to another.  Why is that?  Because the battery is designed for only 300 discharge / charge operations.  If a person smokes 4 ‚Äúcigarettes‚Äù per day (and we remember that one charge is equal to one ‚Äúcigarette‚Äù), then it turns out 120 charging cycles per month.  And just enough for just 2.5-3 months - that's all, buy a new battery. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Based on the foregoing, the electronic cigarette Joyetech 510-CC, the price of which is from 2 - 2.5 thousand rubles, has both its advantages and disadvantages.  However, from this price category this is not the worst option.  After all, you can choose a device and cheaper, but, as a rule, such a device will have even more problems.  For example, the base will flow.  And this will bring losses both in the filling material and in the constant replacement of evaporators. </p><p>  But not all of the listed disadvantages of the model are such.  After all, the presented device was created primarily not for heavy smokers for whom their types of E-cigarettes are sold, but for women who will use it as additional attributes to their external image, plus wanting to ‚Äúpuff‚Äù a little with different flavors.  This elegant model for sophisticated natures. </p><p>  For example, you can recall cars.  When there is a need to operate the vehicle to the maximum, they get a car that is appropriate for the needs, and if you need a car for slow driving and the main requirement is external beauty and comfort, then take a different type of car. </p><p>  So here, the opinions of most people agree that for their declared capabilities and qualities, the Joyetech 510-CC electronic cigarette is an excellent option.  You just need to get a little used to its features. </p><p>  Also, when choosing this device, it is important not to fall for a fake.  Therefore, your purchase should be taken in trusted stores, and not at kiosks or on hand.  This thing is not cheap, so that you can save on it. </p><p>  How to distinguish a fake?  Pay attention to the quality of the assembly, the packaging, whether there is a hologram and, of course, a guarantee. </p>
