All of them are actively used by man in industry.  Shale is considered one of these rocks.  This article will describe in detail about them, namely, what properties they possess, what is their mineral composition and structure.  In addition, we will figure out what shale is in general and how it is extracted.  And now, first things first. </p><h2>  What are shales </h2><p>  So, before talking about shale, it must be said what kind of rock it is in general.  In fact, shale is a different kind of rock with a layered arrangement of intergrowths of minerals.  To extract it, a lot of effort is needed, but, despite this, it takes place in many corners of our planet. </p>

    <p>  More details about the extraction of this material will be discussed later.  In the meantime, it's worth talking about the composition of this rather interesting stone. </p><h2>  Clay shale: mineral composition </h2><p>  The mineral composition of shale is quite diverse.  As the name implies, the stone is mainly composed of minerals.  These include sericitis, epidote, albite, quartz, etc.  In a word, the majority of rocks that belong to low-temperature or medium-temperature materials. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Clay shales are divided into several groups according to their mineral composition.  After all, they have other substances.  It was they who became the reason for the separation of shale into several types:

    <ol><li>  Alum slate.  This type of rock includes those whose composition includes carbonaceous matter and <span>sulfur pyrite.</span> </li><li>  <span>Roofing slate.</span> </li><li>  Slate is aspid. </li><li>  Hone.  This type of clay shale includes silica. </li><li>  And the last view is slate slate.  It can be easily split into small columns. </li></ol><p>  That, in fact, is all that can be said about the mineral composition of this breed and its varieties. </p><h2>  Physical properties of shale </h2><p>  This breed has a large palette of colors.  It is mainly yellow, red, gray, burgundy.  Most often, gray stone is used in industry.  This material has good sound insulation, durability, and also frost resistance.  Slate does not lose its color until the end of its life.  Corrosion to this material is absolutely not terrible. </p><h2>  Application of the breed in question </h2><p>  This breed has been known since time immemorial.  All over the world you can find buildings whose roofs are covered with roofing material just from it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Where is clay shale used today?  The use of this fossil is quite large, but mainly it serves to create a roof, facing and slate material. </p><p>  The stone is very popular for several reasons.  First of all, because clay shales do not contain absolutely no harmful chemical impurities.  And in our time, when in almost every building material there are substances hazardous to our health, this method of decoration is simply worth its weight in gold.  In addition, this stone is quite strong and reliable.  The service life of such building material is not one dozen years. </p>

    <p>  Quite often, bathrooms are decorated with shale.  This is due to the fact that the breed perfectly absorbs all moisture and does not affect the service life.  What material can compare with this type of rock?  In fact, no.  The density of shale, its long service life and versatility make this material indispensable. </p><h2>  How to get this breed </h2><p>  Mineral mining is carried out in almost every corner of the Earth: Spain, Brazil, the United States of America.  Russia also does not lag behind its competitors.  Mostly, rock mining is carried out in Siberia, as well as in the Urals, in the Kostroma and Kirov regions. </p><p>  Unfortunately, at present, clay shale mined in Russia is not very popular, as a result of which it is bought abroad.  So what is the reason for this unpopularity of the material?  There are two reasons: </p><ol><li>  Underdeveloped roofing slate market in Russia.  That is why the extraction of this breed is far from profitable. </li><li>  Low quality. </li></ol>
