The opportunity to take a loan on more favorable terms may be of interest not only to those clients who are in a difficult financial situation.  Rational borrowers see in such loans a way to save their own financial resources. </p><h2>  Internal refinancing </h2><p>  Many banks offer internal <span>refinancing of loans</span> for individuals.  The borrower receives a certain amount on more loyal terms, which should cover the old loan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="refinancing loans for individuals" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/1950519.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A financial institution renegotiates a contract with a client that sets new deadlines and interest rates.  A very convenient mechanism to reduce costs and improve the quality of life. </p><p>  As a rule, a bank agrees to a loan, if there is a real need for it.  In case of a change in the financial situation of the client, the bank will agree to re-sign the loan agreement.  Such a prospect is more acceptable than engaging in litigation in the future if the borrower cannot pay at all. </p><p>  Sometimes refinancing loans for individuals is offered to bona fide payers as a pleasant bonus.  Reducing the rate and size of payments can significantly ease the financial burden. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  External refinancing </h2><p>  Not always a banking institution is ready to meet the needs of a client in need of lower interest rates.  <span>Mortgage refinancing</span> for individuals becomes possible only when applying to another organization. </p>

    <p>  If it is difficult to choose the right bank, it is worth using the services of a broker.  He will help to apply to different institutions, select the optimal payment conditions.  Of course, such brokerage assistance is not free.  You will have to pay from 1% to 10% of the requested amount to the consultant.  Not too cost-effective, but in some situations, a specialist can provide real assistance. </p><h2>  Required documents </h2><p>  Refinancing loans from other banks to individuals is sometimes carried out according to a simplified scheme.  Indeed, at one time another bank had already made a positive decision on the loan, and financial employees have reasons to trust this opinion.  The client will need a previous loan agreement, all receipts for payment, identification documents and a certificate of income. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that a tarnished credit history, lack of regular work and delays in a previous loan can become a serious obstacle to a positive solution to the issue. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Terms of refinancing </h2><p>  Each banking organization has its own conditions for refinancing a loan for individuals.  But everyone has common features.  You can start the procedure after at least 3 months after taking a loan.  No delays should be allowed during this time.  The amount of debt exceeds 50,000 rubles, and at least 7 months remain before the payment is completed.  The client who submitted the application must not be older than 65-75 years at the time of payment completion. </p><p>  It is also necessary to provide a certificate of the amount of debt.  As a rule, this document is provided free of charge at any lending institution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loan refinancing for individuals conditions" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/1950509.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If a guarantor is involved, a full list of documents will also be required from him. </p><p>  Therefore, do not confuse refinancing of individuals' loans with restructuring.  The latter is carried out in conditions of the inability of the client to pay a monthly payment and requiring a significant reduction in the amounts payable.  Re-lending is a rational decision made by the borrower in order to reduce the financial burden on their own budget. </p><h2>  How is the process going? </h2><p>  Having decided on the bank in which the individual will refinance the loan, all the necessary documents are collected.  After that, an application is submitted, which the institution considers within a few days.  In the case of a positive decision, the client either receives cash on hand, or money is transferred to the account of the old lender. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loan refinancing for individuals reviews" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/1950508.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  After completion of the procedure, the borrower agrees to fully comply with all obligations under the contract in a timely manner. </p><h2>  Merger of several loans into one (loan on credit) </h2><p>  It happens that an individual has several active loans at banks or MFIs.  A very dangerous situation for the financial situation, since it is likely that after some time there will simply be nothing to pay such an amount of loans. </p><p>  Some banks offer programs that allow you to combine all these loans into one large loan with a minimum interest rate.  It is better not to delay the decision and apply for refinancing as soon as possible.  This will protect you from the numerous fines that will inevitably arise in the event of the slightest delays. </p><h2>  Will Sberbank help? </h2><p>  Individuals can refinance loans at Sberbank by submitting an application to the local branch.  This financial institution offers a solution to monetary problems in several areas: on-lending to consumer and housing loans, debt debit card overdraft.  Clients get the opportunity not only to lower the interest rate, but also, if necessary, to take their car out of burden.  It also offers the service of combining several loans into one large loan. </p><p>  The cost of a future loan is determined individually by the bank; it can range from 17% to 29% of the amount.  It is possible to repay such a loan in an annuity way (in equal installments). </p>
