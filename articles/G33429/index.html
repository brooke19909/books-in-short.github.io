    <h2>  Fabulous water edge </h2><p>  Tuva has large reserves of fresh water.  In this republic, one of the largest rivers of the planet begins - the Yenisei, there are many other small and large water arteries, mainly its tributaries.  The volume of water in rivers increases significantly during the spring melting of ice and snow, as well as during the summer heavy rains. </p><p>  In addition, there are more than four hundred lakes on the territory of Tuva, most of which have existed since the glacier melted.  Lakes of other types (salty, mud) are also available here and have wonderful fishing in Tuva. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fish stocks </h2><p>  Yenisei, being the water pride of Tuva, is famous for the quantity and quality of the types of fish it contains.  There are a lot of all kinds of fish in the republic‚Äôs lakes, as the region‚Äôs industry is insignificant (the ecosystem is not polluted by emissions from enterprises), and there are very few fishers.  So fishing in the Republic of Tuva always brings rich trophies and gives a lot of pleasant moments. </p><p>  Among the most valuable trophies of fishermen will undoubtedly be taimen and grayling.  These fish species are very demanding on a clean environment, and local water sources are considered almost ideal for them.  Therefore, they feel excellent here and breed in droves.  These types of fish are valued for their excellent taste, and in Tuvan waters they can grow incredibly large. </p><p>  Local fishing enthusiasts prefer fishing in late spring.  However, according to the recollections of experienced anglers, winter fishing in Tuva is often successful. </p>

    <h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  According to the recollections of tourists from many regions of Russia, fishing in Tuva deserves special attention, due to the wealth of local ichthyofauna.  The places here are incredibly plentiful.  For lovers of fishing, those sections of the territory of Tuva where the mountain passes pass near large areas of the taiga are of most serious interest.  This is where the most interesting fishing takes place.  In addition to this type of leisure, in Tuva it is nice to go rafting.  Rafting along the local rivers often approaches extreme tourism.  Many local water arteries are very complex, it is difficult for an inexperienced traveler to cope with the course. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For fishing, as a rule, choose proven routes.  move on them on different sailing vessels with or without engines.  The characteristic features of local rivers are very clear water with a pronounced natural taste.  Water in any river can have its own taste, due to the presence of natural mineral springs.  It is necessary to point out the abundance of now rare <span>fish</span> species in the rivers <span>: grayling,</span> lenok (Siberian trout).  In addition, fishing in Tuva allows you to compete with such a powerful and beautiful fish as taimen. </p><h2>  Rivers </h2><p>  Among all the Tuvan rivers, Balyktyg-Khem stands out as the ‚Äúfast river", if translated from the local dialect.  The river is really stormy, not with one dangerous threshold.  The path along it is still assessed as the route of the highest difficulty (fifth category).  Tourists with extensive experience hiking along these dangerous rivers can go without incident, the rest must be safe with the help of experienced local guides. </p>

    <p>  Kyzyl-Khem is another wonderful Tuvan river.  She is very beautiful and serves as a kind of decoration of these places.  Having broken a narrow gorge in ancient basalts, Kyzyl-Khem remains wide and sunny, despite the complexity of its route.  Large coastal stones and boulders caressed by water are replaced by sandy beaches, and the points of tourist camps are beautiful and varied.  The river is also considered quite complicated, but if you know places rich in underwater wildlife, fishing in Tuva and on this horny river can be effective even for not very experienced anglers.  Kyzyl-Khem, despite the fact that it is of a mountain type, has great depths almost everywhere, along its course there are many vast pits.  The movement of fish to the wintering ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù pits does not manifest itself on this river, but a large number of complex rapids does not affect the number of spawning grounds formed with the onset of heat.  Each type of fish has its own characteristics that grunts need to know about.  So, grayling and lenok are active everywhere, which always pleases fishermen.  But the search for taimen requires significant, and by no means always successful, efforts.  Therefore, those who come just for the taimen need to make sure that the gear is always at hand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Lakes </h2><p>  Tuva seems like a paradise for many lovers of hunting and fishing, thanks not only to full-flowing rivers, but also to deep lakes, where a lot of fish species are also found, and numerous waterfowl live on the shores.  Therefore, hunting and fishing on the lakes of Tuva are always unforgettable moments of life. </p>

    <p>  For the vast majority of fishing enthusiasts, many lakes are inaccessible due to the distance and impassability.  But with the help of a powerful SUV it is quite possible to get to them.  Another way is to walk along forest paths, but only the most desperate fishermen choose this route.  In order not to miss the opportunity of fishing in Tuva in the local rich in fish, but inaccessible lakes, to many of them the delivery of fishermen is carried out by helicopters.  Consider the features of some types of fish. </p><h2>  Taimen </h2><p>  Many anglers go to Tuva to catch the taimen.  It lives in fresh water - in large rivers, their channels and flowing cold-water lakes.  Taimen never emerges in salt bodies of water and in the sea.  It occurs in our country in different regions: from the Kama basins in the west to the Far East, inclusive. </p><p>  In summer, during the hot season for him, taimen moves to mountain rivers with cool water, in winter, during the cold period, it descends into the plain rivers.  Fishing in Tuva on taimen in the summer is possible on a spinning rod under various catchy spinners and lures.  But in the hot months, the "master of the river" is sluggish, dozing off at the bottom, so sometimes you have to wait two or three days to catch the moment of his "hunt." </p><p>  In winter, he is more active, so you can go out with winter baubles. </p><p>  Taimen, like other salmon fish, is not bony, meat is tasty and tender, fatty, pale pink. </p><h2>  Grayling </h2><p>  One of the famous Siberian fish and the personification of fishing in the waters of Asian Russia.  Fishing in Tuva for grayling is the most common way to spend leisure time.  Taimen disappears and is listed in the Red Book, while grayling is still there, although it is smaller. </p><p>  According to many biological features, grayling is like a transitional link between salmon and whitefish.  This fish is easy to distinguish from the rest by the large dorsal fin.  Its body is more compressed than the rest of the salmon, and is covered with rather large scales. </p>

    <p>  Grayling lives in mountainous areas and together with trout forms the leading fish stock of cold and fast reservoirs of Tuva.  There are fish in other regions, but here it is especially abundant - large and small.  Therefore, fishing on grayling in Tuva always ends with a rich catch. </p><h2>  Winter fishing </h2><p>  Connoisseurs of these beautiful places claim that there is excellent fishing in the Tuvan reservoirs in the winter.  Although, of course, this extreme type of fishing in Tuva is an amateur.  The sharply continental climate and harsh nature bring the air temperature in these parts to minus forty degrees, but this does not stop true fishermen.  The best sites for winter fishing are <span>mountain lakes,</span> in which you can catch such valuable fish as lenok and grayling in large numbers.  To fishing areas, anglers in complete off-road conditions move with the help of powerful snowmobiles.  Overnight stays due to the lack of villages are organized in the winter huts heated by wood stoves.  If you are lovers of unity with wildlife, then winter fish expeditions will be to your liking. </p><h2>  Tours </h2><p>  Due to the fact that fishing in Tuva and magnificent fishing in Tuva are always unusually interesting and productive, tours here are carried out all year round.  They are organized in the form of an alloy along the river in a catamaran, or using a powerful motor boat.  The duration of the tour is from three days, the cost is from 135 000 rubles (calculation for 7 people).  This amount includes delivery to the fishing place from the city of Abakan and back, rafting on the river, fishing, accommodation in a hunting lodge, food.  Additional services - video shooting, hunting, a visit to the shamans, overnight in a yurt at the Biy-Hem tourist base. </p><p>  Nowadays, when a good <span>dirt road</span> was made to Toor-Khem (a small village near Kyzyl) <span>,</span> fishing on the fairly plentiful in the past rivers Hamasara and Bay-Khem became very popular, and the number of lovers arriving on these rivers increased significantly.  With the rapid increase in the number of cars, many tourists without special difficulties by individual transport rise to the upper reaches of the once inaccessible rivers, originating at Lake Mayun. </p><p>  Further, local fishermen sail by motor boats to Biy-Khemsky Falls.  There are legends among professionals that it is there that genuine fishing takes place in Tuva, where the catch is estimated at an incredible amount of fish. </p><p>  The most popular for hunting and fishing have always been Lake Choigan-Khol and the Sorug River, lying at the foot of one of the spurs of the Eastern Sayan Mountains.  High shores, allowing you to stop at parking lots, beautiful islands, fascinating climbs to the mountains and rumbling waterfalls - this is what awaits tourists here.  Here you can catch an exotic large grayling or trivial pike and perch. </p>

    <p>  Of course, human activity has a very negative effect on the ichthyofauna population in local water bodies.  In past years, it was easy to take large taimen or lenok, but now such instances are already rare.  Catching such a fish now is luck for any fisherman who chose fishing in Tuva. </p><p>  Today, catches have become not so large both in terms of numbers and in terms of weight.  Nowadays, lenok cannot be taken on this river, and taimen is in the Red Book.  In order to get the best trophies, long-distance fishing is organized in Tuva.  Tours are in places that are almost inaccessible to the vast majority of lovers.  In this regard, it is very difficult to get there.  Mostly, this is the headwaters of the rivers and it is possible to get there only by helicopter. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Many places in Tuva can only be reached by helicopter.  But the passage to the starting point of the tour is much easier.  Most tours depart from the city of Kyzyl, from where tourists are transported by wheeled transport to the small village of Tooro-Khem, then by motor boat or Mi-8 helicopter they are delivered directly to the fishing site.  It is impossible to get from Moscow to Kyzyl by direct flight, only with a transfer to a shuttle bus in Novosibirsk or Krasnoyarsk.  You can also fly <span>to Irkutsk,</span> Tomsk or Abakan.  Further to the <span>capital of Tuva</span> - by bus, car or taxi.  The road turns out to be a distant, but an amazing edge of nature, distinctive culture and life, shamans and sport fishing makes you forget about all the difficulties. </p><h2>  Katazy </h2><p>  One of the famous addresses for stopping wildlife lovers is the village of Katazy in Tuva.  Fishing here is very interesting, rich in catch and for memorable moments.  Recently, such a form of outdoor activities as fast rafting on the river is gaining popularity here.  On the territory of Tuva, there are several areas for rafting, which combines rafting on a stormy river with dangerous rapids and entertaining fishing in untouched wild places. </p><p>  The most popular destination for fishing enthusiasts is located near the village of Shivei.  From here, after three days of unhurried horse riding, you can reach the farthest village in the Katazy region. </p><p>  On the way, you will get acquainted with the elements of the ancestral life of the Tuvan people, sailing in boats on the Kaa-Khem, fascinating fishing and finally an interesting rafting on wooden rafts to the village of Erzhe through the dangerous Kaa-Khem rapids.  An indelible impression of a trip to the Siberian taiga, familiarity with the life of local residents, fishing on the famous Lenka and grayling, crossing the powerful rapids of each tourist will leave memories for life.  The final point of this fascinating route is the village of Katazy (Tuva).  Fishing in its surroundings will bring new experiences. </p>

Including the president of the Russian Federation Putin.  The last time he was in the republic this summer. </p><p>  Preparation for fishing V.V.  Putin in Tuva requires quite a lot of effort.  The president, who chooses an active, energetic form of relaxation, during a short vacation seeks to survive the greatest number of adventures allowed in nature.  He rafted along a fairly fast river, sailed in a Siberian pond, at speed he ran off-road on a powerful ATV.  But at the same time, the emphasis was on fishing.  And the region‚Äôs famous water pike didn‚Äôt get off. </p><p>  For such an energetic vacation, of course, the local authorities had to seriously prepare.  And while the federal authorities were most likely preparing the plane to Abakan, then the rest rest lay exclusively with Tuva officials.  They had to organize: </p><ul><li>  a helicopter to a resting place in the Ust-Abakan region; </li><li>  installation of comfortable yurts; </li><li>  fishing arrangements and more. </li></ul><p>  In the conditions of complete impassability, it was quite difficult and required vigorous action from the local authorities, but it was worth it, as our president was extremely pleased. </p>
