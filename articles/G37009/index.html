Doogee also does not lag behind its colleagues.  The company equipped its new product, Homtom HT6, with a powerful 6250 maH battery.  But what, besides the reinforced battery, can the device boast? </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The device comes in a stylish blue box.  When you look at the packaging of Doogee Homtom HT6, you get the feeling that in your hands is not a Chinese smartphone, but an advanced flagship of the eminent brand.  At the back of the box, the manufacturer placed a sticker with the main characteristics of the device. </p><p>  In addition to the phone itself, the package includes a USB cable, a protective film, a network adapter, an instruction manual, an OTG cable and a rear bumper.  Unfortunately, the Homtom HT6 smartphone does not come with a headset.  However, the presence of a cover and a film completely compensates for the shortage. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  Appearance of the device remained in the usual Doogee style.  The smartphone is completely made of plastic that simulates metal.  The device looks a bit rustic, but pretty.  Rounded sides and a silver back cover add the Doogee Homtom HT6 appeal. </p><p>  Elements of appearance in their places, designers did not particularly bother.  The front part has become a haven for sensors, earpiece, indicator, frontal, touch buttons and a large display.  The controls are highlighted.  On the rear panel there is a speaker, the main camera, flash, company logo.  The back is silver and looks like raw aluminum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The bottom end is reserved for a USB jack and a microphone, and the top for a headphone jack.  <span>The volume control</span> along with the power button is located on the right side.  The left side of the device was reserved for flash drives and SIM cards.  The card slot is paired, which means that the user is presented with a choice.  The owner will have to abandon one SIM card in favor of a flash drive or vice versa. </p><p>  Confused a bit HT6 dimensions.  The device turned out to be large and weighs as much as 170 grams.  One-handed operation with the device can be forgotten.  Although the thickness of the device is small, it is only 9.9 mm, which is very good for a phone with a 6250 maH battery. </p><p>  The design of the model is well designed.  High-quality plastic and <span>Gorilla Glass</span> for protection can only please.  At the height and assembly.  The user will not detect gaps and creaks in the device. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The screen of an inexpensive model looks impressive.  The manufacturer installed a diagonal of 5.5 inches in the Homtom HT6.  The review of the display will please and excellent resolution.  The model received 1280 by 720 pixels, which means that the screen provides HD-quality. </p><p>  They also did not forget about protection.

In a cheap device, such a display looks really unusual. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2>

    <p>  Most often, device manufacturers install a weak battery and get a lot of dissatisfied users and their reviews.  Homtom HT6 stands out even from the market leaders.  The device is equipped with a battery with an incredible capacity of 6250 maH.  A similar amount can be found except in tablets. </p><p>  The battery provides excellent autonomy.  In passive mode, the device will "live" for about seven days.  Active use of HT6 will drain the battery in three days.  The timing is incredible, especially for a powerful device on Android. </p><p>  Not without chips.  The company installed not only a reinforced battery, but also supplemented the model with a quick charge function.  The owner will be able to restore 70 percent of the battery in just 30 minutes.  The device is perfect for people who are actively working with the device. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The model is equipped with a 13 megapixel sensor.  The quality of the pictures is not bad, as for an inexpensive device.  Not without its useful camera features.  Naturally, there is HDR mode, autofocus, filters, balance adjustment and others.  In conditions of good lighting, the pictures come out bright and detailed.  In general, the camera leaves a good impression. </p><p>  Not without a front-end.  The matrix at the front camera is 5 megapixels.  Accordingly, the user received not only the ability to make video calls, but also to take self-portraits.  The quality of the front camera is not the best, but it is enough for a selfie. </p><p>  The user may be surprised that a cheap phone received a good matrix.  There is no particular secret to this.  It's all about interpolation.  In fact, the characteristics of the camera are very different from the declared ones.  The main matrix of the HT6 corresponds to 8 megapixels, and the front to 2 megapixels. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2>

    <p>  Got a Homtom HT6 MTK6735p processor with four cores.  The device chip is 64-bit with a frequency of 1 GHz.  Mali-T720 is responsible for the image in the device.  The ‚Äúfilling‚Äù looks quite acceptable, although it could have been better.  Used in the Homtom HT6 MTK6735p has a performance limitation.  The maximum frequency for the chip with the prefix ‚Äúp‚Äù is 1 GHz. </p><p>  RAM looks much better than the processor.  The smartphone received as much as 2 GB of memory.  A budget employee of such a characteristic is definitely enough for all needs.  The built-in memory did not fail either.  The manufacturer allocated 16 gigabytes to the user.  Also, the owner can expand the amount of memory flash drive up to 32 GB. </p><p>  Programs in the device work without problems.  Brakes and freezes appear only in demanding games.  Naturally, such a situation is expected from a cheap "Chinese". </p><h2>  Cost </h2>

    <p>  The price requested for the Homtom HT6 is slightly higher than for budget devices.  You can buy a device for 10-12 thousand rubles.  Given the "stuffing" and the enhanced battery, the cost is more than justified. </p><p>  Depending on the additional equipment, the cost of the Homtom HT6 will increase.  The price will rise if the user needs a flash card.  You will have to spend money on buying headphones that are not included.  Perhaps you should fork out and cover, because the device is plastic. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Most buyers chose the device because of the powerful battery.  <span>Homtom HT6 reviews are</span> full of positive comments about the duration of the work and fast charging.  On average, the device "lives" for two days at constant loads. </p><p>  The screen also received positive reviews.  Homtom HT6 pleases with saturated colors, brightness and viewing angles.  A bit confused by the pixels visible on the display, but this is a trifle. </p><p>  The price was also attractive to most buyers.  The characteristics of the device are close to middle-class devices, and the cost - to state employees.  Finding a similar smartphone for 10-12 thousand is quite problematic. </p><p>  It should be noted and the work of designers.  Designed not only the appearance of the model, but also its box.  The blue box immediately catches the eye of the buyer.  There is a feeling that the flagship or advanced device is in the box. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  The manufacturer‚Äôs reluctance to change the appearance of its products upsets.  The smartphone is made in the style of Doogee.  Disadvantages also remained.  Reviews Homtom HT6 characterized as a fragile device.  Almost every drop leaves a dent or scratch on the device. </p><p>  Confuses <span>camera interpolation.</span>  An attempt to pass off weaker matrices as gadgets used in the middle class is only displeasing.  Interpolation does not improve the quality of images, but only misleads inattentive customers. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Released in 2015, the device stands out from other state employees.  The smartphone was not enough to enter the middle class.  Despite problems and shortcomings, the device has something to interest buyers.  Perhaps the next model from Doogee will be more successful. </p>
