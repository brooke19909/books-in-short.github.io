Adults believe that the Dim Suite Hotel is an excellent choice for an inexpensive vacation for families with small children.  A cozy atmosphere, reminiscent of home, silence after ten in the evening, normal food without frills, however, no one left the restaurant hungry - what else is needed to relax. </p><p>  Many Russians are satisfied with the arrangement of rooms, although to some their area seems too small.
