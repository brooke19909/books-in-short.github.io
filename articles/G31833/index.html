    <h2>  Short description of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Kadriye Sarp Hotel 3 * can not be attributed to new hotels, but the latest repairs were carried out on its territory two years ago.  Almost all apartments underwent updating, so tourists often write that they were pleasantly surprised by the condition of the number of rooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is approximately two thousand square meters.  This, of course, is not much.  But the guests claim that all the necessary infrastructure facilities on the territory of Kadriye Sarp Hotel 3 * are present. </p><p>  The hotel itself consists of two four-story blocks located next to each other.  Each building has an elevator.  Sixty-four comfortable rooms can enjoy views of the sea, garden and road.  If you are not lucky, and you will be forced to admire the roadway, keep in mind that the sound insulation in the buildings is pretty poor.  Therefore, you are unlikely to be able to sleep well during your vacation. </p><p>  If you refer to the numerous reviews about Kadriye Sarp Hotel 3 *, then we can conclude that a small territory and a minimum number of infrastructure facilities cannot spoil the holidays of travelers who dream of spending a couple of weeks on the sea coast for a small amount. </p>

    <h2>  Feature of the hotel complex </h2><p>  This is often written by our compatriots who are faced with the lack of professionalism of travel agency employees.  The fact is that in Turkey there are two hotels with almost identical names.  Sarp Belek has four stars, while Kadriye Sarp Hotels in Belek has a 3 star category.  In the brochures, their names are often written very similarly, and therefore even the tour operators themselves confuse them.  Sometimes travelers think that they are going to the Quartet, but in fact they pay for the three rubles and find themselves in it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Therefore, be very careful when purchasing a tour.  And keep in mind that these hotel complexes are very seriously different.  Today, as you understand, our article is dedicated to the Kadriye Sarp Hotel 3 * - a three-star hotel in one of the best resorts in Turkey. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Located Kadriye Sarp Hotel 3 * (Turkey) in Belek in Kadriye.  The hotel is located almost in the center of the village, so it is very convenient to get to Belek from here.  It is necessary to go to him about seven kilometers.  To this end, our compatriots often use the services of a taxi or purchase a ticket for travel by public transport. </p><p>  Antalya International Airport is approximately twenty-five kilometers from the hotel.  The resort center can be reached a little longer - thirty kilometers. </p><p>  If you want to arrange a walking tour of the surroundings, then keep in mind that there are no historical monuments and attractions near the hotel.  But nearby you can find numerous shopping arcades, shops and shops.  Fruits, daily necessities and souvenirs are bought here.  For more interesting things, tourists should go to Antalya or Side. </p>
