And it‚Äôs not just that.  The thing is that often in practice this option becomes unnecessary.  Yes, and annoying in some cases.  Fortunately, the operator offers its customers several alternative solutions.  And everyone is able to choose the method that seems to him the best and easiest.  How does the ‚ÄúCall you‚Äù service turn off on MTS? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disconnect on mts they called you" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1143539.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What </h2><p>  More about this later.  After all, we still do not know what we are dealing with.  Maybe this option is very useful, and therefore you should not abandon it?  Practice shows that customers didn‚Äôt always call you from MTS. </p><p>  In general, this package of options allows you to receive SMS alerts about who called you while you were offline.  For example, if you are traveling by elevator or metro, you won‚Äôt get through to it.  Once the network is established, you will receive a message from the callers.  You will see in the text who and how many times tried to contact you.  Plus, the last time you tried is also displayed here.  Initially, all MTS phones are connected to this service.  But some are trying to abandon "they called you." </p><p>  Why?  The thing is that the MTS ‚ÄúCall you‚Äù service is paid.  And the cost varies in different regions.  On average, a monthly fee costs 60 rubles a month, occasionally 30. Not too much, but not enough.  A fixed amount is debited daily.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter if you receive SMS alerts or not.  Therefore, often the ‚ÄúCall You‚Äù option (MTS), the cost of which does not suit customers, is turned off.  Most often, those who can always be contacted do this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Call </h2><p>  For example, some may use the call to the operator on 0890. If you dial this combination and wait until they answer you, then each caller has the opportunity to refuse or connect all MTS services.  Very comfortably.  Especially if you take into account the fact of free connection with the operator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phones pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1143541.jpg"></div>

    <p>  How to disconnect on <span>MTS "you called"?</span>  Wait for an answer, and then inform about your intentions.  Most likely, a call center employee will try to persuade you to leave the service.  Insist on your own.  If there is no persuasion, just wait until you get a request.  After processing it, you will no longer be bothered by annoying messages like "The caller called you." </p><p>  This is by no means the most popular method.  At MTS, disabling the ‚ÄúCall you‚Äù service may be somewhat different.  In principle, the main problem with calling an operator is the huge likelihood of communicating with a voice robot.  In this scenario, you are likely to get confused in the navigation and can not unsubscribe from the option. </p><h2>  We are visiting </h2><p>  You walked around the city and suddenly thought about how to disconnect <span>‚ÄúCall you‚Äù</span> on <span>MTS?</span>  Then you can advise to look at the nearest office of the company.  They will always help you here.  And they will not only answer your questions, but will also assist in the implementation of certain actions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay service you received a call" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1143540.jpg"></div>

He may be asked for identification.  Contact the MTS office and say that you want to unsubscribe from "They called you", ask for help.  The phone will need to be handed over to the office worker for some time.  He will bring your idea to life.  And you will already receive a SIM card with a mobile, on which there is no ‚Äúthey called you‚Äù.  All that remains is to read the message that came to your number with the result of the request.  But this is not all the methods of solving the task before us. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  You can still offer to use the so-called "MTS-Service".  This service is designed specifically for customer self-service.  It does not suit everyone, but there is a place to be. </p><p>  How to disconnect on MTS "you called"?  Dial * 111 # and enter MTS-Service.  Here you have to carefully study the menu that appears.  Look for "Services" in it, and then find the desired option.  MTS phones can easily handle the processing of requests from this service.  The main problem is finding the right service. </p><p>  As soon as you find "Call you" in the list, type on the screen the item (number) that is responsible for deactivating the option.  And all, you can expect results.  Usually after 2 minutes the subscriber receives an alert, which says about the successful rejection of the option.  There is nothing special about this technique.  But there are also faster and more convenient methods in the arsenal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="you called mts cost" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1143542.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  We command the phone </h2><p>  Say using USSD commands.  They delight many subscribers and are in great demand.  On the phone, a certain combination is entered, which is "called".  During operation processing, disconnection / connection of any operator option occurs. </p><p>  Have you thought how to disconnect on MTS ‚Äúthey called you‚Äù at any time?  We dial * 111 * 38 # and send the request.  Please note that our option is enabled by a similar command.  Therefore, do not rush to repeat it in the absence of SMS alerts.  All actions are absolutely free.  And there are no time limits for activating the USSD command.  They wanted, in the middle of the day they unsubscribed from ‚ÄúThey called you‚Äù, they wanted to - at 3 a.m.  The shutdown time does not affect the request processing speed. </p><h2>  For advanced </h2><p>  The latest scenario is the use of the "Personal Account" on the MTS website.  This is a modern solution for most subscribers.  Log in to the system and the option management problem has been fixed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS disabling services called you" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1143538.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Just go to the "Services" section.  All MTS offers are displayed here.  You can refuse them or connect at any time.  Opposite each feature, on the right side of the line you will see ‚ÄúDisable‚Äù and ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù.  Click here (near "They called you"), you get a security code on your phone.  It is necessary to confirm the operation.  Enter it on the computer in the line reserved for the password and rejoice.  You can leave the "My Account". </p>
