In recent years, this element of clothing has become quite popular, so many may have a question about how to sew a poncho with their own hands. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  This robe dates back to the pre-Columbian era.  Presumably it appeared in <span>the</span> Mapuche <span>Indian tribe</span> or in the Inca empire.  For them, the poncho was not only clothes, but also an identifying element, since their color and decoration were characteristic of each settlement. </p>

    <h2>  How to choose fabric and model </h2><p>  Poncho is a very convenient thing, suitable for almost any weather, up to a mild winter.  It is very easy to combine with both skirts and trousers.  Therefore, you can be puzzled how to sew a poncho-cape with your own hands, so that you can get an update with the least effort and time.  Choosing the necessary material and model, you need to consider the time of year when the product is supposed to be used.  The summer option involves the use of flax, silk or chiffon.  For the autumn-winter period, cashmere, wool, knitwear, drape are suitable.  The insulated model, lined with <span>lining,</span> acts as a poncho coat.  Decorating a product with fur or a finishing fabric, lace and sequins (for summer models), you can get an interesting exclusive item that can decorate any wardrobe. </p><h2>  How to sew a poncho with your own hands without a pattern.  Summer option </h2><p>  The simplest version of tailoring is so easy that for its implementation, a pattern is not needed.  For a light model, you need to prepare a beautiful fabric or finished lace fabric in the form of a square, circle or rectangle of the required size.  For example, for a standard figure, you can take a square section measuring about 115x115 cm. Sharp corners can be slightly rounded.  In the center of the prepared material, you need to cut a circle with a diameter of about 20 cm, making an additional cut 10 cm long to one of the corners of the square.  All edges are processed using an overlock or oblique binding.  It remains only to add a fastener or ties to the edges of the cut and some decorative elements, and the update is ready for a warm summer evening. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Simple model for cool weather </h2><p>  To <span>sew a poncho</span> with your own hands, patterns are absolutely unnecessary, since this model is made of a regular rectangular piece of woolen velor (or other woolen fabric) measuring 190x150 cm.In addition to the material itself, you will need about 9 meters of a three-centimeter oblique inlay or braid and glue stick.  Having removed the edge from the woolen velor, the part must be folded in half lengthwise, cut along the bend to a length of 100 cm to get two separate shelves.  Then make the neck of the desired size and shape.  All edges and sections are covered with a fringing, glued in the right places with a pencil (to get neat seams).  Decorating the product to your taste, you can get a fashionable and comfortable thing. </p><h2>  Do-it-yourself round poncho.  Pattern and description </h2><p>  Sewing such a model does not differ much from those described above.  Processing of rounded slices adds a bit of complexity, so you need to make a pattern before starting work.  It represents a quarter of a circle with a total radius of 60 cm. In this case, the neck diameter will be 30 cm, and the length of the product from the neck to the edge will be 45 cm. With these indicators, a shortened model (approximately to the waist) will be obtained.  The length of the cloak can be varied by increasing or decreasing the corresponding line of the pattern. </p>

    <p>  For a round poncho, it is better to take a well-draped fabric, for example, a fleece of 120x120 cm in size. Having folded the cut in half, mark the semicircle using a pattern.  Having cut the product blank, determine the need for an additional cut for the free passage of the head, and carefully process the edges of the cape.  The final stage is the design of the neck and the choice of the fastener option, as well as decorative elements. </p><h2>  DIY do-it-yourself poncho </h2><p>  If there is a desire to create an unusual new thing, you can sew a two-sided cloak.  It can be of any shape - square, round, rectangular, oval.  Features of the manufacture of such a model are the complexity in the selection of matching fabrics and a little complicated sewing.  Fabrics selected for both sides should be well draped.  It is recommended that one side be made plain, the other may contain a picture or be in a contrasting color.  To enhance the effect, it is advisable to include decor elements (collar, pockets, belt, hem) from the companion fabric on the corresponding side.  Sewing boils down to the fact that, having cut two identical parts from the selected material, they are folded with their faces to each other and stitched as close to the edge along the bottom of the product as possible.  Then it is turned over through the un sewn neck, ironed the seam and gently heal the remaining raw edge.  Adding decorative elements, you get a spectacular thing that will not bother you for a long time, as it has several options for wearing. </p>

It is also popular because it helps to hide the features of the figure (during pregnancy or with excess weight).  Such a product is multifunctional - depending on the chosen model, it can become a replacement for a scarf (if you choose a short and tight-fitting one) or shawls, and even a coat.  That is, having spent quite a bit of time and effort, even a novice seamstress will be able to make a full-fledged wardrobe detail.
