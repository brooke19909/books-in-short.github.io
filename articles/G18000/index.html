This small resort town in southern Turkey is almost immersed in the green gardens of lemon and orange trees.  A citrus aroma literally floats in the air.  Alanya has become famous not only for its wonderful beaches and good service in hotels.  Next to it are numerous monuments of cultural heritage.  After all, Alanya, which lies at the foot of the Toros Mountains, has a very long history.  Today, all tourists are told that it was this piece of the Mediterranean coast that Mark Antony presented to his beloved Cleopatra at one time.  For the queen, he turned into that very favorite place where she came to rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Emir Fosse Beach Hotel" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2011329.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Today, tours to Alanya are breaking records for popularity.  I must say that tourism brings the main profit to this resort city.  And this is not at all surprising.  This popularity of Alanya among the average traveler is understandable.  Firstly, getting to the resort is simple and very quick, since the nearest airport is relatively close.  Secondly, tours in this direction are considered inexpensive.  Hotels in Alanya are much more affordable at prices than in other nearby resorts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, the resort offers all the necessary infrastructure for a comfortable stay.  In turn, the mild climate contributes to the fact that both elderly people and families with children come to Alanya.  As for hotels, here the most popular are three-star hotels.  I must say that in this resort, "star rating" is far from always the criterion by which tourists choose a place to stay.  Most hotels in Alanya, belonging to the category of "3 *", offer a fairly wide range of services.  One of such hotel complexes is Emir Fosse Beach Hotel 3 *. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Emir Fosse Beach Hotel 3" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2011331.jpg" width="336"></div>
