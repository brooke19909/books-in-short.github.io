Light and beautiful fur coats and hats - do it yourself</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The technique of knitting with fur was invented by the Canadian clothing designer Paula Lishman.  She in the middle of the last century demonstrated on the catwalk products related from rabbit fur that conquered the whole world.  Knitting from fur is a simple and original way to create warm, fluffy and light things.  Almost any fur is used as the basis for the manufacture of fur yarn, rabbit, mink, fox, beaver and even sheepskin are perfect, although the thread is rough from this fur.  They knit everything from fur ‚Äúyarn‚Äù - jackets, fur coats, vests, dresses and skirts, as well as bedspreads, hats, gloves, bags and much more that may come to mind to restless craftswomen.  The world's leading designers use fur yarn to create patterns.  Of course, for exclusive models only high-quality first-class fur is suitable.  But in home creativity, knitting from fur will perfectly turn out from fur rags, as well as from used fur. </p><p>  Paula Lishman knitted her products from twisted fur thread, so they turned out to be bilateral, especially warm and cozy.  There are several ways to obtain a twisted fur yarn.  At home, an ordinary spinning wheel with a spindle or a household electric drill is suitable for this purpose.  A solid plate with strong mash is cut into thin strips in all lengths.  Fur rags are pre-sewn into a single fabric, which is duplicated with a thin hot-glue knit or fabric. </p><p>  Sliced ‚Äã‚Äãthin threads are sewn together and twisted into a ball.  Then, 60-80 cm of the fur strip is measured, its edge is fixed with a clip on a flat board, the leather base of the strip is slightly moistened with water, and with the help of a drill operating at low speed, the fur ribbon is twisted into a spiral, stretched a little and fixed with a clip.  Then the next part of the strip is measured and the process is repeated.  So, the whole ball is twisted into a spiral.  The leather base is dried, the fur is carefully combed, and the finished thread is again twisted into a ball for further knitting. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In another way, a double-sided fur thread is made using a frame cotton base thread, on which a fur strip is wound.  A drill or an ordinary spinning wheel is also suitable for work (though you need the skills to work on it).  The ends of individual already twisted threads are joined together, a long thread is knitted for knitting and twisted into a ball. </p><p>  For knitting at home, it is quite possible to use a single-sided thread.  It is much simpler, and the product is no less attractive.  The fur plate is simply cut into thin strips that are slightly stretched, connected together and twisted into a ball.  Then they are knitted from this thread in any way, but it is better, of course, that knitting from fur is obtained on thick knitting needles with the usual front and back loops. </p><p>  There is another way to create a great knitting with fur ribbons.  This is not so much knitting as embroidery on a knitted mesh.  This method is very simple and original.  Currently, it is widely used in the manufacture of fur "linen" in Europe.  According to the pattern of the product, they first knit the mesh with a crochet from crocheted columns and an air loop between them.  After the part is ready, fur strips with a width of 5-6 mm are pulled into the mesh cells.  The finished product is fluffed with a brush, straightening the villi.  This method is well suited for thicker coarse fur, such as sheepskin. </p><p>  Finally, you can create magnificent products from fur ribbons using weaving.  Narrow fur strips are connected into the canvas by ordinary linen weaving, when each strip passes, then below, then above the adjacent strip.  With this method, fur ribbons do not need to be combined into a long thread.  In addition, material consumption will be significantly less. </p><p>  There are many ways to create amazing things with fur trim or knitted entirely from fur "yarn".  It all depends on the imagination of the craftswoman and the model chosen, as well as the thickness and quality of the fur.  Knitting from fur is another amazing type of needlework, with which you can create exclusive things on your own. </p>
