    <p>  Analysis of the average diet of any person shows that it contains a dose of a component that is 7-10 times higher than the required limit for an adult. </p><p>  A high phosphorus content is found in different types of meat, poultry, fish, grain products, nuts, legumes (peas, lentils), greens.  These food sources of this element are rich in other substances, vitamins, which are recommended to be consumed regularly. </p><h2>  Effect on the body </h2><p>  Phosphorus is a mineral substance.  The daily dose (phosphorus is meant) stabilizes the state of bones, teeth, hair and nails.  These parts of the body contain about 85% of the element in relation to the entire body. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A variety of phosphorus compounds also take part in the most diverse chemical reactions in the human body and are responsible for the production of energy, the breakdown of protein, carbohydrates and fatty acids, and also contribute to the synthesis of protein. </p><h2>  Importance for the body </h2><p>  Phosphorus is a mineral substance, the daily dose of which plays a role in almost all body processes. </p>

    <p>  The main role of this component belongs to the areas of metabolism, energy production, maintenance of the nervous system functions.  That is why <span>minerals</span> are an essential part of the human diet <span>.</span>  Amount of phosphorus, if sufficient, helps to restore and renew muscles, liver, kidneys, bones.  Enzymes and hormonal compounds are also formed, B-group vitamins are compiled.  These substances are also included in the formula of nucleic acids, which are responsible for heredity, as well as ATP - adenosine triphosphoric acid, which provides energy for vital processes.  Deficiency of these elements in a daily dose can lead to serious violations. </p><p>  The total daily dose of phosphates in an adult's diet is 1.2 g. An increased dose (1.5-1.8) is required during lactation and pregnancy, as well as during the course of tuberculosis, nervous diseases, fractures and various bone diseases. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Phosphorus intake </h2><p>  It is necessary to monitor the sources of phosphorus and eat these foods in a timely manner.  The daily dose of minerals should be as close to normal as possible. </p><p>  Most phosphates come from cereals and legumes, but the latter option relates to poorly absorbed phytins.  Animal products leave about 70% of the initial phosphorus content in the body, while plant foods with fiber provide about 40%. </p><p>  For the best effect, it is necessary to soak the cereals - this contributes to increased phosphorus conservation. </p>

    <p>  A mineral substance (including a daily dose of phosphorus) is usually reduced.  This happens if the assimilation of this component occurs with too high a concentration of calcium and a minimum of proteins in the menu. </p><h2>  Fertilizer value </h2><p>  Phosphoric <span>mineral fertilizers,</span> which are used in agriculture and livestock farming <span>,</span> have a great influence on the composition of food products of animal and vegetable origin.  Phosphorus in them appears as one of the three main elements that play a fundamental role in the development of living organisms (along with nitrogen and potassium).  This element regulates the processes of chemical metabolism, serves as a source of energy, forms the composition of DNA and RNA. </p><h2>  Types of fertilizers </h2><p>  The introduction of mineral substances is done in the fall, so that they have time to soak into the ground and after that they can easily be absorbed by plants.  In the spring, top dressing is repeated, already with high-speed compounds.  Today, the following types of phosphate fertilizers are used. </p><ul><li>  Superphosphates containing monocalcinized compounds of acid and sulfur, magnesium.  Water-soluble form contributes to the rapid absorption of elements.  The range of use of such an element is quite wide: for any crops, soils and at any time of the year.  Can be used alone or in a mixture. </li><li>  <span>Double superphosphates</span> containing phosphorus concentrate - up to 40% of the total mass.  Use for autumn top dressing and root zone.  It is advisable to reduce all introduced doses twice to avoid an overabundance of substances and burning of the root system of plants and trees.  In cost, this fertilizer is superior to simple phosphate due to the concentration in the composition of the nutrient fat, but in the end this option is more profitable due to the lower volume of use. </li><li>  Ammophos obtained by neutralizing phosphoric <span>acids</span> with ammonia.  The amount of nitrogen decreases after the reaction; together with phosphorus, it is one of the active elements in the assimilation process.  This element is good for feeding cucumbers and melons, it lacks nitrates and chlorine, because of it allergic reactions, powdery mildew, and chloroses do not appear on crops.  It is better to use ammophos in the fall or under spring plowing. </li></ul><p>  Diammophos - ammonium hydrogen phosphates, where the main element is a phosphorus concentrate, which allows saving fertilizer.  This element reduces the level of acidity, increases the base in the soil.  Allows combination with organics - manure, humus, litter.  It is important to dilute the mixture well to avoid stickiness. </p>

    <ul><li>  Organic waste <span>bone meal</span> is a product of processing animal bones from animal bones.  It contains 60% phosphates, which makes it possible to make real healthy compost without the use of chemicals. </li></ul><p>  Fertilizers with phosphorus compounds are used everywhere: from the ground for potted flowers to vast cereal fields and melon plantations. </p><h2>  The role of phosphorus in agriculture </h2><p>  Phosphorus is a mineral substance, the daily dose of which plays a crucial role in providing fruits, berries, crops with useful elements - under their influence, plants bear fruit better, form good seeds and transmit a significant part of the beneficial components in human nutrition.  The advantages of phosphates are that they are absorbed by plants in the maximum allowable amounts, even with an excess of matter in the fertilizer applied. </p><p>  In agriculture, minerals are actively used.  Their role is very high.  Lack of phosphates is detrimental to the chemical composition and condition of plants, their productivity.  Moreover, the lack of phosphorus in the soil can lead to the extinction of forests, fields and rural areas.  Phosphorus regulates the reproductive function of the flora of the entire globe.  Without this element, seeds cannot develop, tree growth is reduced, the earth becomes barren turf. </p><h2>  Body regulation </h2><p>  To prevent deficiency of elements, the doctor prescribes a special diet, which the patient must strictly adhere to (various mineral salts).  Norm (minerals in this case is phosphorus) helps to solve a large number of health problems. </p><p>  With a lack of blood or blood circulation, with diabetes, uraturia, okasaluria, <span>alkaline diets</span> are prescribed <span>.</span>  Acid-active nutritional options are recommended for urolithiasis, phosphaturia, epilepsy and other indications. </p><p>  Mineral substances are very important for the body - they regulate salt and water metabolism, establish a stable osmotic pressure in the cells of the body and in the fluids of the intercellular cavity.  And this contributes to the active movement of elements and accelerate metabolic processes. </p><h2>  Substance deficiency </h2><p>  Minerals, food sources of which rarely appear in the human diet, begin to turn into a deficient state.  Most often, this comes from an unbalanced diet, when one or another dish, poor in phosphates, predominates on the menu to the detriment of others.  For example, milk and its products are good sources of calcium, which is easily absorbed, but milk also has a weak effect on blood formation and is poor in magnesium. </p><p>  In addition to eating disorders, the main causes of phosphorus deficiency in the body are as follows. </p><ol><li>  The specifics of the composition of products manufactured in a particular region of human residence.  In a particular area there may be a predominance of certain substances, while others are present in a very limited composition. </li><li>  The depleted composition of drinking water in the region, which leads to endemic diseases: iodine deficiency, infectious infections. </li><li>  Excessive intake of proteins, fats or carbohydrates also violates the normal absorption of mineral compounds in the digestive tract. </li><li>  Improper heat treatment of products during cooking, when many substances are lost.  In this case, it is better to use steamed vegetables, decoctions, soak products to preserve healthy juices.  About 20-30% of useful substances pass into the broth, minerals are better retained when using a double boiler and preserving the peel. </li><li>  The absence of a change in diet during the period of the necessary increase in the dose of certain substances - during pregnancy, feeding, medical procedures, preventive measures.  At this point, increased doses of various minerals are necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãphosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron. </li><li>  Background of chronic diseases that lead to poor absorption of various compounds, loss of nutrients due to chemotherapy, burns, increased urination, vomiting.  Such symptoms can be caused by tuberculosis, infections, digestive disorders, poisoning, endocrine disorders. </li></ol><h2>  What else does a person need besides phosphorus? </h2><p>  Micro and macro elements are contained in large doses in certain products and in appropriate proportions.  They can range from tens to hundreds of milligrams for every 100 g of tissue or product. </p>
