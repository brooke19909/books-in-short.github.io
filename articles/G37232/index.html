    <p>  Securities differ in their properties and are classified on various grounds.  By the method of issue emit and <span>non-</span> issue-grade <span>securities.</span> </p><p>  Any securities characterized by such features as the ability to secure property and non-property rights, placement by issues, equal volumes and the same terms for exercising rights within one issue, regardless of the time when such securities are acquired, can be defined as equity securities </p><p>  Issue - the issuer's actions to issue securities and place them among owners.  In essence, <span>equity securities</span> form the basis of the securities market.  As a result of the conclusion of transactions of a civil law nature, the transfer of ownership of them from the issuer to the owners occurs. </p><p>  The issuer needs the issue for additional financing and creating the status of a public company.  The most frequently issued bonds, stocks, etc. </p><p>  Equity securities <span>types</span> are as follows.  Such papers are issued in the form of registered papers of a documentary form, registered papers of a non-documentary form and bearer papers of a documentary form. </p><p>  The choice of the form of issue by the issuer is determined in its constituent documents, in the prospectus and in the decision to issue securities. </p><p>  When issuing securities in documentary form, the owner can be issued a single certificate for all types of securities purchased by him, which indicates their quantity, value at par and category. </p><p>  Equity <span>securities are</span> certified by certificates.  One such security may be accompanied by only one certificate.  Moreover, each certificate can respectively certify the rights to one, all or several securities with one state registration number. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When making a decision on the issue of securities in documentary form, the organization issuing them has the right to determine that the certificates will be issued to the owners or that they will be subject to centralized storage in depositories. </p><p>  Bearer securities are issued only in documentary form.  In contrast, registered names can be issued in both documentary and non-documentary forms. </p><p>  All <span>property rights</span> and non-property rights, which are fixed in a documentary and non-documentary form, are equity securities, and the conditions for their occurrence and circulation must correspond to the totality of all the features of a security issue paper. </p><p>  Securities issued by foreign issuers in circulation in the Russian Federation are allowed after registration of a special issue prospectus, which is carried out by the Federal Commission. </p><p>  If it is necessary to issue securities issued by issuers registered in the Russian Federation, such a decision is also taken only with the consent of the Federal Commission. </p><p>  The rights constituting a documentary security certify certificates and issuance decisions.  In the case of undocumented securities, similar rights are confirmed by a decision on their issue. </p><p>  Equity securities secure the rights of owners to the extent that they are established by a decision on the issue and legislative acts. </p><p>  The certificates for equity securities must contain the required number of details: full name of the issuing organization, legal address, number of securities, obligation of the issuer to ensure the rights of owners, an indication of the number of issued securities, an indication of the form of issue, signatures of managers, the issuer's seal, other details, required by law. </p><p>  Equity securities, for some reason not registered during the issue, according to the law, cannot be placed among owners. </p>
