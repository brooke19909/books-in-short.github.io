The history of the end of the reign of the last Russian dynasty in many compatriots leaves a ragged mark.  In the Russian Empire at the time of the execution of the royal family, the highest rate of economic development was observed.  The country was about to win the First World War, and then everything collapsed completely and irrevocably. </p><h2>  About the prophecies </h2><p>  Predictions about the restoration of the monarchy in Russia have survived.  The tsarist dynasty left many supporters.  Dynamics is noteworthy: when conducting a 2013 VTsIOM survey on the introduction of a monarchy in Russia, 28% of the residents said that they were not protesting against this.  And when the same survey was conducted in 2006, only 9% of the population gave a similar answer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Monarchists came out" class="if uuid-3039088" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3039088.jpg"></div><p>  Many prophecies about the restoration of the monarchy in Russia have survived in history.  For example, St. John of Kronstadt announced that he foresaw "the restoration of powerful Russia ... on the bones of martyrs ... according to the old model." </p><p>  Another prophecy about the restoration of the Russian monarchy was given by <span>Lavrenty of Chernigov, the</span> old man, who proclaimed that "the kingdom ... will be nourished by the Orthodox Tsar." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Theophan of Poltava foreshadowed Russia that it would ‚Äúrise from the dead‚Äù, and ‚Äúthe people will restore the Orthodox monarchy.‚Äù </p><h2>  Modern events </h2><p>  In the summer of 2015, official information appeared that the deputy of the Legislative Assembly of the Leningrad Region Vladimir Petrov proposed that the surviving descendants of the Romanovs return to Russia.  They responded with consent, but it did not end there.  However, the topic of the possibility of restoring the monarchy in Russia continues to worry many public figures and politicians. </p><p>  According to official statements, Vladimir Putin himself believes that ideas of this kind are hopeless.  He spoke in an interview that he considers the restoration of the monarchy in Russia impossible.  He did not welcome such discussions. </p><h2>  About the good sovereign </h2><p>  The infamous MP Milonov expressed an opinion on the restoration of the monarchy in Russia as well.  He considers "every Russian in the soul a monarchist."  He believes that a republican form of government in this state is impossible. </p><p>  LDPR leader Sergei Shuvaynikov notes that it was the last Russian tsar who turned the history of the state upside down without thinking about the real consequences.  At the same time, a huge responsibility was assigned to him.  Shuvaynikov considers the discussions on the restoration of the monarchy in Russia useless. </p><h2>  About the constitutional king </h2><p>  It is important to note that at the time of the overthrow of Nicholas II, the autocracy in the country was actually already liquidated - freedom of conscience and assembly appeared, and a parliament was introduced.  Someone, discussing how Russia can restore the monarchy, turns to the experience of the United States.  For example, in this country, a judge of the Supreme Court is elected for life.  And the Russian monarch could be the head of the Constitutional Court. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Contemporary Romanov" class="if uuid-3039084" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3039084.jpg"></div><p>  A number of politicians note that modern monarchists do not actually propose projects in accordance with which the restoration of the monarchy in Russia would take place.  Research for the most part involves the search for those of the remaining Romanovs who have greater rights to the throne instead of identifying how the monarchy will be organized in the Russian future. </p><h2>  Who needs this? </h2><p>  Exploring the possibility of restoring the monarchy in Russia, it is worth listening not only to the opinions of politicians.  After all, monarchical power is standing only in cases when it has secured the support of the population.  However, official studies indicate that, despite the fact that the number of supporters of the monarchy in the Russian Federation is growing, their number is still small.  During the long Soviet period, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhereditary power managed to erode from the mass consciousness. </p><p>  The change of power attracts most segments of the population, while its heredity is objectionable in modern society.  The possibility of introducing a monarchical device through revolution is excluded.  Shocks do not want the Russian people. </p><h2>  About nostalgia </h2><p>  As noted by the leadership of IP RAS RAS Vladimir Petukhov, nostalgia for zero years, and not for imperial times, dominates in Russian society.  Few people forgot the school curriculum, which included Bloody Sunday, Khodynka, and the First World War.  Russia was drawn into it with the direct participation of the ruling dynasty.  All this makes the figure of the last Russian tsar in the minds of the masses very controversial. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicholas II with his son" class="if uuid-3039083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3039083.jpg"></div><p>  Vladimir Petukhov notes that, according to official studies, few Russians understand why and how to establish a monarchical system of society in the country, which will show the fundamental difference in replacing the president with a king. </p><h2>  About the nature of the Russian people </h2><p>  For a thousand years of Russian history, this state has possessed a monarchical system.  And while revolutions thundered in European countries, in Russia every leader of a popular uprising declared himself heir to the throne.  The spirit of monarchism has always been characteristic of a Russian person who needs a tsar.  And any changes in the political course since ancient times have been associated with a particular leader.  Western countries and Stalin were called the "red monarch."  In fact, he was.  No matter what the Russian people try to erect over the course of history, the end result is still a monarchy. </p><h2>  Who has the rights to the throne? </h2><p>  The main law, according to which the inheritance of the Russian throne takes place, is the act of Paul I. Additions were made by Alexander I, deciding that his descendants who had entered into an morganatic marriage no longer had the right to the throne. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern Romanovs" class="if uuid-3039085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3039085.jpg"></div><p>  Due to the fact that almost all of the current Romanovs entered into an unequal marriage, few people have direct rights to the country's throne.  They can appear on it only by decision of the Zemsky Sobor.  In addition, marriage to a representative of the Orthodox faith is considered a requirement for an heir.  According to traditions, the king did not have the right to marry several times, possess concubines, marry widows, enter into marriage with close relatives. </p><h2>  Romanovs today </h2><p>  When Nicholas II was killed, the rights to the Russian throne began to possess Grand Prince Kirill.  And at the moment there are two main branches of the Romanovs.  Some of the Romanovs live in countries around the world, believing that the past will never return, and the country should live its own life. </p><p>  One line goes back to Vladimir, brother of Alexander III.  In 1953, Maria Vladimirovna Romanova was born, she had a son in Madrid in 1981.  The problem is that once Cyril, the son of Vladimir, married his cousin - Princess Victoria-Melite, who at that time divorced the Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt.  Similar events continued in the further history of this branch.  But proponents of predictions of the restoration of the monarchy in Russia associate a similar probability with Maria Vladimirovna and her descendants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The wedding to the kingdom" class="if uuid-3039086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3039086.jpg"></div><p>  Also in 1923, Andrei Romanov was born, the great-great-grandson of Nicholas I. He has three sons.  This branch does not have a direct right to the throne, but it can be considered as applicants to the Russian throne at the Zemsky Sobor. </p><p>  Monarchists show great interest in Rostislav Romanov, who was born in 1985.  He returned to Moscow and became the official representative of the Romanov dynasty.  His descendants show great interest in Russia. </p><p>  In theory, the rights to the throne of Russia are held by Michael, Prince of Kent.  He is a member of the royal family of Britain, a descendant of Nicholas I. This is the second cousin of Maria Vladimirovna. </p><p>  Also a <span>descendant of the Romanovs</span> living in Moscow is Rostislav Rostislavovich.  He is a descendant of Nicholas I, worked as a guide of the Tretyakov Gallery, was a rock musician. </p><h2>  Opinion of the Romanovs </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that while some representatives of the tsarist dynasty consider the restoration of the monarchist system to be the country's past, some of the Romanovs have a different opinion.  For example, at the press conference of MIA ‚ÄúRussia Today‚Äù, a representative of the Romanov House responded to the expression that ‚Äúa monarchy is impossible‚Äù in a modern country: ‚ÄúThis is your opinion.‚Äù </p><p>  At the same time, the monarchy does not contradict democracy.  According to the latest research, about 30% of the population expressed sympathy for the monarchy. </p><p>  But it must be borne in mind that many people do not realize what exactly the monarchical system of the state will manifest itself in. </p><p>  Also, many modern Romanovs are very loyal to the current Constitution, support the current government.  The Romanov Imperial House made statements several times, according to which, he could return to live in Russian territories.  Princess Maria Vladimirovna has the opportunity to return as a private individual.  But she has a responsibility to her ancestors, and the return must be worthy.  She does not make claims on property, political authority, but advocates that the Imperial House become a historical institution, the heritage of the country.  It is important that this recognition be culturological, expressed in a legal act.  The majority of the country's population sympathizes with the murdered royal family, the descendants of the Romanov clan.  The canonization of the last reigning Romanovs also testifies to their rehabilitation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Scandals of the present" class="if uuid-3039082" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3039082.jpg"></div><h2>  Discussion progress </h2><p>  Discussions about the need to restore the monarchy in Russia, however, continue to be very active.  The presence of 30% of the population, which is not against the monarchy, suggests that at least about half of Russians sympathize with the monarchical state system. </p><p>  Some patriots express the point of view that for the effective further development of the country it is important to return to the point of 1917, and then follow the historical path that the country followed.  After all, the empire of those times was considered one of the strongest in the world.  And hardly anyone needed a strong Russia.  The whole monarchy has been the foundation of Russia.  At the moment, the struggle between the whites and the reds is still ongoing in the public mind, experts say.  It is worth noting the events of recent years, for example, the release of the film ‚ÄúMatilda‚Äù, which clearly highlighted this contradiction in Russian society by the fact that it caused the widest resonance and open conflict of people of different views. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="In film" class="if uuid-3039092" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3039092.jpg"></div><p>  Some adherents of monarchical traditions, however, note that it is pointless to return to the monarchy in the 21st century when it crashed in 1917.  It should be noted that, despite the formal differences between the various state systems in the country, the essence of power remained approximately the same - the Russian people always got some kind of monarchy, headed by a tsar who was good and surrounded by bad boyars.  It is noteworthy that this view of the statehood of the country remains to this day. </p><p>  There are opinions that the establishment of a new dynasty is possible in Russia.  Proponents of this approach suggest choosing a monarch from an ordinary Russian family, which is connected by family ties with the Rurikovich or Romanovs.  It is important that there are teachers, priests, doctors, military personnel in it, which will be evidence that the family served the Motherland at all times and went through trials with it.  And there are many such applicants in the country.  The reign is primarily service. </p><p>  Another point of view also appears in the discussions: it is necessary to coronate directly the incumbent president, Vladimir Putin.  But hardly anyone will explain why. </p>
