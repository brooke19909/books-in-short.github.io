It has a very rich history.  Initially, Side settled Greeks-immigrants, then the city was conquered by Alexander of Macedon, and then he passed into the possession of Ancient Rome.  It was during this period that he reached his peak.  Unfortunately, after the conquest of this territory by the Arabs, almost all cultural monuments were destroyed.  Today's Side is a modern seaside resort with a well-developed tourist infrastructure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sayanora Park Hotel 3 Turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2114645.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Like almost all Turkish hotels, Sayanora Park Hotel 3 * also offers customers tours of the all-inclusive concept, so beloved by Russians.  This choice is really justified by the fact that tourists on vacation take the opportunity to disconnect from everyday problems as much as possible.  Three times a day, guests at the Sayanora Park Hotel 3 * guests can receive a full buffet-style meal.  For this, a spacious restaurant is provided, which can simultaneously accommodate up to two hundred people.  The menu is mainly international dishes, a lot of vegetables and fruits, as well as pastries.  According to the all-inclusive concept, guests are entitled to receive free drinks at the bar, including alcoholic drinks, but only of local production.  This is a common norm in Turkey.  For the rest of the booze - imported or freshly squeezed fresh - you need to pay separately. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  In their reviews, many Russians who have already had time to relax at the Sayanora Park Hotel 3 * write that they were satisfied with the ratio of the cost of the purchased tour and the quality of the services offered to them.  For example, in the low season for next year, prices start at about twenty-seven thousand for two with departure from Moscow and staying in a double room of the standard category according to the all-inclusive concept for seven nights.  The cost of tours in the high season is much higher.  It can range from eight hundred dollars and above under the same conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sayanora Park Hotel 3 Side reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2114670.jpg"></div>

On the beach, sunbeds and umbrellas are issued for payment.  Towels are not provided at the hotel.  The beach has toilets, showers and bars. </p><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, Sayanora Park Hotel 3 * is great for relaxing with your family.

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Since the Sayanora Park Hotel is 3-star, there is a fairly modest range of entertainment on its territory.  The animation is presented very sluggishly, there is only table tennis.  But on the beach you can get such activities as diving, riding a banana, boat excursions, etc. Those who wish can go to the sauna and hammam for free, get a massage course for a fee.  The main entertainment on the territory of the hotel is the swimming pool around which there are sun loungers and umbrellas. </p><h2>  Sayanora Park Hotel 3 * (Side): reviews </h2><p>  I must say that most Russians liked this hotel.  It has a convenient location in order to explore local attractions on its own, to conduct a good shopping without spending a taxi, and, of course, it is located near the beach.  Judging by the reviews, the hotel grounds are magnificent - pretty cottages, lots of greenery, well-groomed paths everywhere.  It seemed to some Russians that the rooms were not very spacious.  However, no one has any complaints about their service: the staff works harmoniously, everything is always done on time, they always bring clean towels.  And the occupancy of the rooms is good, there is everything you need for a normal stay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sayanora Park Hotel 3 pics" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2114646.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The pool, too, according to our compatriots, is not bad: it is always clean, however, some believe that the number of beds is insufficient.  Regarding nutrition, the vast majority of Russians left positive reviews: tasty and varied.  True, some believe that the waiters are very slow, but this is apparently due to the workload of the restaurant.  As for entertainment, then in this matter Sayanora Park Hotel 3 * is somewhat behind. </p><p>  Summing up the reviews, we can say that this hotel is quite suitable for a calm and measured vacation with the family.  Many Russians believe that you can return here. </p>
