Now the climate system is even on budget cars.  Air conditioning is a very useful option, especially on hot, hot days.  The machine heats up very much under the sun (even tinting does not save).  And with open windows, driving is not very comfortable.  But practice shows that the inclusion of this system benefits not only in the summer, but also <span>in the winter.</span>  <span>Is it possible to turn on the air conditioning in the winter</span> in the car, and how to do it right without harming the car?  We will talk about this in our article today. </p><h2>  How it works? </h2><p>  This system consists of several elements: </p><ul><li>  Compressor </li><li>  Cabin radiator (evaporator). </li><li>  Drainage holes. </li><li>  Receiver-dryer. </li><li>  Outside radiator (condenser). </li><li>  Expansion valve. </li><li>  Connecting tubes and sealing elements. </li></ul>

So, in both cases, the work is based on the transition of freon from a liquid to a gaseous state.  Freon constantly circulates through the system, providing the absorption of a large amount of heat.  The system can also give off heat.  In this case, warm air will come from the air conditioner.  But, regardless of the climate settings, the refrigerant on the way to the compressor should only be in a gaseous state.  Even a small volume of liquid freon threatens to break the mechanism.  In this regard, the system uses different sensors that control heating.  Based on these indications, the system can force the compressor to shut off. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="warm air from the air conditioner" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1917078.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is also recommended to monitor the level of freon in the system.  Its volume during the winter period is reduced by about 5-10 percent.  How to renew it?  To do this, the machine is connected to a specialized stand, where the system is first checked for leaks, and then a new refrigerant is pumped.  The cost of such a service at the service station is about one thousand rubles with diagnostics.

Experts say that downtime significantly affects the life of the product.  The longer you do not use the air conditioner for heat or cold, the higher the risk of breakdown.  Do I have to turn on the air conditioning in the winter?  Below we will examine this problem in detail. </p><h2>  Why is downtime dangerous? </h2><p>  Many use air conditioners without heating.  Thus, the system is active only in the period from May to September.  The rest of the months she is in a "frozen" state.  This is very harmful to the system.  The fact is that the nodes of the air conditioner are covered with an oil film.  With long periods of non-use, oil drains to the bottom of the system.  Because of this, all the elements of the air conditioner will work dry for the first time.  And the more time the climate control was not used, the less lubrication it will have. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Do I need to turn on the air conditioning in winter" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1917073.jpg" width="600"></div>  Thus, production and dust are formed in the system, which then spreads throughout the system.  This dust can linger on the walls even after flushing and replacing the compressor.

    <p>  The next point is the tubes and seals.  Do I need to turn on the air conditioning in the winter?  If you do not use it often, the tubes will dry out and crack.  Condensation will also appear in the system.  After a long period of inactivity, the air conditioner will blow an unpleasant odor.  It is necessary to process the evaporator with various antiseptics.  But to get to the site, you have to disassemble the front panel of the car. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  About frequency of use </h2><p>  When can I turn on the air conditioner?  Experts say the maximum downtime is up to two weeks.  Next, disastrous processes for the system begin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="when can I turn on the air conditioner" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/1917259.jpg"></div>  They cause cracking of the tubes, <span>oil starvation</span> and unpleasant odors due to accumulated condensate.  Is it necessary to turn on the air conditioner in the winter for a long time?  Performing prophylaxis, 10-15 minutes of system operation are enough.  During this period, the oil level will resume in it and the accumulated condensate will disappear.

    <h2>  How to use? </h2><p>  Considering the question of whether it is possible to turn on the air conditioning in the winter in the car, we will highlight several important points in the course of preventive measures: </p><ul><li>  The system should be launched at a temperature not lower than -5 degrees Celsius.  Turn on the air conditioner only on a warm engine and in conjunction with the stove.  Why so?  The fact is that moisture evaporates on the evaporator.  It does not have time to melt at too low temperatures.  And starting the system on a cold engine is fraught with the ingress of ice crystals into the nodes of the air conditioner.  This leads to its immediate failure. </li><li>  Along with the air conditioner, it is worth turning on the recirculation mode.  This is done in the absence of passengers in the cabin (otherwise recycling will give a greenhouse effect).  This is a mandatory measure.  In this case, the air for the air conditioner will not be taken from the street, but from the cabin, where it is warmer.  This will contribute to the accelerated heating of the system. </li></ul><h2>  What to do if the air temperature is below -5 degrees? </h2><p>  As we said earlier, getting liquid freon into the compressor is undesirable.  Can I turn on the air conditioning in the winter in the car in this case?  Absolutely not.  But what about those whose winter lasts 5-6 months? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="air conditioners without heating" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1917076.jpg" width="507"></div>  The only way out is prevention in a heated garage.  Only in such a room can the safety of the system be guaranteed.  If the machine is relatively new, then the system does not start at all in severe frost - electronics will prevent a fatal step for the system and turn off the power to the compressor.

    <h2>  Air conditioning and consumption </h2><p>  Many do not want to turn on this system, arguing that increased fuel consumption.  Moreover - even in summer such motorists drive with open windows, not to mention the winter period. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="air conditioning for heat" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1917077.jpg" width="400"></div>  Yes, the air conditioner takes part of the energy from the engine.  But this system consumes no more than 0.5-1.5 liters of fuel per hour.  Also note that when driving with open windows, fuel consumption increases by 1-2 liters due to deterioration in aerodynamics.  Therefore, the savings are very doubtful.  But a frequent simple system can ruin its important components.  And this is a serious problem.  Repairing an air conditioner will cost from $ 200.  Therefore, once a week, be sure to turn it on at least for 10-15 minutes.

    <h2>  Draw conclusions </h2><p>  Can I turn on the air conditioning in the winter in the car?  It is possible and even necessary.  This is a necessary measure to prevent the climate system.  But you should know how to do it right.  You cannot run the system in <span>severe frost</span> .  It is also forbidden to include it on an unheated engine.  Otherwise, you only reduce the life of the car air conditioner.  Knowing how to turn on the air conditioner in the winter, you will ensure the system a long and reliable operation.  And by the summer you will not die from the unpleasant smell of mold, which was formed due to downtime of the system in winter. </p>
