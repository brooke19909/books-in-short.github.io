    <h2>  Tourist season </h2><p>  The largest number of tourists come to the resorts of Thailand in the winter months.  From November to February, the minimum rainfall in this country falls, and the sun shines quite brightly.  The temperature of the air and water allows you to enjoy swimming and get a natural tan.  A trip to Thailand in December can be a real adventure.  In the first month of winter, you should not go only to Koh Samui, as the local climate during this period is characterized by heavy rainfall. </p><h2>  Weather in December </h2><p>  The average daily temperature in the coastal resorts of Thailand for December is +32 degrees.  At night it is quite comfortable here - about +20 degrees.  In December, the sea is warmed up, the water temperature is +23 degrees.  Do not be afraid to go on vacation during the dry season - on the coast, humidity is moderate due to winds blowing from the sea.  It is not necessary to expect rains at the beginning of winter.  For the greater territory of Thailand, rare and short-term precipitation is characteristic in December.  Attention: many regions of the country are considered as earthquake hazardous.  While relaxing in such places, do not lose your vigilance and be sure to study the signs of an earthquake and the rules of conduct in such an emergency. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What to do during the holidays? </h2><p>  Holidays in Thailand in December will not be boring.  At this time, resort life was boiling on the coast - with noisy parties until the morning and a busy day program.  The weather in the first month of winter is conducive to visiting various excursions.  Many areas offer diving and boat trips.  As for the attractions, there are enough of them throughout Thailand.  Resting in any corner of this exotic country, you can see something interesting and unusual.

    <h2>  New Year in Thailand </h2><p>  For Russian tourists, this direction is very popular in the New Year due to the long weekend and winter school holidays.  Many people plan their vacation in such a way as to celebrate the onset of the new year during it.  A trip to Thailand at the end of December will cost more than at any other time, but believe me, it's worth it.  In hotels and shopping centers you can see dressed-up artificial Christmas trees, and plenty of admiring them, return to sunbathe on the beach.  On New Year's Eve, many restaurants will delight guests with thematic show programs with the participation of Santa Claus and Snow Maiden.  This is the case when you do not have to choose between tradition and exotic.  In Thailand, both are successfully combined.  Bangkok is transforming into the New Year - no matter how strange it may sound, but the main night of the year is most interesting to meet here on the street.  From midnight until morning, fireworks and traditional lanterns are launched in the Thai capital.  The local population demonstrates incredible hospitality - everyone congratulates each other and offers drinks and snacks.  On the streets of Bangkok on New Year's Eve, it is impossible to feel alone, even if you do not know the language at all.  Tourists note that such a meeting of the holiday is remembered for a lifetime. </p>

    <h2>  December celebrations </h2><p>  In the first winter month, <span>residents of Thailand</span> celebrate some public holidays.  The most important of them are: The birthday of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adunyadet and Constitution Day.  If you are going to rest in the Kingdom of Thailand in early December, you have every chance to get to the main events held on this occasion.  The program includes a military parade, music concerts, mass celebrations and fireworks.  If you are more interested in folk and informal holidays, it makes sense to visit the Day of Ayutthaya.  Once upon a time here was the capital of the ancient <span>state of Siam.</span>  Today, the country has the official name <span>Thailand, the capital</span> has long been moved to another city, but ancient fortresses and other historical sights remained in Ayutthaya.  City Day here is celebrated by lush fairs, folk dances, chants and other interesting events. </p>

    <h2>  Memo for tourists </h2><p>  If you decide to visit Thailand in December, you should not put warm clothes in a suitcase.  In their place it is more useful to put sunscreen cosmetics.  To ensure that your vacation passes without incident, always take care of your belongings (especially money and documents), as well as thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables, try to eat only in reputable restaurants.  Local cuisine is quite unusual for Russian and European tourists, so do not try to try everything, but choose the simplest dishes.  Many cafes and restaurants work specifically for vacationers and offer menus from Europe.  Thailand in December is a popular tourist destination.  The cost of tours (as well as separately tickets and hotel accommodation) is quite high.  Exception - last minute packages or bought in advance during pre-sale.  If you have the opportunity to relax inexpensively, check in detail all the proposed conditions. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  What do travelers themselves say about winter holidays in Thailand?  Almost everyone who managed to escape from the Russian winter to a tropical paradise at least once is satisfied.  A trip to an exotic country is always interesting, and those who fly away from snowstorms and cold winds are doubly happy about their vacation.  The Kingdom of Thailand captivates tourists with its unusualness: local traditions and culture, a variety of excursions - from visiting ancient fortresses and temples to trips to crocodile farms and elephant rides.  Local <span>beach vacations are also pleasing to vacationers: a</span> clean warm sea, well-maintained beaches, and developed infrastructure. </p>

    <p>  Those travelers who traveled to Thailand in December do not always leave positive reviews.  Some tourists are dissatisfied with the hotel service or the quality of the rooms, others complain of too high prices and a clear deception with excursion service.  Someone is "lucky" during the rest to experience all the "charms" of food poisoning or even become a victim of scammers.  In order for the vacation to pass without such troubles, one should always be on the alert, avoiding dubious events and suspicious people.  As the saying goes, an exotic country is exotic in that when you come to it for a vacation you never know what to expect.  However, observing the elementary rules of personal security, you protect yourself from all kinds of incidents.  Have a nice rest! </p>
