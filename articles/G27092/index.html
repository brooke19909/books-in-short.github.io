Jeans as a material for home decoration </h2><p>  Denim fabric has been the favorite of many for many years in a row, and absolutely everyone in the wardrobe has products from it, not even in one copy.  And since fashion is a rather fleeting direction, over time, for this reason, and also because of wear, many things lose their beauty, relevance, or simply become unnecessary.

Turn on your <span>creative abilities</span> and imagine how beautifully they can decorate your own home or apartment. </p><p>  Denim <span>pillows</span> just look amazing <span>.</span>  In addition, a <span>patchwork quilt</span> from old jeans trousers can be sewn to them.  A pouf dressed in a jeans cover will look great.  For students, you can sew a wall apron with pockets for small items and stationery.  It will be very convenient to fold small objects or toys into boxes covered with denim. </p><h2>  A new look for old furniture </h2>

    <p>  On winter evenings, remembering a summer vacation and dreaming of getting back to the sea coast, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking a dream a reality would be the opportunity to craft various crafts from shells brought from the sea, for example, photo frames into which to put pictures taken during sea adventures.  For more experienced and talented needlewomen, weaving from twigs is ideal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hand made ideas master classes" class="if" height="499" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/358509.jpg?1395572655258" width="580"></div>  What could be more beautiful than getting comfortable with a cup of tea in a rocking chair made by your own hands?  For novice creators who want to learn how to weave from a vine, it is best to try first with small items, such as baskets, small caskets, drawers and other various items.

    <p>  People who start to create and create something with their own hands, usually afraid of failure, try themselves in something easier.  But with each success, with each new thing done with their own hands, their self-esteem and self-confidence increase.  And this will necessarily be reflected in a positive way in their daily lives, giving every day a wonderful mood from the birth of new ideas for further creativity and contemplation of already created and realized goals. </p><h2>  Shabby chic outfit </h2><p>  Let's look at how to make a shabby wooden blank in the style of shabby chic. </p><p>  For this we need the following materials: </p><ul><li>  wooden blank; </li><li>  paper napkins; </li><li>  laundry soap; </li><li>  picture or film for fidecor; </li><li>  paraffin or wax (you can use a simple candle); </li><li>  colorless varnish; </li><li>  acrylic paint - light or dark. </li></ul><p>  Instruments: </p><ul><li>  sandpaper; </li><li>  tassel. </li></ul><p>  Work Stages: </p><p>  1. Place the wooden blank on a simple napkin.  Take fine sandpaper and sand its surface.  Blow off the dust. </p><p>  2. Coat the workpiece with dark acrylic paint.  Dry with a hairdryer. </p><p>  3. Take paraffin and rub the board thoroughly on all sides.  Pay particular attention to edges and corners. </p><p>  4. Using a brush, coat the surface with a solution of any soap (but it is better to use a household one).  Dry with a hairdryer. </p><p>  5. Take a light acrylic paint.  Apply it to the workpiece in a very thin layer.  Make sure that dark paint does not appear.  Dry it. </p><p>  6. Use <span>sandpaper to</span> create small scuffs. </p><p>  7. Varnish the entire surface of the workpiece.  Dry it. </p><p>  8. Take a film for Friedecor, moisten and attach to the product.  Gently smooth with a paper towel. </p><p>  9. Coat the entire blank with clearcoat again.  Dry it. </p><p>  As you saw, the hand-made is quite simple, and its technique is available to everyone. </p>
