    <h2>  Impressions of vacationers about the hotel staff </h2><p>  As for the employees of Dizalya Palm Garden 5 *, reviews about them are mostly positive.  However, due to the fact that most Europeans (most often Germans) rest in the hotel, not all the staff speak Russian.  So, according to our compatriots, only one of the reception administrators, an animator and a cook in a restaurant speaks Russian.  However, you will not have communication problems, since it is quite enough to recall a little the school curriculum of English or German.  In an extreme case, you can always ask for help from Russian-speaking employees.  The rest of the hotel staff left a pleasant impression. </p>
