And that they acquired all the human qualities that are familiar to us, judgments and psychology only with the appearance of the species Homo sapiens.  But with this reasoning one can argue.  For example, scientists found the graves of our humanoid ancestors several million years old, and it was found that even flowers were brought to the burial places! </p><p>  With all the incredibility of the fact - this is true.  At the graves were found traces of clusters of pollen from plants that grew in completely different places.  So, our ancestors even then had some kind of understanding of the afterlife.  Perhaps it is <span>abstract thinking</span> and imagination that is the line between the animal and man. </p><h2>  Kinds </h2>

    <p>  The definition of time can be attributed to a number of things and disciplines, such as physics, psychology, philosophy, literature and art.  In the classical sense, this is a quantity determined by the duration of a process: whether it is the decay of a radioactive element in an <span>atomic clock</span> or the movement of a planet around its axis - a change of day.  In the article, we will analyze each of them in detail.  Let's start with the simplest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Metrological </h2><p>  In metrology, time is determined by three parameters.  On the coordinate axis, when the determination takes place on some scale or takes its count, depending on certain data.  For example, well-known calendars, watches, chronometers, local and world time. </p><p>  The second type is relative.  In this case, the measurement occurs between the moments of any two events.  For example, between morning awakening and going to bed. </p><p>  Well, the third and last parameter is subjective.  It is measured by several different frequency processes.  Simply put, this is precisely the case when, depending on the situation, time for a person lasts at different speeds, subjectively for him. </p><p>  These are the most common examples of such a complex concept.  But is it possible to give a definition of time?  After all, this is one of the universal properties of matter along with space. </p><h2>  Explanatory Dictionaries </h2>

    <p>  If you resort to the help of dictionaries, you can see that each author and compiler uses, although close to others, his own explanation of what time is.  For example, Ozhegov gave this the following definition: "The interval of one or another duration, in which something is happening, the successive change of hours, days, years."  This is precisely the literary definition of the word "time." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Philosophy </h2><p>  In this science, everything is somewhat more complicated, and the question of what time is, each philosopher answers in his own way.  But fortunately, there is a generally accepted definition.  According to the encyclopedia, time in philosophy is an irreversible course of events that moves from the past through the present and strives into the future. </p><p>  This problem was posed by the ancient scientists, and the debate has not subsided to this day, after several thousand years.  And one of the first who thought about this was the well-known Plato. </p><p>  According to his writings and ideas, time in philosophy is (a definition was given to them as follows) "a moving semblance of eternity."  And a little later, his ideas were developed and supplemented by the no less wise Aristotle, calling time "a measure of movement." </p><h2>  Psychology </h2>

    <p>  In psychology, everything is somewhat simpler.  And the passage of time or its other manifestations are measured solely by the observer.  Simply put, as already mentioned, for all, time goes differently.  When we are annoyed, tired or engaged in monotonous unloved work, it stretches much slower than usual, as if on purpose.  And vice versa - when the mood is excellent and nothing worries, you are surprised to notice how quietly it flies. </p><p>  So the saying "lovers do not watch the clock" is a very scientific justification - in this condition, the concentration of endorphin (the hormone of happiness) in the blood increases significantly, and time goes faster. </p><h2>  <span>What is time</span> in physics?

    <p>  If we take the laws of classical physics as a basis, then this is a continuous quantity, which is not determined by anything.  And for convenience in life, a certain sequence of events is taken as the basis for its measurement, for example, periods of the Earth's rotation around its axis, the Sun or the work of the clock mechanism. </p><p>  But the most interesting part begins if we take a closer look at relativistic physics.  According to her, time tends to slow down or accelerate, and this is not fantastic: we encounter such phenomena every day in everyday life, but they are so miserable that we do not notice. </p><p>  Simply put, time can slow down and accelerate under the influence of gravitational forces.  For example, on the first floor of a skyscraper and on the last, the clocks will go at different speeds, but under normal conditions you can‚Äôt notice this, the difference will be so small.  But if you bring them to a black hole, then their course in comparison with those left on Earth will be slower. </p><h2>  Time.  Literary definition </h2><p>  If we take the work as a basis, then this is a prerequisite for plot development.  As in reality, in fiction it develops from the past to the future.  But sometimes special tricks are used, such as inserts from a past hero or heroes. </p>
