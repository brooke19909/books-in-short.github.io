    <h2>  Kurskaya - where is it? </h2><p>  There is a Kurskaya metro station in the <span>center of Moscow</span> .  Kursky station is located here (the station was named after him). </p><p>  Having walked up a flight of stairs in the center of the hall from the Kurskaya ring line station, you can make the transition to the Arbat-Pokrovskaya line, and through the lobby at the southern exit - to the Chkalovskaya line of the Ljubljana line.  The northern entrance hall of this metro station leads out on the one hand to the Arbat-Pokrovskaya line, and on the other to the Kursky station. </p><h2>  A little history of the station </h2><p>  The construction of the Moscow Metro began in 1931 from Rusakovskaya Street, in Sokolniki, by digging a mine with ordinary shovels.  This, of course, significantly slowed down the pace of the planned work.  Initially, it was supposed to build an elevated underground, and only in the center of the capital at a shallow depth they planned to build a small underground part of it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Catastrophically lacked workers.  Indigenous Muscovites were skeptical of this and did not go to work here.  And only a call to youth helped to continue this grandiose construction.  The profession of a metro builder in those days became honorable and significant. </p><p>  The first stage of the metro opened in 1935, and already in 1938 the Kurskaya metro station was launched in the second stage.  Kursky Station, or rather its building, was built at the end of the XIX century.  After that, it was reconstructed several times, so nowadays it looks quite solid and respectable. </p>

    <h2>  Station design </h2><p>  The metro station at the Kursk station differs from all other Moscow stations not only in its external appearance, but also in its architectural style.  Indeed, the leading specialist Polyakov, together with experienced engineers Komarov and Kibardin, at one time created a special construction of it - a three-vaulted pylon with a deep foundation. </p><p>  To this day, light gray marble reveals the pylons of the station.  The track walls are framed on top with white <span>glazed ceramic tiles,</span> and black marble at the bottom.  On the round ventilation openings closed by gilded lattices, beautiful lamps are strengthened.  The arch of the main hall is illuminated by several huge chandeliers resembling small suns. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How the station communicates with the station </h2><p>  A complex system of underground and elevated buildings, which provides entrances and exits to the other metro lines, communication with a large station and its internal premises give this station scale and grandeur. </p>

    <p>  The cash pavilion, which is separated from the round transition chamber, is decorated with four oval pylons and cylindrical columns supporting the ceiling.  A line of turnstiles is located along them.  The whole room is decorated in dark, austere colors. </p><p>  All walls with pylons and columns are covered with dark, almost black, interspersed with white marble, imported from the deposits of Davalu.  The floor is made of black gabbro and gray granite slabs.  The three staircases leading to the box office pavilion are finished in white marble, with the middle, the widest, leading you to the waiting room at Kursky Station. </p><p>  The metro station (the diagram presents it very clearly) at first glance it will seem confusing and complicated, but after a short and careful study for any person its ‚Äúmazes‚Äù will become accessible. </p><h2>  Ground Pavilion </h2><p>  The metro station on which Kursky Station is located also includes a ground pavilion decorated with a four-column portico, unusual <span>arched openings</span> and ornamental patterns on its facade.  The design of the lobby of the station is somewhat reminiscent of temple buildings, it is located under an octagonal ribbed dome.  The entrance is indicated by rectangular high-rise pylons, on the inside of which huge swords are minted with bronze with two handles twined with a garland.  Powerful beams are laid on round columns, on which this dome rests.  On the beams themselves, capital letters engraved the words from the anthem of the USSR. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Metro station at Kursk station" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20675/468187.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><p>  One of the largest in the capital, among the nine available, is considered to be Kursky Station.  The <span>metro station (subway map</span> allows you to quickly find the desired station), which is the station is the same name.  The station is located at: Zemlyanoy Val, 29. It is very close to the Garden Ring.  It is from here that fast trains depart, as well as commuter trains in the Gorky and Kursk directions.  Commodity trains do not run through this station.

Travel time will be only 40-50 minutes. </p>
