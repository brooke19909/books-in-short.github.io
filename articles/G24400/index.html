    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  Semiramis Village 4 * (Hersonissos) was built in 1993.  The last restoration was carried out in 2007, because the hotel looks quite modern.  The hotel's location is advantageous - very close to the sea, you can walk to the beach in a few minutes.  True, the hotel rises on a hill.  This is both a plus and a minus.  The good thing is that due to this particular arrangement of the building, the rooms offer stunning panoramic sea views.  And the minus is that for many, the descent to the beach seems tedious and long.  In particular, the elderly, visitors with children and just those who do not like to walk a lot.  However, you can find out about this in advance and not go to the hotel. </p><p>  But the airport is located nearby - only 30 kilometers away.  He is in Heraklion.  And literally 5 minutes from here you can drive to the center of Hersonissos, which, incidentally, is very loved by young people.  After all, there are many different night clubs, discos and restaurants.  So in the evening life in Hersonissos is just beginning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Guests staying at the hotel </h2><p>  Semiramis Village 4 * reviews get mostly good.  People who rested in this hotel, first of all, advise it to those who want a budget vacation with the all-inclusive service and in a picturesque place.  But, since the complex is located on a mountain, it is not suitable for everyone. </p><p>  There is a good, clean sea.  There are paid sunbeds on the beaches, but tourists claim that you can do without them - a spread towel will be enough.  The beach is clean, they clean it every day, there is no garbage, the sand is pleasant.  Sunset at sea is also successful.  The cleaning of the rooms themselves is also not bad.  The apartments are cleaned daily and towels are changed to clean. </p><p>  Still pleased with the location.  The hotel is located in a fairly secluded place, but there is a bus stop nearby where buses run regularly in different directions.  So getting to the sights or entertainment is not difficult.  By the way, you can drive to the water park in five minutes.  In general, car rental is quite modest, you can afford a car. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that smoking is allowed on the territory of this hotel and in the rooms.  But cigarette prices are very high, you need to take this fact into account. </p>

    <h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  Composing reviews about Semiramis Village 4 *, many guests give other tourists tips for the future.  So, for example, if you leave a tip for the maids on the bed (1 euro, for example), then bed linen will be changed every day.  It is even better to take rooms on the highest floors - from their windows a magnificent view of the sea surface opens.  This is impressive.  Especially the dawn from the sea. </p><p>  Some do not have enough entertainment, since there are only periodic concerts and live music.  Therefore, it is better to plan your rest and leisure in advance.  Down below, not far from the hotel, there are good taverns with reasonable prices, and if tourists don‚Äôt order all-inclusive, you can have lunch there. </p><p>  And yet, planning to stay at 4 * Semiramis Village (Hersonissos), it is worth booking a room in advance, a few months before the trip.  Especially if you want to come there in the summer.  Since closer to the beginning of the holiday season, almost all rooms for most dates are occupied.  And it is better to take care of housing in advance. </p>
