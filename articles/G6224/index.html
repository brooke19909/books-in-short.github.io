  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cocos Islands: photos and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the approach of a well-deserved vacation, many think about where to go on vacation this time.  After all, you won‚Äôt surprise anyone with the ordinary sea, but the Cocos Islands are something new!  The main advantage of holidays on the islands is their remoteness from civilization.  Here you will forget about the bustle of the city and plunge into the world of wild, but at the same time beautiful nature. </p><h2>  Islands located in the Indian Ocean </h2><p>  Coconut islands are a group of small coral islands (there are 27 in total), which are located close to each other and have the same origin and similar geological structure. </p><p>  The archipelago is so called due to the fact that on its territory there are a large number of coconut palms.  Since the pioneer of the islands was William Killing (1609), in honor of him the second name of the archipelago is Keeling. </p><p>  On the map you can see in which ocean the Cocos Islands are - this is the Indian Ocean, or rather, its northeastern part.  If we consider the situation relative to the Australian continent, the islands are approximately 2100 kilometers north-west of it. </p><p>  Since 1831, the Cocos Islands belonged to Britain, but the Australian government eventually acquired the rights to them.  Keeling is currently part of the Australian Outer Territories and is managed by a separate government department. </p><p>  Of the total number of islands inhabited, only two are: West Isle and Home.  The population of the Cocos Islands is small, only 596 people, of which 90% are Malays.  The official language is English.  Residents of the islands predominantly profess Islam (about 80%).  The monetary unit is the <span>Australian dollar.</span>  It is believed that the capital of Cocos Islands is West Island (population 150 people). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelingomaldives.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coconut Keeling Island" class="if uuid-2331629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2331629.jpg"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The weather on Keeling Island is fairly constant, there are no changes depending on the time of year.  The climate is tropical humid.  The average temperature in the Cocos Islands ranges from +26 to +28 ¬∞ C.  Due to humid winds, there is no heat, but thanks to them, short-term showers periodically pass.  The most dangerous time to stay on the islands is the period from October to April, since this time of year is characterized by cyclones that can cause minor damage. </p><h2>  How to get to Keeling Islands? </h2><p>  Due to the presence of coral reefs, shipping in the Cocos Islands area is not developed, respectively, there are no ports for cruise liners.  So how do you get to this wonderful place?  Among the tourists visiting this archipelago, there are many who can afford to arrive on their own yacht (after all, it can be moored to almost every shore) or small passenger ships.  The islands can also be reached by air, as there is a small international airport on the island of West Island called the Cocos Island Archipelago. </p><h2>  Accommodation for tourists </h2><p>  In total, there are 5 hotel complexes on the Keeling Islands.  Typically, hotel houses are single-story buildings that look like bungalows or huts.  It is worth noting that the service in hotels is not at the highest level.  However, living conditions are acceptable for a place that is so remote from civilization. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  One of the most popular hotels is Cocos Castaway.  He gained his fame due to modern amenities in the rooms, as well as good service.  Rooms feature flat-screen TVs and microwaves.  In general, the hotel is very comfortable and luxurious. </p><h2>  Passive vacation for tourists </h2><p>  If the locals are serving airports and visiting tourists, then other activities are provided for people resting here.  It is worth noting that Keeling Island is designed more for <span>passive recreation.</span>  <span>This</span> place is suitable for those people who want to relax from the hustle and bustle of civilization, unite with nature and recharge from it with energy.  Most often, visiting tourists prefer to sunbathe on the beach, absorbing solar energy.  Therefore, the beaches here are well equipped, their feature is the lack of infrastructure.  Water has a beautiful emerald color and is distinguished by its purity.  Photos of Cocos Islands are presented in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cocoskeelingislands.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Keeling Island" class="if uuid-2331639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2331639.jpg"></div><p>  The most popular beaches are those located on the island of Home, but there are good places in the vicinity of West Island. </p><h2>  Active leisure for tourists </h2><p>  For those who prefer a more energetic vacation, entertainment is also provided.  For example, diving is considered very popular on Keeling Islands.  Fans of diving and snorkeling prefer these islands due to the abundance of flora and fauna near the coral reef, which near the archipelago truly has a charming look and fabulous shapes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another entertainment will be surface or underwater fishing (everything you need for this lesson is provided).  Canoe safari is also popular. </p><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Near the Cocos Islands, there are many species of tropical fish that differ in bright colors.  Unlike harmless fish, mooring eels and coral snakes live in the waters of Keeling, which can be harmful to humans, as they are poisonous.  Immersion in water should be carried out in the lagoon, as around the islands the water is teeming with predators, especially sharks.  Therefore, when diving, you need to remember safety. </p><p>  As mentioned above, the flora and fauna on the islands are very diverse and have rare species.  For those who love wildlife, there is the Pulu National Park (operating since 1995).  It has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1200 square meters, includes an environmental zone on the island of North Keeling. </p><p>  From the living creatures on the island there is a wide variety of sea turtles, and you can also see many sea birds. </p><h2>  Islands in Thailand </h2><p>  Especially beautiful Cocos Islands in Thailand.  One of the most attractive is Koh Kood, which is the fourth largest island in Thailand.  A less popular, but no less beautiful island is Koh Maprao, which is located off the coast of Phuket. </p><h2>  Koh Kood Island </h2><p>  Koh Kood is famous for its abundance of excellent waterfalls.  Of the attractions, you can visit the Golden Bell Temple, which is known for having a large number of monkeys.  You can also visit the plantations of pineapples, rubber, tapioca and a colorful national market. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mpora.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Koh Kood Island" class="if uuid-2331677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2331677.jpg"></div><p>  Another attraction for tourists is diving.  You can take a snorkel mask and swim in the coral zone, memories of such beauty will remain for a long time, since the underwater world of the island of Koh Kood is very rich and diverse. </p><p>  Koh Kood is a coconut island in Thailand where you can: visit the real tropics and admire the views of coral reefs, swim in the warm sea and recharge with the energy of the sun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tablethotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View Kood" class="if uuid-2331683" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2331683.jpg"></div><p>  As for nutrition, during a vacation on this coconut island you definitely will not stay hungry, as there is a wide variety of local food and drinks. </p><p>  There are 7 beaches on the island.  And several hotels, the best of which are Cham's House Resort 4 * (bungalows are located directly on the beach, there is Internet) and Away Resort Koh Kood 3 * (located near the beach, there is no Internet). </p><h2>  Koh Maprao Island </h2><p>  Near the popular tourist destination Phuket is another coconut island (500 meters).  The territory of the island is very small and is only 2.5 to 1.5 kilometers.  The island has a jungle of coconut trees, as well as pristine sandy beaches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="trvl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photos of Koh Maprao Island" class="if uuid-2331709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2331709.jpg"></div><p>  Due to the fact that two warm currents converge off the coast of Koh Maprao, oysters grow sparkling pearls.  Local pearls are very valuable in Thailand, they are also exported to other countries.  For this reason, the island acquired another name - the pearl of Phang Nga Bay.  It even houses The Pearl Farm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.nationalgeographic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pearl Photos" class="if uuid-2331706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2331706.jpg"></div><p>  The coconut island is located near Phuket, therefore, if the calm and measured rhythm of Ko Maprao is boring, due to the availability of water communication, tourists have the opportunity to get to Phuket quickly enough and enjoy its vibrant life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.smartholidayshop.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Road to phuket" class="if uuid-2331702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2331702.jpg"></div><p>  Phuket is famous for various Thai entertainments, restaurants, bars, markets and other places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.smartholidayshop.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket Photos" class="if uuid-2331703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2331703.jpg"></div><p>  On the island of Ko Maprao there are 3 beaches (on the east coast, the southern and northern parts of it).  It is interesting that swimming is allowed only for a few morning hours, because after that there is a tide and exposure of the rocky bottom and sharp shells.  Enjoying swimming on this island is not the best idea, because the water is often muddy and is characterized by the presence of a large number of algae. </p><p>  Oddly enough, the best time of the year to relax on this island is from November to March.  At this time, the weather is rather dry and sunny, while in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine it is quite cold.  Between April and October, the temperature rises significantly and it becomes very hot, while torrential rains and high humidity can often be observed. </p><p>  As for the sights, then, of course, the most popular place for excursions is the pearl farm.  The guide will show you different types of pearls, tell you how it is extracted, and also teach you to distinguish real pearls from fakes.  You can also purchase pearl jewelry. </p><p>  One of the activities is cycling.  There is a platform on the east coast where you can admire stunning views of the Andaman Sea. </p><p>  The <span>Village Coconut</span> Island is the most popular <span>accommodations</span> , however there are others.  The hotels have cozy cafes and restaurants, and between the islands of Phuket and Maprao there is a restaurant on the water, which serves mainly seafood. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who have visited the Cocos Islands (Australia), compare these places with paradise.  Vacationers admire the beauty of these places.  Also, travelers are satisfied that they are not just brought to sunbathe, but also offer various interesting excursions introducing the local flora and fauna.  Without a compliment, there is no food left for these places.  Reviews about Cocos Islands are always positive, as tourists remain satisfied and are in a hurry to return again. </p><p>  Holidays in the Cocos Islands are more passive than active.  After all, these islands are remote from civilization.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthese places is that vacationers mentally and physically rest from the bustle of the city, plunge into tranquility and connect with nature, thereby receiving a boost of energy. </p><p>  Tourists who have visited the Cocos Islands talk about these places in a way that is breathtaking, because this is a completely different world.  Many say that these places charge with energy and give aesthetic pleasure. </p>
