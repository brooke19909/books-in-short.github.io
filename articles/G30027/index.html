It all began in the <span>14th century,</span> namely in 1314.  Then the battle of Bannockburn took place.  In it, the troops of <span>Robert Bruce</span> defeated the forces of Edward II. </p><p>  Confirmation of independence occurred in 1328.  Over time, it was lost, but the holiday became a national celebration.  Today it is celebrated throughout Scotland, festivals, concerts, and festivals are held.  How did Anglo-Scottish relations develop? </p><h2>  Scotland - the most important region of Great Britain </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thesaint-online.com" data-author=": Monica Burns, "><img alt="Scotland's independence from England" class="if uuid-2466585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2466585.jpg?1540595962"></div><p>  The independence of Scotland is extremely disadvantageous to Great Britain.  This region is considered the richest in the state.  Edinburgh is one of the financial centers of Europe.  The country has its own non-convertible currency (Scottish pound). </p><p>  Shipbuilding, information technology, and agriculture are actively developing from industry in the country.  Oil is produced in the North Sea.  Scotland is famous for its whiskey.  Tourism brings not a small profit.  Great Britain cannot afford to lose all this. </p><h2>  Early story </h2><p>  In ancient times, the territory of Scotland was inhabited by Picts, Gels.  By the end of the fifth century, the Scots appeared here.  It is with this tribe that the name of the state is connected, that is, the "country of the Scottes".  They adopted Christianity, were engaged in missionary activity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The written history of the country began with the arrival of the Romans.  But at that time its territory was divided into several kingdoms.  It is traditionally believed that the history of Scottish independence began in 843.  It was at this time that Kenneth McAlpin became the ruler of the united state of the Picts and Scottes. </p><p>  For several centuries, the kingdom expanded, acquiring a modern look on the map.  The change of Scotland occurred in 1066, when the <span>Norman conquest of England began.</span>  The countries became very close, but this did not stop the hostility between them. </p><p>  In 1174, Scotland invaded the lands of England, but was defeated.  King <span>William the First</span> Lion was captured.  To free himself, he had to admit the submission of his kingdom to England.  Everything was resolved in 1189.  At this time, Richard the First needed money for the crusade.  For ten thousand marks, he recognized the independence of Scotland. </p><h2>  Anglo-Scottish conflict </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img alt="First War of Independence" class="if uuid-2466586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2466586.jpg?1540595962"></div><p>  By the end of the 13th century, Scotland was waiting for a serious test.  King Alexander the Third died without leaving a direct male heir.  Queen declared Margarita - the granddaughter of the deceased.  This took advantage of the English ruler Edward the First.  He insisted on the marriage of his son with Margarita.  But the plans were disrupted by the unexpected death of a girl who did not even have time to crown.  On the way, she caught a cold and died.  So the direct branch was cut short. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1291, several candidates for the throne appeared.  One of the candidates was Edward the First, but he understood that his chances were void.  He led the court, which appointed King John Balliol.  In gratitude, he recognized the suzerainty of England. </p><p>  Part of the Scottish barons did not accept the new king.  The protesters were led by Robert Bruce.  Edward the First began to treat Scotland as a vassal land.  Political and economic games began, which led to the fact that John Balliol opposed the English ruler. </p><p>  In 1296, British troops invaded Scotland, defeated its inhabitants, and conquered the country.  Edward the First declared himself the ruler of the "Scottish country."  From that moment, the war for the independence of Scotland began. </p><h2>  The Rise of William Wallace </h2><p>  The British authorities established a very cruel regime.  The population could not tolerate atrocities, in 1297 an uprising broke out.  It was led by <span>William Wallace</span> with Andrew de Morey.  The battle on the Stirling Bridge was decisive.  The English army fell, the country was liberated, and Wallace became the Guardian of Scotland. </p><p>  Edward the First did not accept defeat.  In 1298, a second invasion began.  In the Battle of Falker, the Scots were defeated.  Wallace managed to escape, he was hiding until 1305.  He was betrayed by John de Mentace, surrendering to the British.  He was accused of treason, but the Scot did not admit his guilt, because he did not consider Edward his king.  Wallis executed in London.  Parts of his cut body were put on public display in the major cities of Scotland. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Wallis affair was continued by Red Comin and Robert Bruce.  They were rivals.  As a result, Bruce killed Comin and in 1306 became King Robert the First.  The war with England continued until in 1314 the Scots defeated the enemy at the Battle of Bannockburn.  Edward II fled to his kingdom.  But after the death of Robert the First, the confrontation for the country resumed.  The struggle for the independence of Scotland has been with varying success. </p><h2>  Battle of Sterling </h2><p>  The famous battle for the independence of Scotland took place on September 11, 1297.  Earl of Surrey, together with a ten-thousand-strong army, went to Wallace and de Morey with a punitive expedition.  They met on Stirling Bridge. </p><p>  English knights on horseback crossed the narrow wooden bridge.  They were attacked by the Scottish infantry.  The cavalry was powerless against the long spears.  Surrey decided to expedite the crossing.  This led to the destruction of the bridge.  At this time, de Morey hit from the rear. </p><p>  The army of England fled, but bogged down in a swamp.  The Scots killed almost everyone.  But the loss of de Morea, who died of his wounds, was no less severe.  He was not only an outstanding commander and associate of Wallace in spirit, but also had a noble origin.  The Scottish nobles were considered with him.  Wallace lost not only a friend, but also a liaison with the upper world.  He was made a regent before the arrival of King John the First, but betrayed at the most inopportune moment. </p><h2>  Stuart Board in Scotland </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img alt="Scots in the 16th century" class="if uuid-2466583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2466583.jpg?1540595962"></div><p>  A long and exhausting struggle ended with the victory of David the Second, the son of Robert the First.  But he died childless.  The closest heir was Roberst Stewart.  In 1371, he became king of Scotland under the name Robert II.  The Stuart dynasty ruled these lands for more than three hundred years. </p><p>  The territory of the kingdom was divided into two zones: a plain with English-Scottish language and mountains with a Gaelic dialect. </p><p>  At this time, the country was experiencing a difficult economic situation, the nobles did not want to obey the king, and there were many military clashes on the British-Scottish border. </p><h2>  The participation of Scotland in the Hundred Years War </h2><p>  The Scottish independence movement continued with the start of the Hundred Years War.  The French turned for help and in 1421 received military assistance from Scotland.  Twelve thousand soldiers went to the aid of an ally.  As a result, Franco-Scottish forces defeated the British at the Battle of God. </p><p>  At this time, England decided to establish relations with a neighbor on the island and released King Jacob, the son of Robert the Third, from prison.  Four years later, Jacob sent troops to help Joan of Arc. </p><h2>  Aggravation of relations in the 16th century </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.forces.net" data-author=": "><img alt="Battle of Bannockburn" class="if uuid-2466579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2466579.jpg?1540595962"></div><p>  While the peace-loving Henry the Seventh ruled in England, there was a period of relative prosperity between the kingdoms.  But after his death, the warlike Henry the Eighth came to power. </p><p>  The wife of the Scottish <span>king Jacob the</span> Fourth was the heiress of the English throne.  This complicated the already difficult relationship.  In addition, the "Scottish country" renewed its alliance with France.  According to his conditions, if the troops of Henry the Eighth invade one of the allied countries, the second will enter the battle.  In 1513, the British set foot on French lands and Scotland began a war on land and sea. </p><p>  At the Battle of Flodden, Jacob the Fourth died, leaving his two-year-old son at home.  The Regency Council changed its decision many times.  Jacob the Fifth was a prisoner in the hands of the regents.  In 1528 he fled, becoming an independent ruler. </p><p>  In the mid-16th century, Anglo-Scottish relations escalated even more.  The reason for this was the departure of Henry the Eighth from Catholicism and the dynastic union of Jacob the Fifth with France.  Unable to agree, the rulers began a war. </p><p>  Then there was a long confrontation between two queens: Mary Stuart and Elizabeth the First.  Being childless, the Queen of England left the throne to Jacob, the son of the Scottish Queen, who by then had been executed for treason.  At this, the wars of independence of Scotland temporarily stopped. </p><h2>  Dynastic union </h2><p>  When Jacob ascended the throne as a descendant of Henry the Seventh, he moved to London.  He ruled for twenty two years.  During this time, only once visited his native land.  It was the time of the cherished independence of Scotland from England.  Their common thing was only the monarch.  Such a rule was called the dynastic union.  Everything changed in 1625, when Charles the First came to power. </p><p>  In 1707, Scotland was annexed to England.  Great Britain appeared on the world map.  Immediately after this, a new history of the war of Scotland for independence against England began.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãseparate coexistence was eagerly supported by the poet Robert Burns. </p><h2>  Anglo-Scottish relations in the 19-21 century </h2><div class="photo" data-original="1914centenary.com" data-author=": "><img alt="Scots in the First World War" class="if uuid-2466581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2466581.jpg?1540595962"></div><p>  During this period, the history of Scottish independence continued, but in a different vein.  There were no serious military conflicts.  England learned from the experience of past centuries and did not put much pressure on the "Scottish country."  Scotland still has a unique position in the UK. </p><p>  In the last century, there were enough threats from external enemies, so the question of independence was not an acute issue. </p><h2>  The role of the Scottish Parliament </h2><p>  The first mention of the Scottish Parliament is found in 1235.  Then Alexander II ruled.  He transformed from an advisory council of counts and bishops, which was under the king into an institution with judicial administrative functions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": ALAMY, "><img alt="Scotland War of Independence" class="if uuid-2466584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2466584.jpg?1540595962"></div><p>  At some points in history, parliament took over the functions of the supreme organ while the country was without a monarch.  Robert Bruce relied on parliament when he fought for national independence. </p><p>  In the middle of the 13th century, representatives of cities, higher clergy, magnates, and untitled nobles could be in it.  Under David the Second, the authority began to agree to the introduction of taxes. </p><p>  The Scottish Parliament was unicameral.  Its main function was to approve the laws passed by the king.  He also considered issues of domestic and foreign policy, approved international treaties that the king concluded. </p><p>  The parliament lasted until 1707.  It was dissolved after the adoption of the ‚ÄúAct of Union‚Äù.  Representatives of counties and barons became members of the British Parliament. </p><p>  For about three hundred years, there have been demands for the restoration of the legislature.  They especially intensified after the discovery of oil reserves off the coast of the North Sea in the sixties of the last century. </p><p>  In 1979, a referendum was held on the establishment of a separate legislative body for Scotland.  However, due to the low turnout, he failed.  Everything changed with the advent of Labor, led by Tony Blair. </p><p>  In 1997, a second referendum was held.  More than 60% of voters approved the creation of their own parliament.  Elections were held in 1999.  It includes one hundred and twenty-nine deputies who are elected by direct vote and on the principle of proportional representation.  In Edinburgh, a separate building was built for him. </p><p>  Issues that the Scottish Parliament may decide: </p><ul><li>  healthcare </li><li>  education; </li><li>  tourism; </li><li>  local government; </li><li>  environmental protection; </li><li>  increase or decrease in the income tax rate (within 3%). </li></ul><p>  There are representatives of Scotland in the British Parliament.  They take part in the formation of the UK government. </p><h2>  The role of the Scottish National Party </h2><p>  In 1934, the SNP was formed as a result of the merger of the Scottish Party and the National Party of Scotland.  In 1945, its representatives got a seat in the Parliament of England.  In 1974 there were already eleven parliamentarians.  In 1979-1998, there were several members of the ShNP in the English parliament.  After the restoration of its own legislative body, talk began about the independence of Scotland.  In 2011, the NSP received the majority in it.  Its main program was the holding of a referendum in the country on the issue of independence. </p><h2>  Independence referendum </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thenational.scot" data-author=": "><img alt="Scottish Independence Referendum" class="if uuid-2466578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2466578.jpg?1540595962"></div><p>  England gave the right to conduct a survey.  The referendum was held in 2014.  According to its results, 55% voted against secession from <span>the United Kingdom</span> .  However, the NSP has not stopped its struggle. </p><p>  A new referendum on the independence of Scotland is supposed to be held in 2018-2019.  What will be its results, the near future will show.  Much depends on the mood of voters and the position of the UK. </p>
