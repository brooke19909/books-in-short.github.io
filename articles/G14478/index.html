A fabulous seaside resort, with a milder and warmer climate than on the mainland, since the sultry Sahara is nearby.

Djerba is called a real oasis of enchanting landscapes, "floating" in the turquoise waters of the Mediterranean.  The resort is known not only for its magnificent fine sandy beaches, fantastic warm climate, amazingly clear sea water, but also for modern hotels.  One of the most popular guest accommodation options in Djerba is Les Quatre Saisons. </p>

Although the reviews about Les Quatre Saisons Resort are somewhat contradictory, many still believe that the institution is up to standard and has a balanced balance of cost and quality of services. </p><p>  Transfer from the airport to the hotel takes 20 minutes.  The hotel building guests describe as large, spacious.  Now it is not in the best condition, tourists say, most of the building is neglected and not maintained.  The hotel is decorated in a Berber style, shared by guests, and is very interesting and unusual.  Check-in occurs immediately upon arrival.  No additional charges are required. </p>

    <p>  The hotel rooms are small and very modest, shared by guests.  A safe is provided free of charge, but not in all rooms.  The rooms have a hairdryer, a large bed, a plasma TV with 3 Russian channels, a balcony, a table and 2 chairs on it.  Cleaning is done daily.  Underwear is changed regularly.  In the room you can not hide valuable things, vacationers say.  According to numerous reviews, during the stay in the rooms nothing disappears. </p><p>  Tourists say that the territory is large, clean.  Its area is about 100 thousand meters. It has a lot of greenery, 5 pools, of which 1 are for children, 1 with slides, 1 SPA (the latter, according to reviews, is rarely cleaned and it is always green).  Pools and slides are on schedule.  Pool water, shared by guests, is very chlorinated.  The hotel has a restaurant (1), bars (main, pool bar and beach). </p><p>  Vacationers call the beach "just gorgeous."  They note white fine sand, a clear <span>turquoise sea</span> with an excellent gently sloping approach and a wide coastline.  For families with children, tourists share, this is just a great vacation.  Sun loungers on the beach are always enough for everyone.  At the beach bar you can buy beer and soft drinks (cola, phantom, sprite).  Some vacationers note the presence of debris and cigarette butts on the beach.  Many do not like the presence of horses and camels here. </p><p>  Hotel guests say that the main restaurant of the institution is often so crowded that vacationers have to ‚Äúwin‚Äù their turn for food.  According to reviews, some Russian tourists in the restaurant do not follow the lines, they ‚Äúrake‚Äù food on the tables, overeat, and litter very much.  This, the guests share, is very tiring and unpleasant.  Many vacationers are ashamed of this behavior of fellow citizens.  The food, according to reviews, is not very tasty, but residents do not remain hungry.  Nobody complains about poisoning either. </p><p>  Breakfast is standard: sausage-ham, fried eggs, cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese, breakfast cereals.  Salads from vegetables.  Baking: rolls, croissants.  For dessert - unusually delicious chocolate.  For lunch and dinner, meat is always served: lamb, chicken, meat sauce, roasting.  There are fish, potatoes, pasta, etc. Soups are served only for lunch (usually a soup puree).  The restaurant serves wine for dinner and lunch.  There was not enough fruit (only grapes, melon and apples).  The food is the same as at home, the authors of the reviews summarize, no frills.  Alcohol is ‚Äúterrible,‚Äù you can drink only what is acquired in duty free.  At the hotel you can only buy beer. </p><p>  Disco parties at Les Quatre Saisons Resort are open until 00:00.  Further, vacationers have to find for themselves where to dance.  The animation is very good, standard: step, bocha, water aerobics, etc. In the evening, the hotel‚Äôs dance, competitions.  You do not have to miss the hotel.  From 20:00 there is a children's animation.  There is a separate playground. </p><p>  The hotel contingent is mainly Russian tourists (about 85%), the rest of them are Libyans.  The hotel staff does not understand Russian well.  Mostly employees speak Spanish, French, less often in English.  But this does not prevent them from communicating with vacationers.  If someone did not have enough food, appliances, sun loungers, etc., the authors of the reviews recommend that you approach someone from the staff and explain the problem.  It will be resolved immediately, guests assure. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Mostly hotel guests are satisfied with their stay.  Many believe that the quality of the services provided here is fully consistent with their value.  Unassuming tourists who appreciate an active budget vacation plan to return to this hotel and recommend it as one of the most successful vacation accommodation options. </p>
