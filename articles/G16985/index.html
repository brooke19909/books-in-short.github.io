Hotel "Belarus" in Brest warmly welcomes tourists at any time of the day, providing tired travelers with a comfortable shelter and tasty hearty food. </p><h2>  Bit of history </h2><p>  The hotel was built back in 1971 and for a long time remained the most respectable hotel in the border region.  As you know, time does not have the best effect on any buildings, making them shabby and dull.  Needs and tastes of people also do not remain unchanged.  And those living conditions, which a few decades ago were the generally accepted norm, today cause bewilderment and a smile.  Often, tourists were dissatisfied with unpresentable living conditions, outdated furniture and unscrupulous service.  There was a need to change the concept, and in 2004 the hotel began a full-scale renovation.  And after a large-scale reconstruction in 2006, the long-awaited news spread around Brest: “Belarus”, a hotel, which is one of the city’s calling cards, is ready to hospitably open its wide doors for visitors from any corner of the country and from abroad. </p>

    <p>  The appearance of the hotel from the outside has not changed much.  However, the interior has undergone significant changes.  All rooms were overhauled, heat-saving double-glazed windows were installed, the finest natural materials were used in the decoration of the premises, and outdated furniture was replaced with functional modern products.  Positive reviews were not long in coming.  Now, in addition to the successful central location of tourists, the perfect decoration of rooms, excellent Belarusian cuisine, the attention of the staff and, of course, very reasonable prices admire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Today, the Belarus Hotel has 143 high-quality rooms, which can comfortably accommodate just over 200 people.  11 rooms are classified as “Luxe”, and the pride of the hotel are apartments and 2 studios. </p><h2>  Budget options </h2><p>  Most of the rooms are classified as standard (single and double occupancy).  The rooms are very spacious, even an extra bed for a child leaves enough space for movement.  The Standard Single and Twin rooms are equipped with modern furniture. In addition to the beds, the rooms have spacious <span>wardrobes</span> and work desks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brest hotels Belarus prices" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/778956.jpg" width="600"></div>  The bathrooms of the standard rooms do not differ in special sizes, but are equipped with modern fixtures and are very functional.  A refrigerator in each room is an added bonus, and the TV will brighten up loneliness when evening Brest gets bored.  “Belarus” is a hotel that is always waiting for its guests and does not close its doors for one minute.  A night spent in a single standard room, including breakfast will cost the traveler 1600 rubles, a double “Standard” with breakfast for both guests costs about 2600 rubles.

    <p>  In the lobby there is a small store offering essential goods that guests of the city may urgently need, as well as a wide range of Belarusian-made cosmetics.  Here is a small branch of the bank, where you can easily exchange any currency into <span>Belarusian rubles,</span> withdraw money from a card or perform another operation.  The hotel bar is open 24 hours a day.  Internet access is available for a fee. </p><p>  Hotel "Belarus" in Brest has the most advantageous territorial location.  It is the first one to be encountered on the way of tourists coming from Poland from the side of the Warsaw Bridge crossing, and is ready to open its doors to them.  Located on the green bank of the river Mukhovets, it is spared from the unceasing noise of city streets.  But at the same time, all the sights of the city center are a hundred meters from the "Belarus".  In the evenings, guests of the hotel have the opportunity to come to the pedestrian street and admire how the lamplighter lights old lanterns.  They say that if you touch his button and make any desire, it will certainly come true.  And already only for this it is worth visiting Brest. </p>
