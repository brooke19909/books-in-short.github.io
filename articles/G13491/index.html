This is not only a curiosity of nature, but also an ancient paleo-observatory.  People lived here, which is confirmed by vertically hollowed walls of caves, steps.  Used impregnable cliffs and as a place of defense against enemies.  Mountain formations got their present name on behalf of the broomstick Oleksa Dovbush.  Who he is and what he is famous for, we will also tell in our article.  But it should be noted that this figure of the eighteenth century has been to many places and left a mark in human memory as a people's avenger.  Therefore, there are three places called ‚ÄúDovbush Rocks‚Äù in Western Ukraine: two are located within the Ivano-Frankivsk region (in the village of Bubnyshche and the town of Yaremche), and one in Chernivtsi.  This attraction, which has every right to be called that, is the first on the list.  In Yaremche, the Dovbush trail begins, which, however, also leads through rock formations.  And in the Chernivtsi region there is the Cave of Dovbush (also in the mountains), where, according to legend, little bunnies hid their wealth.  But in our article we will talk about those rocks of Dovbush, which are located near the village of Bubnische. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cliffs dobovusha" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1255237.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sights of the Carpathian region </h2><p>  The nature of Western Ukraine is very beautiful.  Lakes of Volyn, historical monuments of Lviv, Lutsk and Chernivtsi, castles and monasteries of Galicia, Transcarpathia, Bukovina and Pokuttya - all this attracts many tourists to the region.  Ukrainian Carpathians are divided into ranges, the main and highest of which is Montenegrin.  It includes Goverla (2061 m), Petros (2020 m), Brebeneskul and other significant peaks.  Tourists are attracted by Mount Pop Ivan, on top of which are the ruins of the Polish White Elephant observatory.  Inhabit the Carpathians nationality: fights, Hutsuls, Lemki.  In the villages of the Verkhovynsky ridge, Malfars still live - all revered sorcerers.  In the Carpathians there are several ski resorts.  The most famous, meeting European standards, is Bukovel.  The real pearl of the region is called <span>Lake Synevyr.</span>  On two sides of the mountains - in the Lviv and Transcarpathian regions - there are balneological resorts (Truskavets, Morshin, Shayan, Kvasy). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivano-Frankivsk region" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1256748.jpg" width="600"></div>

They are located on the border of the Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk regions.  A more accurate address: Bolekhovsky district, the village of Bubnische, tract Vydrina.  Administratively, the object belongs to the Ivano-Frankivsk region.  Rocks are located on the territory of Polyanitsky Regional Park.  Therefore, if you drive up from Bubnyshch, the entrance will be paid.  It is better to choose a weekday for the tour.  After all, many tourists come to the rocks, which are also called Ukrainian Sphinxes, on weekends.  Children's sports and patriotic education "Plast" (an analogue of scouts) holds here orienteering competitions.  Such popularity of Dovbush rocks is good in that a lone tourist can‚Äôt get lost here.  A good, yellow-painted trail leads to the sights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountain tourism" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1255241.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Who is Dovbush </h2><p>  He is called Carpathian Robin Hood.  Beginning in the fifteenth century, feudal lords began to enslave the population of the Carpathians.  Wanting to remain free and protesting against serfdom, many young people left for mountain forests and formed partisan detachments.  Such rebels were called bumps.  They plundered estates, burned documents on the land and <span>debt receipts of</span> peasants.  Legends say that excessive wealth of feudal lords handed out overshoots to the poor and the poor.  Such detachments existed throughout the Carpathian region - in Galicia, Pokutye, Bukovina, and Red Russia.  The movement of bunnies reached a particular scope in the eighteenth century, when it was headed by Oleksa (Alexei) Dovbush.  He was born around 1700 in the village of Pechenezhin, in a poor Hutsul family.  As a child, he was dumb.  Malfar (sorcerer) Yosyp Yavny gave him the gift of speech.  Already in his youth, Dovbush led the movement of bumps, which swept the entire edge - on either side of the Carpathians.  Oleksa acted along with his brother Ivan.  They distributed the goods confiscated from the magnates to the poor.  Oleksa was treacherously killed by Stepan Dzvinchuk, a resident of the village of Kosmachi.  Judas, in addition to the award promised by the <span>Polish gentry</span> for Dovbush‚Äôs head <span>,</span> lit up with money that was not under Olex.  Mumps remained to live in folk memory.  There are many stories and legends about the local Robin Hood.  The rocks of Dovbush are also named after him, although there is no documented evidence that mud flies were hiding here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nature of Western Ukraine" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1256776.jpg" width="600"></div>

Seventy million years ago, continental plates began to rise.  Over time, the former bottom ascended to a height of six hundred and seventy meters above the level of the modern World Ocean.  Soft rocks were gradually washed away by the rains until a group of rocky outcrops formed, which bears the name Oleksa Dovbush in toponymy.  They are composed of compressed sandstone.  The rocky outcrops reach a height of eighty meters.  A stone labyrinth 200 m wide stretches among the beech-fir forest from west to east for almost one kilometer. </p><h2>  Historical monument </h2><p>  Ivano-Frankivsk region is rich in attractions.  But the cave rock complex is able to compete in popularity with <span>Mount Goverla</span> (the highest point of Ukraine), the ski resort of Bukovel and Manyavsky Skete.  Indeed, in addition to an interesting natural monument, these remnants are also a historical attraction.  Traces of the constant presence of people here belong to the sixth or seventh centuries of our era.  The fact that the caves in the sandstone are man-made leaves no doubt.  Perhaps they were hollowed out by white Croats.  The ancient settlement is covered on three sides by rocks, and on the fourth it is surrounded by a rampart and a moat.  The walls of the caves are covered with solar signs.  Steps are cut in some rocks.  Near the settlement there is a burial mound.  In order to revive tourism in Ukraine, the government is thinking of restoring the famous historical complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountains cliffs" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1255242.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Rocks: description </h2><p>  These are remnant pillars that are scattered over a fairly large territory.  Since the slopes of these rocks are steep, and their average height is 40 meters, a natural attraction is very popular with climbers.  Categories of the local routes range from 5c to 8a +.  If you approach the complex from the side of the village of Bubnyshche, then the first rock suitable for bouldering is Odinets.  Then the road leads to the main massif, called Osnovnyak.  A little lower on the road are the Witch and Tulip, then Bezymiannaya, Loach, Armor and Horse.  They often have climbing competitions.  The routes under the lower insurance have been broken on almost all outliers.  In addition, there is the opportunity for climbing with the upper rope and bouldering.  Novice climbers can practice on not too tall outliers, such as Austrian, Lyalka, Shurshun, Golets and Kolobok.  If you go through the forest for a quarter of an hour, you can see another rock - the Cross.  The remnants are equipped with nameplates, climbing routes are equipped with pegs. </p><h2>  Caves </h2><p>  But not only climbers are attracted by this natural-historical attraction.  Mountain tourism in Ukraine is quite developed.  Many visitors come here to explore the cave complex.  Naturally, cavers have nothing to do here.  After all, these are not caves in the strict sense of the word, but grottoes hollowed out in sandstone.  For centuries, people lived here.  The traces of a pagan temple, an ancient settlement, and later - a fortress have survived.  What does a tourist need to see?  Firstly, the Big and Small Caves.  Between them lies a very narrow gorge.  Near the Malaya is the Cave-Stable.  If you go a little further, you can see a well hollowed out in a rock six meters deep.  Now he does not reach the aquifer.  In the rock opposite the ancient people steps are cut.  It is worth walking through the forest, among beeches, hornbeams and evergreen firs (screams), drinking pure water from a mountain spring. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Climbing competition" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1255250.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dovbush trail </h2><p>  You can not ignore another attraction, which bears the name of a glorious broom.  It is located in the southern vicinity of the town of Yaremchi, Ivano-Frankivsk region.  To go on the trail, you need to walk or drive along the main highway to Uzhgorod for two kilometers.  On the right, at the entrance to the railway tunnel, is the rounded stone of Dovbush with a cross at the top.  And the trail begins on the left.  There is a parking lot and a ticket office for entering the territory of the Carpathian National Natural Park.  Mountain tourism in Ukraine, as already mentioned, is very developed, so the Dovbush trail is never empty.  Moreover, this route is simple, even children and pensioners can do it.  The trail is five kilometers one way.  The vertical drop is only one hundred and seventy meters. </p><p>  Interestingly, there are actually two paths.  One, laid back in 1902, is light and short.  The second is intended for fans to climb the rocks.  The path winds between the bizarre form of stone blocks.  It passes under the outskirts of Toad and leads to the cave and rock of Dovbush.  From this point you can return or continue on to the top of Mount Makovitsy. </p><h2>  Rocks of Dovbush: how to get from Kiev </h2><p>  The main natural and historical attraction, the description of which our article is devoted to, is located on the border of the Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk regions.  If you look at the map, you can see that the capital of Galicia is located in the northwest, near the border with Poland.  And the glorious city of Stanislav, now renamed Ivano-Frankivsk, is located southeast of the Lviv region.  To get to the rocks of Dovbush from the capital of Ukraine, you should take the Kiev-Frankivsk train or to Uzhgorod, Mukachevoi, Chop.  All these trains pass through Stryi station.  There you need to get off and catch a bus to Bolekhov.  From this town of regional significance there are minibuses to the village of Bubnishche.  You need to go through the village through.  The path to the cliffs of Dovbush begins immediately behind the rural football stadium.  Paid entrance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dovbush rocks how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1255245.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Departure from Lviv </h2><p>  The rocks of Dovbush with their other end come close to the village of Trukhaniv.  This is the Lviv region.  From the bus station, which is located near the suburban railway station of the capital of Galicia, a direct minibus travels to Trukhaniv.  But it will take about an hour to get from this village along a forest path, while from Bubnyshch it takes about forty minutes.  Drivers of a car leaving Lviv need to pass Stryi, Morshin, Bolekhiv.  From the village of Bubnishte you can drive to the entrance to the national park, to the first rock - Odintsu. </p><h2>  Departure from Ivano-Frankivsk </h2><p>  Buses to Dolyna and Bolekhiv often go from this regional center.  You can use the minibus "Ivano-Frankivsk - Lviv", but check with the driver which way he will go.  On the way you can see many interesting places.  If you have the time, you should pay a little attention to the beautiful old town of Bolekhiv (Ivano-Frankivsk region).  In its vicinity there is a miraculous monastery in Goshev and a saltworks (salina).  Previously, the population of Bolechiv was 90 percent Jewish. </p><h2>  Who comes here </h2><p>  Tourism in Ukraine is in the process of development.  Dovbush cliffs are one of the most visited attractions in the Carpathian region.  You can come here as trained climbers, and languid young lady in high heels.  Of course, on mountain trails you need to be careful.  Better take care of comfortable shoes.  Tourist routes pass through the rocks of Dovbush - to the monasteries in Goshev and Sokilche, to the waterfall on the river Sukil. </p>
