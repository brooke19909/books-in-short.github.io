Should I go to the rainy season in Thailand?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Travel companies lure travelers with low prices, offering cheap trips to Thailand in May.  But is it worth the temptation to fly to the Kingdom of smiles at the end of spring, will not such a trip disappoint?  We will comprehensively consider this in this article.  The informational material for her was by no means beautiful phrases of tour operators who wanted to take customers to the resort and get their money. </p><p>  We took into account reviews of Thailand in May, as well as, importantly, long-term statistics on weather monitoring in different parts of the country.  A good rest depends not only on temperature indicators, which near the equator never fall below +22 degrees.  For a tourist traveling to a seaside resort, the state of the water element is important.  Agree that to contemplate the raging ocean the whole vacation, and swimming except in the pool, it is not entirely pleasant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pattayaproperty.pro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand in May: reviews" class="if uuid-3231749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3231749.jpg"></div><h2>  Short geography lesson </h2><p>  Thailand lies in the subequatorial climate.  We will briefly explain what this means for the average tourist.  In winter, when the sun goes down over the horizon to the south, the tropical climate prevails in the country.  The northeast monsoon brings clear and dry weather.  Therefore, the period from December to March is the high tourist season in Thailand.  In May (reviews are unanimous), the weather is changing.  Planet Earth turns to the Sun in the northern hemisphere. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At May noon, a star is standing directly above his head.  Then the southwest monsoon begins to blow, which brings cloudiness and rainfall from the wet equatorial latitudes.  The rainy season continues until October, until the dry tropical climate reappears.  Thus, in Thailand there are three seasons: winter (it‚Äôs clear, but not very hot by local standards), summer (still dry, but the heat increases to +34 in the shade) and, finally, the rainy season. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="15.870032" data-lng="100.99254100000007" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="4"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/8/0/6/17806.png"></div><h2>  Thailand in May: tourist reviews of the weather </h2><p>  Paradoxical as it sounds, the last month of spring marks the end of summer for locals.  But May in Thailand is not August at all in Europe.  The fifth month of the year is considered the hottest in this country.  Surprisingly, in July it gets cooler due to high clouds and rain.  But the humidity in May is already rising, even if the sky has not yet been clouded by a thick veil of clouds.  Therefore, if you have problems with your heart or respiratory system, tourists do not recommend coming to Thailand this month. </p><p>  The rainy season in every way shows that he is just around the corner.  From time to time a downpour begins - a sudden, stormy, but lasting from the force of an hour.  Most often it rains in the evening and at night, but during the day no one is safe from them.  The southwest monsoon begins to bring more than rainfall.  This wind rises high waves in the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand of the Indian Ocean. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.phuket.com" data-author=": JoeySantini, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand in May: tourist reviews" class="if uuid-3231753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3231753.jpg"></div><h2>  Transition period </h2><p>  But May still belongs to the offseason - both in Europe and in Thailand.  So, your vacation largely depends on what decade of the month you are going to visit the Kingdom of Smiles.  Reviews about the weather in Thailand in early May are mostly enthusiastic.  If it was raining, it was only at night.  By morning, everything was dry, and only the greens soaked with moisture pleased the eye.  The sea in May is warmest, it seems as if you are taking a bath.  Alas, bathing does not bring cooling from the heat.  Every day, the thermometer column fluctuates between + 30-33 degrees.  Nights also do not bring the long-awaited cool.  Temperature rarely drops to +25 degrees.  Moreover, the clouds create a "greenhouse effect" and do not allow heat to dissipate in space. </p><p>  But the weather in Thailand at the end of May is becoming even more extreme.  In the reviews, tourists complain of very high humidity.  Because of it, things don‚Äôt dry at all and even the clothes in the suitcase are damp.  It becomes difficult to breathe.  It seems that you are constantly in the bath.  Therefore, if you intend to go to Thailand in the second half of May, be sure to book an air-conditioned room.  This period is not for traveling with children, tourists say.  It will be difficult for the child to adapt to wet and sticky heat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bangkok.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand in early May: weather" class="if uuid-3231754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3231754.jpg"></div><h2>  So what is May in Thailand? </h2><p>  The country is located between the equator and the tropic of Cancer.  Therefore, in May, a month and a half after the spring equinox, the sun is directly over the territory of Thailand.  It is at this time that the temperature maximum falls.  The thermometer column in May rarely drops below +30 degrees.  At the same time, relative humidity rises.  This is a manifestation of the southwest monsoon.  It brings not only cloudiness and rains, which by the end of the month are becoming more and more frequent guests in Thailand, but also heaves huge waves at sea. </p><p>  May is the end of the tourist season, which means a collapse in prices.  Of course, they reach their minimum in the summer months and in September, when showers completely overwhelm Thailand.  But alluring offers can still be caught.  The beaches are empty, and hoteliers and restaurant owners begin a fierce struggle for the remaining clientele, offering unprecedented discounts.  However, it should be borne in mind that the heat does not contribute to land excursions, and the raging Andaman Sea to water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aroundthailand.asia" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand in May: tourist reviews" class="if uuid-3231756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3231756.jpg"></div><h2>  Regions of Thailand in May.  Phuket Weather Reviews </h2><p>  Our analysis of the climatic features of Thailand in May will be too generalized if we do not pay attention to certain regions of the country.  After all, the Kingdom of smiles is quite vast.  The country's coastline extends along the Andaman Sea and outlines the west, north and east of the Gulf of Thailand.  Since the monsoon in May begins to blow from the southwest, Phuket takes the first blow of the elements.  Due to the high cloudiness, temperature indicators on this island are lower than in other regions of the country.  The column of the thermometer at noon occasionally crosses the mark of +30 degrees. </p><p>  But tourists do not recommend going to Phuket in May.  As meteorological observations show, it will be rainy for 21 days in a month.  Heavy rains can cause flooding.  But the rains - often short ones - are not the main obstacle to rest.  Andaman Sea as if transformed.  Huge waves and dangerous tidal currents make swimming simply impossible.  Only brave surfers decide to go into the sea at this time.  If you are brought to Phuket in May, choose the east coast of the island for relaxation - there the water area is calmer.  But in excursions the tourist will be limited.  Trips to the Semilan Islands and all boat trips are canceled. </p><h2>  Samui and Krabi Province </h2><p>  The most famous island in Thailand in May, reviews are described as very rainy.  But meteorological statistics claim that compared to Phuket, Samui has less rainfall.  The rainy days in May are 17. But the temperature indicators are higher.  Tourists may be pleased that the Gulf of Thailand, unlike the Andaman Sea, is not yet covered by storms.  Navigation does not stop, so Samui, as well as Koh Phangan and Koh Tao can be reached by ferry. </p><p>  Tourists say that the weather on Samui is generally very unpredictable.  It is dry and clear only in the winter months, and for the rest of the year it can rain for days on end or not to go for weeks.  Those who rested on the island in May say conflicting things.  Either they caught one 10-minute rain for the entire vacation, then showers did not allow them to pop out of the hotel.  Approximately the same weather conditions are observed in the southwestern province of Krabi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aroundthailand.asia" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand at the end of May - reviews" class="if uuid-3231757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3231757.jpg"></div><h2>  Resorts on the north coast of the Gulf of Thailand </h2><p>  If you decide to visit Thailand in May, tourists in reviews strongly recommend choosing cities such as Pattaya or Hua Hin for a vacation.  They are located on the mainland and near the capital.  The southwestern season gets here later, by June.  And all of May on the northern coast of the Gulf of Thailand, sunny weather reigns.  If it rains, it is only at night.  The sea is also calm. </p><p>  Should take into account the specifics of resorts.  Pattaya is called the city of sin.  Mostly young people rest there, hunting until evening entertainment.  Hua hin is the exact opposite of Pattaya.  The royal family comes here to rest here in season.  This respectable resort is chosen by families with children and senior citizens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="samui-weather.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Thailand in May: reviews" class="if uuid-3231759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3231759.jpg"></div><h2>  East of the Gulf of Thailand </h2><p>  Tourists in reviews of Thailand in May strongly praise the resorts located near the border with Cambodia.  Travelers especially like the country's second largest island (after Phuket) - Koh Chang.  Here is a wonderful balance of unspoiled nature and tourist infrastructure. </p><p>  As for the climate in May, the southwestern monsoon is less affected here.  You can safely go here in the last month of spring: Koh Chang, as well as another island in the region - Koh Kut, will meet you with a clear sky and a calm sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.easyvoyage.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Can I relax in Thailand in May?" class="if uuid-3231761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3231761.jpg"></div><h2>  North of the country </h2><p>  There is a whole layer of tourists who come to Thailand not for the sake of the beaches, but for excursions to the historical sights of this country.  They are interested in the ancient capital of Siam - Ayutthaya, such cities in the north as Lopburi, Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai.  But is an excursion vacation in Thailand possible in May? </p><p>  In the reviews, tourists mention that there is almost no rain in this period in the north of the country.  But terrible heat does not allow to enjoy excursions.  In the interior of the continent, the air glows up to + 35-40 degrees in the shade.  Rest can only be found high in the mountains, where the temperature is more comfortable (+ 25-28 degrees). </p>
