So, if it is still very small, and the rest is long, then it is better not to choose a hotel room where there is no own kitchen.  After all, it will not work for a long time to feed him with dry mixes and purchased cereals, sooner or later it will affect his health badly.  In this case, it is better to choose the private sector, where there is the possibility of self-cooking in the kitchen. </p><p>  It is also worth considering the noise level in recreation areas.  So, in private houses at night, as a rule, silence - they do not hold any events and discos here, as in many hotels or in boarding houses. </p><p>  It can be concluded that with young children who are in the age category up to three years, it is best to stay in the private sector, and with older children you can look for a suitable hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best vacation on the Sea of ​​Azov with children" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2003636.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for the location of the <span>hotel, hotel</span> or house in the private sector, this circumstance should also be paid special attention.  Choosing a place to stay should be purely out of your individual preferences.  So, if you want to attend recreational activities, it is better to be located not far from the place where they will be held, since walking with a child over a long distance will be problematic.  It is also advisable to look for housing closer to the sea coast, where there is the cleanest beach and the most gentle slope into the sea.  After all, the safety of the child and the peace of the parents depend on this.  Near the place of residence there should be shops, a market, restaurants and cafes, where at any time you can go for groceries for cooking or for a family lunch or dinner. </p>
