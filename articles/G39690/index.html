Natural landmarks are concentrated on it, stunning beauty, which originate from the hills and plains and end far beyond the sea horizon.  It is important to note that the island has very lush tropical and green vegetation.  In some regions, thickets approach directly to the coastline, which creates some oases.  It is also noteworthy that the tours to Crete in September allow you to enjoy the deserted wild beaches located in the bays and bays.  If in the summer there is also a small number of tourists, then in the first days of autumn it is almost impossible to meet them here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation crete september reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/465086.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Historical attractions of the region </h2><p>  The ideal place and time for exploring the most significant sights of history is Crete in September.  The reviews of travelers who have been there say that mild, slightly windy weather allows you to go around all the monuments of art and architecture with the greatest comfort.  As a rule, all tours here begin with a visit to the Lassithi Plateau, where many old mills are located.  Then each tourist goes to the gorge of Zeus, which is considered one of the oldest on the planet.  In the neighborhood are the Kurtaliot Gorge and the Church of St. Nicholas, one of the oldest saints in the world of Christianity.  In addition to all this, Crete is fraught with a whole host of monuments of both ancient and medieval culture, but the city of Heraklion deserves the greatest applause.  On its expanses the most beautiful Knossos Palace was erected, a significant and very valuable architectural monument. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crete september reviews" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/465085.jpg" width="600"></div>

Carnivals and parties are held here in the open air, and both locals and visitors — tourists and other guests of the island — are gathering for such events.  An important cultural event is the music and theater festival, which takes place annually in Rethymnon.  It is important that this event begins in mid-August, and comes to an end a month later.  When you visit in September, you have the opportunity to see this action at the time of its height.  Along with this event, the Heraklion-Summer festival is approaching its logical and very enchanting end.  It is important to note that many other events are also taking place in this very famous city.  All of them are very colorful, cheerful and will be very interesting both for adults who travel around the region, and for the kids. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crete tours in September" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/465084.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  September Travel Rates </h2><p>  A unique, affectionate and inimitable vacation in Crete in September is also good because it will cost much less than in any month of summer.  Compared with August, the budget for the tour is reduced by 10-15%, and compared with July, the price drops by as much as 25 percent.  Note that if you have the opportunity to purchase a last-minute tour, then the savings will be much greater.  If we compare the cost of the trip in early September and at the end of this month, then the second will cost much cheaper.  October tours, however, cost very little, but during this period the sea already becomes very cold, air and sand cools. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Crete is a unique island located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, between Europe and Asia.  On it you can find a synthesis of various cultures, and the unity of the ancient heritage.  And, of course, the warm sea, hot sand and wild beaches that settled in the bays will give you a lot of impressions, good mood and unforgettable moments that can be stored in memory and on photographs. </p>
