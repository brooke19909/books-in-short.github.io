You can get to Tel Aviv and Haifa in half an hour.  Hadera is divided into two districts.  The western region of Givat Olga is located on the Mediterranean coast, and the eastern, Beit Eliezer, is located in the Sharon Valley, which is famous for its rich orange plantations. </p><h2>  The history of Hadera and its current state </h2><p>  The name of the town in Arabic translates as "greenery" and means a swamp color, since it was built on a swampy area at the end of the 19th century.  The purpose of the construction of Hadera was the return to the native land of Israel of Jews who settled in Russia and Europe.  An interesting fact is that Baron Rothschild allocated funds for the purchase and planting of Australian eucalyptus - a tree that intensively draws moisture from the soil. </p><p>  Hadera (Israel) has a train station.  In addition, there are two highways, highways numbered two and four.  In 1982, near the sea, the Rabin Lights power plant was built.  The industry of the town is concentrated in its northern regions.  Hadera's economy is successfully supported by tire and paper mills.  Among the educational institutions in the city there are about a hundred kindergartens, 14 primary and 12 secondary schools and 2 art colleges.  Here is the Hillel-Yafe hospital and a military sanatorium. </p><p>  The population of Hadera according to 2016 was 88 783 people.  About 22% of the inhabitants are immigrants who moved here in the 90s, among whom there are immigrants from Russia, the Caucasus and the CIS. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Timezone </h2><p>  The time in Israel is the same everywhere, because the country is in the same time zone UTC + 2.  Every year, the clock is changed twice: an hour ahead on the last Friday of March and an hour ago at the end of October before the Yom Kippur holiday. </p><p>  During the country's existence, the framework of summer time in Israel has often changed.  The reason for this was most often religious holidays.  For example, in 1951-1952, summer time lasted 7 months, and in the next two years - only three.  Since 2005, religious parties have demanded that the clock be transferred after Passover and before Tishrei.  Ordinary people wanted the summer time to last as long as possible.  Due to this confusion, Microsoft owners were forced to release a huge number of updates for Windows.  Many Israeli companies refused to transfer watches at all. </p>
