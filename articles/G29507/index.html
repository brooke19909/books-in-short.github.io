    <p>  Age certainly affects the character, but not in all cases.  Having studied the genetic predisposition to happiness and unhappiness, scientists at the University of Warwick found a number of causes of gloom. </p><p>  Namely gloomy and <span>reserved people are</span> called biryukami.  Although the word itself has more than one meaning. </p><h2>  Who are you, biryuk? </h2><p>  The linguist Ozhegov interpreted this not quite melodious word in his dictionary in two meanings: direct (lone wolf) and figurative (non-human, closed man).  There is also a colloquial form - to look at the turquoise, that is, angrily, from below. </p><p>  The meaning of the word biryuk is different in different regions of Russia.  So, in Astrakhan this is a thief, a beast, in Siberia - a bear or a badger, in the Rostov region they call a one-year-old bull-calf, and in Oryol - a species of river ruff. </p><p>  But most of all, the term has taken root, denoting a too independent wolf separated from the pack and a person who has fenced off from society. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  And one and the other were born to live in a society of their own kind, but both voluntarily refused: a man for his own principles, and a wolf ... I wonder if forest animals have principles? </p><h2>  Biryukami are born ?! </h2><p>  However, let us return to the studies of British scientists who officially stated that introversion (it is also turquoise, it is also self-oriented) depends on the length of the gene that regulates the level of serotonin in the human brain. </p><p>  The longer the gene, the less prone to depression, causeless anguish, inexplicable bitterness and unwillingness to communicate. </p><p>  And neither weather, nor economic and personal crises have anything to do with it, if a person is simply focused on the negative, if he ‚Äúlost‚Äù himself in his bad thoughts and does not even try to find himself - to find out what is the meaning of his isolation and aggression, at this stage of life he <strong> </strong>  who it.  Biryuk <strong> </strong>  and there are biryuk. </p><h2>  Other causes of gloominess and isolation </h2><p>  Besides the genetic code, there are other reasons why people become introverts.  This process is quite lengthy, it can begin in early childhood and not without the participation of the environment. </p><p>  The first to be at risk are babies born prematurely.  As everyone knows, saving a fragile baby, obstetricians immediately tear him away from his mother and put him in a special box, thereby violating the unity of nature between the baby and mother. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It turns out that physical health is out of danger, but mental ... It‚Äôs not even worth writing off everything by age or prejudice - the newborn is able to perceive any information at a subconscious level.  So he took it - loneliness, sadness, himself.  This is a program that will be very difficult to ‚Äúrewrite‚Äù in the future. </p><p>  Such a baby lies in boxing, not even imagining what a turkey is, but already has all chances to become one. </p><p>  Prerequisites for gloominess and isolation can be physical disabilities, for example, weight or non-standard appearance.  In principle, here the child becomes guilty without guilt - a target for ridicule, teasing and non-perception of his peers, so he has no choice but to retreat and become angry with the whole world. </p><h2>  Temporarily or permanently </h2><p>  Most likely, there is no such settlement, courtyard, microdistrict, which would not specifically know who such biryuk is of local significance.  In every city or village there is sure to be someone who is offended by life more than others. </p><p>  This resentment results in an absolute reluctance to see people, living in their own separate world, taciturnity, unkindness and loneliness. </p><p>  And who knows why this person, who, apparently, had had a lot of trouble, is punishing himself even more with loneliness.  Although, perhaps, he seeks salvation in him. </p><p>  After all, who is a turkey?  At heart, he may turn out to be a wonderful, kind, sympathetic person who simply was not given a chance to prove himself. </p><p>  And it is good if turquoise is a temporary phenomenon.  One can still save a child from lifelong gloominess, with his soul not disappointed in people.  With adults it‚Äôs much harder.  They prefer to carry the cross of mistrust to the end, do not make friends, do not like fun, they are annoyed by everything and everyone.  Except for the proud wolf who left his pack. </p>
