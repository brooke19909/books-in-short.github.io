    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  You can not ignore the reviews of the Grand Uysal Hotel 4 *.  Here is what guests who have been there note: </p><ul><li>  Rest at the hotel is most suitable for independent tourists even if round-the-clock entertainment in the company of animators is not important for them, since the events here are mediocre. </li><li>  It is very convenient accommodation for large families who can live in apartments with everything you need, and the kitchenette will be just a godsend for those who want to cook and eat on their own. </li><li>  The restaurant is always a large selection of European dishes, without much bias in the tradition, but there are very tasty snacks, juicy complementing the food.  For breakfast, croutons are baked, oddly enough, enjoying great success in children who certainly will not remain hungry. </li><li>  A private beach deserves special attention within walking distance from the hotel.  Very clean fine sand, convenient access to the sea and clear water, which is important even in high season. </li><li>  In the afternoon, a delicious pizza on thin crust is prepared in the snack bar, so it is unlikely to get hungry before dinner.  The sea has sun loungers, umbrellas, a minibar, which is not difficult to walk and order a soft drink.  The rooms are a bit old and require redecorating, however, all the equipment works, and this does not interfere with enjoying the rest in the hotel, since most of the free time tourists spend on the beach, compensating for some of the shortcomings. </li><li>  There is a mini market on site, souvenir shops, <span>a beauty salon / hairdresser, and</span> Alanyum shopping center in 34 minutes.  walk, state.  hospital, water park, cultural center of Alanya. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand uysal apart hotel 4 turkey reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61988/2113409.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Grand Uysal Hotel 4 * (Turkey, Alanya) is an extremely convenient option for tourists, as you can get to many interesting places from there.  Some of them are worth mentioning. </p><p>  It‚Äôs not a secret for many that the Ottoman Empire dominated the waters of the Mediterranean for a long time, and the Red Tower of Alanya serves as historical evidence and a symbol of the Seljuk‚Äôs skilful architecture.  Initially, the tower was erected to protect the bay and bore the name of the Sultan of Keykubad.  The usual name for the building was due to the reddish shade of the brick.  Over time, some fragments of the tower collapsed, but this did not affect the holistic view of the building, and the foundation and walls of the tower are still amazing.  If you go up to the observation deck, from where a stunning view opens up, you can feel the refreshing sea breeze and take wonderful photos. </p><p>  Water Planet Waterpark is another place worth visiting.  It includes 27 different slides from the most ordinary to completely unusual, twisted into a spiral and attracting only the most daring tourists.  The most popular slide is Kamikadze, as well as a pool with artificial waves and many other water attractions that will leave a lot of impressions in adults and children. </p><p>  Surrounded by the sea on three sides, the fortress of Alanya is a real visiting card of the resort town and shows all the belligerent grandeur of Turkey since the 13th century.  Fortress walls stretch along the sea for 6 kilometers, and the building itself from the time of antiquity strengthened the skills of Seljuk architects in the history of construction.  Here you can wander around dilapidated objects and explore the most convenient defensive points, which offer a gorgeous view of the rocky coast. </p>

    <h2>  Cleopatra Beach </h2><p>  This is something for which many people go to Turkey, at the <span>Grand Uysal Apart Hotel 4 *</span> (reviews make sure this).  In close proximity to the historical relic, at the foot of the ancient fortress, there is a magnificent beach of the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra, who, according to legend, has chosen this place in ancient times.  Cream shade, clean sand, azure water, wild nature and old bizarre turrets of the fortress make this place a real tourist attraction, where anyone can make a wish and spend the sunset through the eyes of Cleopatra herself. </p><p>  Not far from the beach, by the way, is the archaeological museum of Alanya, built in the 20th century.  The museum exposition is divided into two main parts: archaeological and ethnographic.  In the first part you can admire the ancient products of glass, marble, clay, made by Byzantine and Roman craftsmen.  Household items, weapons, clothing of soldiers and women of that era are represented in the department of ethnographic art.  Unique floor mosaics of the 2nd century AD  will attract the attention of even the most experienced tourists. </p><p>  Holidays on the coast of Alanya will leave a good impression, and the Grand Uysal Hotel will take care of high comfort and provide all the necessary benefits, warning the wishes of all guests. </p>
