  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Arakcheev: a brief biography, history and interesting facts from life</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Some statesmen will always be remembered.  One of these odious figures was Arakcheev.  A brief biography will not reveal all the facets of this reformer and the close associate of Alexander the First, but will allow you to get acquainted with the main areas of activity of a talented Minister of War.  Usually his last name is associated with drill.  He really loved order. </p><h2>  short biography </h2><div class="photo" data-original="okultureno.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Barracks in Gruzino" class="if uuid-2482660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2482660.jpg"></div><p>  Arakcheev Alexey Andreevich was born into a noble family.  For a long time, his place of birth was not fully established.  Today it is believed that this happened in Garusovo 09/23/1769. </p><p>  Primary education was provided to young Arakcheev by a village clerk.  In order to enter the artillery cadet corps, two hundred rubles was required.  This amount was unbearable for an impoverished family.  Help provided by Peter Ivanovich Melissino. </p><p>  The young man not only studied.  He gave lessons to the sons of Count Saltykov.  This helped him in his future career.  It was Saltykov who recommended Alexei Andreevich as an artillery officer for the heir to the throne.  Pavel Petrovich appreciated him as a "master of the drill." </p><h2>  During the reign of Paul </h2><div class="photo" data-original="topwar.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pavel the First" class="if uuid-2482659" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2482659.jpg"></div><p>  When Pavel Petrovich ascended the throne, the biography of Arakcheev substantially changed.  It can be said briefly that he received a new rank, was awarded several awards, he was granted baronial dignity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most important reward was the provision of land with two thousand peasants.  Alexey Andreevich chose the village of Gruzino, in which he spent the last years of his life. </p><p>  The location of the ruler was short-lived.  In 1798, Arakcheev was removed from service, making him a lieutenant general.  Relations with the emperor can hardly be called stable.  Arakcheev was continually suspended and resumed in the service.  In 1799 he was granted the title of Count. </p><h2>  During the reign of Alexander </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander the First" class="if uuid-2482662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2482662.jpg"></div><p>  During his service, Aleksey Arakcheev, whose brief biography we are considering, became close to Alexander Pavlovich.  In 1801 he ascended the throne. </p><p>  Arakcheev became chairman of the special commission for the conversion of artillery.  The guns were improved. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.britannica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Austerlitz battle" class="if uuid-2482658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2482658.jpg"></div><p>  In 1805, he personally took part in the Battle of Austerlitz.  His infantry division attacked the Lancers of Murat.  The mission was failed, and the commander was wounded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1808, he was appointed Minister of War.  A brief biography and reforms of Arakcheev were related to military affairs.  So he simplified and reduced correspondence, established training battalions, increased the level of special education for artillery officers, and improved the material part of the army.  All these actions had a positive effect on the wars of subsequent years. </p><h2>  Role in the war with Napoleon </h2><p>  The Patriotic War with Napoleon did not bypass the biography of Arakcheev.  It can be said briefly that he was engaged in supplying the Russian army with food and reserves.  It was he who provided the rear with everything necessary.  Through the count’s hands passed the secret orders of the sovereign.  He was the one who organized the militias. </p><p>  Arakcheev was able to persuade the emperor not to become the supreme commander of the Russian army.  Perhaps he was one of those who influenced the sovereign's decision that Kutuzov became the commander.  There is evidence that the count was very good to Kutuzov. </p><h2>  Military settlements </h2><div class="photo" data-original="okultureno.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Georgian in 1932" class="if uuid-2482665" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2482665.jpg"></div><p>  A brief biography of Arakcheev would not be complete without mention of military settlements.  It is he who is credited with this crazy idea.  In fact, it was proposed by Alexander the First.  He designed the idea Speransky.  Arakcheev, contrary to his opinion, was entrusted with bringing her to life.  Why were military settlements needed? </p><p>  The war of 1812 showed how important it is to have a trained reserve.  But it was very expensive for the state.  And recruiting was more and more difficult.  The emperor decided that a soldier could become a peasant and vice versa. </p><p>  In 1817, Arakcheev began to embody the emperor’s desire in life.  He did this with merciless consistency, not worrying about human gossip. </p><p>  Many military settlements were created according to the same plan.  They settled people with families.  Life was strictly regulated, that is, painted to the smallest detail.  People had to wake up at a strictly scheduled time, eat, work, and more.  The same was true for children.  Men had to undergo military training and farm, providing themselves with food.  In the settlements they had to live forever, and if necessary they went to war. </p><p>  The problem was that the artificially created settlements did not take into account the human factor.  People could not live under constant control.  Many found a way out in alcohol, others ended their lives by suicide. </p><p>  The idea failed, not only because of the lack of thought of all the details.  There has always been a problem of bribery in Russia.  Arakcheev could not eradicate it.  In those settlements, which he was engaged in personally, soldiers and peasants lived quite well, and in the rest they often organized riots because of hunger, humiliation, and poverty.  They were suppressed by force.  Over time, Count Kleinmichel was appointed to manage everything. </p><h2>  When Nicholas </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolay the First" class="if uuid-2482661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2482661.jpg"></div><p>  Alexander the First died in 1825.  Nicholas the First came to power.  His reign began with the Decembrist uprising.  Some officers wanted to prevent the troops and the Senate from swearing allegiance to the king.  This would prevent Nicholas the First from ascending the throne and allow the establishment of an interim government.  So the rebels wanted to begin the liberalization of the Russian system. </p><p>  Count Arakcheev, whose brief biography is considered in the article, refused to take part in the suppression of the uprising.  As a result, the king dismissed him.  The participants in the uprising were sent into exile, and the five most ardent activists were executed. </p><p>  The count was fired on indefinite leave for treatment.  He was registered in the service until 1832. </p><p>  The personal life of the count did not work out.  In 1806, he married Natalia Khomutova from a noble family.  But soon they parted.  In Gruzino, he cohabited with Nastasya Shumskaya, who kept the entire household on the estate until the owner was at home.  She was killed by peasants in 1825 for countless bullying. </p><p>  Since 1827, he was engaged in his estate in Gruzino.  Arakcheev opened a hospital there, established the life of peasants. </p><p>  Alexei Andreevich died on 04/21/1834.  The ashes were buried in Gruzino.  The estate itself was completely destroyed during the Great Patriotic War. </p><h2>  Activities </h2><p>  Arakcheev, whose brief biography and activity is associated with the reign of Alexander the First, was distinguished by honesty and integrity.  He fought bribery. </p><p>  The main directions of his activity: </p><ul><li>  public service; </li><li>  military service; </li><li>  army reform; </li><li>  the creation of military settlements; </li><li>  project to provide freedom to serfs. </li></ul><p>  At different times, a person was evaluated as a cruel executor of monarch will, a royal serf, a reactionary.  Over time, this view has changed.  Today he is considered a worthy military figure in the history of Russia. </p>
