    <p>  Increasingly, in the media you can find articles that predict the most terrible consequences, the main "culprit" of which is the greenhouse effect.  But is this phenomenon really dangerous? </p><p>  <strong><span>What is the</span> greenhouse effect?</strong> </p><p>  In order to accurately imagine the mechanism of this phenomenon, it is enough to conduct a simple experiment.  He will need a small pot with a plant and a glass dish or jar completely covering it.  The pot should be placed on the sunlit area and cover with a suitable object from above.  After some time, it will be possible to notice how traces of steam form on the walls of the glassware, and if you remove it, you can feel that the temperature inside it is slightly higher than in the whole other room.  This is the greenhouse effect.  Although the scientific definition looks a little different.  So, the greenhouse effect is the negative environmental consequences of the life of human organisms. </p><p>  In part, this definition is correct, but only in part.  Its adherents dismiss other information that the greenhouse effect, the reasons for which will be discussed below, also serves as a regulator of temperature comfortable for most organisms.  Therefore, one should understand the occurrence of the phenomenon in question. </p><p>  <strong>The greenhouse effect: the reasons are true and false</strong> </p><p>  The main reason for this phenomenon has long been considered the activity of living organisms, mostly plants.  Scientists explained that when the planet was heated by solar energy, part of it was absorbed, and the rest was reflected from the surface.  But the presence of the atmosphere around the Earth in a certain way delayed the return return, raising the temperature to a hydrocarbon form of life that was comfortable for development.  Under such conditions, plants could carry out the process of photosynthesis, enriching the lower <span>atmosphere with</span> oxygen. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But today, the greenhouse effect is considered by many exclusively as a negative phenomenon, associated only with the industrial activity of man.  They argue that due to anthropomorphic actions, the amount of carbon dioxide that circulates in the air significantly exceeds the consumption possible for photosynthesis.  Also, the emission of other temperature-increasing gases, such as methane or <span>nitrous oxide,</span> is superimposed on this <span>.</span>  The developing industry, constant forest fires, and the destruction of the ozone layer around the planet contribute a lot. </p><p>  The exceptionally negative reaction, with which the adherents of the second approach associate the greenhouse effect, allows them to prophesy a lot of negative consequences for the Earth, from increasing the level of ultraviolet radiation to the second world flood.  At the same time, they tactfully remain silent about the fact that the temperature on the surface of the planet has a wave-like history, and right now a jump in increase is being established. </p><p>  <strong>Greenhouse effect</strong> </p><p>  Its main and positive point is the maintenance of temperature on the Earth's surface in the range that allows all living beings to develop. </p><p>  But the negative points are much greater.  This is the thawing of permafrost, a decrease in the reflecting surface, a change in climatic zones and much more.  However, as recent studies show what the greenhouse effect is and what its impact on the environment is, most of these effects have slightly different sides. </p><p>  So, slowing down currents, including  The Gulf Stream, the change of climatic zones, the <span>melting of glaciers</span> can be provoked not only by the greenhouse effect.  According to the latest data from scientists, the movement of <span>tectonic plates, the</span> wave-like change in global temperature, and also the gradual displacement <span>of the Earth‚Äôs magnetic poles</span> are ‚Äúto blame‚Äù for the consequences often attributed to the phenomenon under consideration <span>.</span>  Therefore, before giving a negative assessment of the greenhouse effect, one should carefully study all the changes occurring on the planet, separating the true from the false. </p>
