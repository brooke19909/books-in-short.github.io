  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crochet a Caterpillar Cord: Diagram and Description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Simple crochet is akin to magic: just now it was just a ball of thread, and suddenly a beautiful little thing turned out to be pleasing to the eye.  But not a single craftswoman is limited to simply dialing loops according to the schemes.  Improving craftsmanship and creating unique designer accessories and wardrobe items - that's what they strive for! </p><p>  Sometimes, in addition to just connecting a thing, you also have to decorate it.  The most popular finish created using a hook is called a caterpillar cord. ‚ÄùEven the most inexperienced craftswomen can crochet this dense embossed product. </p><h2>  Areas of application for knitted caterpillars </h2><p>  The principle of its manufacture is very simple.  As a rule, crocheting a ‚Äúcaterpillar‚Äù cord is used by knitters creating Irish and Romanian lace.  Here his purpose is most important.  For example, Irish lace includes this element as separate inclusions, such as a snake, a curl knitted in the cloth itself, or as a border that runs along the edge.  But the <span>Romanian lace</span> implies the supremacy of the ‚Äúcaterpillar‚Äù cord crocheted over the other elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="caterpillar lace" class="if uuid-2962379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2962379.jpg"></div><p>  Just so, having learned at the beginning to make only the simplest lace itself, needlewomen advance further, not stopping at what has been achieved, creating magical masterpieces in the form of lace paintings! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And at the training stage, such knitting is suitable for the manufacture of straps for T-shirts and topics, belts for dresses and blouses, dressing, etc. </p><h2>  How to crochet a caterpillar </h2><p>  For work it is necessary to prepare: </p><ul><li>  Thin thread - it is desirable that it be well twisted, otherwise the texture of the product is lost. </li><li>  A suitable size or smaller size than necessary hook. </li></ul><p>  Very freely gain two air loops.  If there is a very thin yarn, when it is impossible not to tighten the loop, pick up three - the first is tightened, and the subsequent ones are left weak.  Only they are used in the work. </p><p>  We hook into the initial free loop, grab the working one and pull out a new loop.  We got two of them on the hook. </p><p>  We connect in one, knitting a simple single crochet column. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting caterpillars" class="if uuid-2962390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2962390.jpg"></div><p>  We turn the knitting 180 degrees, leaving the thread behind the work.  Then we introduce the hook into the double loop, which is located from the very edge.  Grab the main thread and bring the loop out.  Again we got two loops in the work. </p><p>  Again, we knit with one single crochet - we knit and turned to the left. </p><p>  In this way, turning the knitting and capturing new loops, we will continue to work until we knit to the required length. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Knitting pattern </h2><p>  For convenience in work for beginners, as well as for experienced knitters, a schematic description has been invented.  As a rule, it is more simple and intuitive. </p><p>  Below is a pattern of knitting lace. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rensfibreart.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2963397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2963397.jpg"></div><p>  We collect three loops - and the hook will go into the very first from the edge, grab the thread and pull it out.  We knit two loops instead of one. </p><p>  Further, turning the work to the left, we enter the hook into the outermost loop and extend the loop.  Knit two together. </p><p>  All actions are repeated in this sequence until a cord of the desired length is obtained. </p><h2>  Wide caterpillar </h2><p>  With the help of hooks and yarn, it is possible to make wide apart from a thin cord.  The needlewomen note its resemblance to the ribbon.  The knitting process is almost the same as in the first case, but differences still exist. </p><p>  A similar crochet cord is created very quickly.  So you easily tie the belts to the dress, straps to the topic.  Some creative craftsmen knit jewelry in this way - amazing are bracelets with beads, necklaces, pendants. </p><p>  Prepare the threads and hook and get to work! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="narrow and wide caterpillars" class="if uuid-2964664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/2964664.jpg"></div><p>  We knit four air loops.  The first is delayed, but the rest are not. </p><p>  The hook is introduced into the second loop from it and pull the thread, forming a loop.  We knit two resulting one. </p><p>  Now we go into the third loop from the hook, pull the loop and again knit all of them together.  We turn and again pull the loop from the second, and then from the third loop in the previous row, knitting them one by one. </p><p>  We repeat such actions further, until the desired result is achieved. </p><p>  The cord-"caterpillar" crochet knitting is not difficult at all, just follow the sequence of knitting loops and you will succeed! </p>
