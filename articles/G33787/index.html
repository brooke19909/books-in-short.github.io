    <h2>  The consequence of active urbanization </h2><p>  It is customary to call a city a socio-demographic and economic system that has a territorial complex of means of production, a permanent population, an artificially created living environment and an established form of organization of society. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The modern stage of human development is characterized by a rapid growth rate in the number and size of settlements.  Especially intensively growing large cities with a population of one hundred thousand people.  They occupy about one percent of the total land area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe planet, but their impact on the global economy and environmental conditions is really great.  It is in their activity that the main causes of environmental problems lie.  In these limited areas, more than 45% of the world's population lives, producing about 80% of all emissions that pollute the hydrosphere and atmospheric air. </p><p>  The environmental <span>problems of cities,</span> especially large ones, are much more difficult to solve.  The larger the settlement, the more significantly the environmental conditions are transformed.  If we compare with the countryside, then in most megacities, the environmental conditions of life are noticeably worse. </p><p>  According to ecologist Reimer, an environmental problem is any phenomenon related to the impact of people on nature and the reversible impact of nature on people and their vital processes. </p><h2>  Natural landscape problems of the city </h2><p>  Most of these negative changes are associated with the degradation of the landscape of megacities.  Under large settlements, all components change - groundwater and surface water, topography and geological structure, flora and fauna, soil cover, climatic features.  The environmental problems of cities are also that all living components of the system begin to adapt to rapidly changing conditions, which leads to a reduction in species diversity and a decrease in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãland plantings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="environmental problems of cities" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/451375.jpg" width="260"></div>

The causes of environmental problems are human interference in the natural landscape during urban development and thoughtless waste management. </p><h2>  Anthropological problems </h2><p>  The environmental problem is not only negative changes in natural systems.  It can also be a deterioration in the health of the urban population.  The decline in the quality of the urban environment entails the emergence of a wide variety of diseases.  The nature and biological properties of people that have been formed over more than one millennium cannot change as quickly as the world around.  Inconsistencies between these processes often lead to a conflict between the environment and human nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="environmental issues of the region" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/451376.jpg" width="355"></div>

    <p>  Considering the causes of environmental problems, we note that the most important of them is the impossibility of rapid adaptation of organisms to environmental conditions, and adaptation is one of the main qualities of all living things.  Attempts to influence the speed of this process do not lead to anything good. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The environmental problem is the result of the interaction of nature and society, which can lead to a global catastrophe.  Currently, the following extremely negative changes are observed on our planet: </p><p>  - A huge amount of waste - 81% - gets into the atmosphere. </p><p>  ‚ÄúMore than ten million square kilometers of land is eroded and desertified.‚Äù </p><p>  - The composition of the atmosphere is changing. </p><p>  - The density of the ozone layer is disturbed (for example, a hole has appeared over Antarctica). </p><p>  - Over the past ten years, 180 million hectares of forest have disappeared from the face of the earth. </p><p>  - As a result of <span>pollution of the oceans, the</span> height of its waters increases by two millimeters annually. </p><p>  - There is a constant increase in the consumption of natural resources. </p><p>  According to scientists, the biosphere is able to fully compensate for anthropogenic disturbances in natural processes, if the consumption of primary biological products does not exceed one percent of the total, but at present this indicator is approaching ten percent.  The compensation potential of the biosphere is hopelessly undermined, as a result, the ecology of the planet is constantly deteriorating. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="solving global environmental problems" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/451374.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <p>  An indicator of 1 TW / year is called an environmentally acceptable threshold for energy consumption.  However, it is significantly exceeded, therefore, favorable environmental properties are destroyed.  In fact, we can talk about the beginning of the third world war, which humanity is against nature.  Everyone understands that there simply cannot be winners in this confrontation. </p><h2>  Disappointing prospects </h2><p>  The development of the global <span>environmental crisis is</span> associated with the rapid population growth of the <span>planet.</span>  To meet ever-increasing needs, it is necessary to reduce the consumption of natural resources by three times in countries with a high level of development and contribute to improving the well-being of individual states.  The upper limit is twelve billion people.  If there are more people on the planet, then three to five billion people will simply be doomed to die from thirst and hunger annually. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="environmental issues of the earth" class="if" height="228" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/451373.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <h2>  Examples of environmental problems on a planetary scale </h2><p>  The development of the greenhouse effect has recently become an increasingly threatening process for the Earth.  As a result, the heat balance of the planet changes and average annual temperatures increase.  The culprits of the problem are greenhouse gases, in particular <span>carbon dioxide.</span>  The consequence of global warming is the gradual melting of snows and glaciers, which, in turn, leads to an increase in the water level of the oceans. </p><h2>  Acid precipitation </h2><p>  Sulfur dioxide is recognized as the main culprit of this negative phenomenon.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãnegative impact of acid precipitation is quite wide.  Many ecosystems have already been seriously affected, but most of the damage is done to plants.  As a result, mankind may face mass destruction of phytocenoses. </p><h2>  Insufficient fresh water </h2><p>  Shortage of fresh water in some regions is observed due to the active development of agriculture and utilities, as well as industry.  An essential role here is played, rather, not by quantity, but by the quality of the natural resource. </p><h2>  Deterioration of the lungs of the planet </h2><p>  Thoughtless destruction, deforestation and irrational use of forest resources led to the emergence of another serious environmental problem.  Forests, as you know, provide the absorption of carbon dioxide, which is a "greenhouse", and produce oxygen.  For example, one ton of vegetation releases 1.1 to 1.3 tons of oxygen into the atmosphere. </p><h2>  The ozone layer under impact </h2><p>  The destruction of the ozone layer of our planet is primarily associated with the use of freons.  These gases are used in the assembly of refrigeration units and a variety of spray cans.  Scientists have found that in the upper atmosphere the thickness of the ozone layer decreases.  A striking example of the problem is the <span>ozone hole</span> over Antarctica, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is constantly increasing and has already gone beyond the borders of the mainland. </p><h2>  Solving global environmental issues </h2><p>  Does humanity have the opportunity to avoid <span>a global catastrophe</span> ?  Yes.  But this requires concrete steps. </p><p>  - At the legislative level, establish clear environmental standards. </p><p>  - Actively apply centralized measures to protect the environment.  It can be, for example, uniform international rules and standards for the protection of climate, forests, the oceans, the atmosphere, etc. </p><p>  - Centrally plan comprehensive restoration work to solve the environmental problems of the region, city, village and other specific objects. </p><p>  - To nurture environmental awareness and stimulate the moral development of the individual. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="examples of environmental issues" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/451370.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Technical progress is gaining increasing speed, there is a constant improvement of production processes, modernization of devices, the introduction of innovative technologies in various fields.  However, only a tiny fraction of the innovations relates to environmental protection. </p><p>  It is very important to understand that only the complex interaction of representatives of all social groups and the state will help improve the environmental situation on the planet.  It is time to look back to realize what awaits us in the future. </p>
