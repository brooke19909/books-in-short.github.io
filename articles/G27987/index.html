In this regard, in 1958 it was begun, and in 1966 the construction of the largest reservoir within the Urals, located at an altitude of 245 m above sea level, was completed.  By the way, the Iriklinskoe reservoir was built on the river of the same name.  Its length is 73 km, and the length of the coastline is approximately 415 km.  The average depth is 12.5 m, the greatest - 40 m. Below is a map of the Iriklinsky reservoir, which will help tourists get to the reservoir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iriklinskoe reservoir rest" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1157804.jpg" width="327"></div>

    <h2>  A few words about the reservoir </h2><p>  The appearance of the reservoir is accompanied by many legends that the locals will willingly tell you.  They say the name of this reservoir in translation means "heavenly place."  Indeed, the time spent here is similar to the time spent in paradise - clean air, clear water, wonderful views ... </p><p>  A huge deep lake with rocky shores and many bays - this is the Iriklinskoe reservoir.  Rest in these places is remembered for a long time.  One who once saw this splendor will remain impressed with him forever.  So say the locals and travelers, there is no end to it in all seasons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  About 40 species of fish live in the reservoir, the diversity of which will also impress the experienced fisherman: burbot, bream, roach, pike, whitefish, trout, silver carp, carp, common carp, sterlet ... And this is not the whole list!  It is worth noting that earlier the Iriklinskoe reservoir (recreation with a fishing rod in these places is quite popular) was famous for populations of predatory fish species.  Who knows, maybe they will meet a lucky fisherman. </p><p>  The huge diversity of the underwater world allows fishing companies to exist successfully, of which there are several: the Volna fishing farm, the state fish breeding nursery, the fishery community and the state-owned fish processing enterprise. </p><h2>  Vegetable world </h2><p>  Also in this area you can find many small islands, peninsulas, lagoons, capes, braids and bays.  Flora consists mainly of poplar, alder, elm, juniper, birch and aspen.  Artificial gardening is actively practiced here, new trees and shrubs are constantly planted. </p><p>  In the summer, the <span>Iriklinskoe reservoir</span> (the most sought after holiday this season) acquires an emerald green hue.  This transformation is due to the blooming of water.  And the reason for this phenomenon is the high content of various <span>nutrients</span> in it <span>.</span>  No wonder this place is called the pearl of the Orenburg region! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iriklinsky recreation center reservoir" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1157806.jpg" width="600"></div>
