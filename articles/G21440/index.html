    <h2>  The legend of Matsesta </h2><p>  In literal translation from the Ubykh ‚ÄúMatsesta‚Äù is ‚Äúfiery water‚Äù.  <span>Sochi district</span> got its historical name due to the abundance of hydrogen sulfide sources.  Many romantic ancient legends are associated with this area, one of them tells about a proud and brave girl. </p><p>  Highlander Kerenduk looked at the reflection of the moon in the smooth surface when his daughter was born.  Water seemed to be on fire, that is exactly how the father came up with the name for the newborn - Matsesta, or Fire Water.  Kerenduk always dreamed of an heir, and the birth of a girl somewhat upset him.  Matsesta from early childhood understood this and always tried to look more like a brave young man than a shy girl.  When her parents got old and started to get sick, the girl decided on a courageous step - to get healing water for them.  Matsesta knew the legend according to which, in one cave, a healing underground spring beats.  Protects the source of the Spirit of the mountain.  The brave girl was not afraid to go down to the cave.  Matsesta defeated the Mountain Spirit, but she could not return from the dungeon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the very victory, hot waters have been blowing from the ground and are accessible to people.  The resort was named after a brave girl who sacrificed herself for the common good.  It is likely that it was based on this beautiful legend that Matsesta was created - a sculptural composition. </p><h2>  Description of an unusual monument </h2><p>  Gusleva Iraida Yakovlevna - a talented Sochi sculptor who created the original composition of Matsesta.  For her creation, the master used a local stone - dense sandstone of light color.  The sculptural composition depicts a girl hugging a mountain, a fountain flows out from under one of her hands.  As conceived by the author, the figure grows out of the rock and looks as if it were created by nature itself.  Despite its simplicity, Matsesta is a sculptural composition that conveys many emotions. </p>

    <p>  The girl looks very strong and magnificent at the same time, but her features are quite soft and feminine.  Near the main composition there is a stylized slab with a carved inscription ‚ÄúMacie-hundred‚Äù - a pointer to the microdistrict and resort of Matsesta. </p><h2>  Sculptural composition today </h2><p>  The monument based on ancient legends and traditions appeared in Sochi in 1968.  The sculpture was very popular with the locals and was popular with vacationers.  Until the mid-90s of the last century, the territory on which the monument was located was in the department of the Research Institute of Balneology and Physiotherapy.  At that time, the Matsesta (sculptural composition) was maintained in good condition, regularly cleaned of debris and restored.  Since the mid-90s, due to the move of the research institute, the monument was abandoned.  In 2001-2002  the sculpture was damaged by the fall of a tree.  For many years, care for the unique monument was carried out exclusively by local volunteers and public organizations.  And only in 2013, Matsesta was recognized as an object of cultural heritage of the Krasnodar Territory.  At the moment, the monument is still waiting for an expensive professional restoration. </p>

    <h2>  Where is the Matsesta sculpture located? </h2><p>  Tourists vacationing in Sochi have a unique opportunity to see this unusual work of art with their own eyes.  The monument is located at the intersection of Kurortny Prospekt and Cheltenham Avenue.  Despite its current state, the sculptural composition looks impressive.  The Matsesta microdistrict (Sochi) has not so many cultural and historical sights.  The sculpture dedicated to him is one of the most interesting and impressive among them. </p>
