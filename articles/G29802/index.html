  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Building a shower in the country and in the house</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Before you start <strong>building a shower in the country,</strong> you need to determine how and where the water will go.  Indeed, soapy and dirty water harms plants in your area and in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãneighbors.  It is equally important to choose a place to install a shower, a water tank that is mounted on the roof.  A sunny place will help the water heat up naturally and not require additional heating.  It is best to choose a place for the shower not in a draft so that it is not subjected to blowing from all sides.  A properly selected reservoir will serve simultaneously as the roof of the soul. </p><p>  If you yourself are going to <strong>build a shower in the country</strong> , then first pay attention to the drain.  If there is a gutter in the country, then it is best to associate a drain with it.  In its absence, it is necessary to dig a hole near the shower so that the water does not have time to fill it completely when taking a shower by one person.  If necessary, increase the depth and width of the pit so that there are no problems in the future. </p><p>  To protect the soil in the country from constant erosion by water, you need to use <span>a shower tray</span> in the form of a foundation of concrete or large stones.  If you want to <strong>build a shower in the country on</strong> your own, then you can do without large financial costs, but at the same time do everything quite conveniently and reliably. </p><p>  To do this, dig 4 holes, install metal poles or pipes in them and concrete them.  The distance between the posts is up to you to choose, but most often take into account the distance of about a meter in width and length.  This distance is the most comfortable and familiar.  Around the support you need to erect the walls of the shower from slate, boards or plastic, then install the door or you can just hang tight curtains. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The <strong>construction of the shower is completed with</strong> flooring.  In the summer shower, planks with small slots are laid on the garden plot to drain water.  This is the most convenient material, environmental, easily replaced with spoilage. </p><p>  When installing a water tank, pay attention to the material and size of the tank.  It is best to paint the tank black so that the water in it heats up faster.  From the tank, make a tap on the thread and attach the shower head.  Water will be supplied when the tap is opened by gravity.  Antiseptics can sometimes be added to the water tank.  But it‚Äôs more practical to wash the tank often, not to allow the water to stagnate in it, to dry and ventilate the tank constantly. </p><p>  <strong>The construction of a shower in the country</strong> can be carried out not only in the garden, but also in the house.  At the same time, the house can have either an independent bathroom, or a designated corner in the common room.  It is only important that the walls in the shower be made of a moisture-resistant material that would not be subjected to the process of mold formation, be easy to clean, wash easily and dry quickly. </p><p>  In the apartment, <strong>wall decoration in the bathroom</strong> requires a more thorough approach.  There it is necessary to level the walls before interior decoration, putty and primer them without fail.  And at the cottage you can use boards, which, as they rot, can be easily replaced with new ones, or plastic panels that are easy to wash, microorganisms do not remain on them, and even at a price they are quite economical.  In addition, <span>plastic panels</span> do not require wall alignment. </p><p>  Plastic panels are installed quickly and easily like puzzles and do not require any special skills.  The house has a sewer, which is connected to the drainage of water in the shower.  Instead of a door, you can use a curtain.  The shower cabin in the house is more convenient and reliable, since even with bad weather it will be warm, light and comfortable to take a shower. </p><p>  A shower in the country is necessary not only after work in the garden, but also in order to freshen up on hot days, especially if you have children with you. </p>
