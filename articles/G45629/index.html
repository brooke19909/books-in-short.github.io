    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  We have not talked about nature at all.  No wonder this place is called the park.  The territory is very well-groomed, beautiful paths are laid, between which lawns are broken, and trees form wonderful oases of coolness.  Everywhere is very clean and beautiful.  There are alleys of mighty oaks, islets of birches and slender rows of fluffy firs.  Such a strict pretentiousness of park alleys is a little broken by a stunning lake, which children love.  There is not much entertainment here, you can sunbathe on sun loungers or splash around in the water.  There is a catamaran rental service, so you can ride with the whole family.  It is better to leave the lake before evening, because when the sun leaves, mosquitoes attack.  There are not too many, but unpleasant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vasilievsky park hotel bezenchuk prices" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/680934.jpg" width="500"></div>
