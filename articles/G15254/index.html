    <p>  Rockstar has released a new version of the game Manhunt.  The storyline of the second part, according to the developers, is fundamentally different from the first game, but <span>Manhunt 2 is</span> not inferior to his older brother in the abundance of scenes of violence and cruelty. </p><p>  If in a game released in 2003, gamers were asked to become participants in a survival show, where they involuntarily had to hunt their own kind, in Manhunt 2 the player appears in the role of real maniacs, one of which, professor Daniel Lamb, is a voluntary victim of medical experiments.  The company to him is a former special forces soldier Leo Casper.  The game begins within the walls of a psychiatric clinic, the atmosphere of which is conveyed quite brightly so that it affects the psyche of the player properly.  The heroes of the game seize the moment to escape from the "psychiatric hospital" and, having brutally dealt with the medical staff, find themselves on the streets of the city.  Maniacs are not very different from other rabble that lives in the backyards, therefore, apparently they do not attract much attention to their persons. </p><p>  We can say with confidence that Manhunt 2 is a simulator of the life of a maniac who walks free and only does what he searches for his victims and ‚Äúexecutes‚Äù them with particular cruelty, and various objects are used from a plastic bag to toilets, switchboards and factory machines. </p><p>  Therefore, before you start playing, think about the impact of this game on the psyche.  Not for nothing, the first version of Manhunt, after its release and the subsequent scandal in the public circles, received a ban on sales in Germany, Australia, England and other European countries.  And even the restriction on the age of up to 18 years did not contribute to lifting the ban on this entertainment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that the game, which was released in 2007, was released in the PC version only in 2009. Prior to this, gamers had to play manhunt 2 psp, as well as Play Station and Nintendo.  However, two years worth the wait.  The game has disgusting graphics, which, in principle, can be attributed to positive aspects, since realism in games of this kind could lead many fans of the game directly to a psychiatrist.  But the sounds used in the game are so real that they can cause strong emotions, up to <span>goosebumps,</span> nausea and even vomiting. </p><p>  Manhunt 2 includes 14 levels for passing and the final, which, in accordance with the chosen level of difficulty, can be of two options, in each of which there will be only one of the two maniacs, and the other, by design, will die at the hands of his comrade in arms. </p><p>  During the game, the main character will have to learn to hide in the shadows, attract the enemy with noise, hide, sneak up behind and carry out ‚Äúexecutions‚Äù.  What you need to know to complete the game Manhunt 2?  The codes for this game and the main points of the passage are in the public domain, but for starters it will be useful to get acquainted with the interface, the main detail of which is the radar.  It displays opponents, their location, direction of movement and the amount of noise that surrounds them. </p><p>  Opponents are indicated on the radar by arrows, and their color is a direct indicator of the enemy‚Äôs actions at the moment.  The most dangerous ones are light red and red, in the first case the color warns that the maniac is actively looking, and in the second, that he is already under the gun.  Yellow indicates the neutral state of the enemy, and blue indicates that it is stunned.  A skull on the screen means execution by surrounding objects.  By the way, the executions themselves can be of three levels of cruelty, which are determined by the time the mouse was pressed before the strike and the color turned on, from white to red.  The most cruel are the "red" executions. </p><p>  The hero of the game can simultaneously have four weapons with him, one of each type, including a firearm.  Although, if a player wants to make the game Manhunt 2 really difficult, the use of pistols, rifles and machine guns should be abandoned. </p>
