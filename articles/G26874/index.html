Often it is called the "gas capital" of the country.  In our article you will find descriptions and photos of the <span>sights of Novy Urengoy.</span>  In addition, we will tell you about the most interesting features of this northern city. </p><h2>  Novy Urengoy: description of the city </h2><p>  There are few attractions here.  There are no outstanding architectural or historical monuments in Novy Urengoy.  The reason is the very young age of the city.  It was founded only in 1975. </p><p>  Novy Urengoy is located within the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, on the banks of the Evo-Yakha River.  In 1966, the first exploratory well was drilled here.  And when the workers reached a depth of 1300 meters, a "fountain" of natural gas burst out of it with great force.  So on the map of Russia appeared the largest gas field - Urengoyskoye.  Later, not far from this memorial place, a symbolic monument was erected.  Now it is one of the main attractions of Novy Urengoy. </p>

    <h2>  List of attractions in Novy Urengoy: photos and names </h2><p>  As noted above, one should not expect anything supernatural from this city in tourist terms.  There are few sights in Novy Urengoy.  These are mainly various monuments.  But in the vicinity of the city is quite beautiful and unusual nature - the classic forest tundra! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, the main attractions of Novy Urengoy: </p><ul><li>  monument to the first train; </li><li>  monument to well R-2; </li><li>  Memorial Square and Memorial; </li><li>  Sailing Fountain; </li><li>  New Urengoy Art Museum; </li><li>  Temple of Seraphim of Sarov; </li><li>  monument to Borodino bread; </li><li>  a monument to the pioneers of the development of Urengoy; </li><li>  Builders Square with a monument to A. I. Nalivaiko (many buildings were built in the city according to his architectural projects); </li><li>  shopping center "Helicopter" (a real helicopter is installed on the roof of the complex); </li><li>  ice sculpture park; </li><li>  Taz Tundra (in the vicinity of the city). </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that, due to the harsh climate and prolonged winters, the Urengo residents have learned to have fun very well.  It annually hosts skiing and snowmobiling.  Noisy and fun every anniversary of the city.  On New Year's Eve, more than a dozen of the most beautiful ice sculptures are installed on the main square of Novy Urengoy.  Perhaps the ice park can be called the main winter attraction of the city of Novy Urengoy. </p>

    <h2>  Monument to the first borehole </h2><p>  This is perhaps the most famous and most iconic monument in Novy Urengoy.  It is located on the eastern outskirts of the city, next to the railway.  The monument is dedicated to the R-2 borehole, as well as to the people who took part in its construction.  It was from this well half a century ago that the history of Novy Urengoy began. </p><p>  In the manufacture of the monument were used real valves and flanges that are used in gas production.  Near the tower are two gilded figures of drillers.  One of them joyfully raises his right hand in greeting.  It should be noted that the monument has not changed at all over the years, it looks exactly the same as at the time of installation in the 60s.  At the monument, all city guests consider it their duty to take pictures. </p>

    <h2>  Sailboat Fountain </h2><p>  Without a doubt, this is one of the main attractions of Novy Urengoy.  A fanciful metal structure decorates the main green zone of the so-called Northern residential part of the city - Friendship Park.  The construction really resembles a sailboat.  It has a mast and fluttering sails. </p><p>  The Sailboat was inaugurated in 2005.  In summer, water really splashes here.  In winter, the fountain turns into an incredibly beautiful light composition.  The design is made of frost-resistant materials and equipped with a backlight. </p>

    <p>  The Sailboat Fountain very quickly became the main symbol of Novy Urengoy.  His image can be seen on one of the Russian postage stamps of 2009. </p><h2>  Memory Square </h2><p>  In the very center of the Northern residential zone is the Pamyat Square with a unique memorial of three wars.  It was opened in 2005 in memory of those killed in three terrible armed conflicts of the twentieth century - the Great Patriotic War, the Afghan and Chechen war. </p><p>  Of all the proposed projects, the sketch of the Moscow sculptor A. Frangulyan was selected.  The monument consists of three monolithic columns of different heights.  Nearby is the Eternal Flame lit in one of the local gas fields.  On the square, during the opening of the monument, a temporary capsule was laid, which should be opened in 2025 (on the 50th anniversary of the city). </p><h2>  Monument to the first train </h2><p>  Without proper transport links, no modern city can exist.  In the square near the building of the railway station is a handsome locomotive TEZ-3003.  It was installed here on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the Novy Urengoy station.  It was this locomotive that became a kind of pioneer for the city - in 1982, he brought here the first batch of products and building materials. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 70s, only Surgut could boast of rail connections in these northern regions.  In 1976, the first meters of the railway to Novy Urengoy were laid.  Laying the canvas lasted almost six years!  But the city is still connected with the "big land".  And the monument to the first train is, first of all, a monument to the labor feat of hundreds of people who worked in extremely difficult conditions. </p><h2>  Taz Tundra </h2><p>  Having visited all the most interesting sights of Novy Urengoy, you can safely go out of town.  About a hundred kilometers to the northeast, between the Taz and Yenisei rivers, there is a unique natural complex - the Taz Tundra.  This is a marshy lake lowland, covered with mosses, grass, undersized firs and birches.  It is especially beautiful here in the early fall.  At this time, the tundra ‚Äúflares up‚Äù in dozens of different shades - from bright green to crimson red.  And on winter nights, you can enjoy the contemplation of the beautiful northern lights. </p>

    <p>  To visit the Tazovsky tundra, it is recommended to contact the city travel agency or take along a guide who knows this area well.  It will be quite difficult to independently lay a route through the vast expanses of the tundra and see its most picturesque corners. </p>
