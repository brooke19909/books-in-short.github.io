As we can understand from the name, this five-star resort has a casino and a water park.  Often, Sirensis in Punta Cana is called a spa hotel.  This is also true.  But what services does he provide yet?  Where is the hotel located, what is its beach and other leisure facilities?  We will talk about this below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sirenis Punta Cana Resort Casino" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1110318.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  Going <span>to the Dominican Republic, you</span> do not count on a budget vacation.  Yes, and Punta Canu can not be called a cheap resort.  But in this case, I want to get a full range of various services for my money.  And it is at the Sirenis Punta Cana Resort Casino.  This hotel complex is located fifty kilometers from <span>Punta Cana Airport,</span> literally on the most magnificent beach in the vicinity, called Uvero Alto Macau.  The nearest town Iguei is located forty-five kilometers from the hotel.  The hotel complex Sirenis Punta Cana Resort Casino consists of two parts.  These are the Sirenis Cocotal Beach Resort and the Sirenis Tropical Suites Casino and Spa.  The vast territory is a garden in which there are two- and three-story buildings.  From the sea, a four-meter sandy beach adjoins the hotel complex.  The hotel arose in 2002.  But since then he has undergone several repairs.  The last reconstruction took place in 2010.  The complex belongs to the Sirenis family. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sirenis Punta Cana Resort Casino 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1110319.jpg" width="600"></div>

All rooms adjoin balconies-loggias with a visor made of palm branches.  In addition to air conditioning, a fan rotates under the high ceiling with blades.  In the standard room in the bathroom there is a shower cabin, in the suites there is a jacuzzi bath.  What pleased the tourists was that the electricity in the room did not turn off when the hosts left the room.  So you can leave the air conditioning and come from the beach or lunch to a cool room.  The technical equipment of the rooms fully corresponds to the five-star status of the hotel.  In addition to a safe, a desk, a hairdryer, cosmetic accessories and other things, there are a refrigerator and a coffee maker among the devices.  This is very convenient, taking into account that the hotel only serves breakfast.  As you know, plug sockets in the Dominican Republic require an adapter for European electrical appliances.  An adapter is already in the room.  A trifle, but nice.  They also give an electric fumigant against mosquitoes, which, by the way, are many. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sirenis Punta Cana Resort Casino Aquagames" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1110325.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Sirenis Punta Cana Resort Casino includes breakfast.  Regarding these morning meals, tourists leave only positive reviews.  They are served in the two main restaurants of the complex according to the buffet system.  There were always a lot of fruits, vegetables, sweets, as well as hot dishes of fish and meat.  It was not at all like breakfasts in other hotels, where besides omelet and scrambled eggs with sausages, they do not give anything.  Many tourists booked half board, full board and all inclusive.  And never regretted it.  Although the area around the hotel is full of cafes, many tourists chose to eat at the hotel.  Very tasty!  All-inclusive travelers can visit √† la carte restaurants.  There are several of them in the hotel: with Italian, Mexican, Chinese cuisine, as well as specializing in seafood.  Beside the pools, from ten in the morning until sunset, bars are open.  And at noon in the tent on the beach you can dine with grilled ribs, chicken or vegetarian dishes.  Mama Juan Bar serves excellent alcohol. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sirenis Punta Cana Resort Casino reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1110321.jpg" width="600"></div>

Four adult pools have varying depths and bizarre shapes.  They have hydromassages.  Two indoor pools.  Cute bridges are thrown over these artificial lagoons.  For children there are two more pools.  Uvero Alto Macau Beach is the epitome of the Bounty commercial without Photoshop.  By the way, all types of non-motorized water recreation are free for hotel guests.  If you go to the beach along the path past the pool system, then along the way there will be a towel dispenser.  They can be changed at least a hundred times a day.  Sun beds and umbrellas on the beach a lot.  An additional shadow is given by a palm grove right on the shore.  The sand on the beach is not white, but cream.  Sometimes the sea brings very beautiful shells to it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sirenis Punta Cana Resort Casino Aquagames" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1110317.jpg" width="600"></div>
