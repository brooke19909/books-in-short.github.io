These parts are disconnected by <span>the Bosphorus.</span>  So that people could freely move and travel across different continents, so that water does not become an obstacle to friendship and reunion of peoples, it was decided to build a bridge over the Bosphorus in Istanbul. </p><h2>  First Bosphorus Bridge </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bridge over the bosphorus" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/416877.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  This bridge was the first suspension structure erected over the Bosphorus.  Hence the name comes from.  The bridge across the strait connects the Asian and European shores.  Just a few minutes, and a person without extra effort gets from Europe to Asia and vice versa. </p><p>  Even the ruler of Persia, Darius I dreamed that a bridge was built that would become a ‚Äúconnector‚Äù of the two continents.  Such a bridge played an important role in the imperial plans.  In order to defeat the great Alexander of Macedon, it was necessary to transport the Persian army through the strait.  If there was a bridge, then it would be easier to defeat the Scythians.  Imperial dreams are a law for courtiers.  In 480 BC, a bridge over the Bosphorus was erected.  True, pontoon. </p><p>  Since then, more than one century has passed, and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa stationary structure still did not leave the heads of the rulers.  And at the very beginning of the 20th century, the Bosphorus Railway Company proposed to Sultan <span>Abdul Hamid II</span> to build a permanent bridge.  However, only after 50 years was the final decision made to bring the idea to life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the length of the bridge over the Bosphorus" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/416875.jpg" width="600"></div>

The project was the brainchild of British engineers W. Brown and G. Roberts.  However, like any great creation, a grandiose plan must wait for its finest hour.  Only 20 years later, in 1970, construction work began. </p><p>  In 1973, the fiftieth anniversary of the Republic of Turkey was celebrated.  Just in time for this, the opening of the structure was timed.  To build a bridge over the Bosphorus, the state had to shell out $ 200 million, and it was named after the founder of the Republic of Ataturk. </p><p>  The bridge consists of three lanes for cars.  Also on it there are two lanes going in different directions along which the <span>emergency services</span> transport moves <span>.</span>  To drive across the bridge, you need to pay a certain amount.  However, this does not stop him from taking on his roads about 200 thousand cars daily.  There are paths for pedestrians.  However, passage through them is prohibited, as these are the favorite places of suicides. </p><p>  The total length of the bridge over the Bosphorus is 1510 meters, its width is 39 meters.  Today, the construction takes 17th place among all the suspension bridges in the world.  It is located at an altitude of 64 meters above the water. </p><h2>  Second Bosphorus Bridge </h2><p>  There is also a second bridge over the Bosphorus in Istanbul.  It bears the name of Sultan Mehmed Fatih.  It became a branch of the European Istanbul (Rumeli Hisar) and the Asian part of the former <span>capital of Turkey</span> (Andalu Hisar).  The bridge was built from 1985 to 1988.  In some characteristics, the second bridge is superior to the first.  Much more money was spent on its creation, and its main span is several times longer.  So, the length of the second structure is 1510 meters, the width is 39 meters.  It stands in twelfth place in the world among the largest bridges.  The height of its supports totals 165 meters, while its predecessor can ‚Äúboast‚Äù a figure of only 105 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bridge over the bosphorus in istanbul" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/416878.jpg" width="600"></div>

In this ancient capital of three powerful empires, work has already begun on this subject.  The first persons of the state participated in the opening of the project.  Its cost will cost Turkey $ 3.3 billion.  However, it‚Äôs worth it, because the design is designed to unload the existing highway. </p><p>  The new building will be named after Yavuz Sultan Selim.  The monarch ruled the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century.  This bridge is in many ways superior to its older "brothers."  It will accommodate eight lanes for cars and two for rail.  Its width will be 59 meters, height - 320 meters, and the length of the main span - 1408 meters.  All these are the parameters of the future masterpiece of architecture.  The builders and the government plan to complete all work by 2015. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bridge over the bosphorus" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/416876.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bridge views </h2><p>  If you just look at the first bridge over the Bosphorus, you will see nothing but metal and concrete.  To appreciate the beauty of sculpture, you need to know where it is best to consider.  If you walk during the day, then beautiful views of the bridge open from a ship cruising along the strait.  From afar, it is visible in the palm of your hand, and it resembles a thin thread.  There is a belief that if you make a wish, sailing under the bridge, you can be sure that it will certainly come true. </p><p>  However, Ataturk bridge is truly beautiful at night or in the evening.  Sit down with a glass of red wine in one of the restaurants on the banks of the Bosphorus Strait and enjoy the magnificent scenery.  When it is dark, the bridge begins to glow with multi-colored iridescent lights.  The sight is worth at least one single night. </p>
