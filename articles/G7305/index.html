  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Christmas garland on batteries: features, applications, manufacturing options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Everyone is waiting for the New Year holidays with special warmth, hope for something better.  And these days, I want everything around to shine and glow with multi-colored lights.  But not everywhere there is the ability to connect flashlights to the mains.  And here comes the battery-powered garland - a product that appeared on the Russian market quite recently, only a few years ago, although there were craftsmen who assembled such products on their own.  The article will focus on such decorative elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wayfair.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Branches ate with a garland on a battery - very beautiful" class="if uuid-2985660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2985660.jpg"></div><h2>  Where can I apply such garlands </h2><p>  The scope of such products is quite extensive.  Naturally, they can be placed together with the lights that work from the network, but the main advantage of LED battery lights in their mobility.  Similar products are very fond of girls, using them to decorate hair styles.  It turns out really beautiful.  It is convenient to use such mobile lights for decorating a Christmas tree in the yard, especially if there is a timer in the circuit, which can turn the power on and off at a certain time.  Some models can be controlled by the remote control. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="Y9sWN6cpoOI" data-url="https://youtu.be/Y9sWN6cpoOI" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/2/2/9/7/12297.jpg"></div><p>  As in any other, in <span>the Christmas tree garland circuit</span> , a controller may be present on the batteries, which will provide several different LED flashing modes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Often such products are used for decoration in a nursery.  In this case, the parents can be calm, because the child will not cut the wires, it will not be shocked.  And how much happiness children have in their eyes when in the midst of the New Year's carnival party in the kindergarten, <span>the prince</span> or snowflake <span>costume</span> begins to glow! </p><h2>  Varieties of "mobile lights" </h2><p>  Battery- <span>powered LED lights</span> are identical to conventional network products.  It can be rain, fringe, icicles or snowflakes, and possibly a net.  The difference between the models is only in the number and size of the supply elements.  Most often, batteries are used, such as AA or AAA, but sometimes, although rarely, can be found as a battery "Krona", voltage 9V. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.weiku.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Battery lights in the shape of viburnum berries" class="if uuid-2985641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2985641.jpg"></div><p>  Products in blue and white are in great demand in the form of small balls of various diameters.  Such battery garlands, if placed in a large glass, create the illusion of a real pearl.  The lights in the shape of angels are chosen to decorate the gift wrapping or several spruce paws placed in a vase in the center of the table.  But the most popular, as in the case of ordinary network garlands, is rain.  They are decorated with chairs, the edge of the table, sets or even a bed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Are there any negative aspects to battery devices? </h2><p>  According to experts, a high-quality garland can have no shortcomings a priori.  But, if you buy a cheap Chinese fake artisanal production, you can encounter quite unpleasant moments, among which: </p><ul><li>  LEDs will begin to turn off or fade after a few hours of operation; </li><li>  when replacing a burned-out element with a similar one, the new one will also not shine; </li><li>  LEDs will start to heat up; </li><li>  the controller will periodically reset the program or even fail without surviving New Year's Eve. </li></ul><p>  In fact, there are more possible troubles, just smaller ones fade in comparison with the listed ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dresslily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Battery-powered garlands are becoming more popular" class="if uuid-2985624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2985624.jpg"></div><h2>  Manufacture </h2><p>  If you do not want to spend money on the purchase of such a product, you can make a garland on batteries with your own hands.  For work, you only need lithium batteries, LEDs and a thin flexible wire.  If the house has a Chinese garland, it can be safely used, this will save you from unnecessary soldering and waste of time. </p><p>  We connect lithium batteries (each 3V) in parallel.  You can leave one, but such a garland on batteries will quickly sit down.  The more batteries will be used, the longer the product will work offline.  After checking the polarity, you can solder the wires to the batteries.  For convenience, a toggle switch is included in the circuit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tr.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Merry snowman shaped lights" class="if uuid-2985666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2985666.jpg"></div><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Regardless of whether the <span>New Year</span> is planned or a holiday has already passed, battery-powered garlands can always be used.  Take at least a trip to the lake with an overnight stay.  After all, you can cheer yourself up by simply hanging lights around it, laying it on the roof of a car or fixing it above a table.  So, this thing is really necessary.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter if it was purchased in a store or made by one‚Äôs own hands.  The main thing is that the lights shine, and the mood rises. </p>
