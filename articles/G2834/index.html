She is the bottom of the women's dress from the waist to the floor.  Its first appearance dates back to the 15th - 16th centuries, when it separated from the bodice due to new formations of the cut principle.  The skirt appeared its changes, both in shape and in length, the width was taken into account, different silhouettes changed.  Among the many types of designs, I would like to single out one - this is a four-blade skirt pattern. </p><h2>  Laconic cut models </h2><p>  The <span>four-</span> blade <span>skirt pattern</span> occupies a worthy place in high fashion because of the uniqueness of its construction.  It is a classic because one of its virtues is its versatility.  The product is suitable for almost all types of figures.  In addition, it visually slim.  From the main drawing, you can simulate several different types of products, consisting of cut parts.  What is the most important thing in a four-blade skirt?  This is the construction of the pattern, which is not such a difficult process. </p>

We need tracing paper in order to be able to carry out the construction on it, as well as draw precise thin lines with a pencil and ruler.  But the eraser serves to erase, corrects defects and brings everything else in the correct order.  It is necessary to arrange the paper sheet to yourself so that it is convenient for you to draw exact lines on it (of course, after calculations). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How is a four-blade skirt pattern for a girl performed?  A simple construction method is used for this.  Make a small indent from the top edge of the sheet down 2 cm. Draw a straight line parallel to the line of the top edge of the paper.  Divide this line in half and put a point in the middle, denoted by the letter A. This long straight line means that it is the waistline.  Now from point A to the right and left sides along this line we put points A1 and A2. </p>

    <p>  For example, when taking measurements, we learned how many centimeters we have at the moment when measuring the waist, for example, 64 cm. Then we begin to calculate 64: 8 = 8.  It turned out 8 cm. From point A it lays 8 cm to the right and left side, we denote by points A1 and A2.  A1A = AA2 = 1/8 waist circumference. </p><p>  Then from point A, perpendicular to the segment A1 and A2, draw straight lines and mark point C on one, and point B on the other, where: </p><ol><li>  From point A to point C is the length of the segment from the waist line to the hips, this measure is measured from the waist line to the hips, approximately it is 16 - 18 cm. </li><li>  From point A to point B is the length of the skirt, this measure is measured from the waist to the knee or lower, fixed on the line in centimeters. </li><li>  Draw a straight line through point C, and also draw a line through point B.  The straight line of the hips and the bottom line are parallel to the waist line, the segment of which is equal to A1A2. </li><li>  From point C to the right and left side we measure the segments.  We give an example, if after taking measurements the hip circumference is 94 cm, then you need to measure from point C to the right side 12 cm, to the left side 12 cm. Here, 2 cm is given for a loose fit, so we add them to the hip circumference (it equals for us 94 cm).  This means that 94 + 2 = 96 cm. The number 96 is divided by 8, we get 12 cm. From point C, they put off 12 cm to the right and left side. We denote by points C1 and C2.  C1C = CC2 = (hips + 2 cm): 8. </li><li>  We draw a straight line from point A1 and connect it to point C1, bring it to the bottom line and mark B1 at the intersection with it, and also draw a line from point A2, go through point C2, draw it to the bottom line and put a point at the intersection with it IN 2. </li><li>  The waist line must be drawn, for this you need to deviate 1.5 cm from point A down, mark point A3.  From point A1 we draw a smooth line, connect it with points A3 and A2. </li><li>  After this, it is necessary to draw a bottom line for the drawing of the four-blade skirt.  To do this, measure the length from point A3 to point B, this length should be noted on the side A1B1, mark it with point B4.  We also measure the length from point A3 to point B, the resulting distance is measured in centimeters on the side A2B2, we will designate point B5. </li><li>  From point B4 we draw a smooth line to points B and B5.  The drawing of the four-blade skirt pattern is ready. </li></ol><h2>  Additional details for the skirt </h2><p>  Then, with scissors, we cut out the finished pattern of the four-blade skirt on paper.  We lay out the pattern in the form of a wedge on a previously prepared fabric.  Then you need to cut four wedges.  Before cutting, do not forget that you need to add 1.5 cm to the seams along the waist line, 1.5 to 2 cm at the bottom of the part, and 1.5 to 2 cm along the edges of the wedge. After increments, along the edges of the wedges Four parts can be cut. </p>

    <p>  For cutting the belt, you need to know the measure of waist circumference, we add another 12 cm to this calculation <span>(waist circumference</span> + 12 cm), after that you can cut out a strip of the size you need along the length.  And for the width of the belt when cutting, you need to know how many centimeters it will be ready-made.  For example, if in finished form it is 3 cm, then we add the width of the part when cutting twice, on each side we need to add another centimeter (3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 8 cm).  For this type of belt use a zipper. </p><p>  There is another type of processing belt for cutting a four-blade skirt with an elastic band.  In this embodiment, a belt is sewn to the skirt at the top of the product and an elastic band is inserted into it.  Only when cutting wedges on the waist line, you need to add a few centimeters on both sides, this is taken into account, since the skirt needs to be collected in this area.  Such a pattern of a four-skirt skirt is suitable not only for girls, but also for adult women. </p>
