Woland Bulgakova watched the ancient city from this wonderful observation point.  You can see this place in the movies, but it's better to see for yourself.  Sparrow Hills are filled with history and the spirit of ancient times.  Several times they changed the name.  In fact, these are not mountains, even on old maps these are Vorobyovy Kruzy, in Soviet times they became Leninsky, and now - the Vorobyovy Gory park. </p>

    <p>  Not a single excursion in Moscow is complete without visiting them; there is an observation deck here, and it offers an excellent view of the capital. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  There is no doubt that the Vorobyovy Gory has been inhabited since ancient times.  Around the 2nd millennium, these lands were developed by man.  This is evidenced by numerous archaeological finds, for example, stone tools were found under the building of Moscow State University.  Also, at different times, arrowheads, various decorations, traces of settlements were found. </p><p>  The name Sparrow Hills was given from one of the first owners of local villages, Cyril Voroba.  Sparrow is a nickname, possibly derived from a tool, a board circling a nail.  Many times the villages changed owners, at one time royal estates stood here, and kings of different eras rested here, hid and made their plans. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sparrow Hills in the XX century and in our time </h2><p>  The village of Vorobyevo lasted quite a long time.  Summer residents lived here, cultivated <span>orchards</span> and kept tea houses for tourists.  In 1924, the village numbered 180 yards and more than a thousand inhabitants. </p><p>  Since 1917, local festivities with rides, carousels, fairs, stalls with ice cream and waffles have been held on the Sparrow Hills.  After the death of <span>Lenin, the mountains</span> began to be called Leninsky, and even the nearest metro station was so named.  It is located on the lower tier of the bridge.  The station, like the bridge itself, was rebuilt and altered, for many years it was closed for use.  Now the park on the Sparrow Hills bears its usual name. </p><h2>  The birth of the green zone </h2><p>  Over the course of several centuries, the metropolitan university requested the territory of the Sparrow Hills for its buildings and has always been refused.  Only under the authority of the Soviets in 1948 permission was obtained, and the construction of the building of Moscow State University began.  The houses of summer residents were demolished, and near the university they raised a botanical garden, strengthened the slopes, straightened the rugged bank of the Moscow River, and in general, ennobled the territory.  So the park appeared. </p>

    <h2>  Why visit the park </h2><p>  If you happen to be in Moscow, then be sure to add the Vorobyovy Gory Park to the list of places worth visiting.  How to get there  This question is with a few correct answers.  You can do this by metro; there is a station of the same name, not far from Frunzenskaya.  If you prefer by car, then opposite the building of Moscow State University on Kosygina Street there are enough parking spaces. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Vorobevy Gory Park is a protected area like the green <span>zone of Moscow.</span>  No cars drive here, only cyclists and pedestrians walk.  The green zone has a total length of 10 km and stretches along the promenade.  There is a forest, and shady ponds, in good weather you can see local animals, especially squirrels.  Here you can disconnect from the non-stop metropolitan movement, relax, breathe fresh air, listen to the birds singing, enjoy the aroma of lilacs, the bushes of which are planted along the promenade. </p>

    <p>  Near the observation deck there is a cafe where you can eat, and for lovers of outdoor activities in the warmer months there is a bicycle rental service. </p><p>  In addition to the observation deck and nature, there is an armchair or funicular, where you can go down to the pier.  A 72-meter long ski jump is open all year.  Near the observation deck is the Trinity Church, known for the fact that it was here that Kutuzov prayed before the Battle of Borodino.  After enjoying the Sparrow Hills, you can board a pleasure boat on the pier and explore Moscow from the river.  And at the next opportunity, be sure to visit the Vorobyovy Gory again. </p><h2>  Gorky Park </h2><p>  The famous nature reserve in Moscow is a desirable place for any developer, as local residents can counteract this.  But not so long ago, the rights to it passed to the Park of Culture.  M. Gorky.  This greatly excited everyone, since the first actions on the part of the park‚Äôs management were the construction of a fence around the perimeter of the nature reserve, and they also limited access for the park‚Äôs regulars, athletes, coaches and others.  They built a buffet, closed one of the ski jumps and destroyed the informal parking lot, which had been used for a long time and used to.  And after rumors of an increase in building height and the construction of an underground car park under the observation deck, residents began to write letters and complaints to the city administration. </p>

    <p>  People do not want changes, because they are not often for the better.  Many are in favor of preserving a piece of nature, rather than covering everything with an artificial lawn, conducting communications, and making large-scale lighting.  How this story will end and whether the Vorobevy Gory Park will become another shopping and entertainment complex is still unknown.  Let's hope for the best. </p>
