    <p>  During the period of the <span>Great Migration of Peoples</span> and after the <span>fall of the Roman Empire</span> , the tribes of Saxons, Jutes and many others rushed to England.  In the course of a stubborn struggle between them, kingdoms were gradually formed, each of which had its own monarch.  In the VIII - IX centuries, the <span>British Isles</span> were subjected to systematic invasions of the Vikings, as a result of which many kingdoms weakened, and the kingdom of Wessex became dominant.  Alfred the Great, king of Wessex, was able to annex several neighboring kingdoms.  He is associated with the fastening on the throne of the Wessex dynasty of English kings, whose reign continues until the 11th century.  In the 11th century, England was invaded by the Danes, and the reign of the Danish kings begins. </p><p>  In 1066, <span>William I was</span> conquered by England. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the last English king of the York dynasty" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11532/275406.jpg" width="351"></div>  From this period began the rule of the Norman dynasty of English kings, which lasted until the middle of the XII century.  Then the throne passes to the Plantagenet dynasty.

Richard the First, or, as he was also called, the Lionheart for many years was in the crusade, during the reign of his brother - John Landless - England greatly lost its position in the international arena.  In the XIV century, England began the <span>Hundred Years War</span> with France, during which Richard II was overthrown by Henry Lancaster as a result of the coup.  Then begins the reign of the Lancaster dynasty of English kings. </p><p>  In the War of the Scarlet and White Roses, another branch of the Plantagenets comes to power - the York.  But the period of their reign was short.  Richard III is the last English king of the York Dynasty.  And already in 1485 the throne passed to Henry VII - a descendant of Lancaster.  From it begins the reign of the Tudors.  During this period, the Anglican Church was formed, and under Elizabeth I, England was transformed into a powerful and advanced European state in all respects. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="english royal dynasties" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11532/275414.jpg" width="294"></div>  The years of her power are called the "golden age", since not only the country's political situation is being developed and strengthened, but also culture and art.
