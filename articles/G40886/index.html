Is this position, title or rank?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  You may have heard such a word - "mayor."  What is this: position or surname, title or rank?  Does it relate to majors in the army?  When did this word first appear?  These and many other questions may be with you. </p><p>  Read on and you'll find the answers in this article. </p><h2>  Meaning of the word </h2><p>  In many countries of medieval Europe, Latin was still the main language.  This is because they were based on the wreckage of the once great Roman Empire.  But this language was called “vulgar Latin” as opposed to “classical”, because in different tribes it included dialectisms from their native dialects. </p><p>  So, it is to this language that the term “mayor” is referred.  This word first appears in the seventh century on the territory of modern France. </p><p>  So in the Merovingian dynasty they began to call the senior servant.  The term comes from mixing two words “major” - “senior”, “domus” - “home”.  That is, the main servant in the house. </p>

    <p>  So scientists answer the question of what is a mayor. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the image of the servant, as shown by the lackeys in the films, was alien to the carriers of this position.  Further we will see what they were in charge of, and you will be surprised at their capabilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Background to the position </h2><p>  Until the seventh century in <span>medieval Europe,</span> in particular, in the state of the Franks, the title "Seneschal" was adopted.  Its approximate value is “metropolitan”.  This servant was in charge of the preparation and distribution of dishes in the usual meals of the royal family, as well as the routine of feasts in the palace. </p><p>  Over time, for unknown reasons, his rights and obligations, as well as opportunities, begin to grow.  From the fifth to the seventh century, at the Merovingian court, this is just another one of hundreds of footmen, but after that everything changes. </p><p>  This person gets the opportunity to manage all the servants in the palace, without exception.  In addition, he could adjudicate at his discretion, became responsible for organizing all the ceremonies at court.  And most importantly, the domain army was under his command, while the king was absent from it. </p><p>  That is, in fact, the seneschal turns into the "right hand of the ruler," his governor.  From this time on, the title and position “mayor” appear. </p><h2>  Who is Mayord? </h2><p>  Until the first quarter of the seventh century, the bearers of this post served as the “chief assistant to the king”, “palace minister”.  But approximately since the reign of Dagobert the First (since 628), the power of the Mayordom has been equalized, and subsequently exceeds the monarchy. </p>

    <p>  In the annals of <span>this period</span> , the formula is preserved that "the king reigns, and rules the mayor." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Even more interesting events take place a little later.  Previously, the position dependent on the will of the king becomes elective (from among the aristocracy), and later hereditary.  Now the mayordomas took power completely in their hands, there were even examples when they removed the kings and seated themselves on the throne. </p><p>  The most striking such case was the decision taken by the son of Karl Martell.  Since Karl came to power, the mayor is not just a “shtetl ruler”.  Over the years of command, he defeated the armies of the same neighboring mayordom and became the "prince of all francs."  What distinguished his son so much, we learn further. </p><h2>  Most famous mayord </h2><p>  Thus, by the middle of the eighth century, the power of the mayordom in the Frankish kingdom became the only one.  In this state, such a situation has developed as in modern Britain, where the royal family "rules, but does not rule." </p><p>  It would seem that <span>Karl Martell</span> has achieved everything desired.  But as subsequent events have shown, everything can be completely different. </p><p>  His son, Pepin Short, with the assistance of the Pope, concludes the last Merovingian in the monastery, and he ascends to the throne. </p>

    <p>  Thus, the last mayor of the Franks and the first king from 751 becomes the founder of the new ruling dynasty.  In the chronicles, she appears under the name Carolinges. </p><p>  We learned from this article that the mayor is a post at the Merovingian court, which later grew into a new ruling dynasty. </p>
