  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About how to disable MTS services?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For the time being, many people practically do not pay attention to the services provided to us by the MTS cellular communication service, just until the constantly pop-up ads, spam messages and other services that can easily be dispensed with begin to really annoy.  When this moment comes, we begin to think about how to find a way out of this situation, and try to find an answer to the question of how to disable MTS services, especially since even those that were initially given to us as a gift, after a while suddenly become paid.  In addition, it turns out that there is an unspoken list of services that we automatically receive along with a SIM card and which we sometimes don‚Äôt even suspect, however, sometimes wondering - where are our money constantly disappearing? </p><p>  <strong>How to disable paid services on MTS?</strong> </p><p>  Consider several ways that exempt from unnecessary service, among which you can choose the most suitable for you.  For example, in order to disable the ‚Äúbeep‚Äù service, you need to do one of the following: </p><ol><li>  Dial the combination of numbers * 111 * 29 # and press the call. </li><li>  Go to the nearby MTS mobile office and ask the manager to turn off the ‚Äúbeep‚Äù, you must have a passport with you. </li><li>  Make a call to the MTS service center to one of the numbers below and state that you want to disable the ‚Äúbeep‚Äù service (or even the package of all paid services in one fell swoop): </li></ol><ul><li>  Toll free number 0890 (throughout Russia) - provided that the call is made from the MTS number.  Disabling services will be provided; </li><li>  Toll-free number 8 800 250 0890 - also valid in Russia, and you can call it, for example, from a megaphone or <span>landline number</span> ; </li><li>  Call roaming for free by calling +7 (846) 2675000. </li></ul><p>  <strong><span>How to disable</span> MTS <span>services</span> using a mobile assistant?</strong> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Go to the MTS website, select the Internet assistant. </p><p>  Examine information about obtaining a password that provides access to your personal account.  Send SMS number 111 to the number, which will contain the text "25 - space - password invented by you." </p><p>  In the window you must enter your password and phone number, after which - click "enter". </p><p>  You find yourself in your personal account, where you can manage your account, connect or refuse services and tariffs, and control the flow of money. </p><p>  In the menu you can see not only the ‚Äúbeep‚Äù, but also other paid services that secretly destroy your money. </p><p>  Residents of Ukraine can be advised on how to disable MTS services, as follows: </p><ul><li>  dial 700 and, having listened to the voice menu, select the function "deactivation of the beep service"; </li><li>  send a message with the text ‚Äúoff‚Äù to number 700. </li></ul><p>  The most common of the <span>imposed services</span> and ways to get rid of them: </p><p>  * 111 * 211420 # - this code will help to disable the "I'm in touch" service. </p><p>  * 111 * 6446 # - disables "All regions of the MTS of Russia." </p><p>  * 111 * 2110 # - relieve the service "Neighboring Regions". </p><p>  If you are interested in how to disable MTS services, for example, ‚ÄúClick‚Äù, then this is pretty simple and not difficult.  All you need is to go to the MTS menu on your mobile phone, then MTS-click, then activation and, finally, turn it off.  Just like everything is ingenious, but as a gift you get a mobile phone free of spam messages that were so annoying, bringing useless information that you were absolutely uninteresting and not needed at all. </p><p>  In addition, the <span>battery</span> will no longer be discharged longer, and this is another definite plus.  And, as they say, ‚Äúa penny saves a ruble,‚Äù and this proverb has a deep meaning, focusing on the fact that everyone should be able to count their money earned by righteous labor and not allow themselves to be robbed.  In a specific case, with the help of skillful tricks of advertising managers, cleverly selling their own, most often completely unnecessary information or services. </p>
