In those days, this territory was in the zone of interest of the NKVD.

The cost of this facility was approximately twelve billion rubles, eight of which were allocated from the federal budget. </p>

    <p>  The Kirov bridge in Samara is presented in the form of a screw structure and can pass up to thirty thousand cars per day.  He became the third crossing over the river.  The first was built back in 1954, the second - in 1974, and only forty years later, the city authorities decided to erect this building.  All residents were impatiently waiting for the Kirov bridge to be opened.  Samara really needed a new carriageway across the river so that the rest could be unloaded and thereby avoiding traffic jams, but the date of the start of its operation was postponed several times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where can I go? </h2><p>  This passage was built to give the left-bank part of the city development and provide access to such routes as the M5 leading to the Urals, as well as to Chimkent and other federal roads. </p><p>  Currently, the Kirov bridge in Samara can lead motorists to the village of Chernorechye, from where you can go to Belozerka and Nikolaevka.  Through it, you can also get to Novokuybyshevsk.  But in this case, the road will be twenty-five kilometers longer than through the Southern crossing.  Also, everyone is waiting for the Kirov bridge (Samara) to be opened, or rather its 2.5 km section, which will lead to a bypass road.  City officials promise that this event should happen next year. </p>

    <h2>  Start of operation </h2><p>  The grand opening of the Kirov bridge in Samara took place on October 10, 2014. All residents were waiting for this moment, since this object was built for seven years.  But due to late financing, it was still not possible to finish all the access roads to it. </p><p>  The opening was attended by the governor of the <span>Samara region</span> and the Minister of Transport of Russia.  They were also very pleased with such a grand event, held on the eve of Motorist Day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The opening of the Kirov bridge in Samara allowed the regional capital not only to get an alternative exit from the city, but also to develop and further develop the territory beyond the river.  Therefore, this object has strategic importance. </p><p>  The builders were the first to cross the bridge that day on their special equipment, while at the entrance to it a line of cars gathered who wished to drive along the bridge at the very moment of its opening.  They were ready to wait, not even minutes, but hours, to try out a perfectly smooth roadway. </p>

    <h2>  Impressions of the townspeople </h2><p>  This news was very joyful for Samara and all its inhabitants, therefore it caused a storm of positive emotions.  They were happy that, thanks to the new construction across the river, their city would finally put an end to eternal traffic jams and traffic jams.  Thus, the Samara residents received an additional means of communication in their regional center, which they were very pleased with. </p><h2>  Litigation </h2><p>  Last year, the Department of the Federal Service of the Middle Volga Region for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Supervision filed a lawsuit in which it demanded that the Ministry of Transport and Highways of the region be brought to administrative responsibility, namely, to suspend the operation of this facility.  During their inspection, they found that the Kirov bridge (Samara, 2014) has not yet received permission to launch, but, nevertheless, traffic along it is carried out, albeit according to a temporary scheme. </p>

Then another lawsuit followed.  In this case, the employees of Themis issued the following verdict, according to which the Ministry of Transport must pay a fine of fifty thousand rubles, but the operation of the bridge will not be suspended.

    <h2>  Future plans </h2><p>  Regional authorities plan to complete the Kirov bridge in Samara before the end of this year.  The photos taken at this facility show that traffic along it is currently being carried out according to a temporary scheme, since there are no access roads to this structure across the river. </p><p>  But, nevertheless, a large part of the bridge, equal to eight kilometers, runs from Kirov Avenue to the highway through Nikolaevka.  In the future, he will have to allow motorists to safely pass to the Samara bypass road. </p><p>  At the end of construction will require about four hundred million rubles.  These funds have already received a new contractor, who will finish the construction work at this facility. </p>

Thanks to this construction, roads in the regional capital have become freer, which allows citizens not to stand in traffic jams and traffic jams.
