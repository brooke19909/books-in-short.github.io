But Phenicia itself was already captured by Assyria in the VIII century, which, firstly, led to the independence of some <span>Phoenician colonies,</span> and secondly, caused the flight of many of its inhabitants from the country (some settled in a recent colony).  Carthage became the new leader of the region, occupying the territory of the former metropolis.  The place where Carthage is located (its geographical location), allowed him not only to gain a foothold, but also to gradually develop his power and influence in the region.

    <p>  It was located on the shores of North Africa, which predetermined its naval dominance and the successful development of trade.  Vessels crossing the Mediterranean Sea inevitably passed between Sicily (partially partly in the power of the Carthaginians and finally subdued already in the 4th century BC), which meant for the state the possibility of establishing its own rules on the sea.  By the VI century <span>BC, the</span> population of the capital reached 70 thousand people, and it became the largest city in the entire western Mediterranean. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first serious military rivals of the state were the ancient Greeks, who began in the 7th century their colonization of the entire Mediterranean coast.  In particular, in the Greco-Persian wars of the fifth century, Carthage occupied the Persian side.  The global confrontation with the Greeks was experiencing variable successes and failures.  However, Carthage significantly expanded its territory mainly due to the North African coast, the south of the Iberian Peninsula and some islands <br>  on the sea.  In addition to conquest, the Carthaginians were also famous for successful trade, which was the main source of state wealth.  Their merchants sailed on the coasts of three continents - Europe, Asia, Africa, as a result of which many nations found out where Carthage is located. </p><p>  <strong>First Punic War</strong> </p>

Their conflict was caused by the natural desire of the Latins to expand their possessions, as a result of which earlier good neighborly relations between them began to deteriorate.

    <p>  The first Punic War (the Romans called the Carthaginians Puns) began in 264 BC, mainly for domination of strategically important Sicily.  The Romans dominated the land battles, but almost could not oppose the fleet of Carthage.  And only in the year 241, when the fleet and army of Carthage were already exhausted, the Romans were able to gather soldiers from their last forces, moving the theater of operations to Africa.  The victory of the Romans at the Egat Islands ended the First Punic War, which led to the loss of dominant position in the region and a number of agreements disadvantageous for the Carthaginians. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <strong>The Second and Third Punic Wars</strong> </p>

In an attempt to revenge, it began the army commander Hannibal Barka.  Instead of invading the territory of the <span>Apennine Peninsula</span> from the sea, Hannibal led his troops bypassing - through Spain and the Alps, gaining a number of important victories along the way (among them the famous battle in the minority near Cannes in 216, which hit the republic hard and led Hannibal to the side significant part of Italy).  However, the Romans still managed to survive, and then again transfer the fighting to Africa.  After a series of victories, they regained their military advantage, and the position of the Punians was greatly complicated.

    <p>  The decisive battle that determined the victory of Rome was the battle of Zam in 202.  And again, Carthage managed to recover from defeat.  Fifty years later, the city again became one of the richest in the Mediterranean.  Such a situation, firstly, slowed down the economy of Rome, and secondly, it was simply dangerous. </p><p>  In 149 BC, the republic started a third war.  By concluding a treaty with the hostile king of Carthage, the Numudian king Massanissa, the Romans received a reason for military invasion.  Having landed troops on the coast of North Africa, where Carthage is located, the troops of Rome besieged the city.  This went on for three whole years, but ended with its capture, almost complete destruction and destruction of a significant part of the population.  In the future, the city continued to exist until the Arab conquests, but never had any importance. </p><p>  Where modern Carthage is located (or rather, its remains), in the immediate vicinity is the city of Tunisia - the capital of the same state in the Maghreb. </p>
