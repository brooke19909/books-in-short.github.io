The Tatars, who lived there in the beginning, were sworn enemies of the Mongols, but they had to come to terms with the fact that the Mongols conquered them.  Thus, both of these tribes <span>Western Europe</span> and Russia began to be called simply Tatars.

    <p>  From the second half of the 12th century, tribal relations began to wither away from the Mongols, and with the advent of private property separate families were formed.  At that time, Russia was a more developed state than the Mongols who wandered. </p><p>  The richest among the Mongols was considered the one who had more cattle and horses.  To do this, they needed large areas of land.  The Mongols had their own leaders, who were called khans.  The khans in the submission were noyons, who were the leaders of the tribes.  It was they who seized the best land for grazing for their livestock.  The Khans with Noyons contained fighting squads consisting of Arats, who were simply poor tribesmen.  Large khans could afford to have a select guard, in which the nukers served. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

The Mongol Empire did not build cities, and wealth was measured by the number of pastures and cattle.  It was believed that the Mongols were a backward civilization.  They were a very warlike people.  In order to capture new pastures, they without hesitation destroyed those to whom these pastures belonged earlier.

    <p>  The Mongols put their children in the saddle from childhood, and therefore each of them was a great rider and masterfully owned a lasso, a bow with arrows.  Their horses were shaggy, stunted, possessed of amazing stamina. </p><p>  Closer to the XIII century, the Mongol khans began to fight for the primacy.  The victors subjugated the vanquished, and they became subjects of a stronger khan and fought on his side.  And the rebels became slaves.  The Mongol empire passed its formation by the ongoing wars of the tribes, and later by their alliances.  The leaders exalted themselves in <span>internecine wars,</span> they did not know how to act differently in those days. </p>

His eldest son was Temucheng, whom we all know as Genghis Khan.  After some time, Esugei was poisoned, and his army fled.

    <p>  The widow lived in poverty for a long time until she grew up and gathered his squad, with whom he fought with other khans.  He succeeded, having subjugated several Mongol tribes, to conquer the throne ‚ÄúHamag Mongol ulus‚Äù for himself, which means that all the Mongols should have obeyed only him.  At these times, he was a young, brave, reckless, and merciless warrior.  But under certain circumstances he knew how to retreat. </p><p>  It was Tamuchen who carried out the reforms under which the decimal system of army organization was introduced.  He created a personal guard with huge privileges for noyons and nukers, who were exempted from taxes.  At the same time, he conquered the rest of the tribes.  The last tribe they conquered were the great Tatars.  At this time, the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMongolia reached 22% of the Earth.  In 1204-1205, Temuchen was proclaimed Genghis Khan, the great khan.  It was from these times that the Mongol Empire began to exist. </p>
