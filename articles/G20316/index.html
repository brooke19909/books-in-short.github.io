It began to operate in 40 provinces of our country, in most of which landowners owned land.  Zemstvo plots were created in them.  This article will highlight aspects of the labor activity of their superiors, who were endowed with great powers in those days. </p><h2>  Background to this post </h2><p>  It is customary to consider the forerunners of the zemstvo chiefs to be <span>world mediators whose</span> main task was to enact the provision on the peasantry adopted in 1861.  These people also resolved situations arising from the established order of land relations between landowners and peasants.  Over time, the number of global intermediaries has been reduced, their institution has become in need of immediate transformation. </p><p>  In 1874, this post was abolished and a new one was introduced: county-level peasant affairs.  The inconvenient aspects of the work of this organization came to light very quickly.  Members of the county presence did not cope with their duties, riots broke out in the volosts, taxes were collected negligently and not on time, cases of embezzlement of money were observed.  These prerequisites led to the emergence of zemstvo chiefs (1889 is the starting point of their labor activity). </p>

    <h2>  Special post requirements </h2><p>  The need to introduce a new post was explained by the fact that in Russia there was no power close to the people.  Only persons belonging to the local nobility class could enter the institute of zemstvo commanders.  Applicants had special requirements.  They had to own certain property (land or other real estate).  It was possible to become the head of the zemsky district only with higher education. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  If there were not enough candidates who met the above requirements, nobles who did not have the necessary education and who had undergone military or civil service were appointed to this post.  But in such cases, they should have had a much greater property qualification.  The Minister of the Interior had the authority, bypassing all conditions, to replenish the ranks of the heads of zemstvo plots by local representatives of the nobility. </p><h2>  Service Benefits </h2><p>  Zemsky chiefs had the right to wear a special sign on a gilded chain.  It was a circle, on one side of which was depicted the coat of arms of Russia, framed by the name of their post.  On the other side of the sign flaunted an inscription indicating the day of approval of the Regulation on Zemsky chiefs. </p>

    <p>  The law on zemstvo commanders gave these people special privileges in relation to courts operating in the volost.  They had the right to control the activities of the judiciary.  However, the representatives of this profession were not entitled to cancel the decisions of the <span>volost courts</span> . </p><h2>  Practical work </h2><p>  The status of zemstvo commanders over the years has become increasingly important.  Based on them as the main executive branch in the field, important affairs in the state were planned. </p><p>  In order to control the redistribution of land received by the peasants as a result of the reforms of the 1860s, a corresponding decree was issued.  It was valid only in the provinces in which zemstvo plots functioned.  In these areas, according to a certain provision, in 1899 the process of collecting salary taxes from the population was streamlined. </p><p>  An important role was assigned to representatives of this profession in the Agrarian reform.  The government in 1906 made it easier for peasants to leave the community.  He was given the opportunity to secure for themselves cultivated plots of land.  Control over the implementation of this decree in the field was conducted by zemstvo chiefs.  The activities of these people led to the success of the Agrarian reform. </p>
