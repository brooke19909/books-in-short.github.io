To the east of it is Saudi Arabia, and to the north is Iran.  The territory of a small country is about 750 square kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahrain language" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1219496.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Over the past few years, the small <span>island nation</span> has outpaced the rest of the world in economic growth.  In addition, Bahrain's crime rate is extremely low, and the warm sea and the scorching sun are the main reasons for the increased demand for tours to the country ruled by the king. </p><h2>  Bahrain: language </h2><p>  The official language of the state is Arabic, and several of its dialects are used.  English is taught at school and is widely spoken in the business environment. </p><p>  Interestingly, in Bahrain, interest in the Russian language is being steadily growing, which is studied in special centers, since they see a great future for it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Unique cultural monuments </h2><p>  Fascinating excursions are offered to everyone who prefers an active rest and is tired of basking on the white beaches.  The unusual sights of Bahrain attract millions of tourists a year.  An ancient country with stunning architecture and noisy <span>oriental bazaars</span> stores many interesting stories that cannot be told. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the small country has many famous cultural monuments that amaze the splendor of even the most sophisticated travelers.  In addition, according to biblical traditions, where Bahrain is now, the <span>Garden of Eden was located,</span> and for the first time tourists who came here feel themselves in a real paradise. </p><h2>  Mound keeping secrets of bygone civilizations </h2><p>  Where to start acquaintance with the smallest Arab state? </p><p>  One cannot fail to visit one of the main attractions of the country - Calat al-Bahrain.  A place with many unsolved secrets was built by man in 2300 BC. </p><p>  Once a high hill, created by superimposing several <span>cultural layers</span> on each other, was the capital of a very ancient civilization.  Later it became an ordinary fortress, and in 2005 the historical artifact was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p><h2>  Excavations of archaeologists </h2><p>  Now, excavations are being conducted at this place, and before the eyes of the amazed visitors of the hill, in all its splendor, civilization disappears with the buried underground houses, churches, defenses. </p><p>  And now it is no secret to anyone that the mound has been a very important shopping center for many centuries.  And on top of the hill is a Portuguese defensive fort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kalat al bahrain" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1219495.jpg" width="600"></div>

The historical importance of this hill lies in the fact that there is no mention of the past civilizations that existed on this territory in the chronicles, except in the Sumerian chronicles.  And excavations are a great opportunity to learn something new about the culture of people who lived many years ago. </p><h2>  Bahrain World Trade Center </h2><p>  In a state in which ancient temples are harmoniously combined with the most modern architectural structures, skyscrapers occupy a separate place in city panoramas. </p><p>  The most famous of them is two giant towers and is located in the <span>capital of Bahrain.</span>  There are several high-rises near the shopping center, but their significance fades against the background of a skyscraper for the construction of which $ 150 million was spent. </p><p>  The architects of the grandiose project did not want to disrupt the picturesque view of the <span>Persian Gulf,</span> and at the same time they faced an important task - to make every effort so that the Bahrain World Trade Center fits into the urban environment. </p><h2>  Smart construction </h2><p>  And when, after four years of construction in Manama, the financial center of the country, the skyscraper opened its doors, the residents of the state gasped in amazement.  The beauty of the shopping center, which was a tower in the form of sails swollen from the wind, exceeded all expectations.  Fifty floors with a height of 240 meters and 26 modern elevators made of transparent glass will surprise with the power and grandeur of all visitors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is Bahrain" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1219494.jpg" width="585"></div>

    <p>  But the most interesting thing is that the Bahrain World Trade Center is a ‚Äúwith intelligence‚Äù building.  High technology has touched all areas: from security to communications.  And the main highlight of the unique structure is a wind turbine, which provides a huge building with electricity. </p><p>  The latest development of architects, arranged in such a way that the "mills" fall into the squally wind zone from the Persian Gulf, draws the attention of the public to the problem of saving natural resources. </p><h2>  Pearl Museum </h2><p>  Not far from the twin towers is an unusual museum, which presents a variety of collections of the highest quality pearls.  The inhabitants of the kingdom have long been engaged in the extraction of precious stones under water.  Despite the fact that modern technology does not stand still, and methods have already been developed for cultivating <span>artificial pearls, the</span> local population continues to search for jewelry. </p><p>  Museum expositions store the rarest types of stone and oyster shells, from which buttons for clothes were made. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahrain World Trade Center" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1219493.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The unique sights of Bahrain are so unique that only here is the world's only giant monument to pearls. </p><h2>  Barbar temple </h2><p>  Apart from the rest of the country's temple buildings is an architectural monument dated to the third millennium BC.  The majestic complex has become an integral part of tourist routes. </p><p>  Discovered in 1954, the religious sights of Bahrain allowed scientists to compose a life picture of those who lived here many centuries ago, because three magnificent buildings are part of the heritage of the ancient culture of Dilmun, which was mentioned by Mesopotamian manuscripts. </p><p>  Smooth walls and steps made of expertly crafted and laid stone appear to tourists.  Research expeditions discovered an underground pool and a sacrificial altar of cult significance, in which bloody rites were performed in honor of the ancient gods who ruled the underground possessions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of bahrain" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1219487.jpg" width="600"></div>
