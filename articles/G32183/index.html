    <h2></h2><h2>  Coffee making equipment </h2><p>  Before you enjoy a cup of a strong sparkling elixir, you must go through one very important process.  Direct manufacture.  To do this, select special equipment.  The first and familiar to almost every individual subject is a Turk.  Its second name is "cezva".  This metal ‚Äúbucket‚Äù with a handle and a small ‚Äúnose‚Äù boasts a rather long history.  With his help, coffee was brewed by our great-great-great-great-grandfathers.  In the modern world, only a small part of people know how to use a Turk correctly.  For those who love coffee, but do not know how to brew it, technological progress comes to the rescue.  Today, any coffee machine or coffee machine can handle the preparation of a natural and invigorating drink.  Which is better - the choice is yours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thanks to the development of engineers and scientists, now you can enjoy a fragrant elixir only by pressing a button on the machine.  It can be either a coffee maker or a coffee machine.  For home, office and garden, both the first and second devices are suitable.  In addition, this equipment has proven itself in cafes, restaurants, pubs and other public places.  And if for business purposes the supply of equipment is the work of specially trained personnel, then how to choose a machine for the house?  How to understand the difference between a coffee machine and a coffee machine? </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Cost and Care </h2><p>  It would seem that these two devices are almost identical.  Relying only on a little theoretical knowledge, many people, without looking, make a choice in favor of one of the devices, then lamenting about the wasted money.  In order to meet your expectations from the purchase of equipment, you should carefully study the information about the purchased product.  Let's see how the coffee machine differs from the coffee maker in fact and what you should pay attention to when making a purchase. </p><p>  Let's start with the description.  Coffee makers are small appliances that attract customers with their price and ease of use.  The device is small in size and with a set of minimum functions can be purchased for less than 50 cu  This is the first difference between a coffee machine and a coffee maker: not a single device of the first kind will cost so cheap. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second parameter by which these devices are differentiated is the method of care and cleaning.  Making coffee in a coffee maker is not difficult.  However, it is sometimes difficult to care for.  The absence of flushing, decalcification, pressure gauge and other functions in many versions of the equipment makes cleaning the device a long and unpleasant process.  While there is no need to disturb the coffee machine for this purpose.  In this technique, everything is brought to automaticity: the system independently rinses the remains of the thick and removes scale.  This is another plus on the account of the coffee machine.  However, this is not all the differences. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Energy Saving and Many Models </h2><p>  An interesting fact is that many coffee makers do not require electricity for the coffee process.  This is the fourth parameter that sets the line between the equipment. </p><p>  Of course, a great influence on the choice of the device is exerted by the presence in it of functions for preparing a different type of aromatic drink.  A coffee maker, as a rule, does not allow its owner to make a choice, giving only one single option in the form of espresso.  The competitor being compared sometimes has dozens of different modes. </p><p>  The presence of only a few models is the difference between a coffee machine and a coffee machine.  The latter includes several categories.  There are carob, drip, geyser, capsule and other devices.  How not to get confused here! </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Espresso lovers </h2><p>  The horn equipment ‚Äúdrives‚Äù the steam through the ground coffee and dispenses a sparkling espresso directly into the cup.  This type of apparatus has its own classification.  This group includes pump and boiler coffee makers.  The first category produces great espresso with a small proportion of caffeine.  The process of serving a drink to a cup is influenced by high steam pressure.  Thanks to this method of operation, this device is most in demand among other coffee makers.  The boiler has a low pressure and delivers a drink that has passed the effects of boiling water. </p><p>  A more automated form of carob appliances is a capsule coffee maker.  In this embodiment, there is no need to monitor the dosage of coffee: special ‚Äútablets‚Äù that are placed inside the apparatus already contain the required amount of ground ingredient. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Simple and affordable models </h2><p>  <span>Drip coffee makers</span> operate by the principle of filtration.  Water is heated in a special tank, which then makes its way to the filter filled with ground aromatic mass.  Penetrating through a layer of coffee, the drop absorbs the ‚Äúnotes‚Äù of the drink and then flows into a special container.  As a rule, such coffee makers are the most common and inexpensive. </p><p>  Geyser devices have the simplest system for making coffee, which is somewhat similar to the functioning of a carob device.  This coffee maker is equipped with two compartments: in the first (lower) is water, and in the second (upper) - ground grains.  The appliance is installed on a burner or a special heating device (it can even be attached to the corners of a fire), and under the influence of steam, drops saturated with coffee drip back down.  And this continues until the drink reaches the desired strength. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  The most important difference </h2><p>  In turn, coffee machines do not have such a wide range.  And at the same time, the process of making a fragrant and delicious drink in such an apparatus is fully automated.  Before the user there are only two tasks: pour grain and select a mode.  And that‚Äôs all.  Grinding, dosing, sweeping, filter cleaning, frothing milk and many other functions are fully automated.  This is the main difference between a coffee machine and a coffee maker.  There is no need to manually grind the grains, pour them neatly into the container, lay out the filters and clean - all this is done automatically.  You just have to reach out and take a glass of a wonderful drink.  Of course, such a miracle of technology will have to spend a fair amount of money.  Is it worth it or not - it's up to you. </p><p>  For espresso lovers, a coffee machine or <span>carob coffee maker is</span> perfect <span>.</span>  Gourmets, of course, will never stop their choice on drip machines.  And they can be understood: these devices that use boiling water only ruin the taste of coffee, washing out a huge amount of caffeine instead of a real aroma. </p>
