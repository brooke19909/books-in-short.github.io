Sometimes we simply forget that our country has such a rich cultural heritage, many picturesque places and preserved historical monuments.  What is it worth seeing Smolensk or Veliky Novgorod, walk along the streets of the beautiful city of Yaroslavl?  It takes at least a week to explore all the sights of Moscow or St. Petersburg!  But today is not about that.  I would like to talk about the glorious city of Astrakhan and its main architectural attraction - the Astrakhan Kremlin. </p><h2>  A bit about the city </h2><p>  Astrakhan can rightfully be considered the Caspian capital of our vast Motherland.  The city is spread over eleven islands of the <span>Caspian lowland,</span> and the famous Volga River flows through its territory. </p><p>  When we talk about holidays in Astrakhan, the first thing that comes to mind is fishing and sightseeing in the city, one of which will be discussed in our article today. </p><p>  Fortunately, the Astrakhan Kremlin is not the only attraction; here you can find various religious buildings, a large number of museums of completely different categories, estates and even art galleries.  The State Musical and <span>Drama Theater</span> deserves special attention <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="organum-visus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sculpture in Astrakhan" class="if uuid-2347599" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2347599.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The Astrakhan Kremlin is one of the main historical sights of Astrakhan, which is a monument of federal significance.  Geographically, the Kremlin has an excellent location in the city, on an island washed by the Volga, Tsarevka and Cossack Erik.  To begin acquaintance with a masterpiece of military engineering art of the half of the 16th century is from history. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="cyna.news" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the Astrakhan Kremlin" class="if uuid-2347585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2347585.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The Astrakhan Kremlin is a full-fledged historical and architectural complex, the history of which originates in the distant 1558.  Initially, the fortress was conceived as a completely wooden structure, but because of the difficult relations between Russia and the Turkish-Tatar troops, it was necessary to build a stronger and more reliable defense. </p><p>  The construction of the Astrakhan Kremlin began during the reign of <span>Ivan VI the</span> Terrible, and ended with his son Fedor Ivanovich.  An interesting fact is that the material for the construction was the remains of the brick of the former capital of the Golden Horde.  The uniqueness of the Astrakhan Kremlin at that time was that it not only performed a defensive function, but was also an important outlet. </p><p>  Today, the construction is an entire ensemble of buildings, the study of which will require at least several days.  The length of the Kremlin almost reaches one and a half kilometers, and the height of the walls - from 5 to 8 meters.  In addition, the construction serves as a working museum.  Since 1974, the flow of tourists has not stopped.  Arriving here, you will not only admire the architecture of the complex, but you can also visit the ethnographic museum or exhibition, which is constantly held in Zeichhaus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Let's take a closer look at the most iconic sights located on the territory of the Astrakhan Kremlin. </p><h2>  Trinity Cathedral </h2><p>  Trinity Monastery is the first building in the city.  Initially, a wooden temple was erected here, but later it was replaced by a magnificent cathedral of stone.  Next to the Trinity Cathedral is the Cyril Chapel, named after Cyril, buried inside the first abbot of this monastery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oldboy.icnet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trinity Cathedral" class="if uuid-2347593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2347593.jpg"></div><h2>  Assumption Cathedral </h2><p>  The Assumption Cathedral is the main cathedral in the Kremlin, as well as an excellent image of Russian church architecture.  This is the first point that catches your eye when entering the territory of the Kremlin.  Its golden domes sparkling in the sun are able to catch the eye of any tourist.  The Assumption Cathedral consists of two floors, the lower tier acts as the tomb of the hierarchs, and the upper is intended for open visits - this is a fairly spacious and bright hall.  The Astrakhan Cathedral in the Kremlin is worth seeing for every tourist personally. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ruspeach.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral in the Kremlin" class="if uuid-2347586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2347586.jpg"></div><h2>  Nikolsky Gate </h2><p>  An equally important attraction on the territory of the Kremlin, located on the side of the northern passage tower.  Once Peter I himself entered through these gates, but after a while the Nikolsky gates were subjected to serious changes and in this form appear before tourists in our time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Bell tower </h2><p>  The attention of visitors is drawn to the eighty-meter bell tower, proudly rising above the main passage gates of the Kremlin in Astrakhan.  The gates over which the bell tower is installed are called "Prechistenskie".  The modern bell tower was erected in 1910, and there are also clocks with an electric motor, beating every quarter of an hour. </p><h2>  Archbishop's Tower </h2><p>  Each of the towers of the Astrakhan Kremlin deserves special attention, and it is worth noting that there are a huge number of them throughout the territory.  If you move forward a bit, adhering to the left side of the Prechistenskaya bell tower described above, you can run into the eastern corner tower, which is called the Bishop's.  The name came from the Astrakhan diocese.  In 1828, a large-scale reconstruction of the walls of the Bishop's Tower was made.  A photo of the Astrakhan Kremlin is presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.smileplanet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kremlin walls" class="if uuid-2347596" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2347596.jpg"></div><h2>  Zhitnaya tower </h2><p>  The uniqueness of this building is that it is one of the few buildings that has been preserved since the inception of the Kremlin itself.  It is also worth noting that the Zhitnaya Tower is the most protected building in the Kremlin.  It is surrounded on one side by a lake, and on the other by numerous structures of the farmyard, referred to as the ‚Äúlittle serfress‚Äù. </p><h2>  Crimean tower </h2><p>  If in the previous paragraph we were talking about the most protected structure, then the Crimean tower repeatedly acted as a defensive structure and reflected the Crimean raids.  Due to regular battles in its vicinity, the Crimean Tower was rebuilt more than once. </p><h2>  Red gate </h2><p>  The highest point of the Kremlin hillock and a very important point from a strategic point of view.  Tower ‚ÄúRed Gate‚Äù is a polyhedron, this design promotes all-round defense.  Geographically, the tower is located in the northwestern part of the wall.  Today you can see the spiral staircases leading to the tower, which previously did not exist - this is the result of the reconstruction of 1958. </p><h2>  Water gate </h2><p>  According to historical records, between Nikolsky and Red gates there was a cache with lattice doors.  At the time of the reconstruction in 1970, a half-filled entrance was found, the so-called ‚ÄúWater Gates‚Äù, since they were the only secret passage to the Volga coast to replenish water supplies. </p><h2>  Artillery (torture) tower </h2><p>  At one time, it served as a venue for judicial inquiries and various kinds of torture, in fact, from here its second name went.  Previously, the Zeleny Yard adjoined it - an old powder cellar, which is the same age as the fortress wall itself. </p><p>  A tour of the territory of the Astrakhan Kremlin is a complete great pleasure.  Travelers can significantly expand their horizons, learn something new and remember the well-forgotten old. </p><h2>  Museum </h2><p>  As we have already said, it is customary to consider the museum on the territory of the fortress wall as a separate attraction.  The institution first opened its doors to visitors in 1974 and has been successfully operating to this day.  From that moment, work began on the restoration of the main structures, and the complex itself received the status of a reserve. </p><p>  Most of the exhibitions of the Astrakhan Kremlin are military in nature, but nonetheless, all tourists are given a unique opportunity to get acquainted with the history of their native state.  The creation of this place is directly related to the accession of new territories to Russia.  It was these events that opened the way for our country to the Caspian Sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="astrakult.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top view of the Assumption Cathedral" class="if uuid-2347587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2347587.jpg"></div><p>  Museum tickets can be purchased directly at the box office or on the official website.  Admission for adults is 300 rubles, for students - 180 rubles and for schoolchildren 120 rubles.  In the summer, the demand for visiting the museum increases significantly, so it is better to plan your route in advance.  In addition, you can book a tour of the Astrakhan Kremlin.  It is advisable to find out all the details directly on the spot. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Let's start directly with this question: where are you from?  Nonresident travelers come from different parts of the country; no one has encountered a shortage of rail or air tickets.  Direct trains run regularly from Moscow, and the city also has its own international airport. </p><p>  From the railway station in Astrakhan regularly runs public transport.  You need to catch the bus following the route ‚ÄúLenin Square‚Äù - ‚ÄúOctober Square‚Äù.  Drive the Kremlin is almost impossible due to its good location on one of the highest points of the city.  Also on the territory of the Kremlin is a huge bell tower, brightly reflecting the sun's rays in clear weather.  Stone walls play no less catchy role: since their height reaches eight meters, it is difficult not to notice such a structure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rossija.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The site in the Kremlin" class="if uuid-2347598" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2347598.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  On this, our article is approaching its logical conclusion.  Astrakhan is a unique city in Russia, able to surprise with its beautiful nature, a unique kind of activity, such as hunting and fishing, as well as numerous monuments of art. </p><p>  As for the main attraction of the city, the local Kremlin occupies an important place in the history of the state and is a great monument of engineering and military art.  Everyone should know the history of their country, and the opportunity to see everything with their own eyes will only strengthen knowledge in our heads.
