And the wise rulers and commanders, feeling this, did not rush headlong at the enemy - they put up, accumulated popular forces in order to defeat the enemy for sure, while retaining most of their troops. </p><h2>  Life and exploits of Alexander Nevsky </h2><p>  The Grand Prince of Novgorod is one of the people who not only influenced the fate of our people and the Fatherland, but also changed them in many ways, and also predetermined the further course of history, centuries ahead. </p><p>  Prince Alexander was born in 1220 (some sources indicate 1221) in Pereyaslavl Zalessky.  His father is Pereyaslavl Prince Yaroslav.  Mother - Theodosius, the youngest daughter of Prince Mstislav. </p><p>  From a young age, Alexander was involved in political events that unfolded around the reign in Novgorod the Great at that time.  Most of the life of the great commander, thinker, philosopher is connected with this city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Novgorod Principality </h2><p>  In early January 1231, Alexander became a formal prince of Novgorod on a par with his brother.  In fact, all power was in the hands of his father.  In 1233, brother Fedor died.  In 1236, Prince Yaroslav took the Kiev throne, vacated by then.  From that moment, 16-year-old Alexander becomes the full ruler of Novgorod. </p><p>  You can often hear the question: ‚ÄúWhat feats did Alexander Nevsky accomplish?‚Äù  Today we will tell you about it.  But first, I would like to note that the beginning of his reign in Novgorod came at a terrible time - the Tatar invasion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-561496" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/561496.jpg?1550071459"></div><p>  Batyr hordes did not reach Novgorod, but at that time the largest Russian cities were destroyed, the most daring princes died. </p><p>  In addition, German knights advancing from the west posed a great danger to Novgorod.  And Alexandra Sweden was worried, which at the beginning of the XIII century began to encroach on the territory of Russia. </p><h2>  Battle on the Neva </h2><p>  It is necessary to describe the military feats of Alexander Nevsky from this battle, because this was the first serious test for the young prince.  I must say that he withstood it with honor, while showing the qualities of not only a brilliant commander, but also a wise politician. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  With a small squad, without waiting for help from his father and other princes, Alexander went on a campaign.  Along the way, he teamed up with the Ladoga and suddenly (July 15) attacked the Swedish camp.  As you know, the Russian army defeated the Swedes.  With huge losses of the enemy, the Russians lost 20 people.  There is an opinion that the losses in Alexander‚Äôs army are somewhat underestimated, but at the same time, the significance of the battle on the Neva is obvious - despite the Mongol yoke, Russia was able to defend its borders. </p><p>  Unconditional victory was very important for the twenty-year-old prince.  She brought him great fame and an honorable name - Nevsky. </p><p>  After this event, Alexander quarreled with the Novgorodians and left the city with his family, mother and ‚Äúhis yard‚Äù.  Probably, the reason for the conflict was his imperious (following the example of his father) reign.  It caused resistance to the boyars.  Alexander moved to Pereyaslavl, where he became a prince. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-561497" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/561497.jpg?1550071459"></div><p>  Without a strong ruler, Novgorod could not resist another enemy - the crusaders.  Knights in alliance with the Estonians (‚Äúmiracle‚Äù) captured Izborsk, and later Pskov.  A year later, the city of Tesov on the Luga River was in their hands.  Novgorodians began to ask Yaroslav to send their son to help.  At first, the grand duke sent his younger offspring, Andrey, to Novgorod, but after a repeated request, the townspeople agreed to send Alexander.  The exploits of Alexander Nevsky were well-known to everyone, so special hopes were pinned on him.  And I must say that he fully justified them.  In 1241, the Novgorodians gleefully greeted the young prince. </p><h2>  The battle with the Germans </h2><p>  All the exploits of Alexander Nevsky are of great importance in the development of Russian statehood.  Victory over the Germans is no exception. </p><p>  Prince Alexander, having arrived in Novgorod, began to act decisively.  In the same year he captured the Kopotje Fortress, which the Germans erected.  He captured some of the opponents, partly released him home, and hanged the traitors (leaders and Estonians). </p><p>  A year later, Alexander, with the Novgorodians and the brother-in-law of his brother Andrei, moved to Pskov.  The city was liberated from the invaders quite simply.  Part of the Germans was killed, part sent to Novgorod as military booty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-561498" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/561498.jpg?1550071459"></div><p>  Building on the success, the Russian squads moved to Estonia, but in the first clash, Alexander's advance detachment was defeated.  The Russian soldiers retreated. </p><p>  On April 5, 1242, a battle took place on <span>Lake Peipsi,</span> which in history was called the <span>Battle of the Ice.</span>  Estonians and Germans, moving in a ‚Äúpig‚Äù (wedge), broke through the advance detachment of the Russians, but were soon surrounded and destroyed. </p><h2>  The last feat of Alexander Nevsky </h2><p>  In 1245, the Lithuanian army led by Mindovg moved to the cities of Torzhok and Bezhetsk.  When people interested in the life of the great commander ask: ‚ÄúWhat is the last feat of Alexander Nevsky?‚Äù, The researchers reply that this is undoubtedly the defeat of the Lithuanians. </p><p>  Having liberated Toropets, Prince Alexander killed ten Lithuanian princes.  After that, he dismissed the Novgorodians home and overtook the Lithuanian army and completely defeated the Lithuanian army near Lake Zhizets.  Returning to Novgorod, the prince's squad defeated another squad of Lithuanians. </p><p>  Alexander‚Äôs squad was a formidable force.  Even the mention of her terrified the enemies.  3 feats of Alexander Nevsky, which he performed with his valiant warriors, could not help but reach Batu.  After the defeat of the Lithuanians, Alexander was ‚Äúsummoned‚Äù to the Horde. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-562638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/562638.jpg?1550071459"></div><h2>  Relations with the Tatar-Mongols </h2><p>  In 1247, Andrei, and after his brother and Alexander Nevsky, went to Batu, to the Horde.  The brothers returned only in 1249.  Andrew received a label from the Khan on the throne in Vladimir, and Alexander - in Kiev.  Formally, the status granted to Alexander was higher.  But Kiev devastated by the Tatars practically lost its significance in the life of the state.  Therefore, Alexander was not satisfied with this decision.  Without stopping in Kiev, he went to Novgorod. </p><p>  The policy of Alexander Nevsky for many years determined the relationship between Russia and the Horde, West and East.  Later the policy of appeasing the Horde was continued by the Moscow princes - great-grandchildren and grandchildren of Alexander Nevsky.  It was they who eventually managed to revive the power of Russia and, finally, to throw off the hated yoke. </p><h2>  Diplomat Prince Alexander </h2><p>  Enumerating the exploits of Alexander Nevsky, one cannot limit oneself only to his military achievements.  He was a successful diplomat, able to conclude very important treaties for the state.  In 1251, he managed to sign an agreement between Norway and Novgorod on the delimitation of border disputes and tribute collections in a vast territory inhabited by Sami and Karelians.  In 1260, a trade agreement was concluded with L√ºbeck, Gotland and German cities.  It turned out to be very durable.  They were referred to him even in 1420. </p><h2>  The last days of Alexander </h2><p>  Returning in 1263 from his fourth trip to the Horde, Alexander fell ill.  In Gorodets, which is located on the Volga, feeling that his days were numbered, the prince accepted monastic tonsure, and on November 14 he was gone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-562636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/562636.jpg?1550071459"></div><p>  We told you about the life of a great man whose contribution to the history of the Russian State is difficult to overestimate.  The deeds of Alexander Nevsky, his life, victories on the battlefield and achievements in the diplomatic field deserve admiration and respect. </p>
