We are talking about the simplest mobile phones that only allow you to make calls and send text messages. </p><p>  It is they, despite the small size and primitiveness, that can cope with a large number of calls per day, so they are perfect for the role of a second, working device.  In addition, they are often taken as the main device by those who do not have time to keep up with modern trends and, in the old fashion, use only voice communication.  One of the best time-tested models is the Nokia 1208, which will be discussed. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Initially, the Nokia 1208 phone was positioned as a solution for poor and developing countries, allowing to bring to the benefits of civilization those who cannot afford a more expensive device.  However, the model was so successful that it appeared on sale almost all over the world, firmly taking its place on the shelves of a large number of stores. </p><p>  Even now, after almost 10 years since the release, it is still relevant and is sold in some stores.  What helped to gain such popularity with a seemingly unpretentious device? </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The key to the popularity of the <span>Nokia 1208</span> phone is the very low price that was achieved due to the maximum reduction in the cost of the device.  At the same time, the quality was maintained at a decent level, and the phone turned out to be reliable, moderately hardy and reliable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Despite the ultra-budget, the device is equipped with a color display with a resolution of 96x68 pixels.  Plus or minus, can only be seen with use.  Some people think that a monochrome display would be a better solution, because the information on it is better visible in strong sunlight, as opposed to color. </p><p>  The phone works only in 2G networks, and this allows you to save battery power.  He does not need more, because the firmware does not support working with any multimedia files.  The signal reception level is confident, the interlocutor is heard well during the conversation. </p><p>  The Nokia 1208 case deserves special attention, which, although made entirely of plastic, has turned out to be quite durable, but lightweight.  <span>The keyboard is rubber,</span> seamless, which prevents dust that may remain on your hands, for example, during operation, from getting inside the device. </p><p>  The phone has 4 MB of <span>dynamic memory,</span> which can be used to store contacts from the phone book, SMS and EMS messages, as well as several tunes in the proprietary "Nokiev" format. </p>

    <h2>  Firmware </h2><p>  The software of the device was developed in order to simplify its use as much as possible.  In it, all items are placed within a few keystrokes, and if necessary, tooltips appear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Based on the proprietary firmware Nokia Series 30, which means that everything in the phone will be a little bit.  There is a simple organizer with a minimum set of necessary functions, such as a calendar and calculator, as well as a couple of simple games.  The language localization was performed efficiently, the firmware was 100% translated into Russian. </p>

    <h2>  Battery and autonomy </h2><p>  I would also like to touch on the topic of device autonomy.  Given the minimum functionality that comes with a 700 mAh battery, the phone lasts for 7 hours of talk time or more than 15 days in standby mode.  If desired, you can increase the autonomy of the Nokia 1208.  The high-capacity battery, which reaches 1020 mAh, copes with this problem without problems, increasing the operating time from one charge by one and a half times. </p>

    <h2>  Security </h2><p>  It would seem that in such a phone there can be no personal information.  But if you want, you can also put protection on him.  For this purpose, it is possible to use a system security code that makes it impossible to unlock the keyboard without entering it.  By setting this code, you can completely block access to SMS messages and the phone book.  <span>The security code ‚ÄúNokia</span> 1208‚Äù cannot be reset without losing all the data. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Based on user reviews, you can highlight some of the strengths and weaknesses in this device.  Among the uniquely positive factors that may lead to a choice in favor of this model, the following can be listed: </p><ul><li>  Rugged case "Nokia 1208", a photo of which were given above, withstanding adverse operating conditions.  Even when using the phone during construction and other similar works, it remains operational, and can easily fall from a small height. </li><li>  Minimum feature set that maximizes battery life.  The phone is perfect for those who are just starting to use cellular communication, since it is almost impossible to get confused in it, and a detailed illustrated user manual is included. </li></ul><p>  However, there were some shortcomings that exist in any electronics.  According to user reviews, they are often not essential, so they may seem inconsequential.  So, the disadvantages of Nokia 1208 are: </p><ul><li>  Low brightness of the display, which prevents comfortable use of the phone in bright artificial or natural light. </li><li>  The manufacturer could immediately equip the phone with a more capacious battery, which would increase autonomy, but at the same time the cost of the device would slightly increase. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the disadvantages include indirect points, which may be insignificant for most ordinary users. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  This phone is well suited for those who want to purchase their first electronic device for communication, due to its simplicity.  Nokia 1208 turned out to be successful also for those who do not want to take risks, for example, at work, with a more expensive telephone, and who need only voice communication.  It is ideal as a second working tube, working a strict number of hours a day. </p><p>  It is not without flaws that should be considered when choosing, but in some cases they can be neglected. </p>
