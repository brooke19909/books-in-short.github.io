This is what we have to find out.  After all, the <span>tariff "Go to zero" ("Megaphone")</span> receives <span>reviews</span> in most cases positive due to this "popular" name.  At the present time, the crisis is hitting all areas of human life, including mobile communications.

    <h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  Where should we start?  We‚Äôll probably try to understand what the tariff is in front of us.  How can it be described in general terms?  In fact, it is not as difficult as it seems. </p><p>  Megafon‚Äôs tariff ‚ÄúGo to zero‚Äù, reviews of which we will study a little later, is one of the most advantageous offers that mobile operators can only provide.  After all, you can easily communicate with other subscribers of your mobile operator.  And 20 minutes a day for free. </p><p>  In addition, all SMS messages, as well as MMS will be at a very favorable price.  And this is just what modern customers need.  Thus, we can say that we are dealing with the most interesting and suitable tariff at the present time.  But what do customers think of it?  Now we have to find out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Conversations in Russia </h2><p>  The first point to consider when choosing any tariff is, of course, the cost of the conversation.  As a rule, in most cases, clients are interested in dialogue within the home region and around the country. </p><p>  "Megaphone" (tariff "Go to zero") receives quite positive reviews in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãtariff plans.  Indeed, when you use it, you will get a great opportunity to talk for 20 minutes a day with other Megafon subscribers for free inside your home region.  This is very pleasing to customers.  After that, you have to pay only 60 cents per minute.  But with other operators, everything is not so simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff go to zero megaphone reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/873014.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you have an additional package of services "All calls" connected, then you will pay 60 cents per minute of conversation.  Otherwise, you will have to pay twice as much - 1.2 rubles.  You will pay the same amount for calls to landline numbers.  Thus, Megafon (tariff "Go to zero") receives quite positive reviews.  Many are pleased with the possibility of free negotiations.  As a rule, 20 minutes a day is enough to communicate on business matters. </p><p>  Plus to everything in Russia, you can also call on favorable terms.  On Megafon, such an action will result in 3 rubles for you, and on other operators (including when talking on the city number) - 12.5 rubles.  Not so high prices as it might seem at first glance.  As many clients note, calls within Russia and your home region are really very beneficial at this rate.  But let's not dwell on this.  What else is important for any tariff plan?  Now we will figure it out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Unlimited communication </h2><p>  The tariff <span>"Go to zero" ("Megaphone"),</span> reviews of which we will learn about each service, which is considered an advantage, also invites us to communicate without any restrictions with the whole world.  In what sense? </p><p>  The thing is that many customers note the fact that with this plan you can call Europe for only 55 rubles per minute.  Calls to Ukraine, the CIS, the <span>Baltic countries,</span> Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia will cost 35 rubles.  In all other places of the globe - 97 rubles per minute.  If you compare this tariff with others, it turns out that most operators offer to pay from 100 to 350 rubles for calls in Europe and other countries.  And it‚Äôs not so profitable, right? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile operators megaphone customer reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/873012.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Thus, the new tariff "Go to zero" can satisfy not only those whose loved ones live in Russia, but also those who prefer to communicate with "abroad".  Nevertheless, this is far from all that sets out this plan.  What else can we talk about?  Let's try to understand this difficult matter. </p><h2>  Correspondence </h2><p>  Of course, Megafon (tariff "Go to zero") receives feedback not only regarding calls and other negotiations.  It is also valued at the cost of messages that customers send.  After all, after the call, ‚ÄúSMS‚Äù is in second place in importance. </p><p>  What is interesting here?  There are several scenarios.  The first is when the SMS XXS service package is connected.  In this case, all SMS will be free.  Otherwise, inside the home region you will pay 1.6 rubles, and outside it - 3 rubles for the "letter". </p><p>  With MMS, things are better and simpler.  After all, such a message, as a rule, will cost you only 7 rubles.  And it is very pleasing to many buyers.  After all, the same Beeline requires 10 rubles per MMS.  As you can see, our current plan is really anti-crisis.  With all this, you will not have a monthly fee.  It will be charged only when connecting any additional services and packages. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Internet access services are provided by all mobile operators.  Megafon customer reviews regarding this item receive mixed reviews.  Let's figure out what's the matter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new tariff go to zero" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/873015.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The cost of 1 megabyte of data in our today's tariff is 9.9 rubles.  And when the option "Internet XS" is connected - for free.  Everything seems to be fine.  Other operators, as a rule, take from clients from 10 to 20 rubles per 1 megabyte of data.  But here, no matter how sad it may sound, customers are not particularly happy.  Mostly due to the quality of the internet connection.  In most cases, if you do not have any connected packages, frequent breaks and other ‚Äúsurprises‚Äù will be observed.  As a rule, those who connect themselves to some additional services are satisfied with the Megafon Internet. </p><h2>  Connect </h2><p>  The tariff "Go to 0" from the "Megaphone" can be connected in several ways.  For example, you can simply come to the nearest cellular office of this operator with a request to change your tariff.  To do this, you need a phone and a passport.  Or even buy a SIM card with this tariff plan. </p><p>  In addition, you can always use the official website of the operator.  Log in to the "Megaphone" page, go to "Tariffs", select the plan you need, and then click on "connect".  And all the problems will be resolved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff go to 0 from a megaphone" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/873016.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Plus, you can use an SMS request.  Just write ‚Äú2‚Äù in the message, and then send it to 00146. And now, wait.  The cost of changing the tariff is 200 rubles.  That's all. </p>
