    <h2>  Rostelecom </h2><p>  Let's start with the largest operator.  This is a company called Rostelecom.  Its branches are located in many cities of Russia.  Many subscribers consider this to be the best connection.  We are talking about all types of <span>networks: telephone (landline),</span> television and mobile communications.  By the way, this operator is in great demand in Internet matters.  Subscribers note that Rostelecom offers humane prices, as well as fairly high-quality network operation.  During some major weather incidents, of course, crashes happen, but not as often as competitors. </p><p>  The network catches even in remote corners of cities.  With all this, no gaps or failures during the conversations were recorded.  This is especially true for landline phones.  We can conclude that you can trust Rostelecom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  MTS </h2><p>  There are subscribers who assure that only MTS operator has the best connection.  However, there were mixed opinions about the company.  The fact is that when it comes to the mobile operator, subscribers begin to pay attention to many points regarding not only the quality of communication.  They leave their mark on the rating of a company. </p><p>  What can be said about MTS?  In general, this operator really provides quality services in Russia, not in all places, but in most.  The best quality communication from the company will be provided at those points in the city where the transmission lines are located.  On the outskirts, the mobile signal is reduced. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which connection is better" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1117804.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The Internet at MTS, unfortunately, cannot boast of its quality.  There are more discontent than joy.  And all due to the fact that in most regions the network signal is low.  Pages open for a long time or, in general, do not load.  In developed cities, you can still admire the Internet from MTS, but among trees or in the village, no. </p><p>  This company is the best telecom operator when evaluating the rates for the proposed tariffs.  Many argue that it is communication from MTS that is beneficial for sociable people.  In general, the network is stable, although it works with some interruptions.  The most frequent failures occur during heat or hurricanes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Megaphone" </h2><p>  Next, you should pay attention to such a large company as MegaFon.  Perhaps few people can say that this company has the best connection.  Rather, it‚Äôs not bad.  In any case, some subscribers speak negatively to the corporation. </p><p>  This opinion has developed for several reasons.  Firstly, prices for Internet and network access services.  Initially, they are small, but soon begin to grow.  With all this, while talking or browsing the Internet, you may notice disconnects.  This, of course, few people will be satisfied. </p><p>  Secondly, if we talk about the World Wide Web, the connection speed in most cases leaves much to be desired. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best call quality" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1117805.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Consumers also assure that even at the slightest weather anomalies, you can remain without communication, especially with regard to remote regions.  Within developed cities, you will simply observe constant network outages.  Many subscribers say that MegaFon is clearly not the best connection in Russia. </p><h2>  Beeline </h2><p>  The next quite worthy competitor of Rostelecom and MTS is Beeline.  This is one of the few companies that is trying to attract subscribers with its quality, but it is not ideal.  What do users think of Beeline? </p><p>  In general, they are satisfied.  Network outages are extremely rare.  The Internet works efficiently, the speed is high even in the worst weather conditions.  <span>The mobile network</span> also practically does not disappear.  If you do not want to use the services of Rostelecom, then we can say that Beeline is the best telecom operator, though with its own shortcomings. </p><p>  For example, with the cost of their services.  Beeline is recognized as the most unprofitable and expensive operator, but its connection is pretty high quality.  However, recently, some subscribers have begun to complain about the frequent failures in the Beeline.  In addition, this operator very often connects paid services and does not notify its customers about this. </p><h2>  "Tele 2" </h2><p>  Who has the best connection?  To be honest, it‚Äôs very difficult to determine, because each subscriber remains with his own opinion.  The company "Tele2" has rather mixed opinions.  This is another major mobile operator, a worthy competitor to MTS and Beeline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best carrier" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1117803.jpg"></div>

    <p>  To himself, he attracts a new audience with prices, for the most part they are anti-crisis.  This makes me happy.  Only here the quality of communication, as users say, is not always excellent.  This is due to the fact that Tele2 in Russia has only recently begun to spread, so the communication system has not been established everywhere.  In large cities, there are no complaints either to the Internet or to the cellular network.  But in remote places there are enough of them. </p><p>  In principle, if you live in a large city where there is Tele2, but do not plan to travel outside it, you can be sure that it is with this operator that you will have the best connection at favorable rates.  But in cases of active use of mobile communications or the Internet outside the developed infrastructure, it is still better to choose someone else as the operator. </p><h2>  Yota </h2><p>  The last company to date is Yota.  This operator appeared in Russia not so long ago.  Positions itself as a company that provides all the most necessary.  The best connection, favorable rates, fast Internet - this is what you can find at Yota. </p><p>  Practice shows a slightly different picture.  Subscribers assure that Yota really offers a huge selection of services, but their quality cannot be considered excellent.  If the mobile network is still acceptable, then with the Internet everything is much worse.  Communication is constantly interrupted, information is processed slowly, and may also refuse to work at all in some regions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best connection" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1117802.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  What do we get in the end?  Which connection is better?  Based on the foregoing, we can summarize: </p><ol><li>  Rostelecom. </li><li>  Beeline. </li><li>  MTS. </li><li>  "Tele 2". </li><li>  "Megaphone". </li><li>  Yota. </li></ol><p>  This is the opinion that many subscribers adhere to.  True, Rostelecom is often used only for home Internet and telephone, and is not considered as a mobile operator. </p>
