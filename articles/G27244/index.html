This device was called X, but what makes it very different from its predecessors?  What is the name of the new iPhone correct and what are its distinguishing features? </p><div class="photo" data-original="i.amz.mshcdn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what‚Äôs the name of the new iPhone 10 or x" class="if uuid-3115323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3115323.jpg"></div><p>  This device is unique in that it presents a number of technologies that are developing in a completely new direction, including with respect to the user interface.  This applies to the iPhone X, XS, XS Max and XR models.  What is the name of the new iPhone - 10 or X?  Since this device is a jubilee and its serial number corresponds to the number 10, it would be correct to call it "tenth." </p><h2>  What is he like? </h2><p>  In many ways, the iPhone X is a highlight of the 10-year history of the smartphone.  This time, Apple developers not only refused the connector, but also excluded one of the most famous and recognizable details - the Home button.  Currently, the iPhone X has been somewhat squeezed out of the market by the XS and XS Max models and a cheaper alternative to the XR, but is it the brand‚Äôs most important smartphone since 2007?  Having dealt with the name of the new iPhone, you should study its main features. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Main difference </h2><p>  The main distinguishing feature of the iPhone X is that the device has a completely new design.  With a glass front and back panel, the iPhone is available in two colors - Space Gray and Silver.  In both versions, it features a polished stainless steel frame around the edge that shimmers and reflects light in exactly the same way as the Apple Watch version of the same material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cdn.cultofmac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new iPhone out" class="if uuid-3115324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3115324.jpg"></div><p>  Due to this, it is noticeably different from aluminum phones.  This is immediately visible if you look at the photo of the new iPhone.  The 5.8-inch display screen looks larger than the iPhone 8 Plus, but the bezel is significantly smaller due to a change in the appearance of the display.  Users who thought the 8 Plus was too big would be very pleased with the design changes because the top and bottom panels are now excluded.  As a result of this, the phone has become much better and will easily fit into most pockets. </p><h2>  The lack of a familiar button </h2><p>  However, some of the changes could frighten some users: Apple abandoned the Home button and Touch ID for the iPhone X and subsequent devices - XS, XS Max and XR.  It turns out that the favorite home button, which has been present on iPhones for the past 10 years, has disappeared.  Now you are returning to the home page, swiping the screen from the bottom up, as well as new ways to access Siri and multitasking.  This is a change that needs to be adapted, and initially it may not seem too convenient. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, new gestures and control buttons are incredibly easy to understand.  Apple Pay has moved double-clicking on the longer button on the side, which also doubles the long hold to activate Siri. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.macworld.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new iPhone model" class="if uuid-3115329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3115329.jpg"></div><p>  Naturally, deleting the Home button means that there is no Touch ID.  The iPhone X and its successors instead use face recognition - a feature that Apple calls Face ID.  This means that it unlocks your iPhone very quickly and helps you turn on the device with gloves or wet hands, which was not possible in Touch ID. </p><h2>  Why are updates so noticeable? </h2><p>  Many people ask questions about the name of the new iPhone, including because the X looks like something completely new.  In this regard, it is believed that previous versions of the iPhone, still available for sale, are crossed out.  With the release of X, there was a feeling that everyone‚Äôs favorite iPhone design would be removed soon, especially with the introduction of a cheaper XR. </p><p>  Naturally, one of the key improvements to X is the display, which dominates the design.  Apple calls it the Super Retina display.  It has a diagonal of 5.8 inches and offers a resolution of 2436x1125 pixels for their density of 458 ppi.  This is an important addition that allows you to increase the display space without increasing the size of the phone.  Apple does not officially disclose screen sizes, in practice, the approximate parameters are about 19: 9. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Screen resolution </h2><p>  The resolution of 458 ppi is ahead of 401 ppi, which was the case on the iPhone 8 Plus.  What does it mean?  More details are placed on the screen, which makes the image clearer and more attractive.  This fact was noted by users immediately after the release of a new iPhone.  This is convenient not only for viewing photos, but also for clearer display of text and graphics, smoothing curves and expanding the capabilities of the iPhone X to demonstrate another important change in its technology: the OLED panel.  This is not the highest resolution on a smartphone, but it is one of the highest quality displays you will find. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gearpatrol.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new iphone xs" class="if uuid-3115326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3115326.jpg"></div><p>  OLED has been used in smartphones for several years, but the only use of this technology before the iPhone X was the Apple Watch.  Its implementation in the iPhone is also similar to a watch, with ink-deep black and clear sharp colors, only on a much larger scale.  The screen is bright, crisp and very impressive, even in bright sunlight.  Compared to other flagship devices, this is one of the best displays that work perfectly in all conditions. </p><p>  The display also features Apple True Tone technology, available in the iPad Pro line, which adapts to the environment.  The idea is that the color balance on the display changes depending on the lighting.  True Tone works very well, however, some users may prefer to turn it off (because the display sometimes switches from cold to warm tones when you use it).  If you have not been familiar with this technology before, you need to get used to it a little. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cdn.vox-cdn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new iphone s" class="if uuid-3115327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3115327.jpg"></div><p>  The display of the Apple iPhone X also supports HDR.  This is the latest functionality used in television technology, and its transition to the iPhone will contribute to the adoption and accessibility of HDR content on a larger scale. </p><p>  The new iPhone model supports HDR10 (common HDR format), as well as Dolby Vision, which is much less common.  HDR and Dolby Vision content is easily accessible and supported by Netflix, however iTunes is also actively using it through Apple TV. </p><h2>  Face recognition </h2><p>  Face ID is a new way to unlock iPhone X, XS, XS Max and XR, and Apple pays great attention to the correct implementation of this option.  All processing is performed on the device, not through the server.  This means that you can unlock the phone regardless of whether you are connected to the network, and at the same time you do not exchange your data with anyone. </p><p>  The setup takes about 30 seconds, and after turning on you will have to actively look at the sensor matrix in the upper part of the device (in the recess) to unlock the device.  However, you will still need a PIN as a backup.  According to user reviews, face recognition is triggered 9.5 times out of 10. This is not ideal, but very good. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cdn-images-1.medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new iPhone 10" class="if uuid-3115328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3115328.jpg"></div><p>  The technology behind this scans and displays your face with 30,000 points, checking the depth, so you cannot fake it with a photograph.  The device should see your eyes, nose and mouth.  The technology is available with a wig, hat, most sunglasses or scarves, but if you cover your mouth with the same scarf, it will not work.  This is different from face recognition or iris scanning, which you can find elsewhere. </p><h2>  Does it always work? </h2><p>  Face ID technology works in all environments: in the sun, in a completely dark room, in a train, in a bar.  Unlike Touch ID, which automatically takes you to the home screen, Face ID still requires you to swipe up to go beyond the lock screen.  You cannot change this, but it means that you get a chance to first view your notifications. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itpro.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new iphone photo" class="if uuid-3115325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3115325.jpg"></div><p>  Most Touch ID apps automatically work with Face ID, including Apple Pay and third-party services, while Safari‚Äôs auto-password feature will also fail if you don‚Äôt look at the screen. </p><h2>  iOS 12 </h2><p>  The new iPhone 10 was launched on iOS 11, which was then upgraded to iOS 12 after the launch of XS, XS Max and XR.  The iPhone X models are characterized by several changes that occur as a result of the lack of a Home button: you swipe up from the bottom of the screen to return to the home page.  In addition, longer scrolling allows you to access open applications, moving up will close the application, and moving along the bottom of the screen will change it. </p><p>  There are also new controls for accessing Siri, Apple Pay and creating important screenshots. </p><p>  There are other iOS features specific to the iPhone X models due to the lack of a Home button.  Interestingly, the new iPhone does not have the iOS landscape mode, which is in the iPhone Plus models, or the ability to increase the image on the screen - this is not very good, according to users. </p><p>  Access to the Control Center can be obtained by swiping down from the top of the screen, with a split, to separate it from Notifications.  Despite the fact that the device is significantly updated, and most of the interface is still familiar enough to understand it. </p><h2>  Options and Services </h2><p>  Many users really like the Do Not Disturb While Driving feature, launched in iOS 11, which automatically sends text messages to people informing you that you are driving and gives you the ability to access all our saved passwords through settings or the app.  This makes setting up the iPhone X a lot easier. </p><p>  As for applications matching this new resolution screen, they quickly adapted to the new design.  Many services from ordinary large manufacturers have switched to full-screen mode, although not all of them are niche. </p><p>  In iOS 12, a few more settings have been added, including support for Waze and Google Maps in CarPlay and Screen Time, which allows you to set restrictions for applications and see how much time you spend using various services. </p><h2>  What can be said about this in general? </h2><p>  Apple announced that this phone will usher in the next decade of other devices, but that‚Äôs not the case.  All three new iPhones use the same design as the iPhone X. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the developers officially explained the name of the new iPhone.  He is considered the 10th model, and the name "ex" or "X" is incorrect.  And in this smartphone, and in its successors builds to note the following.  Polished stainless steel, an OLED display and overall packaging appearance combine with quality and superior aesthetics. </p><h2>  Are there any downsides? </h2><p>  The only drawback is its cost.  When sales of the new iPhone 10 just started, the price of it was 80 thousand rubles and above.  Currently, its cost has slightly decreased, but it still remains a premium device. </p><p>  Today at the same price you can buy a new iPhone S, the technical characteristics of which are improved significantly.  It is faster and more powerful.  At the same time, the iPhone XR model was also released, the cost of which is much lower - approximately 65 thousand rubles.  At the same time, it offers exactly the same technical specifications as the new XS and XS Max iPhones, which makes it faster and more powerful than the X. </p>
