There are no complaints about its quality. </p><h2>  Alternative look </h2><p>  Reviews of Side hotels in Turkey claim that you must pay extra for choosing a room with scenic views.  The hotel has no secure car parking.  Cars have to be left in the municipal parking lot.  In some standard rooms, there were no announced LCD TVs.  There was an outdated video equipment produced in the early 2000s. </p><p>  Residential buildings require repair.  The hotel was commissioned in 2008.  Air conditioners need maintenance and total cleaning.  Not all staff speak English. </p><h2>  Lotus (Lotus Hotel) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dining area of ​​the Lotus Restaurant" class="if uuid-2346041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2346041.jpg"></div><p>  This is one of hundreds of small hotels in Side.  "All inclusive" is not implemented in it.  The complex occupies a niche of inexpensive hotels and offers a minimum range of services.  The cost of living is only 1700 rubles per night.  Meeting with subsequent escort from the airport is paid.  It must be agreed upon in advance.  Estimated fare - 3000 rubles. </p><p>  The nearest beach is nine minutes walk from the Lotus.  In high season, vacationers are delivered to the coast for free.  The bus runs on a schedule several times a day.  All rooms are air-conditioned.  The remote control must be received independently from the reception staff. </p><h2>  Key points </h2><p>  The low cost of living more than compensates for the remoteness of the hotel from the first line in Side.  Among the advantages of the hotel, Russians distinguish the following points: </p><ul><li>  availability of free guarded car parking; </li><li>  good view from the windows; </li><li>  outdoor pool with clean water; </li><li>  spacious family rooms with kitchenettes; </li><li>  wide selection of rooms; </li><li>  proximity to the attractions of the resort. </li></ul><p>  Near the hotel there are restaurants and inexpensive eateries.

The path to the beach takes no more than five minutes.  It offers guests a private recreational area on the Mediterranean coast.  Despite the modest size and lack of a wide range of additional services, the Russians recognize this hotel as the best in Side.  He is chosen by couples, youth companies and families with small children. </p><p>  Each room of the motel has comfortable and soft beds, a refrigerator, air conditioning.

The price of accommodation, which is 2400 rubles per night, includes a rich and tasty breakfast.  Guests are offered fruit and vegetable slices, sausages, sausages, milk porridges, cheese sandwiches and pastries. </p><h2>  Remarks </h2><p>  According to the Russians, not all air conditioners work properly in all rooms.  Climate systems can not cope with the load.  Therefore, it is very hot during the day.  Parents complain about the abundance of stones on the beach.  The coastal zone is not completely covered with sand.  Lack of own parking is a minus.  Clients have to travel to the hotel on their own from the municipal parking lot, which is a ten minute walk. </p><p>  Food lovers give low ratings to breakfast dishes.  For ten days of rest, tourists want variety.  Fried eggs and sausages quickly get bored.  In winter, the administration saves on heating rooms.  It’s cool at night.  Travelers complain about the low data rate when connected to the network. </p><h2>  Miramare Queen Hotel </h2><p>  For accommodation at this hotel they ask for 8,000 rubles for a room designed for two people.
