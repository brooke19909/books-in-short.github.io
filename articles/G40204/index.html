His biography is replete with many riddles and questions, although he ruled the country for a relatively short period of time.  Who is he - a tyrant and fratricide or an innocently slandered victim of the machinations of his younger brother? </p><h2>  early years </h2><p>  The translation of the name Yaropolk from the Old Slavic language is interpreted by linguists as "shining among the people."  The exact date of birth and the name of his mother are unknown to the story.  A number of scientists consider Yaropolk's date of birth 945.  But their opponents argue that this version is completely untenable, since at that time, according to the generally accepted opinion, his father was only three years old.  Some experts suggest that he was the son of the Ugric princess Predslava, like his brother Oleg. </p><p>  The father of Yaropolk was the Grand Duke of Kiev Svyatoslav Igorevich, famous for his numerous victories over enemies.  In particular, this great commander defeated the powerful <span>Khazar Kaganate</span> and the <span>Bulgarian kingdom</span> on the Danube. </p><p>  For the first time in annalistic sources, the name Yaropolk appears in 968.  It was in the absence of Prince Svyatoslav that the Pechenegs raided Kiev, during which the young prince locked himself in the palace with his grandmother Olga and brothers. </p>

    <p>  In 970, his father left him, as the eldest son, to rule Kiev, and he himself went on another campaign for the Danube.  This time he happened to enter the battle with the Romance emperor John Tzimiskes.  The Grand Duke of Kiev Svyatoslav was forced to retreat.  But on the way home, he was killed by the Pecheneg Khan Kurei, bribed by the Byzantines.  Three of his sons began to rule the Russian land: Vladimir, Oleg, Yaropolk, the last of which became the Grand Duke. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The reign of Yaropolk </h2><p>  Yaropolk Svyatoslavich became the Grand <span>Duke of Kiev</span> in 972, after the death of his father.  His brothers - Oleg and Vladimir began to reign, respectively, in the Drevlyansk and Novgorod lands.  But the first time they recognized Yaropolk as elders. </p>

    <p>  Contemporaries considered Yaropolk to be a brave warrior rather than a wise ruler.  However, despite this, he still tried to pursue an active both domestic and foreign policy. </p><h2>  Foreign policy directions </h2><p>  Yaropolk's foreign policy was largely oriented towards the countries of Western Europe.  Evidence of this is the embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãsent in Germany in 973 to the court of the Holy Roman Emperor Otto II the Red.  According to one version, Yaropolk was engaged to his relative Kunigunda.  With a fair degree of probability, it can be argued that rapprochement with Germany was aimed at creating an alliance against the Czech Republic and Poland. </p><p>  But with the Byzantine Empire, the young prince behaved much more carefully, remembering the treachery of the Romans in relation to his father. </p>

    <h2>  Yaropolk and Christianity </h2><p>  The question of the role of Christianity in the life of Prince Yaropolk remains a lot of discussion.  Many historians believe that he secretly received baptism or even openly professed the Christian faith.  But one thing is clear: Yaropolk Svyatoslavich was rather loyal to the Christians, did not persecute them, unlike other rulers of pagan countries, allowed to worship, which caused the criticism of the population professing the faith of their ancestors.  There is an opinion that the embassy to Emperor Otton II set the future baptism of Russia as one of its goals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Of course, a significant role in the attitude of Yaropolk to Christianity was played by his upbringing by grandmother Olga, who adopted the Romance faith in Constantinople. </p><p>  However, during the reburial of Yaropolk and his brother <span>Oleg, Prince</span> Yaroslav the Wise ordered a baptismal ceremony to be performed over their remains.  This fact indicates either a stay in the paganism of Yaropolk until his death, or that <span>Yaroslav Vladimirovich</span> did not know anything about the baptism of his uncle. </p><h2>  Surroundings of Yaropolk </h2><p>  The most prominent figure surrounded by Yaropolk was, of course, Voivode Sveneld.  Most historians converge on its Scandinavian origin.  He began to play a prominent role under Yaropolk‚Äôs grandfather, Prince <span>Igor Rurikovich.</span>  Under Svyatoslav, Sveneld became one of the most powerful people in Russia, had his own squad, collected tribute, went with the prince on campaigns over the Danube.  There is an opinion that under Yaropolk it was he who actually supervised the affairs of the state.  Sveneld had two sons - Luta and Mstishu. </p><p>  Fornication is one of the most important governor under Prince Yaropolk.  He probably moved to the first role after the death of Sveneld.  Later this man betrayed Yaropolk. </p><p>  Varyazhko is a retinue of Yaropolk, with whom, one might say, he was sealed by bonds of friendship.  He was extremely loyal to the prince. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  A family </h2><p>  As mentioned above, according to one version, it is believed that Yaropolk Svyatoslavich was engaged to the daughter of Count Kuno von Enengen Kunigunda, but for some reason the wedding did not take place.  He also married to the daughter of the Polotsk prince Rogvolod - Rogneda, but after the capture of Polotsk and the murder of her father by Vladimir, he himself forcibly took the princess as his wife. </p><p>  But Prince Yaropolk Svyatoslavich was still married to some Greek woman whose history is silent.  Most likely, she was captured as a trophy by his father during the Danube campaigns.  The chronicle tells that at the time of her husband's death she was expecting a baby and was taken as a concubine by his brother Vladimir.  In this case, it turns out that her son, the future prince of Kiev Svyatopolk the Cursed, was a child of Yaropolk.  Despite this, he was adopted by Vladimir.  However, according to another version, he is considered his native offspring. </p><h2>  The killing of Oleg </h2><p>  Meanwhile, a feud broke out between Yaropolk and his brother Oleg, who ruled in Ovruch.  The conflict began with the assassination by the Drevlyansky prince of the son of the governor Sveneld - Lut.  The reason was that he hunted without demand in Oleg‚Äôs lands, which by medieval standards was considered a rather serious offense. </p><p>  Sveneld, naturally, held a grudge and constantly demanded that Yaropolk go to war on his brother in order to call him to account.  Finally, the Kiev prince lost.  In 977, a campaign was organized, during which Oleg‚Äôs squad was defeated, and he himself died in the confusion of battle. </p><p>  Yaropolk Svyatoslavich grieved a lot about this.  But here the question arises of his role in this event.  According to one version, he was just a puppet in the hands of his all-powerful governor, and according to another, he himself planned the seizure of Drevlyansky lands.  The truth of the second version is indicated by the mention of Yaropolk himself during a cry for Oleg that he sent Lut to hunt in his brother's lands.  The purpose of such an act could be one - to provoke the beginning of a fratricidal war.  However, the sum of all other facts allows us to say that, most likely, Yaropolk was a toy in the hands of his entourage. </p><h2>  Speech by Vladimir against Yaropolk </h2><p>  Upon learning of the death of Oleg in the war with Yaropolk, Prince Vladimir of Novgorod decided that the next blow would inflict on his possessions.  Therefore, it was decided to flee to Scandinavia.  There Vladimir Svyatoslavovich scored a strong Varangian squad and moved it to his brother. </p>

    <p>  Meanwhile, Yaropolk managed to establish his power over Novgorod.  But Vladimir easily returned the city to himself.  On the way to Kiev, as mentioned above, he defeated Yaropolk‚Äôs ally, Prince of Polotsk, Rogvolod, burned his capital city, and took his daughter Rogneda, who had previously been married to his elder brother, as his wife.  From this marriage, the future Grand Duke of Kiev, Yaroslav the Wise, was subsequently born. </p><p>  Then Vladimir and the army approached Kiev.  Voivode Fornication, who took the place of Sveneld, most likely dead by then, treacherously conspired with the Novgorod prince and persuaded Yaropolk to leave the capital city.  He took refuge in a well-protected small town Rodne, on the river Ros. </p><h2>  Death of Yaropolk </h2><p>  Vladimir besieged Yaropolk.  The city began a severe famine.  Through the mediation of the Blud, the prince of Novgorod convinced his brother to negotiate with him.  Although the warrior Varyazhko sharply opposed this, suspecting something was amiss.  When Yaropolk came to the place of negotiations, he was treacherously killed by two Scandinavians from the Novgorod army.  It happened in 978. </p>

    <p>  There is still debate about the role of Vladimir in the murder of his brother.  Many historians are trying to idealize the image of the future baptist of Russia and blame the Varangians for all the blame.  But, most likely, the order for the murder was issued precisely by Vladimir.  In any case, his biography is replete with many other facts that allow us to say that the baptist of Russia could well do this. </p><h2>  The role of Yaropolk in history </h2><p>  There is still a heated debate between historians about who Yaropolk was: the main provocateur of internecine conflicts or the victim of a policy of a powerful governor and predatory brothers?  He ruled much less than other Kiev princes.  A table of the chronology of government assigns him reign only six years.  While Oleg managed his possessions for 30 years, Igor - 33 years, Svyatoslav - 27 years, and Vladimir - as many as 37 years. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 701px; height: 186px;"><tbody><tr><td align="center">  <em>Prince's name</em> </td><td align="center">  <em>Years of rule</em> </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  Oleg </td><td align="center">  882-912 </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  Igor </td><td align="center">  912-945 </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  Svyatoslav </td><td align="center">  945-972 </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  Yaropolk </td><td align="center">  972-978 </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  Vladimir </td><td align="center">  978-1015 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  It also remains unclear if <span>Christianity</span> would be adopted <span>in Russia</span> if Prince Yaropolk Svyatoslavovich had won over his brother?  And how would the fate of the Russian state develop in this case?  But history does not know the subjunctive mood.  One thing is clear: the personality and role of the Grand Duke of Kiev Yaropolk Svyatoslavich is still waiting for his proper assessment in the future. </p>
