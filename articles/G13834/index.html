    <p>  “Auto payment” is an automatic payment of bills or an automatic replenishment of a balance (for example, telephone).  A very convenient feature - with it you can forget forever about some payments that are made regularly.  The most popular operations are <span>utility bills.</span>  You can connect "Auto Payment", which on a certain day will deduct funds from your account for using certain features related to housing and communal services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dilemma </h2><p>  True, not everyone is satisfied with this feature.  Therefore, citizens often think about the proposal that Sberbank provides.  “Auto payment for utilities” is good when it comes to paying fixed payments.  Then you can easily control the flow of funds on the card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank auto payment for utilities personal account" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1365101.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <p>  But most payments are constantly changing in size.  For example, for light or water.  Typically, such services are paid according to the readings of the counters, which is not very convenient when automatically debiting funds for certain services provided for servicing an apartment. </p><p>  So, the question arises before the population: “Is this auto payment so necessary?”  Everyone must answer for himself.  Often, this service is activated only in cases where it is necessary to repay accounts with fixed payments.  For example, for gas, telephone or Internet. </p><h2>  Commission </h2><p>  It is no secret to anyone that you will not be charged a commission if you pay bills through Sberbank.  “Auto payment for utilities” will require a small monetary compensation.  This point is often noted by customers as a lack of supply.  Many people think that it is better to save money, but to pay without automatically debiting funds from the card.  Especially when it comes to large amounts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How much will you have to pay in order to use the service that Sberbank (“Auto Payment”) offers its customers?  Utilities (the commission in this case is only 1% of the amount of each operation) can be paid with a small “margin” that even average citizens can afford.  Please note: the maximum commission fees cannot exceed 1,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Different payment options </h2><p>  What does Sberbank offer its customers?  “Auto payment for utilities” currently provides several options for debiting money from your account.  You yourself can choose one of the proposed schemes during the connection of the service.  If you want, as customers say, you can change this system of debiting money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable auto payment for utilities Sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1365103.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What options are there?  Firstly, at a certain moment you can deduct from your balance sheet exactly the amount that you owe.  This system is convenient in most cases.  Secondly, customers have the opportunity to write off a specific amount of money on the day you set. </p><h2>  Informing and checking </h2><p>  Many are trying to find out all the pros and cons of our today's offer.  How does Sberbank surprise and delight its customers?  “Auto payment for utilities” has a huge number of advantages.  And it doesn’t matter which system of debit funds you have chosen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Among the benefits are often noted informing customers about the upcoming payment.  Also, after the operation, you will definitely receive an SMS message with information about the transaction.  Very convenient: you will not forget when your receipts are paid. </p><p>  If there is not enough money on the card or account, the system will begin to check the balance until you have enough funds to make the payment.  Once every 3 days there is a repeated attempt to pay the receipt.  These are the features of “Auto payment of utilities”.  Sberbank customer reviews for informing and constantly checking the status of the account earns mostly positive.  It’s enough to set up payment for utilities in the way that suits you!  And you can only print out receipts about making payments! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank auto payment for utilities meter readings" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1365102.jpg"></div>

    <p>  By the way, the function we are considering is limited by the time at which all bills must be paid.  It is 9 a.m. Moscow time.  If auto payment falls on a weekend or holiday, then the funds are debited at the appointed time.  But the direct receipt of money by the service provider is delayed - the waiting time is about 3 days.  Everything is exactly the same as using a conventional bank transfer. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  There are also disadvantages to the service.  What did Sberbank not take into account?  “Auto payment for utilities” is a good opportunity.  But she does not suit everyone.  This is due to shortcomings that were noticed by customers. </p><p>  The first minus is the commission.  Although not very large, many are not satisfied with even the slightest overpayment for utilities.  Customers prefer to pay <span>utility bills on</span> their own, but without a commission. </p><p>  The second drawback is that Sberbank's Car Utility Payments does not take meter readings into account.  It will not work through this opportunity to transmit this kind of information.  This makes payments not very convenient, which depend on the readings of the counters.  You can set a write-off of money in a fixed payment for certain services of housing and communal services, which significantly exceeds the average payment, but then you will constantly pay in advance.  Some customers do not like this system too much. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank auto payment utilities commission" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1365099.jpg"></div>
