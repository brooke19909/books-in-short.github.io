Not in every European capital can you find an Egyptian obelisk adjacent to magnificent fountains and sculptural compositions.  It offers an excellent view of the many attractions of the city.  For those who intend to visit all the most beautiful <span>squares in Paris, Place</span> de la Concorde should be one of the first on this list.  She is also the second largest in France. </p><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  The name of the Place de la Concorde in Paris has not always been so.  Initially, it was conceived as royal and was named in honor of the then king - Louis XV.  In the center was a monument depicting a monarch riding a horse.  It was presented to Louis by the first persons of the city, who greatly appreciated the king for his contribution to the prosperity of the country. </p><p>  The architect who created the square was Jacques-Anne Gabriel.  The option proposed by him was truly unique for that time.  Firstly, the shape of the structure was octagonal, and secondly, at that time all the squares of the city were squeezed by the surrounding houses, as if in a vice, representing a kind of well.  The free space around the central square and the exit to the Seine made her stand out among her brothers.  It was opened in 1763. </p>

    <h2>  Where did the new name come from </h2><p>  Not even 30 years had passed before the revolution swept the country.  A guillotine was erected at the site of the monument.  <span>Louis XVI,</span> then in power, was executed on a square built in honor of his father.  Many of the country's top officials said goodbye to life there.  The Royal Square became known as the <span>Revolution Square.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Only after 6 years, in 1795, it was decided to remove the guillotine.  At the suggestion of the artist David, in her place were installed sculptures of Marley, which once adorned the royal palace of the same name in the suburbs of Paris.  They depict brave horse tamers.  In the same year, in a sign of reconciliation of all classes, the revolutionary name of the main attraction of the city was changed to Concorde Square.  Paris began to recover. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="name of the consent square in paris" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33984/793820.jpg" width="371"></div>

    <h2>  The obelisk and its surroundings </h2><p>  During the reign of Louis Philippe, the French capital received as a gift from the Egyptian king <span>Muhammad Ali the</span> Luxor obelisk, which now adorns the Place de la Concorde.  The monument is made of marble and covered with ancient hieroglyphs.  Its height is 23 meters and its weight is more than 230 tons.  Despite the unusual appearance for Europe, the obelisk fit perfectly into the image of the city and made the Place de la Concorde in Paris even more remarkable.  By the way, his twin brother still adorns the entrance to the Egyptian temple in Luxor. </p><p>  Around the same years, the Fountain of the Rivers and the Fountain of the Seas were installed.  Each of them has a height of 9 meters.  Decorated with mythical sculptural compositions, they now stand on the sides of the Egyptian obelisk.  In any photo, they can be easily recognized by the dark green color unusual for the fountains and the gold trim.  The author is architect Hittorf.  He also designed lanterns, which in their style resemble fountains located in the square. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="concert area paris" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33984/793833.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  City statues </h2><p>  In 1836, the Place de la Concorde in Paris was again augmented.  This time around it were installed 8 statues, made in the antique style.  Women sitting on pedestals symbolize the largest cities in France.  In the northwestern part there are statues of Rouen and Brest, in the southwest - Nantes and Bordeaux, in the southeast - Lyons and Marseille, and in the northeast - sculptures depicting Lille and Strasbourg.  Currently, all of them adorn the entrances to the underground parking and have no special artistic value, despite the fact that they are made by eminent sculptors.  Nevertheless, many tourists seek to take pictures near them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most beautiful squares of Paris" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33984/793822.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Surrounding Attractions </h2><p>  Place de la Concorde is located in the very center of Paris.  From all sides it is surrounded by various attractions.  Here begins the central street of the capital of France - Champs Elysees.  At the entrance to it are copies of the same horse tamers that David proposed in 1795 to replace the demolished guillotine.  The originals are in the Louvre.  Standing on the Place de la Concorde, at the very end of this straight line like a string, you can see the Arc de Triomphe - one of the main symbols of the city. </p><p>  On the opposite side, in the east, is the <span>Tuileries Garden.</span>  You can visit the Museum of the Orangerie and the National Gallery of Ge de Pom.  After passing through the garden, you will find yourself directly in front of the Louvre. </p><p>  On the north side, Place de la Concorde in Paris is framed by only two buildings that are similar in appearance and resemble palaces.  This is the famous Hotel Crillon, one of the most expensive in Paris, and the Ministry of the Navy of France. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Concert Square in Paris France" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33984/793819.jpg" width="334"></div>

    <h2>  Concorde Square today </h2><p>  Since the reign of Louis Philippe, little has changed here.  The obelisk was decorated with a gilded pyramid.  The rest of the sights were repeatedly restored, but their appearance remained the same.  Despite the revolutions, wars and global changes in the life of the country, for many years, the Place de la Concorde in Paris has remained practically unchanged.  France, as it was at the beginning of the 19th century, has retained its true appearance here. </p><p>  Concorde Metro Station is located right on the square.  There are also many bus routes: 24, 42, 52, 72, 73, 84, 94. </p><p>  Concord Square is not in vain considered central in the country.  The main <span>street of Paris</span> originates here <span>,</span> and the most famous architectural monuments are located nearby.  Therefore, it does not take the last place in the list of the main <span>attractions of Europe</span> . </p>
