The secret to the success of this European country is simple.  Here you can get a magnificent beach holiday on the Mediterranean coast, an ultra-rich ‚Äúexcursion‚Äù, a stay at developed ski resorts and profitable shopping. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lecce Italy" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1757695.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Italy for travelers </h2><p>  People often come here to see the Pantheon and the Colosseum, the Valley of the Temples and the Trevi Fountain.  Tours to Italy from Moscow and other Russian cities are incredibly popular among those who love a good beach holiday.  In addition, aesthetes and gourmets, as well as connoisseurs of works of art, are striving to get into this country. </p><p>  The cost of the trip depends on several factors: on the season, on the route, on the chosen hotel, etc. On average, tours to Italy from Moscow cost on average one person about nine hundred euros in the high season for two weeks.  This amount includes accommodation (at the rate of twenty-five cu per night) meals, medical insurance, round-trip flights, visa and consular fees.  A trip will cost less if not in such large cities as Rome, Naples or Milan, but in those that many domestic tourists do not know about exist, but which are no less attractive for relaxing and visiting local attractions.  One such city is Lecce.  Italy is such an amazing country that it‚Äôs quite difficult to say right away what attracts more to it.  But, in the opinion of experienced travelers, in order to feel her spirit, one should visit both small cities and remote regions.  It is here that still unknown Italy will open up for tourists: Apulia, Veneto, Umbria, Tuscany, etc. There are twenty regions in the country, each of which is interesting in its own way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy Puglia" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1757692.jpg" width="600"></div>

If you look at the map, you can see what is the heel of the ‚Äúboot‚Äù Apulia.  Until recently, it attracted Russian tourists with its large cities, where there are many famous sights, developed infrastructure, etc. However, the situation has changed over the past few years.  Today, in the list of tourist routes in a country such as <span>Italy, Puglia</span> is already far from the last place.  It is famous for its lovely Baroque-style towns, traditionally local trulli (as the locals call small houses), reminiscent of a hobbit‚Äôs hut or a resident of Oz, an abundance of sunshine, magnificent olive groves and orchards, miles of sandy beaches and delicious cuisine.  On the left, Apulia is washed by the Ionian, and on the right by the Adriatic.  Although they are considered part of the Mediterranean, the rest in the region is somewhat different.  In the hottest season, when many resorts are ringing hell, in Puglia there is even a light breeze.  One of the resorts in the region is Lecce, Italy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lecce attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1757694.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  This small but very picturesque town is the capital of the province of the same name.  As soon as the locals do not call Lecce: both Apulian Athens, since ethnic Greeks live here, and South Florence due to the abundance of architectural monuments created in the Baroque style, and the Golden Town, after all, limestone rock is mined here, which over time acquires a golden hue .  Many buildings were built from this stone in Lecce.  Judging by the reviews of those who have already visited this resort, they are cast in gold in the sunshine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The patron saint of the city is considered  Oronia.  Many churches and temples in Lecce (Italy) are dedicated to him - the first bishop of the province and according to legend - a disciple of the apostle Paul himself.  This holy martyr repeatedly suffered for faith and was subsequently awarded for it.  The city has a real Italian lifestyle.  On weekdays, silence and peace reign here, but on weekends it is incredibly lively: the streets are flooded with people, interesting processions and performances take place on them. </p><h2>  Baroque city </h2><p>  There are many settlements in the world that delight with their purely resort components such as the sea, the sun, wonderful nature, etc. And there are purely ‚Äúsightseeing‚Äù cities where tourists discover new places every day .  Located in the Apulia region, the small village of Lecce (Italy) combines both of these forms.  It is difficult to say what attracts him in the first place: the grandiose architecture in the Baroque style or the cozy coast.  Lecce covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout two and a half hundred square kilometers.  About a hundred thousand people live in it.  Here, modern high-rise buildings incredibly organically coexist with ancient ruins. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to Lecce Italy" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1757693.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Beach holidays and weather </h2><p>  Like any resort, Lecce has a high season, from the first decade of June to the end of October.  The sea warms up best in August.  It was at this time that different-sized vessels were going to the coast of the Lecce region - from light yachts to solid liners.  In high season, beach vacations can be combined with sightseeing tours.  For its beauty, incredibly azure color, crystal clear water and the whiteness of local beaches, the Lecce region is rightly called the Italian Maldives.  It is difficult to disagree with this, although many bathing areas are at some distance from the city itself. </p><h2>  How to get to Lecce (Italy) </h2><p>  To get to this resort, tourists will have to take a short trip.  Lecce does not have its own airport.  The easiest option would be to get to Salento or Bari.  In high season, direct charter flights from Moscow fly here.  This is a very convenient way for non-stop being on the heel of Italy.  Those who have an international driving license can immediately rent a car at the airport in the same Bari and drive to Lecce in two hours.  You can go to the resort and by train. <br>  Another way is to get Brindisi with a transfer in the capital of Italy.  From here, shuttles run to Lecce directly from the airport.  The first departure at nine in the morning, the last at twenty minutes to twelve.  Travel time is a maximum of forty-five minutes.  Ticket price - eight and a half euros. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  This city has many options for living.  Those who prefer truly royal comfort can stay at the Patria Palace Hotel, located within the walls of the Palazzo D'Anna-Petrarolo, dating from the eighteenth century.  It is located in the heart of Lecce, a stone's throw from the famous Santa Croce Basilica.  This Art Deco-style room features John Duggan frescoed ceilings and walls.  The opportunity to live in a former synagogue will be given to tourists who have chosen Palazzo Persone.  This hotel has just six apartments.  In general, the resort has many options for inexpensive, but no less comfortable stay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather Lecce Italy" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1757691.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the old town district, almost all of the B&amp;B hotels in Lecce (Italy) are in close proximity to local attractions.  Many of their rooms have a fairly large area and well-equipped kitchens.  This makes staying at the resort convenient even for those traveling with young children. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The city of creativity, aesthetes and hedonists, many call Lecce.  The attractions of this small village are numerous, but at the same time they are quite compact.  In order to see them, tourists do not need to carefully think through routes.  Only a few hours are enough to go around the entire Old City, if, of course, the weather allows.  Lecce, Italy attracts travelers with its history, legends about the temples and houses of the aristocracy, which can be seen literally at every step.  Its main attraction is the Basilica Di Santa Croce - a real triumph of baroque.  The facade of this temple perfectly fulfills the function originally laid in it - it frightens and pacifies.  A pile of scrolls and birds, half-naked female figures and angels will not hurt to notice the sculptural images of Turkish warriors instead of Atlanteans, traditional for Baroque.  This is how architects glorified the victory of the Holy League over the Ottoman army.  The center of the city is Piazza del Duomo.  On this square are the bishop's palace, as well as a library and a seminary.  All of them belong to the work of Giuseppe Chino.  In the seminary today is a museum where the gifts of parishioners are exhibited. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Leche italy reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1757690.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The excursion route is best to start directly from the train station.  the boulevard from which leads directly to the cathedral, located on the same square of the Duomo.  It is considered one of the most outstanding cathedrals in all of Italy.  Built in the twelfth century and completely reconstructed in the middle of the seventeenth century, the temple thanks to its seventy-meter bell tower is visible from afar. </p><p>  Not far from the square is the church of St.  Irina.  In the adjacent monastery, interesting events are held annually.  The most beautiful and original of them is the Christmas exhibition ... of nativity scenes.  Tourists should definitely see another Lecce square, named after St.  Oronia.  Here is the Roman amphitheater of the era of Emperor Augustus.  Another attraction is the castle, erected on the orders of Charles V. It was supposed to protect the city from Turkish raids by the Turks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in Lecce Italy" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1757697.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  City of masters </h2><p>  It may give the wrong impression that Lecce is just a unique architecture.  But this is not so.  An equally important chapter in the history of the city is the tradition of local craftsmen who create papier-m√¢ch√© sculptures of any shape.  For the first time such workshops appeared in here in the seventeenth century, and since then this craft has been associated precisely with the ‚Äúgolden‚Äù Lecce. <br>  They are found throughout the city.  Most local craftsmen work on the sculptures of saints ordered from them, crucifixes and Christmas nativity scenes designed for churches and churches around the world.  And with luck, tourists may be present at the ‚Äúbirth‚Äù of a new saint created in Lecce, Italy. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The vast majority of our compatriots are delighted with their trip to this city.  Attractions here - at every turn.  Those who come to Lecce for one day, have time to inspect them.  I must say that there is dissatisfaction with the fact that the beaches are far from the city itself.  The closest of them is located twelve kilometers from the center.  Nevertheless, if you rent a car for the rest, it is quite possible not only to travel around the entire region, but also the beaches.  As for hotels, judging by the reviews, there are practically no dissatisfied with their infrastructure and prices. </p>
