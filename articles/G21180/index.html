    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about the (hotel Seabel Aladin <span>Djerba 3 *, Tunisia / Djerba)</span> complex are not without a negative connotation.  It is worth paying attention to the following disadvantages of this hotel: </p><ul><li>  tasteless cocktails in bars; </li><li>  the restaurant‚Äôs menu contains very few fruits, which is not typical for a country like Tunisia; </li><li>  the registration procedure is very long, and you have to wait a long time to check in; </li><li>  the rainwater drainage system is not thought out in the bungalow, and therefore, after a rainfall at the threshold large puddles form, which often flow into the room; </li><li>  tasteless first courses in the restaurant; </li><li>  in the swimming area at the bottom there are many large stones (it would not hurt to clear this place with the help of divers); </li><li>  trying to please the European tourist in food, the chefs overdid it, making the dishes not only not sharp, but even fresh; </li><li>  poor-quality and tasteless tea in the restaurant is more reminiscent of hot drinks from a pioneer camp (good packaged tea is served only during breakfast); </li><li>  tasteless vegetable side dishes (products are too soft and absolutely tasteless); </li><li>  coffee is served only for breakfast, and all other meals have to go to the bar for a drink; </li><li>  old washed towels; </li><li>  personnel are sorely lacking, and the available number of employees does not physically manage to cope with all duties; </li><li>  there are a lot of annoying flies on the territory and in the rooms, with which the hotel staff does not fight; </li><li>  poorly washed dishes in the restaurant (there is no dishwasher in the restaurant, and the employees do not have time to do it qualitatively by hand). </li></ul><p>  This hotel is a universal resort complex, which is suitable for both a quiet family and active youth recreation.  Here, in addition to beautiful nature and the clean sea, you can enjoy delicious food, quality service and comfortable living conditions. </p>
