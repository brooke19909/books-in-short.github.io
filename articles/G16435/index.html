    <h2>  Prince Golitsyn </h2><p>  What associations does the name "New World" evoke in you?  Someone associates it with America and Columbus who discovered it.  However, for Crimeans and residents of this region, the New World is also a picturesque resort village located near Sudak.  He is associated with the personality of Lev Golitsyn, the Russian prince.  Another association is great champagne. </p>

    <p>  The key figure in arranging the New World is Lev Sergeyevich Golitsyn, also known as the founder of the Russian wine-making tradition in Crimea and the founder of the industrial production of high-quality champagne in Russia.  <span>To Prince Golitsyn, the</span> New World owes much.  For example, the main part of its attractions.  A rightful place among them is rightfully occupied by the Golitsyn trail - a complex that has been preserved since the time of this prince. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Famous people who walked along the Golitsyn trail </h2><p>  This complex was conceived and built in the late 19th century by the owner of the estate.  The Golitsyn trail (New World) is famous for the fact that many esteemed and high-ranking guests of Golitsyn once passed along it: the counts and princes Gagarins, Trubetskoys, Mordvinovs, Gorchakovs, theologians and priests, the artist I. Bilibin.  And in 1912, part of it, located near Cape Kapchik, was passed by Nicholas II himself, the last Russian emperor. </p><h2>  Construction of the Golitsyn trail </h2><p>  Golitsyn trail - a route on which you will find stairs, viewing platforms, as well as created through nature through and Golitsyn grottos.  For safety in steep sections stone parapets are arranged.  Observation platforms are located in such places, where it is most convenient to admire the mountain and sea landscapes. </p>

    <p>  The Golitsyn trail in the Crimea in some sections has been cut down at an altitude of up to 20 m above sea level in rocky ground.  It was built by Turkish workers.  In the most dangerous areas, they cut this path, being in "cradles" suspended on ropes.  There was a case when a storm raged at sea, and the workers above were hanging in "cradles" in a strong wind.  It was not possible to put them on boats.  So they spent 2 days over the raging sea.  They lowered food and water on the ropes from the mountain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Golitsyn Grotto </h2><p>  You are probably wondering how long the Golitsyn trail has.  Its length is 5470 meters.  Part of this trail stretches along the coast for 2 km.  The Golitsyn trail begins on the outskirts of the New World, near the Green Bay.  Then it passes at the foot of Koba-Kaya (its modern name is Oryol) and leads travelers to the Golitsyn Grotto.  Here in the Middle Ages a cave Christian monastery was located.  The remains of the frescoes, preserved until the 19th century, testify to this.  <span>Golitsyn Lev Sergeyevich</span> at the end of the 19th century equipped his winery here.  A part of the grotto was fenced off with a wall.  A massive door blocked the entrance to this room.  The height of this grotto is from five meters (inside) to eight (outside), and the width and length are about seven meters.  The mountain got its name Koba-Kaya (pictured below) precisely because of the grotto, as it translates as “cave rock”. </p>

    <p>  The entrance here under Prince Lev Golitsyn was blocked by a stone wall, today almost completely destroyed.  Only a small fragment of it has been preserved.  Inside is a well where you can drink spring water.  A metal hook for the lamp is driven into the ceiling above the well.  Once upon a time a huge chandelier hung on it, illuminating the grotto.  However, the visitors are especially impressed by the 2 walls of the winery, each of which has 45 niches.  They used to store bottled wine.  In 5 tiers, these niches with an arched arch are located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Near the winery you can find a scene with a polycircular niche and a platform.  Magnificent acoustics has <span>this grotto.</span>  The second name is well known to tourists - the Chaliapin Grotto.  According to a popular legend, Fedor Ivanovich Chaliapin, a great Russian singer, once sang from this scene, blocking the sound of sea waves with his powerful voice.  However, according to historical information, Chaliapin never visited the New World.  Nevertheless, this legend lives and remains in an unofficial name.  Today, Golitsyn Meetings are held here - special musical events with fireworks and, of course, champagne. </p><p>  In the sea, under the arches of this grotto, you can see a huge block that once fell from the "ceiling".  This is the turtle stone.  A through underwater tunnel is located beneath it. </p><h2>  <strong>Cape Flat and Blue Bay</strong> </h2>

    <p>  Further, having left the Golitsyn Grotto, the road rises smoothly to Cape Flat, after which it descends again to the Blue Bay Golitsyn Trail.  A tour on it on a hot summer day is accompanied by swimming in this bay.  The sea is shallow, but the water is usually clear and clean.  You can use the services of a "sea taxi" in the summer, when you get tired of walking around such a picturesque corner of nature as the Golitsyn trail.  Sudak or the New World - places where you can return from here on a boat.  The blue bay (pictured below) was called the Robber because pirates hid their trophies in these caves.  They were allowed to go unnoticed by a pile of stones.  The Golitsyn trail, following the coast of this bay, goes around the city of Koba-Kaya.  Many stairs with handrails and bridges are located on this site, which are easy to walk along. </p>

You can see in the cliffs the fossilized remains of corals, which are about 150 million years old, as well as algae and sea urchins - inhabitants of the Jurassic Ocean. </p><h2>  Cape Kapchik and Royal Beach </h2><p>  After that, you can make the last ascent to Cape Kapchik along the rocky stairs.  It is located between the Blue and Blue bays.  The famous Royal Beach is located on the shore of the Blue Bay.  It got its name in 1912, after Nicholas II was here. </p>

    <p>  In fine weather, Ayudag Mountain can be seen from here, as well as the mountains of the Southern Coast of Crimea.  This cape penetrates deep into the sea and forms, together with other cliffs of the coast, a prehistoric pangolin or a fairy-tale dragon floating in the sea. </p><h2>  Through grotto </h2><p>  Kapchik crosses right through the Through Grotto from the Blue Bay to the Blue Bay.  About 77 meters is the length of this natural cave, which was formed here due to a tectonic fault.  Unlike many other Crimean caves, groundwater was not involved in the formation of Skvoznaya.  The wedge-shaped profile and its deep cracks indicate that the underground gallery appeared as a result of the movement of limestone cape Kapchik, irregular in several faults.  The same cracks can be found in the form of crevices in the city of Karaul-Oba.  Limestone blocks, torn off the floor, are lying at the bottom of the gallery.  However, the fault does not have any relation to the elongated shape of this cape.  This is not an extended stretch of limestone pushed out over the breaks in the sea, but a reef structure, which was composed of massive solid limestones.  It was used at Golitsyn as a banquet hall.  The prince built here an arched entrance with a wooden door, wrought-iron antique, stone stairs, through which you can go down to the sea, stained glass windows.  Now you can get to the grotto from the side of the Blue Bay, if you walk along a path fenced in a rock fenced with a parapet.  The cave was opened a few years ago, and you could get inside, of course, provided that you are not afraid of bats.  Currently, unfortunately, the grotto is closed to tourists after an accident that occurred in it.  The grill is installed, and you can only look inside through it.  In addition to the Through Grotto, Kapchik also has several other caves, smaller ones. </p><h2>  Juniper grove </h2><p>  What else is interesting Golitsyn trail?  You can return from Cape Kapchik to the New World by a short road through a juniper grove.  This is a living monument of ancient geological eras.  The grove is the remnant of ancient vegetation that covered Europe in the Cenozoic era.  The Cenozoic era lasted 60 million years.  These forests were seen by cave bears, saber-toothed tigers, mammoths ... Golitsyn trail (New World) - a place in the Crimea, near which are found the remains of animals that have died out long ago.  Mammoth bones were first discovered in the last century, not far from here - near the village of Solnechnogorsk, in the valley of the Soter River.  The onset of glaciers began in the Quaternary.  Heat-loving vegetation perished everywhere and only in the south kept because the glacier did not reach here.  It is in the vicinity of the New World that the largest juniper grove in Crimea (470 ha) is located.  Several species of juniper grows here, as well as pine Sudak and Crimean (Pallas).  Sudak is found only in the Crimea, on <span>Cape Aya</span> and in Sudak.  It was first studied by V.N. Stankevich, a young botanist, at the beginning of the 20th century.  In 1906, in honor of him, she was named Academician Sukachev Pine Stankevich. </p><h2>  Mount Karaul-Oba </h2><p>  This mountain guards juniper groves and bays of the New World from the west.  Climbing to its top, you will understand where its name came from.  The entire coast, starting from <span>Cape Meganom</span> and ending with Ayu-Dag Mountain, can be seen from here.  You can admire the scenery, sitting in the "Golitsyn's chair", cut out of stone.  You will see the amphitheater of the New World, as well as three colorful bays located at the foot: Green, Blue and Blue. </p><h2>  Other interesting places </h2><p>  What else attracts tourists to the Golitsyn trail, the photo of which is presented in this article?  The square rooms that surround the straight walls of the rocks are located under Mount Karaul-Oba.  Ahead is the Adam's Lodge.  This is a narrow gorge that is covered with ivy.  Behind the "Adam's Lodge" is a staircase in the rock.  In the New World, all the stone stairs were built by Golitsyn.  However, this, most likely, was still built by the Taurus, and the prince only upgraded it.  You will find yourself in the gorges: the cozy "Paradise" and the wild "Hell".  Descending from Karaul-Oba, you will find yourself on the "Royal Beach".  This mountain is also very interesting from a historical point of view.  Above the 70-meter cliff on its western spur are the remains of the dwellings and walls of the ancient fortress, which was built by Tsar Asander (Bosporus).  Here, in addition, there is a parking of the Tauris. </p><h2>  Golitsyn trail: how to get there? </h2><p>  First you need to go to the Simferopol - Sudak highway.  After that, go to the village.  New World.  This place has the following GPS coordinates: E 34 ° 54.708, N 44 ° 49.788.  The road here goes near the sea, going around the steep slope of the foot of Kush-Kai. </p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>
