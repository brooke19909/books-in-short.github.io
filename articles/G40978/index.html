At the same time, it makes an alarming sound and transmits information to the security control panel.  In the modern world, such a system is very necessary.  Private houses, shops, warehouses and more are put under surveillance. </p><h2>  Autonomous alarm </h2><p>  This is a fairly reliable burglar alarm.  Her installation is as follows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="burglar alarm installation" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1164546.jpg" width="342"></div>  Special sensors and signal sirens are mounted in the room.  They are all connected to the same control panel.  If penetration occurs, the sensors are triggered and transmit a signal to the panel.  It, in turn, includes elements of sound and light.  To disable it, you need to type a security code on the panel or apply the key.

    <p>  With the remote control system, the signal goes directly to the remote control of the security company.  After that, his employees immediately respond to the call and arrive at the place of the alarm.  The choice of this type of system is the most reliable.  But he is one of the most expensive. </p><h2>  GSM </h2><p>  This type of system is also equipped with sensors, but already with a GSM module.  From the control panel when the sensor is triggered, an SMS message is sent to the number of the owner or responsible person.  He will have to call the appropriate service.  The security alarm is not inferior in reliability to the alternative.  Installation can be both professional and independent.  Disconnected from the keyboard on the panel or key. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="burglar alarm system" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1164547.jpg" width="341"></div>  At a cost, this type is more profitable than a remote control, since you do not have to pay monthly contributions to a security company.  It is only necessary to monitor the balance of the number that is attached to the security alarm.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Local </h2><p>  Such a security alarm system can send a signal to the security control panel, which is located directly on the spot.  Or he doesn‚Äôt go anywhere at all.  Such a system is more likely to deter intruders by turning on the siren.  It cannot be called reliable, because if criminals know that this system is used, naturally, it will not scare them.  An advantage can be called only a small expense for the installation of such a system.  Security and alarm systems are a separate view intended for <span>emergency call of a</span> patrol to an object.  The signal is emitted using the <span>panic button.</span> </p><h2>  What kind to choose? </h2><p>  In order for the alarm system to serve its purpose, it is necessary to determine the type of room in which it will be installed.  If we are talking about buildings of a country or garage type, it is recommended to choose an autonomous type of protection.  If someone tries to illegally penetrate an object, a sound signal can frighten off intruders.  A GSM system is also suitable, since its installation does not require a stationary telephone. </p><p>  But in a residential building or apartment, it is better to consider the option of remote control.  This type is more reliable and responds to all types of violations: penetration, breaking the front door, broken glass.  Any type of console security system can be configured in an appropriate way, for example, so that it does not work on the movement of the animal. </p><p>  By the type of connection, alarms are divided into wired and wireless.  At the same time, wired can rarely be found, they are not profitable due to the need for construction and electrical work, which are very expensive.  The security <span>alarm for the house</span> should be reliable in the first place! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  System elements </h2><ul><li>  Control Panel.  This is the device to which signals from all sensors come.  It contains a control and adjustment system.  It is <span>the control panel that</span> transmits an alarm upon penetration.  With the independent installation of this element, difficulties may arise with the security company.  They may require that a burglar alarm (including installation) be purchased only from them. </li><li>  Sensors  They are of various types and are intended for various purposes (movement, sound, opening / closing of openings, vibration and others).  Along with signaling, it is good to install fire-fighting systems, which will be equipped with a burglar alarm.  The price of the system will increase slightly, but the safety of the property will be more complete.  Currently, sensors can be equipped with anything.  They can react to water, humidity and more.  But their installation is optional. </li><li>  Alert devices.  They include both sound devices and light signals, and devices that transmit an alarm signal to the phone can be attributed to them. </li></ul>

    <h2>  System installation </h2><p>  After making a selection of alarms, you can proceed with the installation.  If this is not a local system, then it is better to entrust its installation to professionals.  Currently, it is not difficult to find them; there are many companies specializing in this profile.  There must be such a company with a license and with qualified craftsmen in this field.  The security alarm system (installing it is not a very troublesome task) should be installed in accordance with existing standards.  The contract that is concluded with such a company usually spells out the following types of work: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  design; </li><li>  equipment delivery; </li><li>  mounting; </li><li>  commissioning works; </li><li>  service of the security alarm. </li></ul><p>  At the request of the client, the company can carry out the installation according to the finished plan, but with the replacement of components that can be purchased at another company.  It is worth considering that such manipulations entail an increase in the price of installing a security alarm. </p><h2>  Do it yourself </h2><p>  If you want to save on the installation of a burglar alarm, you can do it yourself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="burglar alarm service" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1164549.jpg" width="547"></div>  There is no big difference in the systems of such a device as a burglar alarm for a house or a summer residence.  Difficulties in installation should not arise if there is elementary school knowledge and a set of tools.

    <h2>  Install a wired system </h2><p>  Currently, such systems are rarely found on sale, although they cost less than wireless counterparts.  To install, you will need a large number of wires of such a length that is enough for all sensors.  You need to know the difference in plus and minus and have good patience. </p><p>  The sensor is attached with a special terminal strip to the wire.  The same element should be on the control panel.  Connect the device wires according to the manufacturer's recommendation.  Check that the connection and operation of the alarm are correct. </p><p>  A prerequisite - at least 20 centimeters should be between the cable and the power line.  All sensors are already initially adjusted, but if you need to make changes, you need to do this smoothly and check the sensor every time.  You need to be aware that the maintenance of a security alarm, installed independently, often falls on the shoulders of the owner of the house. </p><h2>  Wireless Installation </h2><p>  Such alarms are easy to install.  Spending time is just a couple of hours.  In order to correctly install the <span>wireless alarm</span> , you need to know the nuances of each of the elements. </p><p>  <em>Installing the control panel.</em>  For the equipment of a small room, a panel is enough to which four sensors can be connected.  If their number is greater, also not bad - they can be installed in additional places.  The box of the panel itself must be installed so that it was invisible and protected.  The panel power can be autonomous (battery) or combined (if the main power is turned off, the battery starts working).  Panels may vary in the way they are programmed: manually, using a program on the Internet, or starting a system in a store. </p><p>  <em>Installation of sensors.</em>  The most popular types are vibration and movement controls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="burglar alarm for home" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1164550.jpg" width="355"></div>  A sensor that responds to movement should be installed directly in the place of possible penetration.  There are rules for installing any of them.

    <ol><li>  It is impossible that in the process of work they were covered with other objects. </li><li>  Install them away from heating appliances. </li><li>  It is important to avoid direct exposure to sunlight. </li><li>  Installation should be done on the bracket in a place where there are no cyclic vibrations. </li></ol><p>  At the end of the installation, you should check the correct operation, connect the system.  The sensor should start working immediately, after 30 seconds the indicator should light up. </p><p>  The vibration sensor is installed on windows and doors.  It can be put on those items that are forbidden to touch, as well as special cabinets, drawers, safes. </p><p>  <span>Fire alarm</span> elements <span>are installed</span> on the ceiling of the room so that they better capture the temperature increase and smoke.  Such sensors are checked simply - they bring a burning or smoking object, the device should give a signal in a few seconds. </p><h2>  Access keys </h2><p>  They are similar to all the well-known keys to the intercom and have the same principle of operation.  The main rule is not to leave them unattended and not to give them to strangers; duplicating such keys will not be difficult.  A more modern option is a key fob.  But modern criminals can have a special device that will allow you to read the code from such a key. </p><p>  Signals of light and sound should be placed in inaccessible places protected from atmospheric precipitation.  It is imperative to carry out a functional check. </p><h2>  Alarm system repair </h2><p>  Modern equipment requires high stability of its work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="burglar alarm Price" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1164551.jpg" width="410"></div>  In order to avoid failures, it is better to carry out preventive scheduled work, they will help to identify shortcomings in the work.  If you still need repairs, you will have to call specialists and check the following details:

But it is in conjunction with the alarm system that it is more efficient.  With the help of such a system, it is possible not only to observe what is happening at the protected facility at the present time, but also to record possible penetration.  The capabilities of the video system do not end there.  She can give a light or sound signal and notify the necessary services or responsible persons.
