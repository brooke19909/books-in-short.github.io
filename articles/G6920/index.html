Perpetual neodymium magnet motor</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The fact that the generator with neodymium magnets, such as a wind generator, is useful, is no longer in doubt.  Even if all the appliances in the house cannot be supplied with energy in this way, then with prolonged use it will show itself on the winning side.  Making the device with your own hands will make operation even more economical and enjoyable. </p><h2>  Characteristics of Neodymium Magnets </h2><p>  But let's first find out what magnets are.  They appeared not so long ago.  It was possible to buy magnets in the store from the nineties of the last century.  They are made of neodymium, boron and iron.  The main element, of course, is neodymium.  This is the metal of the lantonoid group, with the help of which the magnets acquire tremendous adhesion.  If you take two pieces of large size and pull them together, then it will be almost impossible to unhook them. </p><p>  On sale mainly, of course, there are miniature species.  In any gift shop you can find balls (or another form) of this metal.  The high price of neodymium magnets is explained by the complexity of the extraction of raw materials and the technology of its production.  If a ball with a diameter of 3-5 millimeters will cost only a few rubles, then for a magnet with a diameter of 20 millimeters and above, you will have to lay out 500 rubles or more. </p>

    <p>  Neodymium magnets are obtained in special furnaces where the process takes place without access of oxygen, in a vacuum or atmosphere with an inert gas.  The most common are axial magnetization magnets in which the field vector is directed along one of the planes where the thickness is measured. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The characteristics of neodymium magnets are very valuable, but they can easily be ruined without the possibility of restoration.  So, a strong blow can rob them of all their properties.  Therefore, you should try to avoid falls.  Also, different species have their own temperature limit, which varies from eighty to two hundred and fifty degrees.  At temperatures above the limit, the magnet loses its properties. </p><p>  Correct and accurate use is the key to maintaining quality for thirty years or more.  Natural demagnetization is only one percent per year. </p><h2>  The use of neodymium magnets </h2><p>  They are often used in experiments in the field of physics and electrical engineering.  But in practice, these magnets are already widely used, for example, in industry.  Often they can be found in souvenirs. </p><p>  A high degree of adhesion makes them very useful when searching for objects made of metal underground.  Therefore, many search engines use equipment using neodymium magnets to find equipment left over from war times. </p><p>  If the old speakers barely work, sometimes it’s worth putting neodymium to the ferrite magnets, and the equipment will sound great again. </p><p>  So on the engine or generator, you can try to replace the old magnets.  Then there is a chance that the technique will work much better.  Consumption will even decrease. </p><p>  Humanity has long been looking for a <span>perpetual motion machine.</span>  On neodymium magnets, as some believe, the technology may well take on a real shape. </p><h2>  Ready-made vertically oriented wind generator </h2><p>  Wind turbines, especially in recent years, have renewed interest.  New models appeared, more convenient and practical. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  More recently, horizontal wind generators having three blades were mainly used.  And the vertical species did not spread due to the heavy load on the bearings of the wind wheel, resulting in increased friction, absorbing energy. </p><p>  But thanks to the use of the principles of <span>magnetic levitation,</span> a neodymium magnet wind generator began to be used precisely vertically oriented, with pronounced free inertial rotation.  Currently, it has proven to be more effective than horizontal. </p><p>  Easy start is achieved thanks to the principle of magnetic levitation.  And thanks to the multipolarity, which gives the rated voltage at low speeds, it is possible to abandon the gearboxes completely. </p><p>  Some devices are able to start work when the wind speed is only one and a half centimeters per second, and when it reaches only three to four meters per second, it may already be equal to the power generated by the device. </p><h2>  Application area </h2><p>  Thus, a wind generator, depending on its power, is able to provide energy to different buildings. </p><ol><li><p>  City apartments. </p></li><li><p>  Private houses, summer residences, shops, sinks. </p></li><li><p>  Billboards, traffic lights, streets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div></li><li><p>  Kindergartens, hospitals, ports and other urban institutions. </p></li></ol><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Devices are purchased ready-made or made independently.  Having bought a wind generator, it remains only to install it.  All adjustments and alignments have already been completed, tests have been carried out under various climatic conditions. </p><p>  Neodymium magnets, which are used instead of the gearbox and bearings, achieve the following results: </p><ul><li><p>  friction is reduced and the life of all parts is increased; </p></li><li><p>  the vibration and noise of the device disappears during operation; </p></li><li><p>  prime cost decreases; </p></li><li><p>  energy is saved; </p></li><li><p>  there is no need to regularly service the device. </p></li></ul><p>  The wind generator can be purchased with a built-in inverter that charges the battery, as well as with a controller. </p>

    <h2>  Most common models </h2><p>  The neodymium magnet generator can be made on a single or double mount.  In addition to the main neodymium, additional ferrite magnets can be provided in the design.  The height of the wing is different, mainly from one to three meters. </p><p>  More powerful models have dual mounts.  They also install additional ferrite magnet generators and have different wing heights and diameters. </p><h2>  Homemade designs </h2>

    <p>  Given that it is far from affordable for everyone to purchase a neodymium magnet generator that is powered by wind, they often decide to build a structure with their own hands.  Consider the various options for devices that can easily be done independently. </p><h2>  DIY wind generator </h2><p>  <span>A wind turbine</span> having a vertical axis of rotation typically has three to six blades.  The design includes a stator, blades (fixed and rotating) and a rotor.  Wind affects the blades, the entrance to and exit from the turbine.  As a support, car hubs are sometimes used.  Such a generator with neodymium magnets is silent, remains stable even in strong winds.  He does not need a high mast.  Movement starts even with very light winds. </p>

    <h2>  What could be a device of a stationary generator </h2><p>  It is known that an electromotive force through a wire is generated by changing a magnetic field.  In the core of a stationary generator, <span>magnetic flux</span> is generated by electronic control, not mechanically.  The generator controls the flow automatically, acting resonantly and consuming very low power.  Its oscillations deflect the magnetic fluxes of iron or ferrite cores.  The higher the oscillation frequency, the stronger the generator power.  Trigger is realized by a short pulse to the generator. </p><h2>  How to make a perpetual motion machine </h2><p>  <span>Home-made</span> neodymium magnet <span>generators are</span> basically the same in principle.  The standard option is the axial type. </p><p>  It is based on a hub from a car with brake discs.  Such a base will become reliable and powerful. </p><p>  When deciding to use it, the hub should be completely disassembled and checked to see if there is enough lubrication, and if necessary, clean the rust.  Then the finished device will be pleasantly painted, and it will acquire a “home”, well-groomed appearance. </p>

    <p>  Magnets are glued onto the rotor discs.  The author of the design shown in the photo in the article took twenty pieces measuring 25 * 8 millimeters.  You can use a different number of poles. </p><p>  In a single-phase device, the poles must have an equal number with the number of magnets.  In a three-phase, a ratio of two to three or four to three should be observed.  Magnets are placed alternating poles.  They must be precisely located.  To do this, you can draw a template on paper, cut it out and accurately transfer it to disk. </p><p>  In order not to confuse the poles, markers are made with a marker.  To do this, magnets are brought on one side: the one that attracts is denoted by the “+” sign, and the one that repels is marked with “-”.  Magnets must be attracted, that is, those located opposite each other must have different poles. </p>

    <p>  Superglue or the like is usually used, and after the sticker is poured with epoxy to increase strength, after making “curbs” so that it does not leak. </p><h2>  Three or single phase </h2><p>  A neodymium generator is usually made <span>three-phase.</span>  <span>The single-phase</span> design under load will work with vibration, since a constant current output will not be ensured, which will result in a step-like amplitude. </p><p>  But with a three-phase system, constant power is guaranteed at any time thanks to phase compensation.  Therefore, neither vibration will occur, nor hum.  And work efficiency will be fifty percent higher than with one phase. </p><h2>  Coil winding and the rest of the assembly </h2><p>  Calculation of a neodymium magnet generator is mainly done by eye.  But it is better, of course, to achieve accuracy.  For example, for a slow-moving device, where the charging of the battery would begin to function at 100-150 rpm, it will take from 1000 to 1200 turns.  The total number is divided by the number of coils.  So many turns will be required in each of them.  The coils are wound as thick as possible with the thickest wire, since with less resistance the current will be greater (with a high voltage, the resistance will take all the current). </p><p>  Usually they use round, but it is better to wind coils of elongated shape.  The inner hole should be equal to or larger than the diameter of the magnet.  In addition, the optimal magnet will be in the form of a rectangle, and not a washer, since in the former the magnetic field is stretched in length, while in the latter it is concentrated in the center. </p><p>  The stator thickness is made equal to the thickness of the magnets.  For the form you can use plywood.  At its bottom and on top of the coils, fiberglass is placed for strength.  The coils are connected to each other, and each phase is brought out for connection then by a triangle or a star. </p><p>  It remains to make a mast and a reliable foundation. </p><p>  Of course, this is not a perpetual motion machine on neodymium magnets.  However, savings when using a wind generator will be achieved. </p>
