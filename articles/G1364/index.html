    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Not only advantages, but also disadvantages is the Aviator Hotel in Kazan.  Reviews of tourists note the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  the rooms in the hotel are incredibly small (and especially for economy class rooms); </li><li>  the quality of the cleaning is very mediocre; </li><li>  the hotel is more like a hostel; </li><li>  terrible audibility between numbers; </li><li>  when booking an economy class room, be prepared for the fact that the bathroom is shared by two rooms; </li><li>  very old windows that let in all the sounds from the street; </li><li>  there are very few parking spaces, besides it is paid; </li><li>  the location is very uncomfortable - this is almost the outskirts of the city; </li><li>  it is better to come for breakfast in advance, otherwise you will not have enough not only food, but also cutlery; </li><li>  the shower cabin does not close well, which is why after bathing on the bathroom floor a lot of water is collected; </li><li>  very old creaky furniture; </li><li>  very fast registration and check-in procedure (even if many people come); </li><li>  very few double rooms (suites only); </li><li>  there are a lot of spots on the sofas, and bald spots even appeared on the carpet; </li><li>  muddy water flows from the tap due to problems with pipes; </li><li>  the rooms have cockroaches; </li><li>  the presence of dishes in the room, of course, pleases, but it would not hurt to wash it. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Hotel Aviator, despite being quite old and more like a Soviet hostel, is very popular among city guests.  This is due to the fact that housing prices are quite affordable.  Nevertheless, you should be prepared for the fact that this is the very outskirts of Kazan, and therefore there are some problems with transport.  Its advantage is its proximity to sports complexes.  That is why groups of fans or teams that take part in competitions most often come here.  Also, this hotel is suitable for budget travelers who are not afraid of a long journey to the city center, as well as some "scuffed" rooms. </p>
