This is a good time to take advantage of last minute packages and cheap tours with the best deals from agencies.  Where to relax in April inexpensively abroad and get maximum pleasure? </p><p>  At this time, hotels on the coasts are already fully prepared to receive tourists.  And if the water of the Black and Mediterranean Sea is still cold, then in Egypt and the Emirates a beach holiday in the middle of spring is considered the most favorable and comfortable.  But these are not the only places where you can relax in April with the greatest pleasure.  The second spring month is the best period to visit the European capitals, when the crowd of tourists is much less than in the summer.  It is better to choose those cities and countries where spring and flowering are in full swing.  Moreover, there are places whose charm is especially revealed in the middle of spring. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wonderfulengineering.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Exotic Thai" class="if uuid-2385011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2385011.jpg"></div><h2>  Spain and Greece </h2><p>  Both countries are popular for spring break and the first to come to mind when the question arises, where is better to relax in April?  Of course, they have plenty of attractions and attractive seaside resorts.  If you go here only to explore historical monuments and museums, then it is better to do this in winter, when the influx of tourists is minimal, and the weather is quite warm and pleasant for travel.  Soaking up on the beaches under the southern sun is certainly nice - the April tan is the most beautiful and lasting.  But the sea water is still too cold for swimming and, in order to fully enjoy a vacation by the sea, perhaps you should choose Egypt or the Emirates.  In any case, spending time in these Mediterranean countries will be a pleasant vacation, but if this is not the first trip, it is better to choose something special.  After all, there are places that are extremely interesting and beautiful in April. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Paris gardens </h2><p>  In spring, the French capital greets guests with the flowering of tulips, lilacs, chestnuts, and the air is filled with the aromas of flowers, coffee and fresh pastries.  In addition to the main attractions of the city, in April, Parisian gardens and parks deserve special attention. </p><ol><li>  In the Latin Quarter, one of the central districts of the capital, is the <span>Luxembourg Gardens,</span> which was once a palace park.  Now it is one of the most popular public places where you can relax.  In April, the fountains of the complex are already operating: the large Central and the Medici fountain.  Bright flower borders, alleys, terraces, classic French and English flowerbeds are arranged in perfect geometric order and occupy the central park area.  The more remote parts of the garden are known for their secluded attractive places hidden among two thousand old elms. </li><li>  One of the spring wonders of Paris is the Plant Garden with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã23.5 hectares.  Like the Luxembourg complex, this botanical garden is also free to visit and is also located in the Latin Quarter. </li><li>  A visit to Versailles in the vicinity of Paris with its spring show - gardens in the Chateau de Versailles will be one of the priority excursions.  The Palace Gardens of the ‚ÄúSun King‚Äù is an example of brilliant park design and architecture.  To appreciate all the extravagance and aristocratic past of the palace with its gardens, you should definitely get here in the spring during the period of lush flowering.  From April to September, the famous Versailles fountains operate in full force in the park.  And on weekends, a grandiose Fountain Festival takes place.  This water baroque music show is performed among numerous pools and fountains and ends with an evening fireworks display over the Grand Canal. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="gowith-theblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fountains in the gardens of Versailles" class="if uuid-2384915" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2384915.jpg"></div><h2>  Paris parks </h2><p>  Tired of excursions, entertainment and shopping, you can relax and get a portion of inspiration among the picturesque and well-groomed beauty of the capital's parks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  One cannot fail to mention the romantic atmosphere of Monceau Park, one of the most elegant in the capital, the charm of which Claude Monet portrayed in his works. </li><li>  The ideal union of nature and culture is the gardens and museums in the Tuileries Park, which is especially beautiful in spring with its bright flowering among magnificent statues and pools filled with water lilies. </li><li>  The best place for contemplation and photographs of the Eiffel Tower is the Champs Elysees.  Gardens and alleys of this park occupy a vast territory of the center of the capital between the Military School and the famous tower.  This place is especially beautiful with the variegated flowering of spring flower beds and borders. </li><li>  Butte Chaumont Park, the most delightful during the spring season, is a territory of peace and tranquility.  In April, a park forest and hills shine in the sun, hiding among the flowers and foliage several grottoes, charming paths and bridges. </li></ol><p>  Before parting with Paris, it will be an exciting walk on one of the river buses along the Seine embankment.  The blooming city looks incredibly from the side of the river. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.photo-paysage.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monceau park" class="if uuid-2384935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2384935.jpg"></div><h2>  Italy </h2><p>  April prices in Italy are higher than winter prices, but have not yet reached their summer peak.  At this time of the year, many tourists come to the country, but there are much fewer than there will be in the period from mid-May to the end of September.  Therefore, in Italy you can spend a pleasant and fairly inexpensive vacation in April.  Where to relax?  The choice is huge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  To get acquainted with the historical values ‚Äã‚Äãof antiquity and the Renaissance, which are in the country in exceptional safety, you should visit Rome, Florence, Milan, Venice.  This is the most popular tourist route, providing an oversight of cultural sightseeing. </li><li>  Gastronomic tours will undoubtedly include the administrative areas of Campania, Calabria, Abruzzo.  In addition, a trip to Italy is a great opportunity for tasting local wines. </li><li>  The landscape of the Italian coastline is the most diverse among all the countries of the Mediterranean, which gives a magnificent selection of attractive coastal places where they relax in April.  The beach season at this time is still limited to sunbathing and sailing.  But the sun, cuisine, wine, air and the beauty of the Italian Primorye fill the holidaymakers with energy at any time of the year. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="tourism-italy.tumblr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Italian spring" class="if uuid-2380031" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2380031.jpg"></div><h2>  Rome </h2><p>  In April, the ‚Äúcity on seven hills‚Äù is filled with warmth, sun, freshness, and it seems that all the buildings almost drown in the sea, flowering, trees and greenery.  By the middle of the month, the daily heat here reaches 20 degrees, and this is a very comfortable temperature for exploring the countless sights of Rome.  But mid-spring in the capital of Italy is not the most serene place abroad, where you can relax in April in peace and quiet. </p><p>  Almost the whole month, the capital hosts the spectacular spring festival "Primavera", when concerts, discos, costume shows and processions, various events, shows, fashion shows are held in the open air.  And the ‚ÄúSpanish Steps‚Äù in the center of the Italian capital becomes lilac-pink from hundreds of azalea flowerpots - a traditional flower exhibition.  The city acquires a pink color from the beginning of April also because Japanese sakura, abundantly planted in Rome, begins to bloom. </p><p>  On April 21, the Romans celebrate the foundation day of their city.  This is an impressive costume party.  It begins with a stylized ancient Roman procession passing through the ancient city gates.  Gladiator fights take place on historical squares and in the Coliseum, and an antique horse parade is being held in Borghese Park.  The entire historical part of the city turns into a theatrical spectacle, in which everyone can participate.  It hosts gladiatorial competitions, fairs, wine and national cuisine tastings, the sale of souvenirs and handicrafts of craftsmen from all over Italy, dances, and stage plays.  And the day ends with a big firework.  Rome these days is the most fascinating place where in April you can relax in an unusual and fun way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.bags-free.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spring festival in honor of the founding of Rome" class="if uuid-2380020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2380020.jpg"></div><p>  The second significant event that can happen in April is the late Catholic Easter.  A week before the great feast, Catholics and just curious people, not only from Italy, but the whole world, are gathering for the solemn service of Palm Sunday.  Throughout the week there is a service in the temples. Good Friday is marked by a mass religious procession bypassing the Colosseum.  And on Holy Sunday, St. Peter's Square is crowded with believers who want to participate in the Mass and hear the conversion of the Pope.  It should be noted that the Catholic Easter rite is very beautiful, spectacular and inspiring. </p><h2>  Portugal </h2><p>  In the middle of spring, the cost of tours and prices in the country are so affordable that Portugal is considered one of the first places where you can relax in April abroad cheaply and with great pleasure.  Moreover, the locals consider April and October, which they call the second spring, to be the most pleasant periods.  At this time, Portugal is very beautiful due to the abundance of flowering plants and greenery, and spring travel around the country can be considered the most comfortable than anywhere else. </p><p>  There are always fewer tourists than in Spain, Italy or Greece.  Holidays in Portugal are preferred by those who know how to value true pleasure in life.  Clean, cozy cities with many narrow, well-groomed streets saturated with the smell of eucalyptus and oranges, majestic medieval temples and Moorish castles, the world's best port and marzipan, excellent cuisine, an indescribable beauty of the coast, washed by the Atlantic waves.  Those who have visited Portugal in the spring will certainly return here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.obidosportugalguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portugal in April (Obidos)" class="if uuid-2387211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2387211.jpg"></div><h2>  Egypt </h2><p>  Two of the most popular Egyptian resorts in Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh are cities where you can relax at sea at a low price in April.  On the coast of the Red Sea at this time, real summer and the best season for tanning.  The coral world of the Red Sea is the most diverse and beautiful among the seas of the Northern Hemisphere.  Therefore, coming here, it is worth grabbing a mask, snorkel and flippers for snorkeling or diving equipment.  If you didn‚Äôt have to get involved in these types of swimming before, then you can buy everything you need or rent it on site and be sure to take a boat trip to the most fascinating coral places. </p><p>  All vacation time can be spent under the sun at sea, where, of course, it is pleasant to relax in April after winter frosts.  But, having been in Egypt, it will be annoying not to see the main attractions of the country.  Sharm el Sheikh is located seven hours drive from Cairo with its legendary pyramids.  A tourist bus takes nine hours to reach Alexandria.  Only a couple of hours will take the way to the monastery of St. Catherine and the mountains of Moses.  Hurghada is located between Cairo and Luxor, the most important archaeological site of Egypt, where the famous Karnak and <span>Luxor temples</span> rise <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": Dereck Keats, "><img itemprop="image" alt="The underwater world of the Red Sea" class="if uuid-2384982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2384982.jpg"></div><h2>  Dubai </h2><p>  Emirates can not be called a place where they relax inexpensively.  But in April you can buy a ‚Äúburning‚Äù tour and save a lot on a trip to enjoy the beaches of the Persian Gulf and see the wonders of Dubai.  The air temperature can already reach +30 degrees, and the shallow turquoise sea waters are warm, like fresh milk.  The beaches here are comfortable, clean, with soft fine sand.  They are equipped with showers, toilets and changing rooms.  In addition to hotel beaches, there are also public beach parks and free coasts.  The latter are no less well-maintained, but without the restrictions of "women's days", the swim distance, and photography prohibitions.  Almost everywhere on the coast there are many stalls with soft drinks, delicious snacks and beach accessories. </p><p>  The city also has something to see and something to be surprised.  There are no historical sights in it, but Dubai itself is considered one of the modern wonders of the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.headout.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches in Dubai" class="if uuid-2384994" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2384994.jpg"></div><h2>  The Dead Sea </h2><p>  This is another place where you can go inexpensively, comfortably and where to relax at sea abroad.  April is the most suitable time to recover your body and bring your body into good shape after a long winter.  The Dead Sea is a body of water with a very high level of salts and mineralization, also known for silty sediments and thermal springs with an increased concentration of inorganic components.  These natural factors have the strongest healing effects on the human body.  By spring, diseases of joints and bones, old injuries, diseases of the liver, intestines and stomach are exacerbated.  After conducting local procedures for several days at the Dead Sea, you can forget about your ailments for a long time. </p><p>  In mid-spring, the waters of the Dead Sea warm up to +24 degrees.  Youth and beauty are returned here.  The whole world knows about the cosmetic properties of the natural resources of the Dead Sea.  Where to relax in April on the coast, with maximum comfort?  Right here.  There are many SPA resorts on the coast and there is a beauty parlor at almost every hotel.  Daily bathing and tanning, mud and mineral masks, body wraps, massages, healing baths and many other corrective measures will restore muscle tone, healthy skin color and turgor.  And most importantly - they will restore strength, well-being and high spirits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timesofisrael.com" data-author=": Shmuel Bar-Am, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dead Sea in Israel" class="if uuid-2385000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2385000.jpg"></div><h2>  Long trips </h2><p>  Where to find a more unusual beach holiday in April, and where to relax in distant exotic countries?  If funds allow and does not frighten a long flight, the choice of tours is very diverse.  You can go to the shores of the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea to the amazing kingdom of Thailand.  April is one of the hottest months, but without rain, and sea water is warmed up to +30 degrees.  The trip will allow you to plunge not only into the summer heat, but also the bizarre world of Buddhist temples, outlandish customs and extravagant beauty.  No less surprising will be a trip to the warm shores of the Indian Ocean in Indonesia and Sri Lanka, where the water is warmed up to +28 degrees and the air to +32. </p><p>  Cuba, Vietnam, China are countries where you can bask in the sea in April, where there are plenty of impressions, wonders, and interesting places to visit.  Resorts are perfectly equipped for tourism in each of these exotic countries, a trip to which will leave an unforgettable impression. </p>
