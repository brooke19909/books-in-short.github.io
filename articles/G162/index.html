These yellow little balls with green "branchy" leaves create unusual bouquets, cards, paintings.  <span>Spring flowers are</span> embroidered, created from satin ribbons, knitted, sculpted, burned, but paper mimosa is especially interesting.  With their own hands, children can make separate twigs and even build whole bouquets. </p><h2>  Applications with kids </h2><p>  Kids (1-3 years old) do not like to wait, so prepare a small album sheet, cotton wool, <span>finger paints,</span> PVA glue, toothpick (cut corners right away), green double-sided paper (cut into thin strips) in advance. </p><p>  Now show the child how to make mimosa with your own hands from fleece (it can be replaced with a soft napkin).  Tearing off the lump, roll it with your fingers, dip it into the glue and stick it on the paper.  As soon as all the balls are glued, place a twig-toothpick with leaves between them.  The child will only have to finger paint his mimosa. </p><p>  With children from three to four years, practice the technique of rampling.  Thanks to him, voluminous mimosa from corrugated paper is obtained, and children develop <span>fine motor skills.</span>  Prepare yellow, green and brown paper for work (corrugated, tracing paper or, in extreme cases, double-sided color), PVA glue, cardboard.  From a brown strip, the children should roll up the sausage and stick in the middle of the sheet.  It will be a branch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself mimosa from paper" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/783465.jpg" width="456"></div>

Then from the yellow squares (2x2 cm or 1.5x1.5 cm) roll the balls.  Let the child first crumple a leaf, then begins to squeeze to crush the corners, and only then twirl the resulting lumps with fingers. </p><p>  The older the child, the smaller the squares.  Immediately cut green leaves from green paper, bend and cut into narrow strips.  Glue a few leaves to the branches, place mimosa balls on top of them.  They can be glued with a second layer. </p><p>  Between the mimosa or on top of it, put a couple more leaves.  The background can be painted with paints or pencils.  Draw a picture in a frame, hang it on the wall.  According to this style, you can make mimosa from corrugated paper, like artificial flowers. </p><p>  To do this, you will need a skewer, green and yellow paper or napkin, <span>copper wire,</span> glue.  Cut the wire into small pieces. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make mimosa from paper" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/783452.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mimosa branch </h2><p>  Then you take a small square of napkins, put a wire on it, begin to crumple the paper, forming a ball.  Glue the wire with green paper.  To form lush balls, soak them in glue, and then dip them in dyed yellow semolina.  Leave the flowers to dry, but for now make leaves. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can draw a leaf according to the type of fern, and each branch is still cut into small strips.  In another option, cut the usual wide sheet, like a tulip, cut into strips.  But there is a third option for making leaves.  Cut a long piece of corrugated paper into narrow strips. </p><p>  Now look what a sprig of mimosa from paper will turn out.  Take the skewer, stick the edge of the green paper on it, place a couple of balls, screw the wire and wind it in a spiral with leaves.  If you do everything correctly, then the stripes will look in different directions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper mimosa" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/783453.jpg" width="591"></div>

    <p>  To make the balls look organic, gently pierce the green paper with a wire, and then wrap a twig around it.  In some places, you can insert bouquets of balls.  To do this, connect together a few wires with flowers.  According to this plan, do the rest of the branches, put in a vase and get a whole bouquet.  Such a mimosa from paper from afar as a real one. </p><h2>  Quilling flowers </h2><p>  In this technique, you can make mimosa in three ways. </p><ol><li>  Twist a strip of yellow paper into a tight roll (a circle with the end of the strip glued together).  The diameter of such a circle is not more than five millimeters.  This type of flower is suitable for creating small, unblown flowers that form the top of the twig. </li><li>  You also make a tight roll, which is then slightly pushed forward, forming a cup. </li><li>  Cut a strip of yellow paper into narrow segments.  Then wrap it in a tight roll, glue the end, and shake all the strips thoroughly.  It turned out to bloom a flower. </li></ol><p>  Such a mimosa from paper with your own hands is done easily, and is suitable for postcards, vases or paintings.  Let's start by creating a flower.  On a skewer wrapped in green corrugated paper, glue the flowers made in the third way.  At the same time, some balls are very fluffy, some retain the shape of a bud.  Glue the mimosa tightly to each other on a stick from all sides. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated paper mimosa" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/783456.jpg" width="478"></div>

    <p>  Glue the leaves under the flowers.  In this case, a wide long sheet, cut into narrow segments, will go.  To add realism, bend the leaf vertically, and round each strip with scissors or a pencil to create a visual effect of the wind. </p><h2>  Mimosa with tulips </h2><p>  Beautiful <span>voluminous pictures</span> are obtained from paper <span>, they</span> only require more painstakingness, attentiveness and perseverance.  Consider how to make mimosa from paper with tulips. </p><ul><li>  Prepare the background of the picture by drawing the sky, the gaps of the sun. </li><li>  Cut a vase from paper or draw in watercolor. </li><li>  Prepare a mimosa performed according to the third method. </li><li>  Make a few twigs for mimosa.  To do this, take the green wire, connect it into a twig and wrap it with a <span>floral tape</span> or corrugated strip. </li><li>  Cut directly the leaves for mimosa and tulip. </li><li>  Make several branches in advance (meaning mimosa from paper). </li><li>  Do tulips as follows.  Overlay squares of paper on each other, roll up into a tube until the middle, forming a triangle.  Now add each edge to the top of the triangle and twist it into a petal.  Fasten the petals into the bud on the stem so that the edges are convex (twisted). </li><li>  Collect tulips on a stalk. </li></ul><p>  Now place the branches in the picture and glue them in order.  Fram the work and admire the masterpiece. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper mimosa" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/783455.jpg" width="494"></div>

    <h2>  Mimosa from paper: we create a miracle with our own hands </h2><p>  Bouquets can be made entirely using the quilling technique.  To do this, find a beautiful photo with a vase and print it on the printer.  Cut, glue on the base of the picture.  To create a volume, sometimes fabric is selected according to the color of the vase, thick foam rubber is cut out in its shape, covered with fabric, decorated and glued to cardboard. </p><p>  Next, you need a lot of fluffy mimosas with leaflets.  Make balls of different sizes, but at the same time they should copy real flowers. </p><p>  Now see how to make mimosa out of paper in a picture.  On the canvas with a pencil, slightly outline the direction of the branches.  Have a trial version of flowers without glue.  Work with the direction of the branches. </p><p>  As soon as you like the bouquet option, take a picture of it and work on it.  Start sticking the first layer of flowers and leaves.  Then increase the volume due to subsequent layers.  Sometimes a leaf is inserted between the balls.  Glue more leaves at the base of the vase, the bend of which will hide the seams or irregularities of work.  Despite its simplicity, a picture of 30x30 centimeters may require half a month of work.  But the result is stunning with its realism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make mimosa with your own hands" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/783454.jpg" width="452"></div>
