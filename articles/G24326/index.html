  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Bulgaria: reviews, tours, entertainment, attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Reviews about holidays in Bulgaria need to know every person who decides to visit this country.  Many travelers left their opinion about it and, based on their comments, certain conclusions were drawn in the article.  In the same material you can read general information about the trip, hotels, beaches, attractions and find out other useful data. </p><h2>  Training </h2><p>  In order for a vacation in Bulgaria with children or on their own to go without any adventures, you need to prepare in advance.  To move the border you will need a visa with insurance.  You can get to the capital by plane or train, in the CIS countries this is not a problem. </p><p>  The climate in most of the territory is continental and only in the south is a transition to a warmer Mediterranean.  The temperature in the winter stably keeps at five degrees below zero, in the summer from 16 to 27, but the weather can make its own adjustments. </p><p>  Domestic airlines are underdeveloped, but buses and the railway network compensate for this shortcoming.  Trains run between tourist points quite often. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.spisanie.to" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Bulgaria" class="if uuid-2359948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2359948.jpg"></div><h2>  Choosing a place to relax with friends </h2><p>  The question of where it is better to relax in the <span>resorts of Bulgaria,</span> may be asked by everyone before the trip, but the answers for all will be different.  It all depends on what goals the tourist sets for himself. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If there is a desire to have fun in a large company of young people and find a place where nightlife does not subside, then the path lies on Sunny Beach and Golden Sands.  These places are most famous among all resorts and people from all over Europe come here.  In season, the number of vacationers for an unprepared person may even be too large.  At the same time, the infrastructure here is of the highest level and no needs will be felt. </p><h2>  Ride with children </h2><p>  If you want to spend a wonderful holiday in Bulgaria with children, then it is better to head north and settle in Albena or Kranevo.  There are many children's camps, fresh air due to the large number of trees, excellent infrastructure.  Another pleasant surprise will be low prices, especially for fruits.  Here you can spend a good and budget holiday. </p><div class="photo" data-original="globalgrasshopper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Bulgaria with children" class="if uuid-2359949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2359949.jpg"></div><h2>  For history buffs </h2><p>  To ask where it is better to go on vacation to Bulgaria, so that it is filled for a long time, is necessary.  Only providing yourself with all the necessary information, you can not go wrong with the choice of the region. </p><p>  For example, lovers of history and sights of the previous options are not quite suitable.  Such tourists should settle in Sozopol or Nessebar.  These are the famous cultural centers of the country, through which even simple walks will be remembered for a long time.  The first city is calmer, and in the second you can often see vacationers from Sunny Beach who arrived on an excursion. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The beauty of nature and colorful antiquities </h2><p>  If you want maximum peace and pleasure of beauty, then your path lies in Veliko Tarnovo.  The town is spread out in the Rylsky mountains and as if remained somewhere in the Renaissance.  The architecture is only slightly touched by modern trends, mainly recalls the tastes of the XVI-XVII centuries.  Rylsky Monastery is located here, which is one of the main attractions of Bulgaria. </p><div class="photo" data-original="freeyork.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Bulgaria tours" class="if uuid-2359950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2359950.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel selection </h2><p>  If you book tours for holidays in Bulgaria, then there will be no problems with the hotel.  The travel company lodges guests in a certain place, and from there the rest of the program is already planned.  Only now it is much more interesting to explore the country on your own, and it is important to know how infrastructure is developed in this segment. </p><p>  Most residences in Bulgaria have three stars or the same, but with a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù mark.  Higher-class hotels are also available, and their number is increasing every year.  Bulgaria focuses on visiting Europeans who wish to relax in exquisite places.  The hotels serve food in the form of a buffet, as happens in most establishments. </p><p>  It is worth noting that in the places of settlement of tourists, cosmetic repairs are carried out before each season, which already speaks of the attitude towards travelers.  Health resorts are also popular in the country.  For this purpose, it is best to visit Pomorie or Burgas, where life slows down several times, and you can enjoy true peace. </p><div class="photo" data-original="freeyork.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beach holidays in bulgaria" class="if uuid-2359956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2359956.jpg"></div><h2>  Inspection of the beaches </h2><p>  Beach holidays in Bulgaria are quite common and it is for this purpose that many people come to the camp.  If a person goes to the resort, then you should prepare for a huge number of people on the coast. </p><p>  Sandy beaches here are common and free, but because there the number of people can be amazing.  At the same time, in Sunny Beach or in Golden Sands there are many variations for entertainment.  Right on the coast there is the opportunity to play volleyball or football, ride horses and the like.  In the first resort, even a child will be comfortable swimming, and in the second, problems may arise due to a steep entrance to the sea. </p><p>  For those people who want to relax away from a huge number of people and noisy youth, the beaches of Ahtopol or Tsarevo can be great.  These are small towns in which mass construction in the tourist segment has not begun.  Here the rest will be more measured and cheaper.  Prices can often be found lower than in the native cities of the CIS countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="davidsbeenhere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgarian resorts where better to relax" class="if uuid-2359960" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2359960.jpg"></div><h2>  Cuisine and Catering </h2><p>  In addition to entertainment in Bulgaria, every tourist should definitely try national dishes. </p><p>  All the cuisine in the country is characterized by a love of spices and spicy food.  The abundance of dishes with vegetables is also part of the culture of food consumption.  Locals love to cook on an open fire, and serve the finished product in earthenware.  All this creates a certain flavor and arouses the interest of visiting people. </p><p>  Among the most famous dishes, you can highlight stuffed peppers, kavarma, tourator, lutenitz and many others.  In the local cuisine, dairy products, especially feta cheese, are actively used. </p><p>  Another feature of catering establishments is their names, which reflect the essence of the institution.  For example, "Mehana" is a family restaurant, which is most often decorated as a rural house.  The menu of such an institution will have so many dishes that it will be incredibly difficult to choose something at once.  The wine list in Bulgaria is quite rich; gourmets will not feel offended. </p><div class="photo" data-original="globalgrasshopper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria rest where it is better to go" class="if uuid-2359963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2359963.jpg"></div><h2>  The main attractions of Bulgaria </h2><p>  Excursions on vacation in Bulgaria are guaranteed to be remembered for a lifetime.  The history of the country is incredibly rich, and a trip to one capital can take more than half of the rest.  Here is the ancient fortress of Serdika, the temple-monument of St. Alexander Nevsky, the Banja Bashi mosque and many other attractions.  They just need to be seen in order to plunge more into the atmosphere of the country's history. </p><p>  During the flowering season, visiting the Valley of Roses will be a unique experience for every person, because the sight opens up simply magnificent.  There is also a mysterious Thracian tomb, which has been preserved since ancient times. </p><p>  Varna also has a number of places to visit, including a local aquarium, lakeside walks, museums and temples. </p><p>  A trip to the Rila Mountains will also be an excellent choice, because it is there that the cultural center of the whole country is located - the monastery of the same name with unique architecture.  Nearby is the mysterious "stone forest", the origin of which was definitely not known until these days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Bulgaria excursions" class="if uuid-2359966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2359966.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about holidays in Bulgaria from the lips of many people sound extremely positive.  This applies to trips in pairs, family entertainment or group.  The reason for this positive flow is the calm atmosphere that you want to enjoy.  It contributes to the fact that the body and soul really gain strength for new everyday life. </p><p>  The country is diverse, you can go here for different purposes.  Fans of noisy parties and historical values ‚Äã‚Äãwill find something to do, with a difference only in the regions for settlement.  The beaches in most cases are clean and marked with the blue flag of the EU, which means environmental safety.  Nessebar and Sozopol can be considered open-air museums, where monuments from the times of antiquity and the Middle Ages have been preserved.  Positive reviews about holidays in Bulgaria are heard from people who satisfied their desires, with whom they went to this country.  The number of attractions is large, you can walk around Varna and Sofia for long days and new details will always open. </p><h2>  Negative opinions </h2><p>  Not all reviews about holidays in Bulgaria convey enthusiasm with admiration.  Many people find the atmosphere too calm and even dull.  It is noted that being in one resort can quickly get bored.  Tourists repeatedly wrote in comments that local people are not too friendly, especially to Russian tourists.  They can smile, but sincerity is not felt in this.  Some people were not satisfied with the local color cuisine; the quality of the dishes did not match the price.  Also, travelers wrote that it was easy to pick up an intestinal infection in the sea, and then all rest would be ruined. </p><p>  It is worth noting that about all these aspects, there are ongoing disputes between tourists with allegations of lies.  Some are assured of the high quality of rest, others say that they will never return to Bulgaria.  Tastes are different, but if someone decides to go to this country, then it is better to plan your vacation in advance, which will help this material. </p>
