Reviews speak of such advantages of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  beautiful architecture of the cases, sustained in the Arabian style; </li><li>  from the balcony you can watch very beautiful views; </li><li>  the beach is well maintained and comfortable; </li><li>  due to the remoteness of the hotel from the city center, guests can enjoy peace and tranquility; </li><li>  holiday parties; </li><li>  runs a free shuttle to the resort center; </li><li>  when meeting newly arrived guests are treated to a delicious refreshing cocktail; </li><li>  good lighting rooms; </li><li>  the hotel has a access system, in addition, they will search you every time you enter (for some this may seem like a drawback, but you can be sure of your safety); </li><li>  excellent service in the restaurant; </li><li>  a lot of greenery in the territory; </li><li>  the hotel courtyard is kept in perfect cleanliness;  excellent diving; </li><li>  the furniture in the rooms, although old, is of high quality and comfortable; </li><li>  a bank branch operates directly on the territory; </li><li>  snow-white and fragrant bath towels, the same bed linen; </li><li>  politeness and smiling staff makes you close your eyes to all the flaws; </li><li>  lively underwater world in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marina plaza hotel tala bay aqaba 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39549/1448003.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Not yet fully explored direction is Aqaba.  Marina Plaza Hotel Tala Bay, like any other resort, has its drawbacks.  From traveler reviews, you can find out the following: </p><ul><li>  the staff is extremely slow, and comments or requests have to be repeated several times; </li><li>  the Internet is almost completely absent (there is a signal, but not a single site is loaded); </li><li>  in the corridors for some reason are old mattresses and utensils; </li><li>  the interior is outdated and needs updating; </li><li>  housekeeping is poor; </li><li>  in the restaurant menu there are almost no dietary dishes for children; </li><li>  very modest breakfasts; </li><li>  the hotel is far from the sea; </li><li>  inflated prices for accommodation, meals and other services; </li><li>  the rooms have neither electric kettles nor utensils (all this can be rented for an additional fee); </li><li>  frequent interruptions in water supply; </li><li>  poor-quality plumbing in the bathroom; </li><li>  rocky entry into the sea; </li><li>  clogged drain in the shower; </li><li>  loud noise from the track running nearby. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  As mentioned above, Jordan is a rather specific tourist destination that has not yet been fully explored by domestic travelers.  Of great interest is the historical and cultural heritage, as well as natural and recreational resources.  As for the service, it remains a bit in the shade.  Although, the prices for accommodation and recreation are much higher than in Egypt and Turkey.  This direction is chosen by real travelers who seek to learn something new, and the hotel for them is a secondary factor. </p><p>  The first thing that catches your eye upon arrival is architecture and a luxurious area with a dense green garden.  However, the euphoria passes almost immediately after you go inside.  Here you will find shabby walls, outdated furniture and so on.  However, the impression evens out a bit when you get into the room.  The "tired" interior and equipment is more than compensated by the design decision and bright decorative elements.  In addition, the rooms have everything you need for living. </p><p>  Jordan is a fairly expensive resort.  This hotel is located far from urban infrastructure, and therefore the prices for accommodation and recreation here are even higher.  One can say that they are unreasonably high, because neither the quality of service, nor the range and taste of food, nor entertainment are impressive.  Perhaps only the beach deserves attention (which, incidentally, is located quite far from the hotel).  As for excursions, they are several times more expensive with a hotel guide than with local travel agencies. </p><p>  Given the tense situation in the region, resort hotels are heavily guarded.  Outsiders are not allowed into the territory.  And even the residents of the hotel are searched every time they return to the hotel after a walk, tour or visit the beach.  Upon arrival, the luggage is screened on an x-ray machine.  Despite the fact that these events are not the most pleasant, they can be considered a kind of payment for safety and a relaxing holiday. </p>
