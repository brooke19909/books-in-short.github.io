For example, in the described Chinese province is the largest lake in the country, called Taih.  And in the southern part flows the largest river in the Celestial Empire - the Yangtze. </p><p>  In the 7th century, Jiangsu Province became the site of the construction of the Imperial Canal, which still exists today.

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  Jiangsu Province, whose cities are home to more than 79 million inhabitants, ranks fifth in the country in terms of population.  Of course, almost all of them are Chinese (99%).  Here, locals speak the same dialect.  This is not surprising, because this nation is the most common.  In addition, China is the most populated state in the world. </p><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  Jiangsu Province (China) is also widely developed in various fields.  Its economy is considered one of the strongest in the state.  However, it should be noted that not all the settlements of this province are developed equally.  There is a significant difference between cities.  The southern ones are especially distinguished - they have the highest standard of living (on average, twice as many as the rest). </p><h2>  Minerals </h2><p>  Minerals in this province are mined a little, because for the development of the country's economy they do not have much significance.  It mainly produces and processes marble, sulfur, rock salt.  According to these indicators, Jiangsu Province (China) is one of the richest in the state.  Since ancient times, light and food industries have developed here.  And after the Communists came to power, heavy industry also gained wide development.  Among the most influential areas can be identified chemical, building materials and oil.  Relatively recently, electronics manufacturing and mechanical engineering were added to them, which could bring the whole world to its feet.  Due to the increase in these economic indicators, Jiangsu Province began to develop its other cities, equating them to the capital of Nanjing. </p>
