Spotlights and lamps mounted on masts, various poles, viaducts can improve visibility in the dark.  Light is very necessary not only on the night streets of a big city, but also in the yards of small sleeping areas, and in private households. </p><p>  Previously, the same lights that were installed along the roads were used as spotlights.  The lights practically did not differ from each other in terms of device and principle of operation.  Today, the situation has changed: to street lamps, spotlights, lights for summer cottages meet the requirements, you have to work hard.  Today's selection of outdoor lighting equipment is amazing.  Halogen equipment is especially popular.  With the help of these lamps illuminate sculptures and other cultural values, billboards, facades. </p>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The very first outdoor lighting system that was used to illuminate the streets was built in Amsterdam in the 17th century.  The project was developed by one of the fire department of this city.  It was necessary to install about 2.5 thousand lamps.  <span>Oil lamps were</span> used as a light source <span>,</span> and they were only finished using them in 1840. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Such experience was appreciated in other countries and cities.  So, in 1807, gas-powered outdoor lighting lamps began to appear in London.  And in Moscow, the streets began to illuminate in 1730. </p><p>  Today is not the 17th century, so a halogen spotlight is used as a source of illumination for both city streets and private cottages. </p><h2>  What are the requirements for outdoor lighting sources </h2><p>  Outdoor lighting systems are very different from indoor lighting devices.  Differences in everything - in design, in the installation method, in the technical characteristics.  Choose a spotlight with <span>a motion sensor</span> for the street also by other principles.  And if a parameter such as color temperature is important for indoor use, then power is important for such lamps. </p>

    <p>  The luminous efficiency of a light source is the ratio of the luminous flux emitted by the source to the power consumed by it.  As a rule, lamps, searchlights for outdoor lighting are mainly halogen.  Their light output is at the level of 85-150 lm / W. </p><p>  Another parameter is the lifetime.  It is very important when selecting a device.  Since the process of replacing a searchlight is quite time-consuming, a long life is a big plus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What to choose when choosing </h2><p>  When choosing a street lighting system, several nuances should be taken into account.  So, climatic features of those territories where the halogen floodlight will work are very important.  The intensity of movement in the area to be illuminated is also important.  In addition, take into account the impact of the external environment, the need for territory in saturated light, installation features. </p>

    <p>  Searchlights work in conditions of high humidity, as well as sharp temperature changes, so it is important to consider the level of protection.  This indicator indicates whether moisture or other foreign bodies can penetrate into the lamp housing.  For example, a halogen floodlight must have a protection level of 23 IP for the electrical part, as well as 54 IP for a sealed compartment with a lamp. </p><h2>  Halogen outdoor light </h2><p>  This is a popular tool for organizing outdoor lighting.  They are used almost everywhere.  These lamps illuminate both city streets and private households. </p><h2>  Device </h2><p>  The device is based on halogen lamps for spotlights.  They are a cylinder filled with buffer gas.  It is this component that allows you to increase their service life by several times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As the basis for the lamp using tungsten wire.  The shape of the wire is attached using special electrodes and holders. </p>

    <h2>  Operating principle </h2><p>  The halogen floodlight works on the principle of the formation of tungsten halides, the evaporation of which triggers the decay and reduction of tungsten.  This action is a closed loop. </p><p>  Previously, iodine atoms were used in such lamps, but this caused certain disadvantages.  Iodine turned out to be very aggressive towards metals, and the light was a green hue.  In addition, it was not possible to calculate the iodine rate necessary for the stable operation of the lamp. </p>

    <p>  Then, bromine, chlorine and fluorine were used in the lamps.  And these substances failed to give the lamp the necessary characteristics.  In modern halogen bulbs <span>, methyl bromide</span> or methylene is used.  These substances have the properties necessary for work.  Lamps with a long service life contain pure bromine in the bulb, but their cost is prohibitive. </p><p>  A halogen lamp works when electricity is supplied to the tungsten spiral.  The spiral heats up and emits light.  Operating temperatures rise and tungsten begins the evaporation process.  Metal atoms are deposited on the walls of the container, and atoms of bromine or other substances return the metal to its original state. </p><h2>  How is the lamp </h2><p>  Even a not very powerful halogen spotlight of <span>150 W</span> will allow for optimal distribution and angular concentration of light.  There is a lamp in the spotlight, as well as a special lens that concentrates the light in a certain direction.  Most modern models use Fresnel type lenses.  Additionally, outdoor floodlights are protected against dust and moisture. </p><h2>  The benefits of halogen lighting </h2><p>  These lamps emit beautiful light that can be either soft or diffused or, conversely, hard.  The halogen lamp has a more saturated light, and bright light can be adjusted. </p><p>  Spotlights on halogen lamps are very durable, and the <span>luminous flux is</span> constant for the entire time of use.  These products can withstand even severe surges.  Lamps for projectors are small in size, which saves energy.  Such devices are reliable in any climatic zone. </p>

    <p>  The searchlight device allows you to adjust any angle of lighting.  Powerful lighting equipment does not require special starting equipment.  Also, a spotlight with a motion sensor for the street will help save energy. </p><h2>  Types of Halogen Spotlights </h2><p>  Lamps vary in color.  So, there are transparent and matte.  If we talk about the structure of the lamp, they distinguish between linear, with an external bulb, with a reflector and capsule type lamps. </p><h2>  Spotlight with motion sensor for the street </h2><p>  This is the same halogen spotlight, but it is additionally equipped with a sensor that responds to movement.  The lighting device will light up at the moment when the sensor detects movement in a certain area.  This is a very economical device. </p><p>  The device is a one-piece product, and installing and connecting it is very simple.  Installation of the device is carried out by means of a special bracket, which has an element for mounting.  The device is beaten with standard dowel nails into already created holes. </p><p>  Connecting this equipment to the network is also very simple.  The output wires are three cores.  One of them is yellow or green, the other is black, the third is blue.  There are options, but the ground wire is always yellow or red.  To connect, you need other wires that connect to zero and phase. </p><p>  It is advisable to install the device through a switch.  The sensor can work even on small pets, which can sometimes cause inconvenience. </p><h2>  Purchase </h2><p>  How to choose a halogen spotlight?  Before making such a purchase, you need to pay attention to several important nuances.  If you need to get a light similar to sunlight, then recommend a device with a transparent lamp.  Matte lamps give out a white color with a bluish tint. </p><p>  For external mounting, a device equipped with a motion sensor is recommended.  When choosing, the number of luminous flux is important - choose according to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãillumination.  The very bright light that a 500 W halogen floodlight gives is not appropriate in all situations. </p>

    <p>  It is important to carefully consider the case of the device.  It is recommended to carefully study the body, the glass part of the bulb, the quantity, and also the quality of the reflectors.  These devices are made of aluminum, so they will not overheat - you should purchase just such devices.  Tempered glass lamps withstand even severe mechanical stress. </p><h2>  Cost and Manufacturers </h2><p>  These lighting devices are produced all over the world and even in our country.  At the same time, it is not recommended to buy Chinese halogen floodlights, their price is affordable (up to 700 rubles), but the quality is frankly low.  But in China there are worthy manufacturers.  More high-quality devices are produced by Philips, Galad and other well-known brands.  The price for them is from 2 thousand rubles. </p>
