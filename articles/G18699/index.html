It is a part of women's clothing, it looks like a cylinder in which hands are hidden during the cold. </p><h2>  Coupling History </h2><p>  We associate this product with past centuries.  How often do we look at paintings that depict ladies hiding their hands in couplings. </p><p>  Apparently, the hand clutch was invented in Italy.  It is not very cold here, but here they know a lot about luxury; it is not for nothing that the famous <span>Venetian carnival</span> appeared in this country <span>.</span> </p><p>  The famous painter Titian painted his paintings, depicting languid ladies with sable fur couplings on them, and his brother Cesare Vecellio said the following about them: ‚ÄúVenetians are charming: in summer they wear beautiful gloves, and in winter - couplings‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hand clutch" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/687956.jpg" width="344"></div>

    <p>  Sewing the sleeve into the hands was then a tricky business.  It was necessary not only to pick up beautiful materials, such as, for example, swan fluff, but also to decorate it with gold buttons, as well as crystal jewelry. </p><h2>  Coupling as a decoration of the nobility </h2><p>  An accessory such as a clutch on his hand soon became a piece of jewelry for the English queen.  Her clutch was made of silver brocade, it was embroidered with gold and pearls, on it were patterns depicting birds, trees and forests, on it were beautiful buttons. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This product could replace a <span>handbag.</span>  There were many pockets in it, inside of which one could put various ladies' little things, such as powder, perfume, a mirror, lipstick and so on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hand clutch pattern" class="if" height="473" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/687954.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <p>  And there was also a tradition of aromatizing the coupling.  Noble ladies added flavor to the clutch, which made them unique.  Couplings everywhere were worn by men who dressed in rather feminine clothes in the 17th century.  This product becomes an integral part of the court toilet, which cannot do without a clutch. </p><p>  In the 18th century, the clutch on the arm becomes impractical.  At the court, it is small, made of expensive materials and decorated with expensive jewelry, but it does not warm your hands.  Then the couplings were made of satin, and decorated with fur. </p><p>  In the 19th century, couplings were also popular, and there were a variety of models.  There was still a fashion to wear small dogs in couplings.  Men at that time wore warm clutches in which it was possible to hide a bandoleer for hunting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sew hand clutch" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/687953.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the 20th century, people did not have time for couplings; they spun in a whirlwind of events.  But at the same time, women again sought to be elegant, and these wardrobe items began to appear.  Leading world fashion designers began to introduce them into their collections. </p><h2>  Hand clutch now </h2><p>  She was forgotten for a long time, but recently she has become popular again.  The hand clutch is especially convenient for those who walk with a child in cold weather.  As a rule, inside such a product there is warm fur and a layer of <span>artificial fluff.</span>  This clutch can be worn on the handle of the stroller, and it will help you warm your hands in cold weather.  But it can also be used to put on a car seat, to lay on a sled or on a stroller. </p><h2>  What are hand couplings </h2><p>  These products in their form are fused and separate.  Hartan (a clutch for hands) is most often one-piece, and it is suitable for a stroller with a single handle.  There is a manual clutch separate, it looks like mittens.

Suitable for strollers with separate handles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fur clutch for hands" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/687951.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The pattern is done this way: first, from paper or from film, we make a part measuring 45 by 45 centimeters.  We also cut out a pocket measuring 28 by 11 centimeters, a pocket valve measuring 11 by 10 centimeters, a small pocket strap. </p><h2>  How to sew a hand clutch, preparation </h2><p>  If you are interested in how to sew a sleeve on a hand, then this is not difficult.

The scissors you use must have sharp blades so you can cut a flat ribbon with them.  Also, if you want to sew a sleeve for your hands, you need to have threads and a needle.  You can use a sewing machine, but for sewing the coupling you will need to purchase a special needle for the sewing machine.  This needle will sew fur, and you can purchase it in special hardware stores. </p><h2>  Sewing workshop </h2><p>  If you like the clutch for hands, then the pattern for it is done in a matter of minutes.  You just need to cut a rectangle of the right size out of paper.  Then this rectangle is applied to the faux fur, and a similar one is cut out of this material.

    <p>  Now the faux fur is fastened with a synthetic winterizer on a sewing machine.  One side remains uncrosslinked.  We take a long ribbon and sew it to the edges of the coupling.  It will be fastened at your waist, and you can always carry the sleeve with you.  It can be decorated with rhinestones, feathers, artificial flowers.  You can attach pockets to it in which you can store such necessary trifles as lipstick, perfume, cosmetic bag, wallet and even a mobile phone. </p><h2>  How to knit a hand clutch with knitting needles </h2><p>  If you have some knitting skills, then you may have a knitted clutch for hands.  In winter, it will serve as an excellent adaptation for riding a stroller, especially if the stroller has an iron handle. </p><p>  The coupling is so well knitted.  For work, you will need threads, about three hundred grams, and knitting needles that are thicker than thread.  It is not necessary to take new threads, you can dissolve old things.  The children's hand clutch is well knitted with knitting needles made of yarn, which is half wool and half acrylic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hand clutch teutonia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/687941.jpg" width="389"></div>
