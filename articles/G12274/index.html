    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Guests note the following flaws in the Aniva Hotel: </p><ul><li>  if for some reason you have to leave the hotel ahead of time, then the staff will do everything to not return the funds for an unused day; </li><li>  It may come as a surprise to you that there are no cosmetic accessories in the bathroom, so take them with you (the nearest store is not so close); </li><li>  if you require replacing bed linen before the due date, then you will have to pay extra for this; </li><li>  When booking a room through special resources, you cannot be sure that your application has been accepted and you will be settled there (it is better to order directly); </li><li>  despite the fact that wireless Internet is declared in the list of services, we can say that it is practically absent, since the speed and quality are almost at zero; </li><li>  breakfast starts at 9:00, which is very late, because at this time many people go for walks and excursions; </li><li>  despite the fact that the TV is connected to a satellite dish, it broadcasts only 2-3 channels (all the others are very "snowy"); </li><li>  if you order a banquet, you may find that the quality and quantity of dishes does not match the price that you paid, and therefore require that every item be written in the check for which you are charged. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The city of Noginsk attracts residents of Moscow and other cities with its beautiful nature and clean forest air.  Hotel "Aniva" invites you to have a good time in comfortable rooms.  This institution has a very beautiful territory, which also includes a large picturesque lake.  Guests have access to fishing and barbecue facilities.  The main advantage of the hotel is its silence (both on the territory and inside).  But not without flaws.  So, the organization of work of employees leaves much to be desired.  It is also worth redecorating the apartments.  Nevertheless, if you like a relaxing holiday, then you are advised to rent a room at the Aniva Hotel. </p>
