    <h2>  History of the town of Radomyshl </h2><p>  Since ancient times, these fertile lands have been inhabited by people.  The location was strategic.  It is believed that it was here that Olga was camped, who went to punish the Drevlyans for the murder of her husband.  Later, trade routes passed through these lands, along which goods from Kiev passed through 8 countries to the distant <span>Iberian Peninsula.</span>  But in the first mentions in the <span>Ipatiev Chronicle,</span> which date back to 1150 and in which Radomyshl is found, the castle has not yet appeared.  In those days, it was called Mychesky, probably because the Myka River flowed through it.  Downstream, it flows into the Dnieper. </p>

    <h2>  Paper factory </h2><p>  The Kiev-Pechersk Lavra built a paper mill in Radomysl (which it was called in the 16th ‚Äì 17th centuries) - Papyrus.  Since that time, the inhabited place has become fortified.  Radomyshl passed from the Orthodox Church to the Catholic.  In the XVIII ‚Äì XIX centuries there was an intensive development of the town.  A brewery is being built, schools, a theater, a post office, a telegraph, roads, bridges are appearing.  And the old Papyrus is destroyed.  In its place there is a mill.  But she will not live long.  Under Soviet rule, flour mills will grow everywhere.  From Papyrni will remain only powerful walls.  In the 90s, all the republics of the USSR were in decline.  Radomyshl was no exception.  The population of a not so big city began to leave to work in big cities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rebirth </h2><p>  Who would have imagined that it would become the historical and cultural center of Radomyshl!  The castle, built on the remains of Papyrni, which stands on a granite rock, attracts tourists here and becomes the spiritual center of the country. </p><h2>  The asceticism of Olga Bogomolets </h2><p>  The doctor and deputy, poet and singer, philanthropist and collector - this is Olga Bogomolets.  She created the castle Radomysl.  The beginning was laid by a fragment of the icon trampled into the dirt, on which only eyes were preserved. </p>

    <p>  Continued the flea market meeting.  Rummaging in a pile of rags, Olga discovered a small tablet with the image of a saint.  She asked the seller about her and found out that this was the home of the children's saint Ustinian, who was prayed that he would give the children a reason.  From this began the fascination with icons painted in Ukraine.  They differ from the strictly Byzantine canon in that their faces are bright, radiate love and joy. </p><p>  Twenty years later, when the collection began to be five thousand units, Olga needed not just a place to store them, but a museum where everyone could examine them in detail. </p><h2>  "New house" </h2><p>  The remnants of the old mill in Radomyshl in 2007 were sold cheaper than a car.  Olga Bogomolets accidentally came across this announcement and went to inspect them.  There were no cracks in the walls, just as there was no roof.  But there were mountains of garbage.  But still it was exactly what was needed.  Rubbish was raked in 3 months.  And the repair began.  There was no plan, no estimate.  When there was money - they put up a roof, there was no money - the repair stopped.  Nobody helped Olga financially.  So, windows were gradually inserted, heating was carried out, the refectory was equipped (the old stove was removed and the modern one was installed).  We built and decorated guest rooms, each of which housed a small museum.  So year after year the castle Radomysl grew. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  She and her husband traveled to Europe, and all unanimously said that this is a one-of-a-kind museum, which has no analogues.  It‚Äôs only the roads.  It's easy to say - pave the way.  Suddenly the state helped.  After all, tourists were drawn to a small town with a population of 13 thousand inhabitants.  From 2012 to 2016, they were visited by more than one hundred thousand! </p><h2>  Pearl edge </h2><p>  Radomysl Castle is unique in many ways.  Firstly, it stands on a rock created by nature during the Paleolithic.  He has no other foundation.  He is surrounded by water.  Secondly, it is huge.  Its area is 2.5 thousand square meters.  m. Thirdly, no matter which side you look at, it looks different from all sides.  And last, a tower (35 m) with a bell of eight floors connects three wings.  The spiral staircase of the tower has 138 steps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle radomys reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1392868.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  There has even already been a legend that if a person manages to climb the tower without stopping, he will look from the observation deck on the heart-shaped island of Love, and will ring with a bell tongue, then his desire will come true.  Pure love and a strong family life will come. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  In the halls of the museum </h2><p>  Entering the museum, you immediately feel a special, medieval aura.  Through thick walls street noise and din do not penetrate.  You should not rush into it.  You can walk around the halls for a long time, and then reinforce your exhausted strength in the refectory.  Since we have already mentioned it, we will say a few words. </p>

    <p>  In an old refectory over an open fire, water boils in a 60-liter boiler.  The food is cooked in a large modern stove, which can serve as a fireplace.  The walls are decorated with copies of ancient maps of Ukraine, Europe and Asia.  From the kitchen, we begin to explore the Radomysl castle.  Description of the main halls will be given below. </p><h2>  Concert, Fireplace, or Mikhailovsky Hall </h2><p>  There is a stage in the corner, next to it is a piano and a guitar, a fireplace with a sculpture of the Archangel Michael.  Quietly playing music.  The hall, one of the best in Europe, seats 150 listeners.  Its height is six meters.  Walls of raw stone tell us that we are in an ancient building.  Through them, water enters the room.  Her <span>living springs</span> come from rock.  Not chairs, but benches are intended for the attentive listener who will not be distracted. </p>

    <p>  It can be iconostases several meters high and very tiny images, arks and folding.  Once they were all thrown away, but a miracle saved them, and they returned to the people.  An exceptional and unique exhibit is the icon of Nicholas the Miracle Worker of the 12th century, made on stone.  Tens of thousands of people carefully applied to her and transferred their prayed energy.  In all seasons, the stone is not cold, it is warm.  The image of the saint preserves mercy and faith in the people. </p><h2>  Cigarette </h2><p>  You can not miss this dark room with antiques, which began the history of the museum.  Only lamps dimly illuminate the room.  Radomisl Castle revived the paper-making process that existed centuries ago.  Paper is made from nettle, flax and hemp.  The technology is complex, but the paper is durable and strong.  A watermark is applied to it.  Such a leaf can become a <span>family heirloom,</span> especially if the newlyweds make it with their own hands. </p>

In the open air, young people are waiting for fireworks, carriages, live pigeons and various games, for example, the search for the ‚Äúgolden iron‚Äù.  It is from it that a spiral staircase goes up.  And in the concert hall, a spring beats at the piano and occasionally the frog Gertrude appears.  To the one who sees her, luck will certainly come. </p><h2>  Hotel VIA REGIA </h2><p>  If someone decides to spend several days in the castle, then it offers comfortable rooms with beautiful views of the park and the river.  Complete solitude, crackling firewood in the fireplace, peace and quiet will restore strength and harmony.  And the sounds of the waterfall will give vitality and energy.  The hotel complex has six double rooms.  Two of them are in the tower.  From their windows all four cardinal points are visible.  Truly, these are rooms for princesses. </p><h2>  A park </h2><p>  A beautiful landscape park surrounds the castle Radomysl.  Radomyshl is proud of him along with the castle.  So that everyone could admire the man-made beauty, tens of tons of garbage were taken out of here.  Then the lowlands drained, brought the earth, raised it above the water level.  The islands are connected by bridges.  Now everything here unites man and nature.  Two natural waterfalls fill the air with coolness, and conifers with essential oils.  Breathed in him deeply. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle museum radomysl" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1392875.jpg" width="600"></div>
