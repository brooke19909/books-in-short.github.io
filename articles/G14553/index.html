  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY paper rocket</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A do-it-yourself paper rocket can be created in a simple way. </p><p>  Before you start making a rocket model, you need to determine the scale of the model. </p><p>  It should be noted that real rockets have certain proportions (the ratio of the diameter of the rocket to its length) or elongation, which must or is preferably observed. </p><p>  The accepted elongation ratio corresponds to a gap of 1:10 to 1:20, i.e.  the length of the rocket should be no less than 10 times its diameter, but not more than 20 times. </p><p>  This ratio is dictated by the requirements of aerodynamics and maximum energy armament of the rocket. </p><p>  Next, to make your own paper, you need to prepare everything you need. </p><p>  A do-it-yourself paper rocket can be created for a model that will be carefully stored on a shelf and not be subjected to stress. </p><p>  In other words, a do-it-yourself paper rocket will not be durable for gaming purposes or frequent shipments. </p><p>  So ‚Ä¶ </p><p>  1. Prepare a cylinder from any material on which paper will be wound. </p><p>  You can do without a cylinder and roll the cylinder from the Whatman hands in the air.  But, it will not have the exact shape and size of the diameter. </p><p>  The material of the cylinder can be anything from wood to plastic and metal. </p><p>  The cylinder size, diameter and length will depend on the rocket ratio you select. </p><p>  For example, if an elongation ratio of 1:10 is selected, then with a model diameter of 5 cm, its length will be 50 cm. If an elongation ratio of 1:15 is chosen, then with a model diameter of 5 cm, its length will be 75 cm. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Those.  with one diameter selected, for example 5 cm, the length of the rocket model can vary from 50 cm to 100 cm. </p><p>  With a different diameter, the lengths will be different, according to the selected elongation. </p><p>  Aesthetically, an elongation ratio of 1:10 is more attractive.  And the paper model will be stronger. </p><p>  It is advisable to review the selected model parameters (diameter and length) based on what size cylinder is available for operation. </p><p>  2. Prepare a Whatman paper sheet of the appropriate size. </p><p>  It is advisable to revise the selected model parameters (length) based on what size whatman paper is available for work. </p><p>  3. Prepare the glue.  It is better to use PVA brand glue. </p><p>  4. Prepare a piece of foam for the rocket fairing, (you can make a cone out of paper). </p><p>  5. Prepare paints or colored paper to cover the model. </p><p>  6. Prepare a pair of scissors, a blade or a sharp knife. </p><p>  7. Prepare the material for the model stand (foam or cardboard). </p><p>  From the description of the preparation, it is already obvious how to make a rocket model with your own hands. </p><p>  The cylinder is used to make the rocket body, which is created by winding whatman paper on it. </p><p>  After the first turn of whatman paper it is necessary to smear glue along the entire length of the first "overlap" of turns.  This will prevent the appearance of the spring effect and the unfolding stresses in the turns of the Whatman paper. </p><p>  After winding the Whatman paper, the edge of the sheet adheres to the ‚Äúbody‚Äù of the wound cylinder. </p><p>  After the glue dries, the cylinder is removed from the shell obtained from the Whatman sheet wrapped around it.  The body of <span>the rocket model is</span> ready. </p><p>  The rocket fairing can be cut out with a blade or a retractable office knife made of polystyrene foam and glued to the cylinder from a Whatman paper by inserting one of the ends into the hole. </p><p>  The same can be done from paper, which will be somewhat more complicated, because  To glue the cone, you need to make a cutting drawing.  The drawing of the cone should take into account the "skirt", which serves to "fit" the cone into the cylinder and glue it. </p><p>  The bottom of the model should also be closed.  This can be done from polystyrene by cutting out the desired size for the plug.  If the plug is made of paper, then it is necessary to make a cutting drawing in the same way as in the case with a fairing. </p><p>  Additionally, you can make a stand for the model of foam. </p><p>  The same can be done from paper.  Then for the model stand you need to take a tight piece of cardboard. </p><p>  The external design of the model can be given with the help of stickers from colored paper or painted with paints. </p><p>  Each rocket must have a designation and it must be applied to the model.  After that, a do-it-yourself paper rocket can be considered a complete model. </p>
