  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung smartphone with a good camera: rating, review of the best, specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Digital cameras of the middle hand or in the common people ‚Äúsoap dishes‚Äù have lost their position to modern smartphones.  The latter can offer similar capabilities, and the cameras of some models have come close in effectiveness to premium segment photo gadgets. </p><p>  One of the main suppliers of quality smartphones is the South Korean company Samsung.  Convenient, productive and pretty (for the most part) devices come out under this brand.  The brand pays special attention to the photographic part of its gadgets. </p><p>  We‚Äôll try to find out which Samsung smartphone has the best camera, taking into account the opinions of specialists in this field and the responses of ordinary users.  In parallel, we consider other notable characteristics of each model.  For a clearer picture, the devices will be presented in the form of a rating. </p><p>  Samsung smartphone rating with a good camera: </p><ol><li>  Galaxy A9. </li><li>  Galaxy A8. </li><li>  Galaxy A6 +. </li><li>  Galaxy J8. </li><li>  Galaxy A7. </li><li>  Galaxy A6. </li></ol><p>  We analyze the characteristics of each model in more detail. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy A9 </h2><p>  This is the new Samsung smartphone with a good camera from the premium segment.  Rear combined optics received matrices of 24 + 5 + 10 + 8 megapixels.  Such a quartet will digest any environment in the best possible way.  The quality of the images at the output is quite comparable with similar professional equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uae.souq.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Galaxy A9" class="if uuid-3247200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3247200.jpg"></div><p>  The 24MP front camera also distinguished itself.  Regardless of the time of day or the weather outside, your selfies will be perfect - rich and detailed.  Local software will facilitate the implementation of your photo endeavors by offering a wide selection of different tools and all kinds of effects. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.anandtech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Galaxy A9 Camera" class="if uuid-3247205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3247205.jpg"></div><p>  The chipset set is impressive.  The gadget received a powerful processor for 8 cores of the 660 series and the same high-performance video chip "Adreno 512".  6 GB of RAM is enough to solve any problems.  To store user data, a smart 128 GB internal drive is used. </p><p>  The visual part fell on the shoulders of a 6.3-inch display with an advanced Full HD-matrix (2280 x 1080 pixels).  There are no problems with autonomy.  The 3800 mAh battery lasts for a long time even despite such a powerful set of chipsets. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy A8 </h2><p>  The device appeared last year and immediately took a leading position in various tops and ratings, including the ‚ÄúBest Camera 2018‚Äù.  The Samsung Galaxy A8 series smartphone boasts not only high-quality shooting, but also a high-performance ‚Äústuffing‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lelong.com.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Galaxy A8" class="if uuid-3247199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3247199.jpg"></div><p>  The smartphone camera received an excellent 16 megapixel matrix.  The output pictures are of exceptional quality, regardless of the time of day or weather conditions.  The manufacturer managed to completely get rid of the specific soap, which almost all owners of mobile gadgets complain about. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the video, this Samsung Galaxy smartphone with a good camera calmly shoots a row in a 1080p scan at a stable 30 frames per second.  Selfie lovers will not be disappointed either.  A double front peephole with a 16/8 megapixel matrix offers not only high-quality shooting, but also the maximum viewing angle possible for such a technique. </p><h2>  Smartphone Features </h2><p>  For the performance of the gadget meet the 8-core proprietary processor, 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal.  Such a "filling" will digest any, even the most "difficult" modern application.  The visual part fell on the shoulders of a 5.6-inch screen with a scan of 2220 by 1080 pixels. </p><p>  With the autonomy of the gadget there are no problems, even despite the powerful set of chipsets.  This Samsung smartphone with a good camera and battery will calmly last a couple of days in mixed mode.  For those who like to watch high-resolution video, play serious games and somehow put the battery in, fast charging is provided. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy A6 + </h2><p>  This is a relatively inexpensive Samsung smartphone with a good camera from the mid-budget segment.  Despite the quite affordable price, the device boasts premium-level matrices.  Of course, the manufacturer had to save on other components, but the cameras were a success. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Galaxy A6 +" class="if uuid-3247201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3247201.jpg"></div><p>  The main, or rather, the main paired cameras on the back received a matrix of 16 and 5 megapixels with an aperture of f / 1.7.  Their capabilities are impressive.  The Samsung smartphone with a good camera allows you to take detailed and rich photos, and local software intelligently apply all kinds of effects, like ‚Äúsoap‚Äù in the background. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The matrix of the frontal eye received a good flash and a 24 megapixel matrix.  Pictures are excellent, and without regard to the conditions overboard: day, night, snow or rain.  The flash does not flash and works practical on a professional level. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  We were pleased with other characteristics of this Samsung smartphone with a good camera.  Here we have a processor quite fast for its price segment, 3 GB RAM and 32 GB internal memory.  The video accelerator adequately pulls modern gaming applications at medium graphics settings.  The 6-inch ‚ÄúAmoled‚Äù -screen with Full HD-scan is responsible for the display. </p><p>  There is no problem with the autonomy of this Samsung smartphone with a good camera.  A capacious 3500 mAh battery provides at least a couple of days of work in mixed mode.  It is also worth noting the presence of the NFC module.  As a fly in the ointment here is a modest amount of internal memory and a case, like a magnet attracting dust with fingerprints. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy J8 </h2><p>  This is a budget Samsung smartphone with a good camera and a large 6-inch display.  The matrix of the screen received a spread of 1480 by 720 pixels, which is very good for a budget model.  On the rear side there are two twin cameras of 16 + 5 megapixels.  Nearby is an advanced flash with LEDs with high speed and autofocus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Galaxy J8" class="if uuid-3247204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3247204.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by user reviews, the pictures are very good, even if you take them in motion.  It is also worth noting that the camera behaves perfectly in the dark: no noise, artifacts and other unwanted elements. </p><p>  Pleased with the software.  The software fully reveals the capabilities of the camera, offering a wide selection of management tools and a chic set of effects for overlay.  The aperture value is f / 1.7.  The front camera of 16 megapixels showed itself in a similar way. </p><h2>  What will please the model </h2><p>  The gadget's performance is quite decent for its segment level.  The Snapdragon 450 series paired with the Adreno 506 video chip perfectly digest medium-sized gaming applications, but suffocate on heavy ones.  You have to reset the graphic settings to the minimum value.  In normal mode, the platform works flawlessly. </p><p>  There are no questions about autonomy either.  Due to the modest set of chipsets, the battery is quietly enough for a couple of days in mixed mode.  There are no critical flaws in the gadget.  Some users complain about the lack of a light sensor and easily soiled body, but these shortcomings are offset by the democratic cost of the device. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy A7 </h2><p>  The gadget from the mid-price segment received triple rear optics with a resolution of 24 + 5 + 8 megapixels.  The photos are quite decent and it's very difficult to find fault with them.  Thanks to an advanced flash, the camera takes high-quality pictures even in the dark and in bad weather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Galaxy A7" class="if uuid-3247202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3247202.jpg"></div><p>  Front optics are also pleasing.  The 24 megapixel matrix allows you to shoot excellent selfies both on a bright sunny day and at night.  The software also did not disappoint.  The abundance of various effects and presets will please picky users who are accustomed to adjust everything for themselves. </p><p>  The corporate ‚ÄúAmoled‚Äù 6-inch screen with an expansion of 2220 by 1080 pixels is responsible for the visual part.  The diagonal size allows you to comfortably view photos and video content.  Experienced users strongly recommend immediately to buy film in the store, because the local protection is prone to scratches. </p><h2>  Distinctive features </h2><p>  Smartphone performance at a high level.  The local set of chipsets allows you to run all games without exception, but on especially "heavy" applications, the graphics settings will have to be reset to average values.  In normal mode, the platform works flawlessly.  4 GB of RAM is enough for gluttonous software, and 64 GB of internal for storing user files.  If the latter is not enough, then it can easily be expanded using external media, up to 512 GB. </p><p>  The 3300 mAh non-removable battery keeps the smartphone for almost 20 hours in continuous talk mode.  Judging by user reviews, with a mixed scenario, the charge lasts for almost two days.  If you watch high-resolution video or run serious modern gaming applications, then the battery will sit in about four hours, which, in principle, is very good for the voracious Android platform. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy A6 </h2><p>  Another budget option that allows you to take great pictures.  The 16-megapixel rear camera with f / 1.7 aperture copes well with photography without regard to the time of day or the weather outside.  Frontal optics with a similar matrix also performed well. </p><div class="photo" data-original="saudi.souq.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Galaxy A6" class="if uuid-3247203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3247203.jpg"></div><p>  The software pleases with an abundance of various effects for the overlay and tools.  The 5.6-inch display with a matrix in the spread of 1480 by 720 pixels is responsible for displaying the picture.  The output image is juicy, and thanks to a good supply of contrast, it is also bright. </p><p>  The gadget can not be called high-performance, but an 8-core processor and 3 GB of RAM are enough to run gaming applications at medium or minimum settings.  To store user data, an internal 32 GB drive is provided.  The volume of the latter, of course, is small, but it can be expanded with external SD cards, up to 256 GB. </p><h2>  Cons of the model </h2><p>  Despite the modest set of chipsets and a decent battery (3000 mAh), the battery life leaves much to be desired.  The gadget hardly pulls the day in mixed mode.  If you properly load it with "heavy" toys or video in a Full HD scan, then the battery will run out in two hours. </p><p>  Also, users note the device is soiled and the case is prone to scratches.  A smartphone attracts dust and dirt to it, therefore it is better not to put it in a pocket with keys and other sharp objects.  The cover acts as a panacea, so the problem cannot be called so critical. </p>
