History and Modernity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the southernmost part of Russia, the Akhtynsky district is located.  This is a place with a rich history and magnificent nature.  The development of the region has its own characteristics.  Despite the high mountain location, the area was very attractive for people and almost never was completely deserted. </p><h2>  Early story </h2><p>  At the dawn of its history, the territory was part of the early feudal state of Lucks, which owned the lands of modern southern Dagestan and parts of Azerbaijan.  History has preserved only fragmentary information about this state entity.  Lucks can be called the ethnic kingdom of the Lezghins.  It is they who still mostly inhabit the Akhtyn region. </p><p>  Along the course of the middle Samur, a union of rural communities of Akhtypar formed.  "Ahty" - means "six" in translation from the Turkic dialect, "couple" - part, piece.  The union included 6 communities, hence the name. </p><p>  It can be assumed that the union of communities is a step backward, but in fact, such a leadership had a beneficial effect on the development of the Akhtyn region.  The Union successfully crushed smaller territories and villages.  Communities successfully united to jointly protect the territory from invaders. </p>

    <h2>  As part of Russia </h2><p>  Together with the entire territory of Dagestan, the Akhtynsky district became part of the Russian Federation.  In the same time period, many residents are resettled from highland settlements.  Previously, most of the population lived in villages located in remote places.  Highlands successfully hid from enemies.  Not knowing the exact location, it is difficult to find a remote village in the mountains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  With the beginning of the industrialization of the region, many villagers go to cities to earn money.  Sometimes entire settlements moved to the foot of the mountains, completely abandoning their homes.  Often a new place retained its former name.  As a result of this process, the ghost villages of the Akhtyn region appeared. </p>

    <h2>  Ghost villages </h2><p>  The appearance of ghost villages has become a characteristic feature of the entire <span>highland Dagestan.</span>  Resettlement was not always systematic and voluntary.  The party leadership wrongfully believed that in closed conditions it was impossible to develop normally, so activists forced residents to relocate. </p><p>  So many fruitful livestock farms were destroyed.  People lost their usual way of life.  In the new conditions, suitable meadows for cattle grazing were not always found, so many had a hard time. </p><p>  The villages in the mountains remained almost lifeless.  Some, despite everything, remained in their own home, not wanting to move, but there were only a few.  The villages have remained empty and are now mercilessly destroyed by natural forces.  These places need careful research while there is something to study. </p><p>  In Akhtynsky district, a program is currently underway for the resettlement of people.  There is little work in the city, and the revival of villages with subsistence or farming will serve as a good impetus for the development of the region. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Akhtyn fortress </h2><p>  The history of the Akhtyn region is rich in events.  The region became the southernmost point on the territory of Russia, and the southernmost fortress was built here.  Built in 1839, it became the first defensive line in the south.  The fortress has the shape of a pentagon, before it was surrounded by a moat and additional stone walls with a height of more than 4 meters and a width of more than 1 meter. </p><p>  The location was not very successful.  Hilly terrain interfered with the view and firing of the enemy from cannons.  The main battle was already at close approaches.  In the 1848 war with Imam Shamil, the fortress was repeatedly stormed.  Enemy forces captured almost the entire region, but the defensive walls still held, being completely surrounded. </p><p>  Today the Akhtyn fortress is recognized as a monument of history and culture.  Despite this, it is closed to visitors.  The main buildings are in disrepair, and there is no talk of restoration yet.  The monument is in danger of destruction and ultimate loss to history. </p>

    <h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Akhtynsky district has beautiful nature and climate.  Almost the entire area is covered with meadows, only occasionally there are copses.  Many mountain streams and streams create a beautiful picture. </p><p>  Near the village of Kurukal is a unique thermal hydrogen sulfide spring.  The mountainous area gives you a lot of crystal clear waterfalls, the most famous of which is Zrykhsky.  The admiration and delight is caused by the Midjah oak tree.  Numerous river valleys help to find harmony with the world and with oneself. </p>

    <p>  Akhtynsky district is the southernmost territory of Russia.  Here, the originality of the Lezghin culture, along with modern trends, has been partially preserved.  The mild climate and beautiful landscapes make this place perfect for relaxation, which is clearly demonstrated by the photos of the Akhtyn region.  The region has its own problems, including numerous abandoned villages, but all this can be overcome. </p>
