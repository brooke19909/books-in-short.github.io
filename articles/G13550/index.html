This is especially true for complex technical and hardware devices, which include smartphones.  And if disappointment in a cheap phone is not critical, then the purchase of an expensive model with possible malfunctions should be carefully thought out in advance.  But is it worth buying a used iPhone in principle, if there are similar risks?  The question is multi-layered and ambiguous, so it is necessary to disassemble it from different angles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Used Apple smartphones" class="if uuid-2891940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2891940.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparing to test an iPhone smartphone </h2><p>  A feature of preparing for the first acquaintance with any smartphone is the availability of a full arsenal for testing the device‚Äôs filling.  In the case of the iPhone, it is very important to prepare the following tools: </p><ul><li>  A laptop.  Not bad if iTunes is initially installed. </li><li>  Another smartphone that runs mobile Internet. </li><li>  Battery pack type PowerBank. </li><li>  Headphones. </li><li>  Active SIM card that can be used in modern smartphones. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, no highly specialized tools will be required, but even this simplest set will help with a high degree of probability to answer the question of whether to buy a used iPhone in a specific version.  Already at the inspection site, you should proceed step by step, checking the characteristics of the device in a separate order. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  External inspection of the device </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cultofmac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Buy a used iPhone" class="if uuid-2891938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2891938.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, the physical condition is evaluated.  The integrity of the case, the correctness of its geometry, the joints and the degree of wear are checked.  Even if you do not care about aesthetic properties, and there is a willingness to put up with minor defects in the form of chips, dents, and simply impact marks, it is important to understand that these may be harbingers of more serious internal problems.  So is it worth buying a used iPhone if there is minor damage on the case? </p><p>  Theoretically, the housing can be replaced, although this will require additional costs, which may become a legitimate reason for bargaining.  But, again, damage as evidence of a phone crash should be a serious motive for a deeper study of the insides of the device.  At this stage, from the point of view of checking the functionality, special attention should be paid to the screen.  Its sensor should respond to the slightest touch within the limits of sensitivity.  It is advisable to do such a check in the process of several games, which will make it possible to evaluate both the reaction and the performance of the coating on different parts of the screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bgr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to choose an iPhone?" class="if uuid-2891934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2891934.jpg"></div><h2>  Signs of difference from the original </h2><p>  You need to start authenticating an instance by reconciling the serial number.  In the smartphone itself, through the settings, go to the "About this device" section and write down the serial number.  He checks the information on the official website of the manufacturer.  Next, you can go to the design features.  So, in matters of whether it is worth buying a used iPhone-6, smartphone lovers are often confused by the fact that its body bends.  This is a completely normal property of this model, which just indicates the authenticity of the instance.  Another thing is that this is only one of the features of the original.  For example, in real iPhones, the battery, even at high load, is able to maintain its energy potential for 1.5-2 days. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The following small details will also tell about the authenticity of the device: </p><ul><li>  The back cover does not provide for removal - it can only be unscrewed with a special screwdriver. </li><li>  All technical and marking labels are displayed clearly and without errors. </li><li>  The iPhone manufacturer's signature, model number and certification mark must be present. </li><li>  <span>All iPhones</span> lack an external antenna. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.techspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SIM card for iPhone" class="if uuid-2891948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2891948.jpg"></div><p>  It is important to take into account the fact that up to the latest X modifications, all models supported the possibility of using only one SIM card at a time.  In other words, devices 7 and 8 in all versions, in principle, do not have two slots for SIM cards.  At the same time, they are the most popular today. </p><p>  But is it worth buying a used iPhone-7 if there is also a more technologically advanced eight on the secondary market and dual-SIM devices will appear soon?  With all the advantages of more recent models in the form of an improved processor, wireless charging and additional services, the Seven retains the basic set of the most successful Apple solutions.  As for the used version, it should be purchased at least because of a more attractive price relative to the new generations of the smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Verification of identification systems </h2><p>  Perhaps the most difficult and crucial part of testing any iPhone.  First of all, through iCloud settings and Find my phone function, AppleID and password field are checked.  This function must be disabled.  The next step is to test the operation of the lock through the Touch ID system. </p><p>  In this part, it should be noted that starting from version 6s, this protection option is implemented at a new level with support for the possibility of making purchases on the Internet from a Mac computer.  First, through the settings, set your own fingerprints, and then secure them with a password.  The device must be released from the lock immediately after being held across the sensor with a finger. </p><p>  Should I buy a used "iPhone-6s" if TouchID doesn‚Äôt work for it?  On the one hand, the refusal of such a purchase will be justified if the fingerprint sensor.  as such, matters as a practical function.  But if it is not necessary, then this malfunction can become only an additional reason for the discount.  Moreover, a significant discount, since the new user will not be limited to just replacing the sensor if you want to restore Touch ID.  It will be necessary to update the entire motherboard of the smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.quikset.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Check iPhone Identification Systems" class="if uuid-2891956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2891956.jpg"></div><h2>  Ping </h2><p>  Of course, you can not do without testing the basic capabilities of an iPhone as a phone.  Using your SIM card and a second smartphone, you should check the sending of messages and the quality of calls.  Audibility is tested both with headphones and without them - including with hands-free mode. </p><p>  At the same stage, it should be noted that a smartphone may have restrictions on the use of the services of certain operators.  The configurations can be different, both with system prohibitions for a specific instance, and with the device blacklisted. </p><p>  Is it worth buying an iPhone with your hands if it is blocked by one operator, for example?  Of course, this is a big drawback, as it limits future communication options.  But if there are alternative means of communication and if the operator who is open for use is satisfied, then this nuance can be reconciled.  Moreover, such a restriction will provide a significant reduction in the cost of the device. </p><h2>  Sensor Testing </h2><p>  Among the main sensitive detectors, wireless means (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi), accelerometer, GPS and Glonass are checked.  It is important to evaluate the correct operation of the sensors, since even in good condition they can function with failures, settings violations, etc. </p><p>  Should I buy a used iPhone with similar defects?  Much will depend on the degree of violations, but the problem is that many communication capabilities and ergonomics in general depend on such detectors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iphoneincanada.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Used iphone" class="if uuid-2891959" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2891959.jpg"></div><h2>  High load tests </h2><p>  It is necessary to check the operability of the device at peak load using resource-intensive applications.  Moreover, it is desirable to run diverse programs and functions that involve unrelated device modules.  Based on the test results, it is concluded whether to buy a used iPhone with specific performance indicators. </p><p>  It must be understood that this data cannot be drastically improved, therefore, the actual power with heating indices should be considered as constant.  The stopping sign from the purchase should be the incorrect behavior of the smartphone in conditions of high workload.  For example, arbitrary shutdown of applications or complete shutdown of the device. </p><h2>  Pros and cons of buying a used iPhone </h2><p>  If not the only, then the main reason for buying a used smartphone is the low price.  Thus, 50-70% can be saved, which makes many turn to the secondary equipment market.  But is it worth buying a used iPhone with your hands, given its external wear and tear and a certain ‚Äúmileage‚Äù of technical stuffing?  This is the nuances of this decision.  In any case, the resource of the device will be reduced, and in the coming months problems may be found that, in principle, cannot be detected during inspection. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="damaturu.adeex.com.ng" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Should I buy a used iPhone?" class="if uuid-2891963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2891963.jpg"></div><p>  Purchases of used equipment are often justified by the tasks that the future owner plans to solve.  If we are talking purely about utilitarian tasks, then it is quite possible to limit ourselves to early smartphone models, if their functionality and performance is enough.  Another thing, is it worth buying a used iPhone 7 and more recent versions on hand?  All the same, it concerns a premium brand whose product value is exclusive.  But even from this point of view, the question of financial feasibility, which remains relevant even when buying high-end fashion phones, is not going away. </p>
