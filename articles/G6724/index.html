    <p>  A phone with a walkie-talkie - the device is not so expensive.  Rather, the point here lies in demand.  Although it can be said that in previous years a principle called Push to Talk was used.  It is designed to operate in walkie-talkie mode, but only if there is a cellular signal.  But the phone with a walkie-talkie that would really work in the civilian range, for some reason, became a headache.  The scope of such devices is great, if you think about it.  The same fishing and hiking in the forest, sporting events, walks in the parks. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2>

But do not forget that it is only valid for open areas.  In urban environments with a high density of buildings and other elements, the distance will be reduced.  And still, a telephone with a walkie-talkie will have some advantages over a conventional device.  Today we will deal with the category of ‚Äúindestructible phones‚Äù, namely, let's talk about the Senseit P8 model.

    <p>  It is clear that ‚Äúindestructible phones‚Äù do not differ in particular indicators.  Not for that they were created to show off the transcendental technical characteristics.  But still, what does this telephone walkie-talkie have?  It has a screen with a diagonal of 2.4 inches.  At the same time, the <span>resolution of the</span> display is 320 by 240 pixels.  There is a camera.  Its resolution is 2 megapixels.  You can install two SIM cards, they must be of the usual format.  The lithium-ion battery has a capacity of 2,000 milliampere-hours.  The talk time is 12 hours.  The mass of the device is 180 grams. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Exterior </h2>

    <p>  <span>Rugged phones</span> with a walkie-talkie can simply be recognized by their appearance.  <span>Senseit P8 was</span> no exception to this rule.  The device is a design painted in black and yellow.  Overall dimensions are as follows: in height, the device reaches 132 millimeters, in width and thickness, respectively, 68 and 20 mm.  Height will automatically increase by 6.5 millimeters when integrating the antenna.  With such dimensions, the phone cannot be conveniently placed in the pocket of ordinary clothes.  However, in the ‚Äúwalk‚Äù he will not interfere. </p><h2>  Mounts </h2>

    <p>  This cell phone with a walkie-talkie is equipped with a special clip, which is located on the back of the device.  The clip mount is made of plastic.  Someone might think that this is a significant drawback, but tests have shown that it is reliable enough.  Accidentally, the phone cannot fly off the mount.  But if you need to remove it, then implement it as easy as shelling pears.  Before this, of course, it will be necessary to practice a bit and understand how to do it, but then it will be easy.  For clips in the case, the developers screwed the washer.  It has a considerable size.  In fact, the phone lies precisely on it.  If you put the device in your pocket, you can feel how the puck abuts.  For some, the clip is just an annoying hindrance, and people are not going to use it.  Well, in this case, you can remove the holder with a screwdriver.  And then the protruding parts disappear, and the body becomes smooth.  In this regard, the <span>Ginzzu walkie-talkie</span> will still be <span>better.</span> </p><h2>  Protection </h2>

    <p>  As stated at the beginning of the article, the mass of the device is 180 grams.  For many models, such parameters are standard.  The device is protected only by IP56 standard.  The device must not be heated in water.  Another thing is if he just fell into the water.  However, after this, it must be pulled out immediately.  It seems that problems should not arise with further work, but for some reason the manufacturer refrained from commenting.  This does not inspire confidence, to be honest. </p><h2>  Arrangement of elements </h2><p>  At the top end you can find the SOS button.  It can also be programmed to send <span>emergency calls</span> to a particular number.  The button has a tight stroke, just so you can‚Äôt press it.  Already good, since accidental pressure is excluded at the root.  On the left side there is a connector for connecting a MiniUSB cable.  There is also a charging port and, of course, a jack for a wired headset standard 3.5 mm.  On the opposite side are buttons designed to change the volume, as well as a walkie-talkie button. </p><h2>  Back part </h2><p>  This mobile phone with walkie-talkie is really replete with screws.  Take a look at least at the back cover.  It is attached to the surface using two corresponding elements.  By the way, the rotary screws can be opened with an ordinary coin.  The back cover is tight enough to the surface.  Removing it will not be as easy as it might seem.  Even after the screws are unscrewed, it should be poked by the recess.  Some object will be needed here, since it seems almost impossible to do this using just a finger. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  In general, it, of course, causes mixed feelings.  On the one hand, the manufacturer sacrificed the protection of the device, but added another battery.  When using a walkie-talkie, this is very important.  The radio itself consumes a considerable amount of charge.  But on the other hand, thanks to such a design, it will not be possible to quickly open the case.  And this is already a minus, because quickly changing the battery is not an option.  A clear plus is the lack of a protective grid near the speaker, since its volume automatically increases.  Thus, the phone is heard under any, even inappropriate conditions.  Moreover, this rule applies to voice calls, and directly to telephone conversations. </p><h2>  Conclusion and reviews </h2><p>  What do the buyers of this device say?  First of all, among the advantages of the device, they distinguish a very loud call.  It is simply impossible not to distinguish.  Even if real urban chaos reigns around.  Not bad and vibrating alert.  In general, the decision to abandon the protective mesh when planning the speaker went, as they say, only to the advantage.  Everything is fine with the connection, there are no complaints about this parameter.  Among the shortcomings was the inability to quickly replace the battery (hello to the unsuccessful design and its developers), a weak battery and a camera that you should not take pictures at all.  Although did we expect something different from the walkie-talkie?  The apparatus does not need the rest, we presented it completely.  The cost of the device is currently 7,500 rubles. </p>
