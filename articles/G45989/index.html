  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What can be made from beads - a miracle gift</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every year, gifts made by yourself are gaining more and more popularity.  What can be done from beads, fabric and other materials give the answer numerous books on needlework.  But perhaps the most versatile material for creating pleasant little things has become beads.  From small multi-colored beads you can build anything from a small keychain to a huge bouquet of beaded flowers. </p><p>  What can be made of beads if you have not enough skills and time, but you really want to create a nice gift.  The most common products are small reptile-shaped charms, it can be a crocodile, a snake, or something like that. </p><p>  How to weave crocodile beads, you ask, everything is quite simple here, even a beginner will cope with this task.  For work you will need beads (several shades of green and black), a strong thin thread or fishing line and scissors. </p><p>  First you need to take a long piece of fishing line and fold it in half.  Then tie any item to the middle to secure the fishing line.  You can start stringing beads on one end, thread the second end on the opposite side - this will be the first row. </p><p>  The second row consists of two beads.  In the third row, two black beads should be used - these will be the eyes.  In the following rows, two beads should be added to expand the body. </p><p>  Then you should take two beads of color from which you made the body and three (colors intended for the legs).  Beads must be put on alternately on one end of the fishing line, then thread the same end through the first two beads.  Also make another foot. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Following the paws, we will make the middle of the body of the crocodile.  In a row, this will be the sixth row.  You need to take two beads to match your body color and one other shade.  You need to attach them in the same way in the previous rows.  The seventh row will consist of four beads of different colors.  To make further rows as well, but decreasing one bead each. </p><p>  When the torso is ready, attach the hind legs.  They are manufactured according to the same principle that has already been described.  After that, you need to make a tail.  It can be of any length.  For example, you can take six beads.  They need to be arranged in a row, each of the beads must be fixed by pulling the ends of the fishing line from different sides.  When you get the desired length, tie a knot and cut the fishing line.  For reliability, you can fuse the ends of the fishing line with a match, but very carefully.  That's all your souvenir is ready. </p><p>  What else can be made from beads?  There are also many options, for example, you can make a bouquet of <span>roses from beads.</span>  We can learn a lot of techniques for creating <span>flowers from beads.</span>  Roses really make any size, color and shape. </p><p>  One of the most popular techniques for making flower petals is the French flower weaving technique.  Petals made in this way are very resistant and practically do not deform in the future.  For the manufacture of roses in this technique you will need beads or chopping, a thin but strong wire and pliers.  Ready-made petals must be carefully assembled into a bud, which should resemble a rose in shape, for this it is necessary to make petals of different shapes. </p><p>  Roses can also be made from glued petals.  To do this, you must initially make a blank using the papier-m√¢ch√© technique and then glue the bead threads in even stripes.  It is up to you to decide which method you would prefer.  To achieve the highest quality, you need to work on more than one flower, but the result will never fade.  The bouquet made is not recommended to be kept on the windowsill, since the beads do not respond very well to the sun's rays and can burn out or even crumble.  Therefore, for the manufacture of products you should choose high-quality beads. </p><p>  What can be made from beads for yourself, relatives and relatives, you choose.  It all depends on your skills, desires and fantasies. </p>
