The saddest thing is that they come to light already during operation and do not make themselves felt at first acquaintance.  An exception to this rule was the modification of the Minelab Safari.  Responses of owners who used the previous version indicate the preservation of external attributes and a radical change in the filling.  Moreover, the internal changes went exclusively to the benefit of the detector, which, however, can not be said about the price. </p>

    <h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The model continues the concept of the Quattro metal detector, showing an example of the successful disclosure of the potential of its platform.  Externally, the new version is distinguished only by the color scheme, which is quite justified, since the developers decided to leave the usual quite ergonomic control scheme.  As for the working properties, the functionality of the device, the processor was revised and the search capabilities in problematic conditions among garbage were improved. </p><p>  The fundamental difference between this unit and the previous model, which even an inexperienced seeker will feel, is the processing speed.  Both the new processor and the updated software ultimately reduced the response time to the signal, as well as increased the clarity of detection of the target object.  The expansion of the frequency range also affected a more efficient differentiation, which made it possible to distinguish between unwanted objects and the desired metal.  The type of soil cover in this case does not matter - in this regard, the apparatus is universal.  A more detailed review of the Minelab Safari metal detector will help to identify other differences from the previous generation, as well as demonstrate the new capabilities of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  There are two configuration packages.  The standard set, rather, is intended for experienced amateurs who do not plan to solve problems of increased complexity.  The extended package gives the model more solid search capabilities, without which sophisticated professionals can not do.  So, in the ‚Äústandard‚Äù, in addition to the structural parts of the device, the owner receives a box for batteries, an 11-inch coil, a protective coating, fasteners with washers for fixing the coil, instructions and a guarantee.  In addition to all of the above, the Minelab Safari metal detector in professional configuration is also provided with a 1600 mAh nickel-magnesium battery, a charger and RPG headphones for the 6.35 mm jack. </p><p>  As for the direct working qualities, the equipment does not change them - both packages offer identical devices.  That is, if desired, the user of the standard set can improve his device to the level of a professional, only by purchasing additional equipment.  Another thing is that the initial purchase of an extended package will cost less. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2>

    <p>  To search for different types of metal, there are four discrimination modes.  They allow you to direct the search directly to coins, jewelry, lead alloys and relics, as well as the detection of all metal objects without exception.  In direct access to the control panel there are buttons that allow you to include finds in the black list, provide switching between discrimination modes, and tune the device from electromagnetic noise.  By the way, the pinpoint mode is also provided in the device "Minelab Safari".  Owner reviews indicate the accuracy of its operation and the low coefficient of surface fixation of unsuitable objects.  This mode is designed for in-depth search in a specific area, which allows even before excavation to determine the value of a fixed object. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for the depth of detection, it depends on the size and location of the subject.  For example, as treasure hunters themselves note, small silver coins can be found at a depth of 15-30 cm. Metal helmets and objects of similar size are located at 80-100 cm. The maximum detection depth is about 200 cm, but this will most likely not be subject, and overall design. </p><h2>  Setting up the device to work </h2><p>  Begin tuning with sensitivity.  For large areas, close to maximum levels can be used to ensure wide coverage.  In specific areas with point search, the minimum sensitivity indicator is justified, but it is important to balance the noise.  Practice shows that the optimal solution for a universal search would be 15-20.  Next, a threshold tone is set - an audio indication that allows you to acoustically distinguish between types of metals.  In this part, one should start from the indicator 9-11, at the level of which even materials cut off by discrimination will be perceptible.  Further, depending on the success of the search, it will be possible to increase this value.  Then you can proceed to the detuning from interference, which will depend on the conditions in which the Minelab Safari metal detector is used.  Reviews in which owners recommend activating this function when the device is raised 30 cm from the surface are very common.  After 20 seconds, the device will be reconfigured and will work stably with minimal noise intrusion. </p>

    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The device turned out to be successful in functionality and basic working qualities, which is what users note.  Begin with depth of detection and modes.  Almost all reviews of the Minelab Safari metal detector indicate stable and high-precision operation at a level of up to 30 cm. At the same time, unlike analogues, this model has a small mass, correctly distributed throughout the structure. </p><p>  With regard to the modes, the possibility of their detailed correction is emphasized, as well as the reflection of the features of each search format and on auxiliary options.  For example, setting the search mode of all metals or separately coins automatically adjusts to the corresponding characteristics and sound indication of ‚ÄúMinelab Safari‚Äù.  Owner reviews indicate solid equipment.  Not every device of this class already in a standard package receives protective covers for the reel. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Criticism of the apparatus concerns the high cost (an average of 45-50 thousand rubles), certain ergonomic nuances and search capabilities at great depths.  The fact is that the device made a big technological and functional breakthrough, standing out noticeably against the background of the Quattro device.  This led to increased interest in Minelab Safari.  Reviews at the same time draw attention to the fact that it is necessary to compare the capabilities of this version with full-fledged professional models, since a cost of 50 thousand just raises the requirements to this level.  And the criterion for the quality of detection at great depths below 30-50 cm will not be in favor of the Safari. </p><h2>  Comparison with competitors </h2>

    <p>  First of all, many people compare the capabilities of the device with the Garrett AT PRO.  They have approximately similar search abilities, but vary in design.  "Garrett" is for the most part a one-piece device, moreover equipped with an ellipsoid coil.  As practice shows, it is precisely in comparison of these two coils that there is no difference - the round shape of the Minelab sensitive organ gives the same effect.  Although it is believed that the ellipse performs better in the conditions of separation of nearby objects.  Many are faced with the choice within the line - "Minelab Safari" or "Terra 705".  Owner reviews often point to the fact that the first model belongs to the professional ones and therefore placing the detectors in one row is inappropriate.  But if we compare precisely the real possibilities, then experienced searchers give preference to the Terra model, which, although it does not have a multi-frequency spectrum, but guarantees high accuracy in the basic ranges. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  The model is more suitable for users who are already familiar with previous versions of this family - with the same Quattro.  The concept of the series is quite original and will not disappoint those who are ready to put up with the individual operational nuances of the Minelab Safari.  Owner reviews, in addition to working qualities, also recommend that you familiarize yourself with the configuration of the control unit in more detail.  It has some features that distinguish it from most other models.  And do not forget that the weaknesses of the device are compensated by wide functionality and an optimized lightweight design, which is also important. </p>
