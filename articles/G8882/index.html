Overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Electronic cigarettes are increasing their popularity every day, because it is a worthy alternative to regular cigarettes.  Many go soaring in order to quit smoking, others simply because it is fashionable now.  But regardless of the purpose of purchasing an electronic cigarette, the best choice for any beginner in soaring will be eGo cigarettes.  One of the most popular representatives of electronic cigarettes of this type is a device called Eleaf iJust 2. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many watts in ijust 2" class="if" height="226" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60193/1976994.jpg" width="560"></div>  Before proceeding with an overview of this device, its technical characteristics, as well as the answer to the question of how many watts are in iJust 2, we briefly examine the principle of operation of Eleaf iJust 2, give a general description of the similar electronic cigarette formats.

    <h2>  How iJust 2 Works </h2><p>  Despite the great difference between different electronic cigarettes, they all have a common principle of operation.  Due to the fact that the essence of the device is the evaporation of liquid, each of them has an atomizer, inside of which the entire evaporation process takes place.  The second integral part of any such device is the battery pack, the purpose of which is also clear - to supply energy to the atomizer.  Speaking of an electronic cigarette, they mean having both of these parts together.  In most devices, the atomizer and the battery pack are separable and interchangeable, thanks to universal connectors (threads).  Both of these parts are considered basic, but, in addition to them, there are other elements necessary for convenient soaring. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Inside the atomizer there is an incandescent spiral, which is part of a replaceable evaporator.  The principle of temperature vaporization implies the presence of two necessary elements: an incandescent spiral and an impregnation material (wick).  In our case, the wick is made of pure cotton.  The mechanics of the atomizer are arranged so that the liquid charged into its tank, under the action of back pressure during tightening, impregnates the wick, and the spiral heats it, forming steam.  Steam generation is affected by a parameter such as the electrical power of the battery of the battery pack.  Power is measured in all electronic cigarettes, in iJust 2 including watts.  How many watts are required to achieve the desired evaporation depends on the specific situation.

    <p>  All electronic cigarettes, one way or another, are equipped with air vents for supplying air to the atomizer. </p><p>  In fact, with the help of such a device, any liquid can be turned into steam.  However, it is not so much liquid that is suitable for soaring, which acts as an alternative to smoking.  It should have throchitis (characteristic bitterness), give a lot of steam at low evaporation temperatures, it should have some taste and, if necessary, contain nicotine.  All of these properties can be achieved only by kneading together several special ingredients, and thus get a special liquid (liquid) for electronic cigarettes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  IJust 2 Electronic Cigarette Format </h2><p>  There are only three main types of devices: Mini, eGo and Box Mod. </p><p>  Electronic cigarette iJust 2 refers to the format of electronic cigarettes eGo.  Devices from this category are similar in size to ballpoint pens or large cigars.  They all use battery packs equipped with a smarter electronic circuit board than the Mini format.  The downside for both categories, including the Mini, is their maintenance free.  But in fact, this is a moot point.  Although officially no service devices repair such devices, Mini disposable electronic cigarettes, detachable Mini atomizers and eGo atomizers can be easily analyzed.  Therefore, on the Internet you can find a lot of articles and various videos on how to rewind maintenance-free atomizer databases of these formats. </p><p>  In flavoring and vaporization, eGo e-cigarettes are average among the three existing e-cigarette formats.  These parameters depend on the power of the device.  In our case, the taste transfer and vaporization are subordinate to how many watts the iJust 2 produces. </p><p>  Electronic cigarettes in eGo format are well suited for people who want to replace conventional cigarettes with a less harmful alternative, as well as for beginners in vaping.  Unlike Box Mod electronic cigarettes, eGo cigarettes without fail have an electronic board that protects the user and the battery from short circuits.  Among Box Mod cigarettes, devices without such protection are common and very popular.  In addition, the Box Mod format itself is intended for experienced users of electronic cigarettes who know what electrical resistance is, are able to handle unprotected batteries correctly, know how to make an incandescent spiral and a wick, and also properly configure the atomizer to the desired vaporization.  If the smoker needs simplicity in work and at the same time good steam, then he will not find a better option than eGo. </p><h2>  Description of iJust 2 </h2><p>  The manufacturer of iJust 2 is the company Eleaf, has long been recognized among lovers of electronic cigarettes.  The company manufactures Box Mod and eGo soaring devices.  After the great success of the iJust electronic cigarette, the company releases its new and improved version - iJust 2. As a bright representative of the eGo format, this device has all the characteristic features of this class of electronic cigarettes.  The most important feature of iJust 2 is its sabotnost (the ability to work with low resistance spirals, resistance is measured in ohms).  Due to this, iJust 2 can give a lot of steam when using.  To achieve this goal, Eleaf equipped the battery pack of the new device with a battery with a very good capacity of 2500 milliamps per hour (unit of capacity).  Such a charge will last for several hours of evaporation, even taking into account the factor of its subordination (spirals with low resistance require greater energy efficiency from batteries). </p><p>  The new iJust is also able to please a roomy 5.5 ml atomizer tank.  Even with a high intensity of use of an electronic cigarette for several hours, the tank will not run out of liquid. </p><p>  Replaceable iJust 2 evaporators have a 0.3 ohm coil resistance (sub).  You can also find these parts at 0.7 ohms.  The vaporization efficiency when using evaporators of different resistance depends on how many watts are currently in iJust 2.  As in the design of the atomizer of the previous version, this device has retained the convenience and simplicity of changing spirals. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to a special silicone ring that regulates the tightening force. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eleaf ijust 2 how many watts" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60193/1976998.jpg" width="600"></div>  Like any subwoofer atomizer, iJust 2 has large air vents to make it easy to tighten.  But if you wish, you can make it tighter, similar to a puff of an analog cigarette.  In order to improve the impregnation of the wick (the tighter the tightening, the stronger the effect of supplying liquid to the wick due to back pressure), you can use a silicone ring worn on the outside of the bottom of the atomizer base.

    <p>  The battery pack of this electronic cigarette is equipped with the common Passthrough function.  This means that you can charge the device without breaking away from soaring. </p><p>  Among the minuses can be noted the bottom refueling tank for sludge.  That is, to fill the slurry into the tank, you need to unscrew the atomizer from the battery pack, turn it over, unscrew the base, and only then pour the slurry into the tank.  Also a minus is that the glass part of the atomizer is inseparable from it.  If the glass breaks, you will have to replace the entire tank. </p><h2>  How many watts does iJust 2 produce? </h2><p>  The output power of iJust 2, unlike conventional iJust, is not fixed.  The developers decided not to equip the electronic board of this device with such a function, thereby realizing in it an interesting feature uncharacteristic for most electronic cigarettes in eGo format.  The power, and accordingly the vaporization, is directly proportional to the degree of discharge of the battery of the Eleaf iJust 2 battery.  Officially, the company determined the boundaries of power from 30 watts (with a discharged battery) to 80 watts (with a charged battery).  Mods without electronic boards (mechmodes) have the same feature.  In fact, this is a common property of any battery.  The stronger it is discharged, the less power it gives out.  The board of this device, although it does not fix the power, is not devoid of the usual necessary function of protection against short circuit.  The answer to the question of how many watts the Eleaf iJust 2 will produce the highest vaporization is obvious - at the maximum possible, that is 80 watts. </p><h2>  Description of iJust S </h2><p>  An advanced version of iJust 2 - S already exists on the market. How many watts this version gives out, you can understand, given that it retained the appearance and technical characteristics of the previous device.  The only and undoubtedly pleasant improvement in technical specifications was made only in the battery capacity, which was raised to 3000 milliamps.  Fixed the above disadvantages of iJust 2 - added the ability to top refuel without having to unscrew the atomizer from the battery pack, and the interchangeability of the glass part of the tank.  In terms of size, the iJust S is slightly shorter than the iJust 2, but slightly wider in diameter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ijust 2 s how many watts" class="if" height="489" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60193/1976997.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Description of iJust 2 Mini </h2><p>  There is another representative of this line - iJust 2 Mini.  How many watts in this device can also be understood without comment.  The battery underwent a change, the capacity of which was reduced to 1100 milliamps to obtain a shorter length of the entire device (115 mm).  Also iJust 2 Mini has a tank of small capacity - only 2 ml.  In all other respects, this version copies the original. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many watts in ijust 2 mini" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60193/1977000.jpg" width="346"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance, dimensions, weight and connector iJust 2 </h2><p>  This device belongs to the class of cylindrical electronic cigarettes.  Many classify it as a pipe mode, which is not true, since pipe modes (Pipe Mod) are devices in the form of a smoking pipe. </p><p>  The total length of iJust 2 is 168.5 mm.  The length of the battery pack is 81 mm, the atomizer is 67.5 mm, the drip type (mouthpiece) is 20 mm.  The diameter of the battery pack is 20 mm.  The weight of the entire electronic cigarette is 125.2 g. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many watts gives ijust 2" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60193/1976996.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The iJust 2 electronic cigarette has a universal connector 510. This means that its battery pack can be used with any other existing atomizers, and the atomizer itself can be screwed to any other battery pack. </p><p>  Now that we have reviewed the description of all versions of this electronic cigarette, their technical characteristics and how many watts gives iJust 2, we can begin to consider the configuration of the starter kit. </p><h2>  Options iJust 2 </h2><p>  The iJust 2 starter kit upon purchase includes: </p><ul><li>  battery pack; </li><li>  atomizer; </li><li>  replaceable evaporator; </li><li>  silicone ring; </li><li>  charging cable (USB); </li><li>  instruction; </li><li>  packaging. </li></ul><p>  All of the above comes in a single copy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many watts in ijust 2 kit" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60193/1976995.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <p>  All starter kits are indicated by the word ‚ÄúKit‚Äù (kit).  Each version of iJust 2 has its own starter kit - iJust 2 Mini Kit, iJust S Kit and iJust 2 Kit.  How many watts in a given set can be found directly on the package or in the instructions. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Despite the simplicity declared by the manufacturer and the absence of problems in steam with iJust 2, it is important to understand that the saturation of the wick with sludge during the active operation of the device has its own balance.  If the slurry penetrates the wick too well, then the atomization chamber of the atomizer will overflow, giving rise to the so-called ‚Äúsnot‚Äù.  The rate of evaporation of the slurry from the wick, in such a situation, is slower than the rate of saturation. </p><p>  There is a converse, more common problem - burning.  This is the same, just the opposite.  Replaceable wick has its own resource - approximately one week of use.  After this time, it is recommended to change it, because it will give cinder from natural aging.  If iJust 2 gives a cinder earlier than this time when the tank is full, you can try to achieve balance by increasing traction, that is, through the use of a silicone ring.  In cases where iJust 2 suddenly begins to produce mucus, it is necessary, on the contrary, to make the cravings freer. </p><p>  Despite the fact that officially iJust 2 evaporators are considered maintenance free, you can find various tips on how to rewind them yourself, without the need for their constant purchase.  Therefore, this electronic cigarette is worth trying for those who want to switch to electronic cigarettes, but do not want to constantly spend money on replaceable vaporizers. </p><p>  We hope that this article was useful in finding information about how many watts there are in iJust 2, as well as about other technical characteristics of this device. </p>
