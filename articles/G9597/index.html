Most likely the pond was given such a name, because at its bottom there are many stones that can be clearly seen even through the thickness of the water. </p><h2>  Description </h2>

    <p>  As mentioned above, Tashkent is a lake.  Chelyabinsk region is known for its lakes.  In total, over 3750 of these reservoirs are located on its territory!  But Tashkent is the deepest of all.  Its maximum depth reaches 35 meters.  The water in it is so clear and clean that even far from the coast at the bottom white stones are clearly visible. </p><p>  This pond has a rounded shape, its area is 1.2 km2.  It is filled due to atmospheric precipitation and underground sources. </p><p>  Lake Tashkent has a sandy bottom, only a small part (no more than 2% of the total area) is covered with stones, and in some places it is muddy due to the swamps approaching the shores. </p><p>  Swimming in the lake is dangerous, especially for children, because great depths begin immediately from the shore, which abruptly goes downhill with steep ledges.  There are several pits at the bottom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The water in Tashkent is freshwater, very clean and transparent, does not bloom.  It can be drunk even without prior purification and boiling. </p><p>  The shores are covered with mixed forest.  Powerful pines and white-birch birches grow here, alder approaches the very edge of the water.  But in the lake itself there is little vegetation. </p><h2>  Geographical coordinates.

    <p>  Not far from Tashkul there are 4 more lakes.  In 1.7 kilometers east lies Tatysh - a freshwater pond with very clean water, translated from Turkic its name means "quiet, affectionate."  Just 1 kilometer south lies the Semiskul lake.  1.5 kilometers to the north-west is the beautiful Itkul reservoir - a hydrological natural monument, a specially protected area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Chelyabinsk region. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Directly to Tashkul itself from the west is a small Terenkul lake.  Once these two reservoirs were connected by a channel, but today it is boggy. </p><h2>  Relaxation </h2>

    <p>  The picturesque lake of Tashkent has long been like a magnet, attracting vacationers, who are attracted not only by the cool, crystal-clear water and plenty of fish, but also by the clean air, peace and quiet around. </p><p>  Several guest houses were built on the shore.  But tourists prefer to relax "savages" - in tents.  A dirt road has been laid to the coast, so you can easily get here by car. </p><p>  Recently, the authorities "ennobled" this place: they installed pavilions on the shore, prepared bonfires with firewood for picnic and barbecue lovers, set up garbage cans, dry closets, and built bridges for fishermen.  The coast is regularly cleaned, therefore it is always very clean.  But you have to pay for comfort, and now rest on Lake Tashkent is paid. </p><p>  Despite this, there are many tourists.  All of them are attracted by the beautiful and clean Lake Tashkent.  Reviews about him are only positive.  Singles, romantic couples in love, youth companies, and families with children come.  Everyone finds here a place and occupation to their liking. </p><h2>  Fishing in the Chelyabinsk region in Tashkent </h2>

    <p>  Although there is little vegetation in the pond, it is very rich in fish (another mystery for biologists).  Pike and a chebak, zander are found here, large perch weighing up to 0.5 kilograms is caught!  Good pecking trout, whitefish and ripus. </p><p>  An interesting fact: in 2012, the employees of one of the companies in the city of Snezhinsk had the idea to breed valuable fish - sturgeon in the lake.  With their money they bought 200 thousand fry and 30 thousand adult fish, all of them were released into the reservoir.  Sturgeons took root in the new place perfectly, and already in the summer of 2013, the first specimens were caught by the most successful fishermen. </p><p>  In general, the catches here are very good.  They hunt fish from the shore, as well as rowing and motor boats.  Also, the lake of Tashkent was chosen by rakolovs.  Since the water in the pond is very clean, there are a lot of crayfish here, and it's easy to catch them. </p><p>  One small clarification: fishing in the Chelyabinsk region in Tashkent is paid.  At the same time, you will have to pay extra for the caught valuable fish - trout and sturgeon.  Fans of spearfishing will have to fork out extra. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The direct route Chelyabinsk-Yekaterinburg leads to Tashkul, but it passes through Voskresenskoye and Snezhinsk.  As you know, Snezhinsk is a closed territorial-administrative formation, therefore, passage through this settlement is possible only with a special pass.  It is clear that most tourists who are in a hurry to relax on the lake do not have such a pass.  Therefore, it is necessary to get to the reservoir in a roundabout way. </p><p>  How to get to the lake from Chelyabinsk: first you need to go through Argayash, Kyshtym, then pass Verkhny Ufaley.  You can go in the direction of Ekaterinburg to Tyubuk, at this settlement turn to Kasli.  Then move towards Upper Ufaley to Lake Ikul, which you need to go around from the north.  Having reached the village of Klyuchi, go straight to Tashkul. </p><p>  How to get to the lake from Yekaterinburg?  First you need to get to the city of Polevsky, then to the village of Poldnevoy, after passing by Lake Ikul, head to the village of Klyuchi.  A road leads from the village directly to the lake.  And you can get in a different way: first - to the Tubuk turn, from where through Kasli go directly to Tashkul. </p><p>  How to get to this lake from Ufa?  You need to go along the highway "Ufa-Chelyabinsk" to the city of Miass or Zlatoust.  From these settlements through Kyshtym and Verkhny Ufaley drive to <span>Lake Itkul,</span> and then Tashkent! </p><p>  The roads in the Chelyabinsk region are not bad, but in some places there are pits, which, however, are easily overcome by a car. </p>
