  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forensic Tactics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The subject of forensics includes the study of the laws governing the preparation, concealment and commission of a criminal act.  This science studies the occurrence and existence of traces of crime.  Within the framework of science, a special system is being developed, including special forensics, means and methods of forensic science, methods for assessing and investigating judicial evidence, which, in turn, are subsequently used in criminal proceedings, which include investigating, preventing, solving crimes. </p><p>  All science is divided into sections. </p><ol><li>  Theoretical basis. </li><li>  Equipment. </li><li>  Methodology </li><li>  Forensic tactics. </li></ol><p>  The fourth section is devoted to the study of the laws governing the investigation of traces of a criminal act within the framework of an investigation.  Forensic tactics include a set of techniques that allow you to most effectively apply the capabilities of a certain <span>investigative action,</span> based on the specific situation in the case. </p><p>  The section includes 2 parts - special and general. </p><p>  The first includes tactics for conducting specific investigative actions.  Such actions, in particular, include identification, interrogation, <span>investigative experiment,</span> confrontation, examination, etc. </p><p>  Forensic tactics is a section that reflects a system of scientific principles and planning recommendations based on them, as well as the organization of a judicial and preliminary investigation.  Along with this, a line of conduct is determined for persons conducting a judicial study of evidence, methods of conducting actions within the framework of the investigation aimed at collecting and studying evidence. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Forensic tactics in some cases are called investigative.  However, many experts note that the first definition most accurately reflects the content of this section.  This is mainly due to the fact that the scientific provisions of forensic tactics can be applied not only by investigators, but also by judges, prosecutors or employees of investigative bodies. </p><p>  The general part examines the concepts, content, essence of science.  In the same subsection, sources, the relationship with other sections of forensics and other branches of science are studied.  In the general part, the essence of the main categories of science is also considered.  This subsection explores the doctrine of criminal <span>investigation planning</span> and the forensic version. </p><p>  The formation of forensic tactics as a scientific industry in its modern form occurred as a result of research by scientists on expert, investigative, operational-search and judicial activities. </p><p>  Such scientists as Belkin, Vasiliev, Porubov, Karneeva, Bykhovsky, Luzgin and others took an active part in the development of fundamental concepts and practical recommendations. </p><p>  Being an independent section, forensic tactics, however, has a close relationship with other areas of science.  So, it uses various particular theories that are components of a general theory.  Along with this, when developing tactics for the implementation of a number of investigative actions, the specifics of using the means and methods of forensic technology is always taken into account.  In addition, the methods common for crimes to conduct actions within the framework of an investigation acquire special features in private methods. </p><p>  The <span>main tasks of forensic</span> tactics include: </p><ol><li>  Developing the most effective recommendations for planning and organizing investigations. </li><li>  The creation of methods for the preparation and production of actions within the framework of the investigation </li><li>  Improving the forms of interaction between investigators and operational apparatuses by employees of tax, <span>customs authorities</span> and others. </li><li>  Development of recommendations on the application of special knowledge in the implementation of investigative and judicial actions. </li></ol>
