Its walls were painted with sacred images, iconostases appeared, <span>church utensils were</span> purchased <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Trinity Cathedral of the city of Podolsk endured all the trials during the time of the atheism and resisted. </p>

Father Nikolai was not afraid to catch the infection, he first went to the homes of the sick and began to partake of them.  This action showed people that he is a true shepherd, zealous and true.  In those difficult days, an icon of the Mother of God of Jerusalem was brought from Bronnitsy.  Her image was surrounded by a procession around the city and the epidemic stopped.  For getting rid of the disease, a copy of the icon was purchased for the cathedral.  Prayers were held in front of her in memory of intercession during an illness. </p><p>  Since 1991, a Sunday school has been opened at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Podolsk.  This is one of the largest schools of the Moscow diocese, which is attended by more than two hundred pupils.  In it, every Christian can strengthen faith and also develop parish life. </p><h2>  Saints of the Cathedral </h2><p>  The Trinity Cathedral has its own shrines.
