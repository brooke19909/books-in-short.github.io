It is in this place that such masterpieces of world culture as the Chocolate Girl and the Sistine Madonna, as well as other unsurpassed canvases, are stored.  The ensemble of palaces (Zwinger) is a brilliant work of art made in the Baroque style.  This is one of the symbols of the village.  It is located in the center of the metropolis next to the embankment of Elba.  And first of all, Zwinger is known as the place where the Dresden Art Gallery is located.  This attraction belongs to those objects that need to be seen firsthand, because not a single story about them can be compared with real splendor and pomp. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zwinger in Dresden" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1583538.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Description and History </h2><p>  The Zwinger in Dresden consists of seven pavilions that are connected by a gallery, the ‚ÄúBathhouse of the Nymphs‚Äù fountain, a courtyard decorated with fountains and flower beds, and the Kronentor gate.  Strong, but over time, dark sandstone, a gilded crown on the gate and blue roofs make this attraction look like a fabulous palace.  Galleries are decorated with balustrades, sculptures and vases.  This all turns Zwinger into a single masterpiece of Baroque art.  In the middle of the building are several large museums, among which there is a gallery of Old Masters.  During the summer, an open-air courtyard organizes a series of events. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The incredibly beautiful palace and park complex Zwinger was erected on the territory of the fortification of the city, which played the role of the defensive structure of the Elector‚Äôs castle.  When there were peaceful times, the object was used for a variety of court festivities.  Zwinger appeared thanks to the efforts of Elector Augustus the Strong, architect M. D. Peppelman and sculptor B. Permozer.  During the years 1711-1728, many other masters and artists took part in the construction of the ensemble.  From the very beginning, it was planned to build a complex of greenhouses, in which was supposed to be a collection of the rarest plants of King Augustus the Strong.  But over the years, the project expanded slightly, as a result of which Zwinger turned into a large structure with a park.  It was not possible to complete the project until the end. </p><p>  In just a few years, the complex has become the epicenter of court celebrations, ceremonies, relaxation and life in general.  It was also the venue for the collection of the electors.  For example, since 1728, scientific and technical collections have been located here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dresden sights in one day" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1583539.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  XIX-XX centuries  in the history of the sights </h2><p>  The courtyard of the Zwinger until the 19th century from the side of the river was limited only by a small wall.  It was planned to break the park.  But in the 40s of the XIX century Semperbau was erected - the new museum building, the project of which was worked out by the court architect G. Semper.  The museum building turned Zwinger in Dresden into a closed ring. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Throughout the 18th-19th centuries, buildings were destroyed and rebuilt many times, wasting their historical appearance.  But in the 1920s, the great importance of baroque for the art of Europe was recognized, and therefore the Zwinger Palace in Dresden is being restored under the strict supervision of Hubert Ermisch.  The vast experience of such works allowed the architect and expert historians to restore the attraction in almost the same form in which it was created many years ago.  Today we have the opportunity to admire the object exactly as Germany saw it for the first time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palace and park complex zwinger" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1583540.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is in Zwinger </h2><p>  Zwinger in Dresden has the following buildings and museums: </p><ul><li>  The Gallery of Old Masters is the very Dresden art gallery, which is the most famous museum in the city.  This is where you can see the "Sistine Madonna" written by the immortal Raphael. </li><li>  Armory - one of the richest collections of tournament equipment and court parade weapons in the world is collected here. </li><li>  German Pavilion - together with the adjacent gallery, the object connects the pavilion with the chimes and the Semper Gallery building. </li><li>  Porcelain Collection - The Dresden Porcelain Collection consists of 20 thousand exhibits and is one of the most valuable ceramic collections on Earth. </li><li>  Pavilion with chimes - in 1933, a chronometer was installed at the construction of the Zwinger City Pavilion, into the mechanism of which four dozen bells made of <span>Meissen porcelain</span> were integrated <span>.</span> </li></ul><p>  These are far from all museums and monuments located on the territory of Zwinger.  It is quite difficult to describe them in one article, therefore it is best to see all this beauty live. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zwinger Palace in Dresden" class="if" height="439" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1583541.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The most outstanding objects of Zwinger </h2><p>  The Zwinger in Dresden, which we described in the article, is the most important attraction in the city.  And if you were lucky enough to get to this place, then you should definitely visit the Nymph Bath fountain.  It is located in the place where once behind the French pavilion was a fortification rampart.  This is one of the most beautiful fountains belonging to the Baroque era.  It was built according to the project of Balthazar Permozero.  There is a hole on top of the shaft from which water flows and falls into the pool in an artificially created waterfall.  Six statues of nymphs and a dolphin pouring water adorn the fountain on the southwestern side. </p><p>  No less interesting will be the gate of Kronentor or the gate-crown.  They are crowned by a dome, depicting the Polish crown, which is carried by four eagles.  This object was reconstructed after the Second World War. </p><h2>  One of the most beautiful theaters in the world </h2><p>  Very beautiful is Dresden.  Attractions in one day here you can see many.  So, in addition to Zwinger, it is worth visiting the Semper Opera House, which is one of the most beautiful theaters on the planet.  The opera house is really chic, and it is built in the neo-Renaissance style.  The object is located on the Theater Square of the village.  In niches around the perimeter of the sights are 16 figures of popular writers and literary heroes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zwinger in dresden description" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1583542.jpg" width="600"></div>
