Esports tournaments are held with huge prize pools, a lot of games are coming out, the budget of which is several times larger than the most popular Hollywood blockbusters.  Industry development has also significantly influenced the creation of new technologies.  A vivid example of this is portable game consoles.  What it is?  You will receive answers to questions by reading this article. </p><h2>  Portable gaming systems </h2><p>  Initially, only specialized electronic devices called a console were used for video games (in common people - a prefix).  They connected to the TV, they were rather bulky.  Soon, however, market trends and consumer desire changed.  So there were portable game consoles. </p><p>  How does a portable gaming system differ from a full-fledged console?  First of all, in size.  Portable game consoles (an overview of the most popular models you can find below) are very compact and mobile.  You can take them with you anywhere, because the portable console easily fits in your pocket.  How did you manage to achieve such compactness?  Everything is pretty simple.  As a rule, a screen, sound reproducing elements and a joystick are already built into portable game consoles.  But here the main problem of portable systems arises - power.  To make the device compact, you have to sacrifice the "stuffing".  Therefore, compared to classic consoles, portables are less productive. </p><h2>  The best portable game consoles </h2><p>  Sony and Nintendo are eternal competitors in the field of gaming technology.  Both companies have their own series of portable consoles.  It is about them that we will talk in this part of the article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  PSP is the brainchild of Sony, which was released on May 11, 2004.  The main advantages of this set-top box are a high-quality widescreen screen, the ability to connect to the Internet, the presence of multimedia functions (through the console you can watch movies, listen to music, etc.), interact with other Sony‚Äôs consoles (for example, with PlayStation 3) .  Another feature of this device is innovation.  Sony experts have used the latest technology to make PSP incredible in performance.  In addition, a huge variety of games pleases.  There are shooters, arcades, quests, slashers, races, and tons of other genres on the PSP. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Portable game consoles" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33088/1000961.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Nintendo DS is a portable bag from the Japanese company Nintendo, which was launched back in 2004.  Despite the obsolete hardware, the console has been successfully sold to this day.  One of the main features of the console is the division into two screens.  One screen displays information, the second (touch) is required to enter data using your fingers or a special stylus.  In addition, there is a classic set of keys (cross, buttons A, B, X, Y, Start, etc.).  For the most part, the console is focused on the Japanese market.  If we talk about the filling, the DS is less productive than the PSP.  Nevertheless, over the years, the Nintendo prefix competed with the brainchild of Sony.  What is the secret of such popularity?  The answer is simple - games.  On DS there are legendary series of games like "The Legend of Zelda", "Mario", "Pokemon", etc. This is what makes many gamers make their choice in favor of Nintendo products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Handheld game consoles reviews" class="if" height="426" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33088/1000963.jpg" width="600"></div>

Despite this, they were sold in huge numbers.  From 2006 to 2010, portable game consoles were at the peak of their popularity.  They were bought more often than stationary consoles.

    <p>  Nintendo 3DS is the current generation portable console.  The new console has become much better in terms of technology.  One of the main features of the console is the ability to create the effect of a three-dimensional image without any virtual reality glasses.  3DS sells significantly better than Vita.  Nevertheless, the console does not bring a lot of income and is almost unprofitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best portable game consoles" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33088/1000967.jpg" width="568"></div>
