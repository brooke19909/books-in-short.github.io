And therefore, it is far from always possible to cope with the tasks set in the shortest possible time.  Want to request a deduction for treatment?  What documents are needed to implement this task?  Understand all these issues and not only try further.  Ultimately, the design thereof should not cause any significant trouble. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cianoid.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax service and registration of deduction for medical services" class="if uuid-3227738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3227738.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  What documents for a tax deduction for treatment need to be prepared?  The answer to such a question depends on the life situation in which the citizen applies for the appropriate service.  Therefore, each case has to be considered separately. </p><p>  First you need to understand what the tax deduction for treatment is.  It refers to social tax "refunds", which allows you to reimburse a small amount of funds spent on paid medicine or drugs. </p><h2>  Return Size </h2><p>  Want to get a tax deduction for treatment?  What documents are needed for this, everyone should understand. But also the potential applicant will have to figure out what he can count on in one case or another. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All treatment can conditionally be divided into ordinary and expensive.  In the first case, a person has the right to reimburse 13 percent of the amount spent, but not more than 120,000 rubles in total, 15,600 rubles a year comes out.  In the second, there is a reimbursement of thirteen percent of the cost of expensive treatment, without any restrictions. </p><p>  Important: a person cannot demand more money from the state than he transferred in the form of personal income tax to the state treasury. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nationalpainreport.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rules for applying for a deduction for medical care" class="if uuid-3227736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3227736.jpg"></div><h2>  Conditions for registration </h2><p>  Preparation of documents for obtaining a tax deduction for dental treatment in Russia makes no sense if the person does not have the appropriate right.  Not all residents of the country can apply for the studied ‚Äúservice‚Äù.  Before realizing the task, one will first have to understand whether a person has the right to bring it to life. </p><p>  To have a real right to reimburse money spent on medicines, rehabilitation or other medical services, you must: </p><ul><li>  have formal employment; </li><li>  have income taxed 13% personal income tax; </li><li>  possess citizenship of the Russian Federation (dual citizenship is allowed); </li><li>  make expenses from your own "pocket". </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, if a person pays for someone else's treatment, he, as a rule, cannot demand a refund of money paid for the mentioned service.  But there are exceptions.  For example, when it comes to treating close relatives. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  To whom is provided </h2><p>  Collecting documents for deduction for treatment is necessary only after a thorough study of the legislative framework of the relevant issue.  Otherwise, the potential applicant will simply be denied service. </p><p>  To date, citizens can return part of the costs incurred for paying for medical services: </p><ul><li>  yourself; </li><li>  children </li><li>  spouses. </li></ul><p>  But the other relatives can‚Äôt be treated, while receiving part of the money back.  This is not provided for in the current legislation of the country. </p><h2>  Where to request </h2><p>  Want to get a deduction for treatment?  What documents are needed for this task is important for everyone to know.  But you also need to understand where to turn for help when registering the corresponding "service".  It is not as difficult as it seems initially. </p><div class="photo" data-original="myrouble.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax Code - deduction for treatment" class="if uuid-3227737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3227737.jpg"></div><p>  At the moment, tax authorities deal with deductions.  A person can go directly to the Federal Tax Service of the region or contact the multifunctional center with a statement of the established form. </p><p>  Since some time in the Russian Federation it has become possible to apply for a deduction (social, property) through an employer.  This is not the most common option, but it also occurs in practice. </p><h2>  Limitation period </h2><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that tax type deductions can not always be requested.  Citizens must apply to authorized bodies exclusively within the time period established by the state.  Otherwise, refunds will be refused legally. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The limitation period of applications minus treatment or other medical services is three years.  This means that during this period, a person can reimburse the costs of paid treatment or the purchase of medicines.  It is also allowed to request funds immediately for all 36 months.  It is very convenient if the applicant or his family are regularly treated in paid clinics. </p><h2>  Instruction - make a deduction </h2><p>  The documents for obtaining a deduction for treatment, as already mentioned, will vary depending on the specific life case.  Therefore, first of all, you need to deal with the design features thereof.  And only after that, specify what certificates to prepare under certain circumstances.  Interested in a deduction for treatment?  What documents are needed?  And what to do to get one? </p><p>  To request from the tax authorities or the employer part of the money spent on medical care, you need to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Examine the documents for deduction, and then prepare the necessary certificates.  They, as was emphasized earlier, will change in one case or another, albeit slightly. </li><li>  Fill in the application of the established form. </li><li>  Submit a deduction for medical services to an authorized service. </li><li>  Wait for a response from the relevant organization, and then receive the funds in the prescribed amount. </li></ol><p>  It sounds as if there will be no problems with the design.  But in practice, paperwork when requesting the studied ‚Äúservice‚Äù in Russia is a lot of trouble.  And therefore, it is better to cook for it in advance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prolgoty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much personal income tax will be returned for treatment" class="if uuid-3227740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3227740.jpg"></div><h2>  Basic Help </h2><p>  Documents for the tax deduction for dental treatment or any other paid medical service must be prepared in advance.  Otherwise, the person may be denied service legally. </p><p>  Without fail, a citizen will have to take with him to the authorized body: </p><ul><li>  applicant's identity card; </li><li>  statement of established form; </li><li>  income statements (can be obtained from the employer); </li><li>  tax return for a given tax period; </li><li>  checks confirming the cost of medical services; </li><li>  an agreement with a medical institution for the services provided; </li><li>  license of the chosen place of treatment for a person; </li><li>  accreditation and license of a doctor, if required by law. </li></ul><p>  But this is usually not enough.  Especially when it comes to documents for obtaining a tax deduction for the treatment of relatives.  Under such circumstances, a person will have to face more paperwork.  Fortunately, achieving the desired result is much easier than it sounds. </p><p>  Important: when it comes to reimbursing funds for medicines and medicines, you will need to attach a doctor‚Äôs opinion and a prescription written by a specialist. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  There is a need for a deduction for treatment?  What documents are needed in order to achieve the desired result? </p><p>  Usually it all depends on the specific situation.  With the main help package sorted out.  But they are usually not enough when it comes to reimbursing funds "for medicine" received by close relatives of the taxpayer. </p><p>  Quite often in Russia, paid treatment is given to children.  In this case, you will have to supplement the previously indicated list: </p><ul><li>  birth certificate of a minor; </li><li>  a child‚Äôs passport if he is fourteen years old; </li><li>  statements of adoption; </li><li>  certificates of changes in the personal data of the child (if any). </li></ul><p>  On this list you can end.  As in the previous case, when reimbursing funds for medicines, you need to get a doctor‚Äôs opinion and a prescription of an established sample. </p><div class="photo" data-original="subsidii.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to apply for a deduction for medical services" class="if uuid-3227742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3227742.jpg"></div><h2>  For spouses </h2><p>  Interested in a tax deduction for dental treatment?  What documents to prepare under certain circumstances? </p><p>  It also happens that a person pays for the treatment or rehabilitation of his spouse.  By law, a working taxpayer may reimburse a portion of the costs incurred for appropriate service. </p><p>  To receive a deduction for the treatment of a spouse, a marriage certificate is required.  It is also recommended to enclose certificates confirming the absence of an official place of work for the husband / wife. </p><h2>  For insurance </h2><p>  In Russia, as in many developed countries, people use paid medical insurance.  And for her, too, you can return a little money.  The main thing is to know how to act to achieve the desired goal. </p><p>  The treatment is deductible.  What documents are needed to recover the cost of paid health insurance?  All of the above, but in addition to them, you will have to attach an insurance contract and VMI policy.  The license of an insurance company should not be forgotten either.  Otherwise, the taxpayer will simply be refused. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nsovetnik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deduction Application" class="if uuid-3227735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3227735.jpg"></div><h2>  Through employer </h2><p>  Documents for obtaining a deduction for treatment must be prepared in advance.  Only in this way will it be possible to protect itself from failures by authorized services.  What if the person decided to request a deduction through the employer? </p><p>  In this case, you will have to prepare for the fact that funds will not be issued to your hands.  Instead, a person will not pay personal income tax on wages in the amount of the deduction. </p><p>  To cope with the original task, the citizen will have to prepare all the previously listed documents.  True, you can not prepare a form of 3-personal income tax, as well as income statements.  Sometimes it makes life much easier. </p><h2>  Private companies </h2><p>  Documents for obtaining a tax deduction for treatment in the Russian Federation can help to collect, as well as submit to the authorized body private intermediary companies.  They file tax returns for a fee, as well as request certain certificates for citizens.  If necessary - submit applications for deductions. </p><p>  You can contact any relevant company.  The intermediary will send a statement with prepared certificates to the local tax office.  True, such a scenario is not in demand.  It is much easier and cheaper to contact the Federal Tax Service or the International Financial Center on your own. </p><h2>  Tax transfer </h2><p>  Do you plan a deduction for dental treatment?  What documents to prepare under certain circumstances, found out.  It is hard to believe, but even pensioners and unemployed citizens can count on an appropriate refund.  True, a short time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coach.nine.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What you need for a deduction for treatment" class="if uuid-3227739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3227739.jpg"></div><p>  It is about using the so-called transfer of personal income tax.  When applying for a tax deduction for medical services, income taxes paid to the state treasury for three years will be taken into account.  Accordingly, if you lose your official place of work, the right to a tax deduction for a person will disappear only after thirty-six months. </p>
