    <p>  Cutting out a tympanum has gained particular popularity in modern times.  Today for the implementation of ideas you can choose absolutely any paper material, the varieties of which can not be counted on the fingers. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vytynanka circuit" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29706/666064.jpg" width="499"></div></h2><p>  A lot of people know what a vytynanka is (photo below), they will only know after visiting exhibitions of applied art. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can‚Äôt get past such beauty. </p><h2>  The historical past of the tyrant </h2><p>  What is tympanum and where do they come from?  The first examples of this art were made in China during the appearance of paper as such and the first primitive scissors.  Since paper was an expensive and rare material, for carving in Ukraine, animal skins, dried plant leaves, wood, and dishes were taken as the basis.  Paper ejections spread to Ukraine only in the middle of the nineteenth century.  Their main purpose was to decorate <span>village houses.</span> </p><p>  Vytynanka of the nineteenth - twentieth century are distinguished by high artistic skill.  In each isolated region and in different layers of the population, the most beautiful works have acquired individual features of material presentation, form, technical dexterity, a sense of rhythm, proportions, silhouettes, and richness of ornament. </p><h2>  The purpose of the vytynanka in modern time </h2><p>  Knowing what vytynanka are, very many masters find the most extraordinary destination for them.  They are decorated with crafts, greeting cards, photo albums and photo frames, shelves in the kitchen, large blinds are used as paper decorative curtains for windows, paper tablecloths for tables, they make beautiful paintings and wall panels, they are used as a stencil for inscriptions or drawing on another the surface of ornaments and patterns, using the protrusions paint the facades of modern houses. </p><h2>  Tools and material for the implementation of the punch </h2><p>  For skillful work in the manufacture of original beautiful openwork patterns, professional vytynanka masters use the tool of their ancestors - cutters.  But modern craftsmen prefer industrial special kits, which include a dense rug, often a wooden one, several types of sharp scalpels, <span>stationery knives</span> with various blade sizes, scissors, spare blades, and a metal ruler. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Paper of different density and dimension is taken as the basis for the punch.  It all depends on the imagination of the master.  You can cut it on xerox, white, color paper, cardboard, corrugated sheets, wallpaper.  It is possible to perform not only ejections on paper, but also use wooden foundations, clay, stone, metal or fabric for this purpose. </p><h2>  Design options for work performed by the vytyanka technique </h2><p>  Depending on the technology of execution and artistic style, vytynanka are classified into the following types: openwork - these types of products are made of a sheet of paper, the image is contained in slots;  silhouette, in which the silhouette of a tree, a person, and the like appear. </p><p>  Depending on the complexity of the work of manufacturing, the holders are divided into simple single, executed on one sheet of paper, and complex application colored ones - on several sheets of multi-colored material. </p><p>  Depending on the execution technique and the method of supplying the image, complex protrusions are divided into harmonious ones (large-scale products, an integral image of which is made of several elements folded in an alternating order, make up a harmonious ornament) and invoices that are folded up to one another with a slide. </p><p>  The shape of the vytyanka can be various - oval, square, round, triangular or rectangular, often there are works in which there is a uniform uniform variety that creates a complex structure of the product. </p><p>  Depending on the plots cut out on paper, the following groups of protrusions are distinguished: figures - silhouettes of birds, horsemen, dolls, natural contour elements are depicted on the canvas;  sockets - openwork type of performance, composed of stars, rhombuses, suns, squares;  trees - parts of trees are represented - branches, trunks, crowns with the presence of additional elements - berries, fruits, birds;  ribbons - the image of various one-sided or two-sided ornaments;  Wallpaper - free filling of the canvas with beautiful patterns;  firanki - complex ribbon pimples;  tsatanki - works with a pronounced decorative and thematic character;  exhibition copies - made specially for participation in exhibitions of printing products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tips for choosing a template </h2><p>  Having understood what tympanums are, many people who are predisposed to fantasy seek to learn as much as possible about the technique of performing work and product templates.  There are a lot of those.  An attractive vytynanka (examples of schemes are shown in the photo below) is performed on the basis of a wide variety of pictures printed on paper with any type of writing object (marker, felt-tip pen, pen, pencil).  The complexity of the drawing depends on the skill of the manufacturer of the work. </p>

    <p>  Professional masters most often take on complex plot compositions, but beginners in this case should begin to learn the art of tympanum with simple simple ornaments and landscape images. </p><h2>  How to make a punch-stencil? </h2><p>  Drawn out of paper - schemes for creating a drawing on other bases (wood, metal, stone).  A flat surface is not always taken as the basis; ornaments are cut on cylindrical shapes, spherical and oval spheres.  Drawn stencils in this case help to smoothly and beautifully apply a drawing to perform symmetrical work. </p><p>  A stencil is made by cutting out the necessary curly holes on paper. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tucked out stencils" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29706/666076.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  How can stencil be used? </h2><p>  Any <span>template (scheme) of the</span> vytyanka can be used as a stencil.  What can be done with so-called screen templates? </p><p>  Yes, anything: put a picture on paper, fabric, walls with paints, resulting in beautiful art paintings, on dishes - plates, jugs, cups, glasses, vases, lampshades - chandeliers, sconces;  decorate hedges with ornaments using one standard template of some pattern;  apply in carving wood paintings and drawing thereof on metal. </p><h2>  Drawn for windows </h2><p>  A very interesting and the most extraordinary version of the vytyanka is newsprint carving.  This practical method has pushed so many craftsmen to such a <span>type of carving</span> on paper as making paper curtains, which can be used instead of blinds. </p><p>  The canvas of the newspaper is large, it can be folded into several layers and create examples of original ornaments and scenes, which can later be repeated on clean beautiful paper. </p><p>  Vytynanka on the windows look very original and fun. </p><h2>  Tips for Beginners </h2><p>  While admiring the beautiful works made in the style of a punch, there is a desire to do something similar with their own hands.  Where to start a beginner? </p><p>  Firstly, it is necessary to purchase a special set of tools, since it is unlikely that it will be possible to do a beautiful job with ordinary scissors, which they cut everything in the house in a row.  Paper should be cut clearly in line.  Very many small parts require the use of scalpels for carving on paper. </p><p>  Secondly, pick up a very simple template for the future product, decide which parts will be cut out of it, outline them with a pencil, so as not to mistakenly cut out the detail of the main drawing of the punch. </p>

    <p>  Thirdly, you should choose the basis on which the finished vytynanka will be pasted.  It can be cardboard or velvet paper, or cloth woven base. </p><p>  Fourth, evaluate your perseverance, because work requires attention and composure. </p><p>  Fifth, to get started, you should choose plain white xerox paper, which is easier to cut than corrugated paper or cardboard. </p>
