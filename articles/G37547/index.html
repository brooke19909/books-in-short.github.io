How does OSAGO work and what is meant by abbreviation?  CTP is a compulsory <span>motor third party liability</span> insurance of the insurer.  By purchasing a CTP policy, a citizen becomes a client of the insurance company to which he applied.  After the conclusion of the contract, the owner has in his hands the policy of a strict reporting form or a document printed on A4 paper, certified by seals, as well as a receipt for payment.  The policyholders are left with copies of documents, a statement.  The application contains the full details of the policyholder and all entered drivers.  The contract is valid for 1 year throughout the Russian Federation.  If the client needs to insure the car for a shorter period, then there is the opportunity to reduce the period of use.  In an insured event, the owner of the car can contact any office of the <span>insurance company of the</span> culprit.  OSAGO risk is civil liability. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.osago-peterburg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="OSAGO strict reporting form" class="if uuid-2604994" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2604994.jpg"></div><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  During the insurance process, the client must provide the representative of the insurer with the documents: passport of the owner or policyholder, vehicle passport or vehicle certificate, driver's license of all drivers inscribed in the insurance.  Also, having come to the office, you need to bring a mobile phone with you.  During registration comes a password code, without which there is no way to make insurance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  OSAGO actions at road accident </h2><p>  How does OSAGO work in case of an accident?  The injured party must contact the culprit insurance company with its policy to receive payment.  If the damage is greater than the limit, then the victim has the right to recover the remainder in court.  Victims can be all individuals who have been harmed (life, health, property damage). </p><p>  How does OSAGO work if you are to blame?  The culprit of an accident cannot receive payment for his car, as he is not a victim.  How does the CTP policy work for the culprit?  With it, the culprit does not need to cover the bulk of the damage caused to the victim.  That is, there is no need to pay for your own and another's car.  In order to get paid for yourself, you need to insure the car using voluntary types of insurance.  This is hull. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fountaininjurylaw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Traffic accident" class="if uuid-2605012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2605012.jpg"></div><h2>  Non-payment cases </h2><p>  How does OSAG insurance work in various cases?  The Federal Law "On CTP" included exclusions from coverage, they are indicated in article 6: </p><ul><li>  if the culprit is one vehicle, and the insurance is framed by another, the payment is established only for the car specified in the insurance; </li><li>  lost profits and non-pecuniary damage caused due to a traffic accident are not insured events; </li><li>  study tour in a special place, trials, competitions; </li><li>  environmental pollution; </li><li>  the liability of the carriers must also be insured if the damage occurred due to the cargo; </li><li>  life and health are not reimbursed during work if there are other types of insurance; </li><li>  the employer‚Äôs loss is not reimbursed due to compensation for harm to the employee; </li><li>  the car of the culprit of a traffic accident cannot be covered by insurance; </li><li>  in the process of loading or unloading cargo; </li><li>  there is no way to restore values ‚Äã‚Äãusing OSAGO. </li></ul><p>  If the damage occurred due to the above circumstances, then there will be no payment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="angliya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="office car insurance" class="if uuid-2604991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2604991.jpg"></div><h2>  Examples </h2><p>  The civil liability of the insured vehicle must come.  How does OSAGO work with a single participant in a traffic accident (drove into a tree, a tree stump, a garage door slammed, etc.)?  Such events will not be insured against OSAGO.  The minimum number of participants in an accident is two.  The culprit will be held liable, and the victim will have the right to compensation for damage. </p><p>  Damage to the car for unidentified reasons (punctured tires, scratched with a nail, etc.) is not an insured event, since the culprit is unknown and not the owner of the car.  For these cases, there is hull insurance. </p><p>  Damage must be sustained due to the operation of the vehicle while moving.  For example, car damage was caused in the parking lot by another car, the owner opened the door and damaged another car.  This is not an insured event and there will be no payments, because the car must be in motion. </p><p>  If the client has two cars, one had a policy, and the insured event occurred with another car, then there will be no payment, since the policy is tied to one car.  The client is obliged to purchase two insurances, one for each car. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Electronic CTP </h2><p>  Since 2015, policyholders have a new opportunity - drawing up a contract at any convenient time, without leaving home.  How does the CTP insurance policy work?  Using a computer connected to the Internet, the client can draw up an agreement on his own by choosing the insurance company he likes.  To do this, enter all the requested data into the database, pay.  Payment can be made in any way convenient for the client: bank cards or the type of electronic payment systems.  Next, the policy will come to the mailbox, you need to print it yourself, because while traveling by car you need a paper version.  Such a policy is an analogue of insurance of a regular policy on sheet A4.  Where does electronic CTP work?  The official website of public services provides the opportunity for online registration.  The cost at the conclusion of the contract in the office and on the website should not differ, since the base of all insurance companies is one.  In addition, other voluntary insurance is offered at the office, if they wish, they are issued. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.toyota.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="car insurance" class="if uuid-2605056" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2605056.jpg"></div><h2>  The actions of the MTPL insurance policy depending on the year of issue of the vehicle </h2><p>  How does the <span>CTP insurance policy</span> work depending on the age of the car?  Before concluding insurance, the owner of the vehicle must enter all the data in the form on the website, put an electronic signature and wait for an answer.  Failure, error may appear here.  The client does not understand why OSAGO does not work.  The lack of technical inspection of the vehicle does not make it possible to conclude a contract.  A diagnostic card is a mandatory document when applying for a policy if the age of the machine is more than three years. </p><h2>  Entering erroneous information into the database </h2><p>  After entering all the information you need to double-check it, as the slightest mistake will not allow you to draw up a contract.  Therefore, in order not to wonder if OSAGO works, it is necessary to enter the data accurately.  If it was possible to draw up a contract with errors, then in the insured event there may be a refusal to pay, because an error is the presentation of incorrect information. </p><h2>  System crash </h2><p>  Programs are updated periodically, so if the system does not respond for a long time, you should try to draw up an agreement the next day. </p><h2>  Fraud </h2><p>  Electronic CTP creates the emergence of new scammers on the Internet.  Compliance with the requirements for the sale of policies is regulated by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  Over the past year, 840 domains with fake sales were removed.  After registration and payment, the client does not receive a document in the mailbox, so it is not possible to claim compensation from the insurance company.  It is illegal to draw up a contract for a commission, as well as if the cost of insurance is much cheaper for the insurer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="slaptai.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="car insurance fraud" class="if uuid-2605033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2605033.jpg"></div><p>  There are rules by which a client can avoid scammers. </p><ol><li>  Self-made without mediation. </li><li>  The right of the insurer to sell the policy.  On the website of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, you need to check whether the company has a license.  The insurance company may have a license, but for other types of insurance, so you need to check the license for OSAGO. </li><li>  Definition of the official website of the company.  To identify a site double, you need to check if there is a green circle with a checkmark and the signature "Register of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation."  There are also minor changes in the address bar of fake sites. </li><li>  Double sites invite customers with signatures ‚Äúquickly, simply, cheaper, I will help to issue‚Äù.  The cost of the original cannot be several times cheaper and does not change depending on the chosen insurance company, regulated by the RSA. </li></ol><h2>  Types of MTPL policies </h2><p>  CTP is divided into several types: </p><ol><li>  The period of use of the vehicle: full, applies for insurance for one year;  short, from three months. </li><li>  The number of drivers who are allowed to drive: limited, indicated are drivers who have the right to drive a vehicle;  unlimited, any competent individual can ride. </li></ol><p>  The law does not contain information on the maximum number of drivers inscribed in insurance.  But the form contains only five columns.  With limited insurance, you can enter up to five people.  If you need more, then you need to choose unlimited insurance.  Such insurance will cost about twice as much. </p><h2>  Policy price </h2><p>  The cost of insurance comes from the base rate and adjustment factors.  Tariffs are regulated by the Central Bank of Russia; it has the right to increase or decrease them once a year.  But since the cost of cars is growing every year, respectively, the prices of spare parts also, then we are talking about an increase.  How does OSAGO work, based on the territory of registration?  There is a certain coefficient related to the territory, each region has its own.  There is also a system of discounts for customers, the driver class depends on the breakeven, driving experience, age.  Therefore, it is impossible to immediately answer the question of how much insurance will cost.  The program itself gives out the cost. </p><h2>  Policy Action Abroad </h2><p>  How does OSAGO work abroad?  The policy gives the right to the owner of the vehicle to transfer responsibility to the insurance company only within the Russian Federation.  Before traveling abroad, you will need to buy a similar insurance, which is required in other countries - a green card (Green Card).  The document is checked at customs, it can be purchased at insurance companies, sometimes registration takes place at the border.  Rates are standard for everyone, but depend on the duration: for one year, the cost will be within 12,000 rubles, 15 days - 1300 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="radiovan.fm" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Green map" class="if uuid-2605007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2605007.jpg"></div><h2>  Obligation to purchase insurance </h2><p>  On the entire territory of the Russian Federation, the use of a motor vehicle is possible only with the CTP insurance policy.  After buying a car for ten days, the owner is obliged to insure OSAGO.  The policyholder and vehicle owner may differ.  The policyholder can be any competent individual who has provided all the necessary documents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tapinjury.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="CTP insurance" class="if uuid-2606640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2606640.jpg"></div><h2>  Lack of insurance </h2><p>  When driving a vehicle without a compulsory insurance policy, the owner must pay a fine.  If he becomes the culprit in an accident, there is an obligation to indemnify the victim himself. </p><p>  If the previous contract expired, but the car will not be used for a long time, then it is not necessary to insure it again.  The penalty is not provided for cars in the garage. </p>
