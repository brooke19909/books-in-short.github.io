  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Radioactive radiation, its types and danger to humans</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Radioactive radiation is divided into different types.  Their main similarity lies in the fact that they are all highly energetic, exhibit a biological effect by ionization effects, followed by chemical reactions in the structures of living cells, leading to their death.  Our senses do not perceive ionizing radiation: we do not see it, we do not hear and do not feel the effect on our body. </p><p>  Radioactive radiation is made up of charged and uncharged particles, as well as quanta.  The <span>inhabitants of the globe</span> daily meet with them.  First of all, this is the <span>radiation background,</span> which consists of three components: </p><p>  - cosmic radiation coming to Earth from outer space; </p><p>  - radiation from natural radionuclides of building materials, air and water; </p><p>  - radiation from natural ionizing substances that enter our body with food and water, are fixed by tissues and accumulate in the human body for life. </p><p>  Man, in addition, is exposed to artificial radiation, which is widely used in the national economy.  In the medical field, for example, ionizing radiation is used very widely. </p><p>  <strong>Radioactive radiation and its types</strong> </p><p>  In order to effectively protect against ionizing radiation, it is necessary to know its types and properties well.  Radioactive radiation can be divided into two main groups: electromagnetic and corpuscular. </p><p>  X-ray and g-radiation belong to a wide range of electromagnetic waves, they are located behind radio waves, light and <span>ultraviolet rays.</span>  They differ only in wavelength.  The shortest wavelength and, accordingly, the highest frequency of electromagnetic waves in the spectrum of <span>electromagnetic waves</span> belongs to g- and x-ray radiation.  At shorter wavelengths, the radiation energy is higher, as well as penetration. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The sun is a source of <span>x-rays that</span> are partly absorbed by the earth's atmosphere.  They are also generated by some devices (accelerators) for the diagnosis of patients. </p><p>  Gamma radiation occurs during nuclear reactions and the <span>decay of radioactive</span> substances.  It easily passes through the human body. </p><p>  Beta radiation is the flux of electrons and positrons, its particles have an elementary negative (electron) or positive (positron) charge.  They arise during radioactive decay in the nuclei of atoms and are emitted from there.  They can penetrate water with a layer thickness of 1-2 cm. When irradiated with beta particles, open burns form radiation burns, and when ingested with food, air and water, radiation occurs in the body and leads to serious radiation damage. </p><p>  Alpha radiation is called the flow of positively charged heavy particles, which are 7300 times heavier than beta particles.  These particles are emitted at the moment of radioactive decay of some elements, but with a large ionizing ability they penetrate the tissues of the human body to a shallow depth, damaging only the surface of the skin.  A plain sheet of paper protects them from exposure. </p><p>  Neutrons are particles that do not carry a charge, however, in an emergency, they play a significant role, possessing powerful penetrating ability.  Materials containing hydrogen (paraffin, polyethylene) protect against neutron radiation. </p><p>  <strong>The biological effects of radiation</strong> </p><p>  All measures that protect against the effects of ionization are based on knowledge of the properties of a certain <span>type of radiation,</span> their penetrating ability. </p><p>  Radioactive radiation affects the body as follows. </p><ul><li>  Ionizing radiation is insidious in that it is not felt at all.  Dosimetric devices are a kind of additional organs that are designed to absorb radiation. </li><li>  Obvious lesions of the skin, the ailments characteristic of radiation sickness do not appear immediately, but only after some time;  radiation doses are cumulatively hidden. </li></ul>
