The Maldives is located almost at the equator, many of these islands are washed by the Indian Ocean.  The hot sun's rays warm the golden sand almost all year round, and the emerald waves of the ocean resemble <span>fresh milk.</span>  Flora and fauna beckon here romantics and newlyweds, who seek to spend here a memorable <span>honeymoon</span> for life <span>.</span> </p><p>  In the Maldives there are upscale hotels where you can visit SPA procedures and massages if you wish.  After all, there are SPA centers in almost every hotel, but each of these centers is unlike the other.  So in one of the hotels the SPA-center is located under water, and during the procedures, it is possible to observe the underwater world through the window-porthole. </p><p>  And you can sit on one of the many islands in a cozy bungalow on stilts.  Here, no one bothers to enjoy the gentle sunshine and hot sand, as well as the virgin beauty of the island's forests. </p><p>  And if there is a desire to spend time actively, it would be nice to go diving or snorkeling.  In the Maldives, you can go down to the bottom of the ocean with a scuba diving or visit an old <span>wreck,</span> explore the indescribable beauty of coral reefs or watch the reef shark very close. </p>

    <p>  <strong>Holidays in the Maldives.</strong>  <strong>Beach tours</strong> </p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>  The beach is the place where most vacationers spend most of the day.  <span>Maldives beach</span> is literally a few meters in front of the room.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhotels in the Maldives: an integral part of the room infrastructure is the beach.  On such a beach, you do not need to run around and look for free sun loungers, because they are standing next to each room, waiting for their owners. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For vacationers with children it is better to choose a hotel where the lagoon is shallow, it is safe for small children.  And for lovers of swimming, there are hotels with a deep lagoon. </p><p>  <strong>Holidays in the Maldives.</strong>  <strong>Dive Safari Tour</strong> </p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>  This tour is intended for lovers of swimming on diving vessels and just snorkeling.  In general, the best conditions for diving are created in the Maldives.  This occupation has both water temperature and excellent visibility under water, up to 40 meters.  And it‚Äôs also very convenient that ‚Äúdoni‚Äù go to the places of diving, on traditional boats with a flat deck, which is very convenient for changing clothes and getting out of the water.  There are dive sites near each hotel.  And, of course, the main advantage of diving in the Maldives is the diversity of the amazing underwater world. </p><p>  <strong>Holidays in the Maldives.</strong>  <strong>Sea cruise</strong> </p><p>  A sea cruise, like a diving safari tour, includes diving, only the boat selected by the customer will be entirely at his disposal.  The route and schedule are planned by the same customer individually.  Yachts and boats in the Maldives are comfortable, service is very high.  Tour dive safari is chosen by those tourists for whom diving is the main purpose of relaxation.  Boats vary in capacity, size, price and service. </p><p>  <strong>Holidays in the Maldives.</strong>  <strong>Combined tours</strong> </p><p>  In the Maldives, it is possible to combine different <span>types of recreation</span> if desired <span>.</span>  You can combine a <span>beach holiday</span> with excursion programs, or a beach holiday and a dive safari.  Since, when flying to the Maldives, a plane of some airlines lands in Dubai, it would be wise to rest there for a couple of days, to combine the rest in the Maldives with the rest in the UAE. </p><p>  Whatever tour you choose, you can book it in advance, but if you want to save, it is better to buy last-minute tours to the Maldives.  In some travel agencies, it is even possible to purchase last-minute packages to the Maldives in advance.  Holidays in the Maldives is a great opportunity to escape from the hustle and bustle and plunge into the heavenly atmosphere of a serene stay. </p>
