Drawing inspiration from nature, the author of an innovative project was far ahead of the architecture of his time, for which his work, looking rather strange, was heavily criticized.  Locals called the intricate structure, reminiscent of a mountain, a "quarry", and the press ridiculed the "bestial hole", printing sarcastic comments and caustic cartoons. </p><h2>  A unique masterpiece of architecture </h2><p>  Casa Mil√† is not only a residential building, but also a monument of architecture, protected by UNESCO since 1984.  Popular among tourists, Mila's house in Barcelona is the last secular work of an ingenious author who worked tirelessly on a complex structure.  For Gaudi, an unusual project, which turned into the most visited city attraction, became the main thing in life.  Faced with the bureaucracy, the creator even wanted to abandon the construction that was started, however, having received the help of officials, he finished the work and handed over the masterpiece to the admiring customers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mila Antonio Gaudi's house in Barcelona" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1889267.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of the building </h2><p>  Antonio Gaudi, already a well-known architect with a non-standard vision of the world around him, in 1906 met a married couple who did not count money for parties and bought real estate.  Textile tycoon Pere Mila, whose wife inherited after the death of her first husband, indulged all her whims.  A wealthy lady dreamed of owning a building that was different from the rest in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãand her husband turned to the author of unusual architectural works with a request to build a unique house that would have no equal in the world. </p><p>  The businessman wanted one floor to be allocated for housing for his family, and the rest was intended for rental.  The customer, who bought a huge plot, gave Gaudi complete freedom of action. </p><p>  Antonio, who developed the project, in which his wild imagination appeared, abstracted from real life.  In a short time, he provided Mila, who was eager to get a real masterpiece, a drawing of a future project where there was no symmetry.  The couple was going to rent apartments in a new building, and therefore the architect relied on a convenient layout. </p><p>  During the construction, the family‚Äôs solid financial position was shaken, as the authorities repeatedly fined the customer for the fact that the new building, which appeared in 1910, exceeded current standards in height and width. </p><h2>  No patterns </h2><p>  It is curious that Gaudi, who came up with the original design, created ‚Äúfloating‚Äù partitions so that the walls in the rooms could be moved, and this innovation was a real sensation in the last century.  He threw aside all existing patterns, dreaming of finally bringing man closer to nature.  In order to improve the project, the genius added new elements to the drawing, however, the couple kept rushing the architect, violating his plans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mila's house in Barcelona photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1889264.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, for example, the author, who wanted to create the lightest building in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwanted to "lighten" the massive house with green creepers twined around it.  The city authorities demanded the constant coordination of all the details of the project and for a long time did not give permission to realize the fantasies of the author who was keen on creativity.  Antonio wanted to install elevators on even floors, so that tenants could get to know each other and communicate with each other, and they appeared, but much later. </p><h2>  Description of an amazing house </h2><p>  The facade of Mila‚Äôs amazing house in Barcelona (Spain) resembles a gigantic rock, over whose appearance waves worked for a long time, smoothing out all sharp corners, and openwork wrought-iron lattices on balconies look like intertwined algae.  Soft lines pass from one to another, and the daily play of light and shadow creates the illusion of perpetual motion: it seems as if river flows flowing from the roof are frozen in stone.  Such bends of a massive building create a pleasant psychological atmosphere.  A surreal-looking architectural work has no load-bearing walls, and such a dangerous technique was made possible by the most accurate calculations of the master, who had no right to make a mistake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cute house in barcelona" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1889269.jpg" width="600"></div>

At the request of the owner, the space can be modeled. </p><p>  The internal territory of the structure, which is a reflection of natural motives, is divided into zones.  The interior is designed in the style that Antonio Gaudi always worked, and Mila's house in Barcelona is famous for its rounded shapes, which are its main design elements.  Each of the five floors is unique and does not resemble the previous one, which causes delight among residents and tourists. </p><h2>  Gaudi Innovator </h2><p>  The innovation of Gaudi, who puts his soul into the construction, was manifested in the fact that he developed a project for the building, in which each room had windows.  In Spain, at the beginning of the 20th century, many rooms were deaf, and Antonio‚Äôs decision was revolutionary for that time.  The author of the construction of the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãemotions did not adhere to standard calculations, dreaming of creating a real palace, where each room with different ceiling heights would be flooded with sunbeams.  Despite the difficulties, he managed to solve all the tasks, and a truly unique architectural monument appeared - like Mila‚Äôs house in Barcelona descended from the pages of fairy tales. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Barcelona House Mila photo" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1889270.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Gaudi, who sought to convey the grandeur of nature in stone, created artificial courtyards (patios) through which not only a lot of light passed, but also the ventilation of all rooms.  Surprisingly, the genius so carefully thought out the ventilation system that even now there is no air conditioning in the rooms, and this despite the hot <span>climate of Barcelona.</span>  In addition, an underground parking appeared here for the first time in the history of Europe. </p><h2>  Fantastic looking roof </h2><p>  The most interesting place of Mila‚Äôs extravagant house in Barcelona is the roof terrace, when examined, it gives the impression of the presence of fairy-tale characters on it and it seems that the imagination of the genius architect has no limits.  In fact, behind fancy towers and twisted columns covered with ceramic tiles (majolica), ventilation shafts and chimneys are hidden.  What they just did not compare!  Some saw soldiers serving, others saw eastern women in the veil, and others they recalled strange geological formations.  Unusual design was a harbinger of the emergence of a new style in modern architecture - abstract. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cute house in barcelona address" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1889268.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Magic world </h2><p>  The building is in demand among influential and wealthy Spaniards renting apartments here, but most of the building belongs to the Catalan bank, which occupies premises for offices. </p><p>  Tourists are only allowed to enter the top floor with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1000 m2, from which they made a huge museum with the possibility of access to the roof and the attic of Mila's house (Barcelona).  The photos they take cause delight and desire to be there immediately.  Each visitor thinks that he is in some kind of magical world, leading to a state of shock.  In fact, this is a spacious park, which is an excellent viewing platform from which wonderful panoramas of Barcelona open. </p><p>  For a fee, you can also get into the apartment on the top floor, where the interiors of the early XX century are preserved.  Here time has stopped, and guests are in the atmosphere of a past era.  You can not ignore the souvenir shop, located right there.  All the proceeds from sales go to the maintenance of the museum. </p><h2>  Where is it and how to get there </h2><p>  The guests of Spain are interested in the question of how to find the unforgettable house of Mila in Barcelona.  The address of the building that has become the hallmark of the city is: Passeig de Gracia, 92. You can get to it by metro (lines 3 and 5), and you need to get out at the Diagonal stop.  Also, to the desired location (Proven√ßa-La Pedrera) city buses will be taken under the numbers 7, 16, 17, 22 and 24. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="house mila spain barcelona" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1889266.jpg" width="600"></div>
