    <h2>  Youth </h2><p>  Aleksandrov was born from a peasant family living in the Russian outback.  He was born in 1883 in the Ryazan region.  At the age of eight, the boy sang in the choir of the Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg.  Seven years later, he enrolled in the Court Singing Chapel, graduating with the rank of regent in 1900.  He studied at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, but his illness and material difficulties forced him to quit classes.  He wrote his first work, the symphony Death and Life, in Tver, where he worked as a choirmaster and then led the music school he created.  Alexander managed to continue his studies only at the age of sixteen, when he entered the Moscow Conservatory.  He later became a teacher at this institution and received the status of professor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Over the years, he worked in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, was the dean of the pedagogical and military conducting faculties, and headed the choral department.  In addition, he taught at a technical school, worked at the Chamber Theater, and he was also invited to advise productions in musical theaters, for example, at MAMT. </p>

    <h2>  Musical contribution </h2><p>  Major General Alexander Alexandrov also co-organized the well-known and touring the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble around the world.  He toured all over the Soviet Union with the ensemble, even visited several foreign countries.  He was received abroad so cordially that in 1937 he received the Grand Prix of the World Exhibition in Paris. </p><p>  Nevertheless, he wrote his most famous works (and some of the most outstanding) in World War II and dedicated them to uniting the people in the struggle for life.  He created many songs that were included in the music library of the best selection of those years.  In particular, it was Major General Aleksandrov who wrote the music for the songs ‚ÄúHoly War‚Äù, ‚ÄúIndestructible and Legendary‚Äù, ‚ÄúCampaign!‚Äù  Hike! ‚Äù  other. </p>

    <h2>  Anthem of the USSR </h2><p>  In the turning point for the Soviet Army in 1943, USSR leader Stalin came to the conclusion that the country urgently needed a hymn inspiring and uniting all citizens, front-line soldiers and rear workers in a united struggle against the fascist, in the struggle to the end. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The question of the anthem in the country was raised in the 1930s.  In Soviet Russia, the French ‚ÄúInternational‚Äù was used as the main state song, praising the <span>Paris Commune.</span>  The Soviet leadership announced a competition for writing an anthem.  As part of the event, Major General <span>Alexander Alexandrov</span> created the "Anthem of the Bolshevik Party."  Among the contestants were also his son Boris Alexandrov and Dmitry Shostakovich.  However, preference was given precisely to the music of Major General.  The authors of the words were the poets Sergei Mikhalkov and Gabriel El-Registan. </p><p>  The created anthem was performed for the first time on the first night of the New Year of 1944.  However, on the radio throughout the country, the solemn song was sounded for the first time only in April.  With the change of regime, the question of the national anthem arose again.  Only in 2000, it was decided to leave the same immortal tune of Alexandrov. </p><p>  Major General <span>Alexander Alexandrov</span> died in Germany in 1946 on a tour in Berlin. </p><h2>  Composer memorial </h2><p>  Major General <span>Alexander Alexandrov</span> made a significant contribution to the development of musical army culture.  After his death, the ensemble was named after the composer, then a school in his native village of Plakhino.  A museum was also opened here, however, only in 2003.  In Moscow, the state concert hall was named after him. </p><p>  In addition, a memorial sign of Aleksandrov was installed on the Moscow "Avenue of Stars".  Musical scholarships are named after him.  In recent years, several monuments to the composer have been erected at once: one in Moscow, in honor of the 130th anniversary of his birth, a year later the memorial was also erected in Ryazan.  The Russian Ministry of Culture, together with the Union of Composers, established two medals (gold and silver), which are awarded for the best patriotic song. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Major General Alexander Medal in the Armed Forces" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/729601.jpg" width="296"></div>

    <h2>  State award </h2><p>  The military composer was also noted by the Russian Ministry of Defense.  The Office in 2005 established a state award - the medal "Major General Alexander Alexandrov."  Cavaliers can be military, civilian, working in the Armed Forces system, veterans.  In addition, Russian citizens or citizens of foreign countries who have assisted in the development of army and military-patriotic music can also claim the award. </p><p>  It was in the development of this musical direction that Major General Aleksandrov made an invaluable contribution - a medal in the Armed Forces, named after him, marks the merits of composers and musicians working on creating strong and inspiring compositions. </p><p>  On the obverse of a medal made of metal in the color of gold, in the center, against the background of the rising rays, is a portrait of the composer.  Below it is a lyre and laurel branches diverging from it on both sides of the coin.  An inscription is engraved along the upper edge: "Major General Alexander Alexandrov."  On the reverse side in the center, an impromptu detailed scroll is depicted, on which the phrase: "For contribution to the development of military music" is engraved.  The lyre is also shown above, because of the scroll the attributes of military marches are visible: pipes, drums, as well as banners and weapons.  The inscription follows along the upper and lower edges: ‚ÄúMinistry of Defense of the Russian Federation‚Äù. </p>
