Car navigators and taxi drivers, couriers, and just those who are poorly oriented in unfamiliar areas install the navigator in the car.  This is an electronic device that displays various maps of the area, paves a pre-ordered route of movement and at the same time indicates the location of the vehicle.  In this article we will talk in detail about car navigators. </p><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  In the mid-nineties, a GPS system was developed and launched in the United States.  One of the components of the system are twenty-four space satellites that move around the Earth with certain routes.  From an altitude of twenty thousand kilometers, satellites cover the entire territory of our planet and send special radio signals to Earth.  Subsequently, the radio signals are captured by ground-based GPS-navigators and converted into information about the location of the car and its direction of movement. </p>

    <p>  The built-in navigator in the car is capable of simultaneously receiving signals from three different satellites and using a certain method to find and indicate its location on the planet.  For the final and more accurate location correction, information from the fourth satellite is included in the work.  Thanks to this, the determination of the coordinates of the car is reduced to one or two meters, which is a very high indicator.  <span>How to use the navigator</span> in the car is described in detail in the instructions for use of this device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description and Functions </h2><p>  At first glance, the device is similar to a conventional plasma TV, but only smaller.  Unlike a TV, the color display of the gadget broadcasts various maps of the area with roads, streets and houses.  Moreover, all roads, streets and building numbers have a specific designation and names and inform the driver about this. </p><h2>  Device screen </h2><p>  The difference between navigators, as a rule, lies in the size of the liquid crystal display. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="navigator in car prices" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1078673.jpg" width="500"></div>  What else do you need to know when buying a navigator in a car?  Prices are subject to change due to the width of the display.  The device can be both with a small screen of 3.5 inches, and quite impressive dimensions - 7 inches.  Basically, the display resolution is 480x800 pixels, which is enough to display a graphic card.  But there are those that have the ability to play various photo and video materials.  Almost all of them are equipped with touch screens.  Therefore, having such a navigator, getting directions by car is quite simple, even at the time of movement.  The overall dimensions of the device are selected taking into account the preferences of the car owner, the nature of use and free space in the car.  At the moment, the market offers the consumer several <span>screen sizes</span> :

Reviews of the owners of such devices indicate the convenience of their use.  On the screen of this format is placed an order of magnitude more information, while car enthusiasts with "lowered" vision do not feel any discomfort when operating them.  According to driver reviews, it is advisable to choose a <span>navigator for trucks</span> with a large diagonal.  Trucks have a large cab space, and the navigator can be located at a considerable distance from the driver, without sacrificing visibility.  On a device with a small screen, the detail of the picture is hard to see.  Therefore, to purchase a three-inch device is not the most reasonable decision. </p><h2>  Voice Functions </h2><p>  All modern navigators are equipped with voice assistance.  It helps a lot when driving at high speed and in city traffic, the density of which does not allow distractions on the screen of the device.  Voice assistance in time will warn of a possible lane change and turn, indicate the optimum speed for movement, and also warn of its possible excess on the road.  The driver‚Äôs voice informing function can be turned off at will. </p><h2>  Lack of wired connection </h2><p>  The functionality of the device is complemented by the ability to wirelessly transfer data via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.  You can also connect to it a mobile phone and various auxiliary headset. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The navigator installed in the car is powered by the vehicle's on-board network via the cigarette lighter socket.  It also has a rechargeable battery.  It allows you to use the navigator <span>offline for a</span> fairly long time. </p><h2>  Information Equipment </h2><p>  Even the most advanced navigator will absolutely not do any good if there are no navigation maps in it.  Maps are specialized software that consists of certain graphic information. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use the navigator in the car" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1078672.jpg" width="600"></div>  The range of installation programs has a wide selection with various additions and innovations.  When purchasing a good navigator in the car, you need to consult the seller about the compatibility of the device with this or that software.  Since it is often found that certain programs do not fit the device or do not fully reveal their capabilities.

    <p>  Currently, the following programs have gained the most widespread use among motorists: Autosputnik, Navitel, iGo, Garmin, CityGuide. </p><h2>  Standard equipment </h2><p>  Like any electronic device, navigators are optional to facilitate use.  Having bought a navigation assistant, in its kit you can find the holder for the navigator in the car, which allows you to install the device either on the windshield of the car, or on the dashboard.  At the same time, the installation site should not impede a good overview of the traffic situation and interfere with access to controls.  It can be mounted on the windshield, and preferably on the center console, if its shape allows it.  The kit also includes <span>a power adapter</span> and a USB cable for connecting additional devices to the device.  As a supplement, it can be equipped with a carrying case.  It is mandatory to have a manual and a warranty card. </p><h2>  Price category </h2><p>  It is important to know the following information when purchasing a navigator in a car: the prices for it will depend on its functionality and dimensions.  More affordable devices are budget segment gadgets.  In the equipment thereof, there are only basic navigation functions.  Multifunctional gadgets will cost a little more.  In addition to their basic capabilities, these devices also have various ports for connecting additional devices, a larger display size and image clarity, and are equipped with various Internet and radio modulators.  The most expensive are the navigators of the so-called premium class, which are equipped, as they say, in full. </p><p>  It should be noted that in connection with the rapid development of technology, navigation devices are regularly improved and budget models are already equipped with functions that were an advantage of advanced devices yesterday. </p><p>  So how much does a navigator cost in a car? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="navigator get directions by car" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1078671.jpg" width="600"></div>  As already mentioned, it all depends on the functionality and equipment, as well as on the manufacturer.  Typically, the price of a well-known manufacturer‚Äôs navigator includes, so to speak, the value of the brand.  To purchase the simplest device, you need about $ 25, and more advanced navigation devices can reach prices of $ 750, which may exceed the price of a used domestic car.

    <p>  Perform a series of operations to configure the navigator according to preferences and maximum usability.  To do this, in the navigator menu, select the settings item and, according to the prompts, set the desired operating parameters.  It is very important to set the appropriate time zone, <span>distance</span> units and coordinate system.  In the map menu, it is desirable to enable the function of its rotation.  When the car moves, the map on the display will simulate a movement similar to the view through the windshield. </p><p>  In the "Navigation" section, select the type of transport, in our case, a car. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holder for the navigator in the car" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1078668.jpg" width="510"></div>  In the ‚ÄúPulling‚Äù sub-item, you need to set the parameters of the machine‚Äôs location along the route, the most optimal is a distance of about ten meters.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many motorists study user reviews before buying a device.  At the same time, opinions on the benefits of this device vary and depend on the specific model.
