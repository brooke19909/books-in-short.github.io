However, far from all of them correspond to the notorious price-quality ratio.  Choosing a more or less adequate model is sometimes quite difficult.  However, if we consider in detail all the technical characteristics of a laptop and compare it with competitors, you can understand a lot.  A recognized leader in the production of budget laptops is Lenovo.  And indeed it is.  Only this manufacturer offers relatively powerful and moderately high-quality models at an adequate and non-burdensome price.  Lenovo IdeaPad 310 15ISK also refers to such devices.  Reviews about him are mostly positive.  But we will consider them a little later.  As well as the technical characteristics of the device.  In the meantime, remember the main milestones of the development and formation of Lenovo. </p><h2>  Let's talk about the manufacturer </h2><p>  Lenovo was founded in China in 1984.  And at that time, she was engaged in adapting personal computers from IBM for use in China.  The company also imported computers with might and main.  In 1990, the first Lenovo personal computer was assembled.  Since that time, the company continues to successfully build PCs.  In 2010, Lenovo achieved such impressive success that it was able to buy the legendary IBM brand along with all its debts and merits.  As a result, legendary series such as the ThinkPad and IdeaPad, a legacy of the acquired IBM, appeared in the Lenovo mobile line of computers.  This is what allowed the <span>Lenovo</span> IdeaPad 310 15ISK to be born.  Reviews about him, by the way, are pretty good. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  But the manufacturer did not stop there.  More recently, the company bought the Motorola brand.  The legendary manufacturer was mired in debt and did not find anything better than to sell its business to the Chinese giant.  Now Lenovo can release smartphones under the Moto brand.  But they will not become Motorola.  But with personal computers and laptops, the manufacturer is fine.  They are reliable, productive, cost adequate money and can easily compete with recognized masters (like HP).  This is exactly the laptop Lenovo IdeaPad 310 15ISK.  We will analyze the reviews about this creation a little later, but for now let's turn to the technical characteristics of the device. </p><h2>  Design and body materials </h2><p>  So, what does the Lenovo IdeaPad 310 15ISK look like?  Black, according to user reviews, seems stricter.  This is a classic.  A black laptop fits perfectly into your home environment and office environment.  But without a fly in the ointment, of course.  The cover is made of plastic, which, according to users, very quickly collects dust and fingerprints.  There are color options.  But only for the top cover.  Inside, the plastic is trying very hard to pretend to be brushed metal.  But he does it extremely badly.  Yes, and this plastic is easily pressed through.  The keyboard is standard, island type, with a dedicated digital panel.  Under the keyboard is a giant touchpad with dedicated keys (like a mouse).  The panel is so large that it‚Äôs hard to miss it.  Above the keyboard there is only a power button and a pair of LEDs - nothing more.  Such a design is even attractive.  The laptop stands out among its classmates, who are usually overloaded with various unnecessary elements.  Around the screen is a glossy frame.  The screen itself is also glossy.  This, of course, is not bad, but fingerprints and dust are collected very quickly.  To the credit of Lenovo engineers, it should be noted that this laptop turned out to be much thinner than its budget counterparts.  And this allows you to use it more comfortably.  Now let's move on to the hardware stuffing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Laptop Iron </h2><p>  And now for the fun part.  What is ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù of the Lenovo IdeaPad 310 15ISK?  Reviews say that there are two versions of the device that differ in the type of processor.  Let's analyze the one that is more powerful.  The processor used is the Intel Core i7 Skylake.  It has four cores and eight threads.  The maximum clock speed is 3 gigahertz.  This is serious power for a laptop.  The amount of RAM is 6 gigabytes.  Moreover, 4 gigabytes are soldered on the motherboard, and the remaining 2 are implemented as a removable module.  The laptop‚Äôs graphics are presented immediately by two video adapters: the integrated <span>Intel HD Graphics</span> 520, which works when launching not very demanding applications, and the discrete nVidia 920 MX with 2 gigabytes of memory, which connects when launching heavy 3D applications and games.  Switching between video cards is carried out using nVidia Optimus technology.  The drive is represented by a HDD with a volume of 1 terabyte and a rotation speed of 5400 rpm.  There are also Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters of the latest generation, a DVD drive and the required number of interfaces.  The default operating system is Windows 10 Home Edition.  Exactly the same OS is equipped with a laptop Lenovo IdeaPad 310 15ISK white.  Reviews about her are reserved-positive. </p>

    <h2>  Screen specifications </h2><p>  What screen will the Lenovo IdeaPad 310 15 on Intel please?  Owner reviews about the screen are extremely unflattering.  Indeed, the laptop installed a poor display based on a TN-matrix, with very poor viewing angles and extremely low resolution - 1366 by 768 pixels.  The screen size is 15.6 inches.  In principle, the display copes well with its main task - it displays information.  But for more serious studies it is not possible to use it.  Those who professionally work with photography will not be happy with such a screen.  Gamers will not be delighted either, since the response time of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãvery long.  In especially dynamic games, a wild "loop" will be noticed.  However, for surfing the Internet, working with documents or watching movies, such a display is suitable.  Only his brightness is very low.  Therefore, on a sunny day on the street it is normal to use a laptop.  It's a pity.  Now we turn to the battery life of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Battery life </h2><p>  What kind of battery is installed in this laptop?  According to the technical specifications, it has a battery with a capacity of 3687 mAh and a capacity of 30 watts per hour.  What does this mean in ordinary language?  This means that when watching a video at a comfortable brightness and volume, it will last for 4 hours maximum.  However, by turning on special energy-saving modes, lowering the brightness of the device to a minimum and artificially limiting the processor frequency, an increase of 1-2 hours can be achieved.  Of course, this laptop does not shine with battery life.  But do not forget about its power.  It is not surprising that with such parameters he does not "live" for a long time.  This is still a normal result. </p>

    <h2>  Positive feedback from owners </h2><p>  So what are the customer reviews for the Lenovo IdeaPad 310 15?  I must say that for the most part, users are happy with the purchase.  The vast majority of owners of this laptop praise the performance and excellent appearance.  Quite a few honors go to a rather voluminous hard drive.  The owners also note that the laptop works well even a year after purchase.  This is not surprising, since Lenovo products have always been able to boast of reliability.  Users also note a good cooling system.  No one else has a laptop overheated.  But this is only on condition that it will be regularly cleaned of dust and dirt.  If you do not, then you can easily kill even the coolest cooling system.  Oddly enough, the laptop performed well in games.  Even World of Tanks on average settings is quite playable.  The laptop perfectly fulfills the prescribed period of autonomy.  This is evidenced by an impressive number of positive reviews. </p>

    <h2>  Negative owner reviews </h2><p>  Negative reviews about the Lenovo IdeaPad 310 15ISK mainly concern the screen quality of the device and battery life.  The display here, according to users, is really useless.  Even at the weakest angle, it is not possible to see anything on the screen.  And most importantly, without exception, all owners complain about the incomprehensible flickering of the screen.  And it is true.  At 50 hertz, this flicker is very poorly perceived by the human eye.  As a result, working for a laptop for a long time does not work.  Unfortunately, this trouble has a place to be.  Also, negative comments were awarded the battery life of the laptop.  With these parameters (according to users), the laptop should work on battery power for a couple of hours longer.  But this is not as important as a flickering screen. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We reviewed the laptop Lenovo IdeaPad 310 15ISK 15 6. Reviews were also reviewed.  And what is the verdict?  If it were not for the flickering of the screen, which adversely affects the organs of vision, then this laptop could be recommended to everyone and everyone.  And so - it is better to refrain from buying, if you care about your eyes. </p>
