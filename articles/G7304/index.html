    <h2>  Own business </h2><p>  After a leading position in a coal company, Filaret Ilyich gained enough experience and business connections to create his own business.  So in 1996, Rosuglesbyt appeared.  In 2004, the company was renamed the Open Joint-Stock Company Eurocement-Group.  Over the years of painstaking work, Filaret Galchev created the largest holding out of a small company, uniting more than fourteen cement plants.  Open Joint-Stock Company Eurocement-Group produces cement of all kinds.  Shipment is carried out through nineteen branches-distributors in more than fifty regions of Russia and abroad. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 2000, Galchev and S. Generalov bought the Krasugol company in half.  At that time, she was bankrupt.  Before the acquisition of the enterprise by Galchev and Generalov, employees were not paid salaries of eight months each.  A ton of coal was below cost, debts to many budgetary organizations amounted to almost five billion dollars. </p><p>  But Filaret Galchev was sure that he and his partner would raise Krasugol from the ruins of bankruptcy.  This is what happened thanks to the proper conduct of business.  When Krasugol passed into the hands of the new owners, all the previous management was replaced by a new one, and a professional business team was found.  As a result, already in the second month wage arrears were paid off and large tax payments began. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Filaret Galchev lost" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1292229.jpg" width="330"></div>

    <p>  But after some time, Generalov sold his share of the shares to MDM Bank, without coordinating this step with Galchev.  As a result, in order not to get involved in lengthy proceedings, he also sold his package.  Filaret did not manage to earn money on the company, but at least he was able to return the invested funds. </p><p>  Galchev chose a business in the cement industry, having previously analyzed this market.  And he considered it the most promising for further development.  In 2002, together with G. Krasnoyarsky, they acquired Stern-Cement, which is on the verge of bankruptcy.  She owned several cement plants.  The company was subsequently renamed and joined the Eurocement holding. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 2005, Filaret Galchev acquired Inteko cement plants.  This company was owned by Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow, <span>Yuri Luzhkov.</span>  Thanks to modern modernization, proper business conduct and painstaking work, Eurocement-Group Holding has become one of the world's largest cement producers for ten years. </p><h2>  Media interest </h2><p>  Filaret Galchev, whose biography is described in this article, has repeatedly come under the scrutiny of the media.  There are many reasons for this.  In 2000, competition in the coal business increased.  It was about the allocation by Gazprom and the government of large sums for the revival of the coal industry, since a certain shortage of raw materials had already begun to be detected.  Filaret Galchev, who at that time owned Rosuglesbyt (the largest trader in the world market), also offered a large sum of money - half a billion dollars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="filaret galchev photo" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1292231.jpg" width="445"></div>

    <p>  In 2005, due to increased cement prices, dozens of consumer companies filed a lawsuit against Galchev holding, calling it a monopolist.  FAS conducted an audit and found that there were violations of the law in the activities of Filaret Galchev.  Namely - illegally obtained income.  As a result, the FAS tried to recover 1.9 billion rubles from the profit received by the company from Eurocement-Group holding.  But the Ninth Arbitration Court found the FAS order illegal.  Since then, the holding "Eurocement-Group" has ceased to be considered a monopoly enterprise. </p><h2>  Scandal with Russia Partners </h2><p>  In the spring of 2006, a major scandal occurred between Russia Partners and Filaret Galchev.  The Fund, together with its partner, investment company A-1 (from Alfa Group), filed a lawsuit against Eurocement Group in a Moscow arbitration court.  Moreover, he proceeded from enterprises controlled by Russia Partners, which own forty-four percent of the holding‚Äôs shares. </p><p>  The essence of the lawsuit was that in 2004 Eurocement-Group removed raw materials quarries from the plants.  Russia Partners presented data that the holding began selling raw materials at inflated prices.  And the finished products were sent to Eurocement (renamed Stern-cement) for subsequent resale. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Galchev Filaret Ilyich" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1292230.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 2006, Russia Partners began prosecuting the holding in Cyprus and England.  Claims of the fund were made due to 38.7 percent of the shares of ‚ÄúMaltsovsky Portland cement‚Äù.  This is the largest asset of the ECG.  Galchev and his companies in Cyprus were accused of having illegally retained this block of shares.  Although this package was sold to the holding by Russia Partners Fund in 2004, 38.7% have not yet been transferred from Eurocement to the holding.  However, Russia Partners lost as a result. </p><h2>  Businessman family </h2><p>  Filaret Galchev (Greek nationality) was born on May 26, 1963 in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, Tsalk district, and the village of Tarson.  Father - Ilya Azarievich, mother - Elizaveta Agepsimovna (maiden name Balobanova).  Filaret Galchev married Markitanova <span>Elena Nikolaevna.</span>  In this marriage, a daughter, Alina, and a son, Ilya, were born.  There is little information about his family, as a millionaire tries to hide relatives from journalists. </p><h2>  Awards and titles </h2><p>  Filaret Galchev, whose photo is in this article, was awarded in 1995 the sign of ‚ÄúMiner's Glory‚Äù of the third degree.  Five years later he received a jubilee sign of the <span>coal industry of the</span> Russian Federation.  In 2000 he was awarded the Miner Glory badge of the second degree, and in 2003 - the Miner‚Äôs Golden Badge.  In 2004, Filaret Galchev received the medal "For Mercy" of the second degree.  A year later, the Order of Daniel of Moscow.  In 2006, Galchev was awarded a medal for assistance to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and awarded the title of ‚ÄúHonorary Builder of Russia‚Äù.  In 2007 he received the golden sign of the Holy <span>Great Martyr Barbara.</span>  And a year later he was awarded the FILA Golden Order. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="filaret galchev nationality" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1292232.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Filaret Galchev wrote more than twenty-two scientific papers.  Among the first to consider and justify the segmentation of the coal market and the formation of competitive prices for products.
