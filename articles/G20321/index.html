The shallow, well-warming Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, spacious beaches, the abundance of fruits that the Kuban is so rich in - all this contributes to the fact that every summer there are many visitors.  But where to stay <span>in Taganrog?</span>  We bring to your attention the Golden Fleece Resort Hotel.  We must immediately warn: there are two hotels with the same name in Taganrog.  The first is located in the city.  His address: Rostov Region, Taganrog, Chekhov Street, 31/1.  If you look at the map of the city, then this is the very center, but not the first lane.  The sea is visible only from the windows, and even then not from all the rooms.  The second hotel called ‚ÄúGolden Fleece‚Äù is more often called a club-hotel or a recreation center.  It is located beyond Taganrog, seven kilometers from the city.  Her address: <span>Neklinovsky district,</span> Dmitriadovka village, 31 Krasnoarmeyskaya street. </p>
