  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vegetative propagation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Vegetative propagation is aimed at preserving mainly the biological properties and characteristics of the original plant.  Such characteristics, for example, include the color of the flower, pyramidal nature and so on.  It is vegetative propagation that makes it possible to grow indoor plants from part of the leaf, stem, root, since most decorative tropical species do not produce seeds in moderate climatic conditions.  Such plants, for example, include aloe, tradescantia, ficus, monstera and others. </p><p>  Vegetative propagation is by far the only method of securing valuable varietal properties of plants.  In other words, only using this method can pure varieties be preserved, the value of which lies in their qualities (color, smell, terry and more).  This vegetative propagation is significantly different from seed.  In addition, plants grown from seeds bloom more slowly. </p><p>  There are different methods of vegetative propagation: dividing bushes, mustache, offspring, cuttings of leaves and stems, layering, etc. </p><p>  The most common method is <span>cuttings.</span>  <span>A shank</span> is a part that is separated from the stem and develops in favorable conditions into an independent plant.  The optimal time for such breeding is spring (March or April).  Cuttings in this case have time to form a stable root system.  Such plants overwinter well, unlike late-cuttings.  Vegetative propagation by this method is carried out by young or slightly lignified parts of the stem.  Their length is not more than six to eight centimeters.  Cuttings should have internodes (two or three) and three or four leaves. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cut the cuttings with a sharp knife.  The lower section should be oblique and located directly under the kidney or leaf, the upper one is 1-1.5 cm above the kidney.  Cuttings of plants in which milky sap is present should be lowered into warm water for some time.  If necessary (for better rooting), parts of the stems should be treated with growth substances <span>(aloe juice,</span> sodium humate). </p><p>  When grafting cacti and other succulents, you should sprinkle the slices with crushed coal, then let them dry for two to three days. </p><p>  Cuttings are planted in specially prepared pots or boxes.  A drainage layer <span>(coarse sand,</span> pebbles, etc.) is laid at the bottom, the height of which is 2-3 centimeters, sheet and soddy earth (in the same ratio) mixed with well-washed sand (1: 5) is poured on top.  The nutrient layer should have a height of four to five centimeters.  A three-centimeter layer of coarse-grained river sand (well washed) should be laid on top.  To prevent acidification of the soil, it is advisable to use small pots and place several cuttings in them around the perimeter. </p><p>  Plant the cuttings with a pointed stick, the thickness of which is no more than the thickness of a pencil.  Holes are made in the sand.  Between them should be about five to six centimeters.  Cuttings are planted so that the lower end is immersed in sand for 1-2 centimeters.  After that, sand is pressed tightly against the cuttings. </p><p>  Until the end of rooting, every day (in the morning and evening), the planted parts of the stems are sprayed with water.  Crates or pots should be covered with glass - this way the heat and humidity will remain more evenly.  Tanks with cuttings set in a bright place (not in the sun).  Air temperature should be no more than +25 degrees.  After two to four weeks, the cuttings form the root system and begin to develop.  After rooting, young shoots are accustomed to indoor air.  To do this, they begin to take off the glass: on the first day for one or two, on the second - for two or three hours and so on, gradually increasing it.  After 1-1.5 weeks, the glass is completely removed. </p>
