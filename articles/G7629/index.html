  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Prague, metro (scheme). Prague - metro stations. Prague metro map</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The metro of <span>the Czech capital,</span> if you look at its map, does not seem to be impressive, especially after the Moscow one.  Nevertheless, he ranks seventh in the EU in terms of passenger flow, and this is a rather big indicator.  And in fact, Prague can be proud of such a subway.  The metro, the scheme of which clearly shows that it is almost the most important of the means of transportation around the city, consists of three lines that do not have names and are denoted by the letters of the Latin alphabet A, B and C. </p><h2>  From the history of the Prague metro </h2><p>  It began in 1898.  Rott Ladislav made a proposal to build a full-fledged underground high-speed transport system in the capital.  By 1920, a working draft was prepared.  Soon, work began directly related to the construction of the subway.  They were held until the very beginning of World War II and resumed after its completion.  In 1966, with the active participation of specialists from the USSR, they began the direct construction of the metro using Soviet equipment.  Thanks to this, the first line, C, was launched on May 9, 1974. After that, construction began at a rapid pace, and already in 1978 the line A was opened. The last one, B, was launched later, on November 2, 1985.  The plans of local authorities include the construction of the fourth line, which would connect the Central Station with the eastern part of the city. </p><p>  It's time for us to get acquainted with the map ‚ÄúPrague.  Metro".  The scheme of the Prague subway will be presented a little lower. </p><h2>  What is the Prague metro map </h2><p>  To begin with, it should be noted that 57 stations operate on the existing metro lines.  The total length is 59.3 kilometers.  Currently, every day from 1.5 to two million people use this type of transport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague metro scheme" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/515559.jpg" width="600"></div>  Lines A, B and C in the central part of the city form a triangle where passengers are transplanted.  A similar organization of the movement operates in Kharkov and Kiev, previously it was in St. Petersburg, while there were three lines.  On the diagram you can see what a map of Prague is.  Now very briefly about each of the lines:

The Place to Peace, located on line A, is the deepest, located at a depth of 53 meters, respectively, the escalators are 87 meters long. They were the longest in Europe until the Victory Park station opened in Moscow. </p>

    <p>  The most important thing you need to know: during the construction of the subway, emphasis was placed on simplicity and functionality.  And, despite the fact that everything was done in close cooperation with specialists from the Soviet Union, this absolutely did not affect the appearance of the stations.  In the city of Prague, the metro stations turned out beautiful and without excessive luxury and pretentiousness.  Nevertheless, only very high quality materials were used in the construction.  And the decoration of the stations was quite expensive.  They didn‚Äôt save money on the stone cladding of Malostranskaya, and the architecture was very high.  All three lines, more precisely their stations, are made of different finishing materials.  For this reason they received popular names: A - tin, B - glass, C - stone.  Also, their design became a continuation of the interiors of the lobby and the surrounding area (for example, the Mustek station).  So it‚Äôs not only functional, but also beautiful in the city of Prague metro.  The scheme of underground transport fits perfectly into the terrain and infrastructure of the Czech capital.  Only a completely glass pavilion of the Strizhkov station, reminiscent of a drop of water, falls out of the local flavor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Metro in Prague: ticket price and where can I get it </h2><p>  We will share information on the current cost of metro <span>tickets</span> in the Czech capital.  A single trip will cost you 24 <span>Czech crowns.</span>  This pass is valid for 30 minutes after entry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague metro station" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/515555.jpg" width="600"></div>  For 32 CZK you can buy a ticket for 90 minutes.  With it you can make transfers, including to another mode of transport.  110 CZK costs a daily pass.  It applies to all public transport in the city.  For three days you need to pay 310 crowns.  For local residents, there are many other travel and forms of payment, including in the municipalities and via SMS.  Tourists can buy a ticket in yellow vending machines at the entrance to the station, at the underground ticket offices, at Trafika kiosks - on the street.  Keep in mind that not every box office is available.  Sometimes employees of the station are engaged in sales in such places.  There are no turnstiles, travel tickets must be marked in special composters, where the date and time of landing breaks through.  Often there is a control, a fine for free travel is 950 kroons, and 700 on the spot.

    <p>  In the afternoon this is 5-8 minutes, and in the evening it may well be 10-12 minutes.  Intervals between stations - no more than two minutes.  What else can you tell?  In the Czech capital, urban electric trains have recently been launched - a new type of transport.  They are called S line trains, and they interconnect small suburban and city railway stations, as well as train stations.  The development of the local metro continues.  Soon, Prague will become even more convenient for tourists.  The metro, the circuit of which is in front of you, will reach the main airport of the capital.  And it will be faster and cheaper to get to the right place. </p><h2>  Some useful information for travelers from Russia </h2><p>  Tourists from Russia make up a significant part of the total number of travelers.  And the Czechs have long adapted to this, creating maximum convenience for them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague metro map in Russian" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/518377.jpg" width="600"></div>  Everywhere you can see the inscriptions in Russian.  In many stores (and not only) you can easily explain on it.  Also, for those who wish, a metro scheme of Prague in Russian is offered.  And although, frankly, there is not much benefit from it, it can come in handy complete with marked attractions.  Especially if you absolutely do not understand the Czech language.
