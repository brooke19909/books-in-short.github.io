Mountain road "Troll Staircase"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The troll road in Norway is one of the country's most popular attractions, with an interesting history and beautiful unique landscape.  Steep climbs and descents, harsh northern landscapes, cliffs, waterfalls and fjords - this is what attracts tourists here. </p><h2>  Troll Road (Norway): Description </h2><p>  This modern road represents a section of the Norwegian County Road 63, passing through the southwestern Westlan region, M√∏re og Romsdal province in Norway.  Almost 100 years ago, it connected two small towns - Oldansnes and Walldal, which are located in neighboring valleys and have been separated by a gorge and rivers for several centuries.  Locals gave it their name - "Troll Staircase" (Norwegian Trollstigen). </p><p>  Its route is 106 km long, and it itself is a narrow serpentine, which has 11 very sharp turns, is fenced by low stone fences along its entire length.  The width of the track in the narrowest places reaches 3.3 m, so riding on it is ‚Äúnot for the faint of heart‚Äù and represents a real emotional test. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.tochka.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="serpentine on the troll road" class="if uuid-2556396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2556396.jpg"></div><p>  In some places, the road rises to a height of several hundred meters above sea level, and the difference between steep turns is sometimes 12%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to adverse weather conditions, the Troll Road (Norway) does not always let tourists in: it is open only from May to October, and the exact start / end dates depend on the weather. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The construction began in the late 19th century, when the need arose in the region to connect villages and towns with roads passing through gorges.  Since the 16th century, the largest regional fair has been held in the city of Romsdalen since the 16th century, while there was no transport connection between neighboring Walldal. </p><p>  The project for the construction of a mountain road in Norway at this place was first presented in 1894, but local authorities recognized it unsuitable due to the difficult landscape.  And only in 1905 the construction of the route was started, while only the first 8 km were managed to be laid, and it was completed in 1913. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thetimes.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Troll Staircase" class="if uuid-2553170" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2553170.jpg"></div><p>  Later, the architect Howendak proposed his own version of the track designed for cars.  He also noted all the picturesqueness of the local landscape and made an assumption about its future popularity among tourists. </p><p>  The next construction was delayed for many years due to the short warm season, it was also prevented by snow avalanches, rockfalls and snowfalls.  They could finish the construction only in 1936, during the reign of King Haakon 7, who solemnly took the road ready.  At the request of local residents then it was given the name "Ladder of the Trolls." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now the road has an ideal modern coating, the same as other transport arteries in Norway.  With the growing interest of tourists in such attractions, the need has ripened for the construction of an observation deck, food outlets and sale of souvenirs, a tourist center.  Over time, all these buildings were erected at the highest point of the road. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Norwegian landscape from the road" class="if uuid-2553179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2553179.jpg"></div><h2>  Scenery </h2><p>  The most impressive is not the track itself, but the landscapes surrounding it, demonstrating the wild northern nature of the country: fjords, green hills, peaked cliffs and beautiful park areas.  Created by human hands, the road organically fits into the landscape and harmoniously combines with it. </p><p>  The road begins immediately after a special sign depicting the silhouette of a troll, on which many tourists leave their comments about the experience.  Each turn of the Troll Road (Norway) offers stunning views of the mountains, waterfalls, forests in the middle of gorges, etc. </p><p>  Special pockets for cars have been built at various heights along the entire length of the track, which allow you to park and explore the surrounding landscape.  Here everyone can get out of the car and go along the path to small observation platforms and places intended for a picnic.  Tourists with pleasure can dine right in the fresh mountain air, sitting on a cliff and admiring a beautiful waterfall or other, no less picturesque landscape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelcaffeine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Norwegian landscape" class="if uuid-2553196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2553196.jpg"></div><h2>  Bridges and waterfalls </h2><p>  In the middle of the track there is an amazing, impressive building - a narrow bridge over the Stigfossen waterfall.  When driving on it, it seems that the water is seething right under the wheels of the car.  Erupting massive streams of water from a height of 180 m, the waterfall gives people a sense of perpetual motion and the power of nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.norwaytravelblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterfall over the road" class="if uuid-2553178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2553178.jpg"></div><p>  There are also stepped pools along the route, where you can swim.  The water, of course, is cold, but by the afternoon it heats up in the sun. </p><p>  In addition, there are three more bridges on the Troll Road: Goodbrann, Khol and Krihe.  They are all lined with stones on the sides, the same as the whole road. </p><h2>  Service for tourists </h2><p>  Especially for those who travel around Norway, along the route of the Troll Road in the middle of the path there is a parking zone, where there are many souvenir shops and shops.  There are also trails for cycling and other activities that allow you to brighten up the leisure of visitors. </p><p>  From here you can go to the main point of interest for tourists - the observation deck Aurland Look.  This will allow you to explore the Valldalen valley from a height of 600 m, the fjords and the Troll wall, as well as see the city of Ondalsnes and the Stigfossen waterfall.  It is here that all tourists are photographed, however, in bad weather, the site plunges into dense fog. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iamaileen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Viewpoint" class="if uuid-2553174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2553174.jpg"></div><p>  Those who want to ride along the road with a breeze should know right away that: </p><ul><li>  at the height of the season, the number of cars on the road reaches 2.5 thousand daily; </li><li>  set a speed limit of 80 km / h. </li></ul><p>  Therefore, it is recommended to go at a low speed, enjoying the contemplation of the surrounding northern landscape. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  The Troll Road in Norway has interesting features: </p><ul><li>  the highest point of the road is called Stigrere (858 m); </li><li>  the maximum slope of the roadway in some sections reaches 9%; </li><li>  the passage of vehicles longer than 12.4 m is prohibited due to too narrow places where cars cannot leave; </li><li>  in winter, the track is closed due to increased danger; </li><li>  the track acquired the name ‚ÄúStaircase‚Äù for the external similarity of the serpentine, which raises steps up. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelcaffeine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Another troll" class="if uuid-2553186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2553186.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  It‚Äôs better to go to such places by your own car.  When traveling in Norway by car from the north, you can get here as follows: before reaching the city of Ondalsanes 5 km, you should turn onto highway number 63, which will allow you to get to Trollstigen.  If you get from Oslo, then you need to choose the E4 or E6 highway and go to Lillehammer, then along the E6 to Dumbos, where you need to turn onto the E136 highway and then similar to the first route. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt have your own transport, you can use the express bus that follows the route from Ondalsnes, which is accompanied by a guide who tells about all local attractions along the road.  You can also get to the nearest settlements by train from Oslo and Trondheim stations, and then anyway by bus. </p><p>  Since 2012, a tourist center has been established at the beginning of the Troll Road, which provides any assistance to tourists, even in the most difficult situations.  There you can dine in the cafe and buy local souvenirs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitnorway.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Extreme photos" class="if uuid-2553333" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2553333.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Troll Road in Norway ("Trollstigen") is an engineering masterpiece that was erected thanks to innovative design ideas.  The project brought to life allowed to optimize trade communications in the region and increased its tourism potential.  The road is surrounded by a unique northern landscape and is literally saturated with the atmosphere of Norwegian myths and traditions. </p><p>  Lovers of active tourism, all those who appreciate the northern beauty of Norway, dream of admiring the waterfalls and fjords, such a pearl among the sights of the country will allow you to spend an exciting and unforgettable vacation.  A picnic at an altitude of 858 m will be a memorable event.  Just be sure to remember that the ‚ÄúTroll Staircase‚Äù is open only a few summer months. </p>
