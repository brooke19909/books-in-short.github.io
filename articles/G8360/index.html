There, right on the Mediterranean coast, is the luxurious Kemal Bay Hotel 5. The photos of its two red buildings - the main six-story and the second, three-story - look very impressive after the renovation carried out in 2008.  The buildings are surrounded by a huge garden - 80 thousand square meters.  There is <span>a bus stop</span> right at the gate of the hotel <span>,</span> thanks to which you can reach the center of Alanya in seven minutes.  To the air port of Antalya - about one hundred and twenty kilometers. </p>

The hotel is on the front page, so the distance to the sea from the buildings is only a few tens of meters.  The bottom is sandy, without stones and a hollow sinks, which is very important for children.  Well, one who loves to dive right into the depths can go down the steps from the pier.  On the coast, platform and pools there are many sunbeds with mattresses under umbrellas.  All this is free, but <span>beach towels</span> are secured.

This situation is very convenient for those who do not speak foreign languages, because there is always a Russian-speaking staff at the customer service desk (which, by the way, works around the clock).  Even the maids and waiters in the Kemal Bay Hotel 5 restaurant will quickly fulfill your every request.  There is also an excellent Turkish textile store, a hairdresser, a laundry, a rental of equipment for water entertainment, and a diving school on the shore.  Near the reception there is a room where you can leave luggage for storage at late check-out.  The hotel cordially invites you to visit the SPA center (massage room, jacuzzi, hammam and sauna) and a gym with exercise machines.  Tennis enthusiasts can exercise on the court.  For children, in addition to the shallow pool </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemal Bay Hotel 5 reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/17145.jpg" width="500"></div>  and playgrounds, a mini club.

    <p>  <strong>Reviews:</strong> Since almost a hundred percent, with a few exceptions, vacationers at the hotel are tourists from Russia, everything is focused on them.  The animation team (for both adults and children) consists entirely of Russian-speaking employees, dancing at discos to their favorite hits, and everyone around speaks Russian.  In this regard, Kemal Bay Hotel 5 (reviews do not get tired of reminding about it) looks like ‚Äúa piece of Moscow in Turkey‚Äù.  Dining at the hotel is very diverse, especially it will please the sweet tooth and fresh fruit lovers.  The beach and the sea are clean.  Guests are not overjoyed by the helpfulness and cordiality of the staff.  If you rent a car to ride through the Egyptian deserts and meet the sunset and sunrise, then it will not be a problem to attach it in the parking lot. </p>
