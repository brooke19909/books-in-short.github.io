Here you can easily swim in two seas in one day, because the Taman Peninsula is washed by the waters of two seas - the Black and Azov.  The coastline here is distinguished by its ruggedness, the presence of many bays, estuaries, and braids.  The formation of the modern appearance of the peninsula was significantly influenced by <span>the Kuban River</span> Delta <span>.</span>  <span>The coast of Taman is</span> mostly steep, consisting of limestone and limestone rocks.

    <p>  The Black Sea beaches of Taman are stony, pebble and sand beaches with unusually clear water, where in the morning you can easily find dolphins setting off on a hunt.  And the shallow shell beaches of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov are the best suited for vacationers with children. </p><p>  And still the main thing is what Taman is famous for.  Attractions, natural and historical, are here at every step.  Each grain of sand keeps echoes of history and if the stones could speak, they would tell us a lot of interesting things. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Taman Attractions Photos" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/267174.jpg" width="600"></div>

What is a must-visit for someone who has decided to spend their holidays on this amazing peninsula? </p><p>  Which of us has not heard the word "Tmutarakan"?  So - it is here.  People began to settle in these places in the VI century BC.  Hermonass, Samkherts, Tamatarha, Matarha, Matrika, Matrega, Taman, Tmutarakan - this is the name of this city at different times and among different peoples.  Various artefacts are still found on its territory.  In the museum, located in the village of Taman, you can see a collection of exhibits that tell about this amazing city. </p><p>  Turkish Fountain (also called Turkish Wells) - this amazing <span>hydraulic structure has</span> existed from the 15th century to the present.  Similar to a small house rather than a fountain, it is unique in that it was built in an area where at all times there were difficulties with fresh water, and therefore is a condensation source, the device of which is still a mystery. </p>

Lermontov.  Of course, the house itself, in which he stayed, was not preserved, but the museum, recreated according to notes of contemporaries, exactly conveys the spirit of those times.  Whitewashed walls, small rooms, household items - everything is like in the days of the great poet.

According to legend, the bells of this temple are cast from the guns of the <span>Zaporozhye Cossacks,</span> who were the first Russian subjects who arrived to settle in Taman.  Here were kept the regimental banner of the Cossacks and timpani, with the help of which the Cossacks convened in the rain.  The updated interior of the church exactly repeats the original look. </p><p>  The nature of this region is also amazing.  There are salt lakes on the peninsula, the bottom of which is covered with healing mud containing hydrogen sulfide, bromine and iodine.  But these are not the only mud springs that Taman is famous for.  Sights of interest for those who like to improve their health are, of course, the famous mud volcanoes.  The dirt coming directly from the bowels of the earth with bubbles of oil gases has a beneficial effect on the skin and promotes its rejuvenation. </p><p>  The famous lotus valley is located in the <span>Akhtanizovsky estuary</span> .  These huge and unusually beautiful flowers in full bloom can reach half a meter in diameter.  As for this Taman attraction, the photo of which will not leave anyone indifferent, then in reality everything is much more beautiful and romantic.  According to the existing belief, which breathed in the unique and mysterious aroma of this flower, it is necessary to become wiser.  And if you whisper a cherished desire to an unbroken bud, they will certainly come true.  It is best to visit the <span>lotus valley</span> in July-August (or early September), when their flowering season begins. </p><p>  One cannot but mention the fact that during the years of World War II, the most fierce bloody battles took place in Taman.  Literally every square meter is watered with the blood of Soviet soldiers who died for the liberation of their native land, as evidenced by numerous military monuments and obelisks. </p><p>  Of course, you can endlessly tell what Taman is famous for.  Sights here are almost everywhere, and therefore only the most basic are listed in the framework of this article. </p>
