    <p>  In the territory, which belongs to the boarding house, there is a lot of entertainment for children and adults.  When you read the reviews about the rest, “AzovLend” seems to be a paradise for families with children.  For example, there is a water park, a water slide with a pool, which can be tried by both children and their parents.  There is a bouncy castle on the beach, where kids can frolic in plenty. </p><h2>  Active and passive rest </h2><p>  In the neighboring boarding house there is a noteworthy thematic water park “Treasure Island”, an excursion to which you can also book vacationers “AzovLenda”.  If you can’t imagine life without sports activities, then you should know that the guesthouse has a bike and bicycle rental service, and you can always play beach volleyball there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to such rich opportunities for recreation in the AzovLend boarding house, the reviews of vacationers often agree that this is a pretty pleasant place both for outdoor activities and for simple lying on the beach.  But when a fascinating animation program is developed for vacationers, I don’t especially want to wallow in the sun.  After all, animators think out entertainment for children and adults: various contests and relay races, interesting performances and show programs, and for fitness lovers - aqua aerobics and much more. </p><h2>  Nearby Attractions and Massage Room </h2><p>  Tourists who prefer to walk around the neighborhood in search of local attractions are invited to order excursions.  What for?  Yes, then, that a huge company to go several times more fun.  Do not forget about this if you are relaxing in the AzovLend boarding house, reviews of which you will write the most wonderful later. </p>

    <p>  If you suddenly have muscle problems, or just need to relax in a relaxed atmosphere while your children are entertained by tireless animators, you can look into the massage room, where experts from the Azov spa center will do everything possible to make you feel more more relaxed.  By the way, maybe because of the AzovLand boarding house (Crimea), reviews are most often good?  Indeed, real service industry professionals work here, ready to do anything so that the client would like the place he chose for his vacation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If suddenly one of the vacationers in a boarding house wants to visit any Crimean city, then the distance to Kerch is only thirty kilometers.  Half an hour drive - and you can overlook this wonderful city.  To Feodosia will have to go longer, since it is eighty kilometers from the boarding house.  The nearest airport is in the city of Simferopol, and to go to it 210 km. </p><h2>  What is included in the package? </h2><p>  The AzovLand boarding house belongs to the projects of the investor group of the Azov complex.  For this reason, "AzovLend" and "Azov" are in contact, providing each other with various kinds of services.  For example, the same massage room or water park “Treasure Island”. </p>

Reviews of 2016 from vacationers about him are mostly positive: it is located in the area called “General's beaches”.  This unusual name has roots in the history of the USSR.  When the nomenclature of the Communist Party and all high-ranking officials of the state went on vacation to Azov, they liked to relax in the place where the AzovLend boarding house is now located (Crimea), reviews of which are often written on the Internet on special sites and, in fact, on the boarding house’s website . </p>

    <p>  “General beaches” is a unique nature that delights anyone who comes here on vacation.  No wonder this place was so fond of the Soviet generals. </p><h2>  Sea depth </h2><p>  It should also be said about the equipment of the beach, because about the AzovLend boarding house the reviews of 2016 often affect the beach infrastructure.  As vacationers say, the beach has everything you need, and even more.  What no beach can do without - lifeguards and sunbeds with umbrellas - is here.  Specially trained rescuers will preserve your safety and the safety of your children, so you should not worry when you swim up to the buoys or watch the kids playing in the surf. </p><p>  Sun loungers, sunshades and umbrellas for vacationers are absolutely free of charge. </p><p>  Fans of deep-water swimming can not worry that they will not have the opportunity to do what they love, because the beach belongs to the waters of the Kazantip Bay, which is famous for its depth compared to the entire Sea of ​​Azov, accessible for swimming. </p><h2>  Service and animation </h2><p>  On the website of the AzovLand boarding house, the reviews of 2015 were preserved, and therefore you can find out how the rest went on last summer.  For example, many people write about July of that time, about how calm the sea was then, just one day of a slight storm, and so it was hot weather, but the rooms were nice and cool.  I remembered the responsive and friendly staff of the institution.  The accommodation in the room was also ideal, and the building itself has everything you need, including a laundry room and a dining room.  The pool and trampolining were pleasant to children. </p>

    <p>  The administrator of the boarding house records on excursions that are very popular with those vacationers who do not like to lazily lie on the beach.  Excursions to Koktebel, to the dolphinarium, for example, are possible.  Or to Kerch to an ostrich farm, or to Feodosia to see local attractions. </p><p>  Parents of young children often note the fact that the water park is suitable for their children.  I also like the portions in the dining room and the fact that the food is cooked at home.  The dining room menu has a lot of cereals that are suitable for baby food, as well as a good selection of main dishes and soups.  Casseroles or milk soups often rely on breakfast, and mashed potatoes, chop and dessert can be eaten for dinner.  Well, for lunch, you must have soup or borsch, porridge, salad and all that is included in a healthy diet. </p><h2>  Suitable place for a budget holiday with children </h2><p>  About such a place as the AzovLend boarding house, the reviews of vacationers agree that this is a very suitable option for families with children.  Mostly the whole family goes here, because you rarely find the place where customers are treated with such care. </p><p>  If you are looking for where to spend your summer vacation next year, pay attention to the AzovLand boarding house, reviews about the rest in which everyone speaks for themselves.  You are waiting for clean and comfortable rooms, good service, sandy beach, calm sea, beautiful nature.  If you have children, even small ones, all the more you need to get a ticket to AzovLend, because for them there is a bouncy castle, a water park and funny animators with endless imagination and an individual approach to each child. </p>
