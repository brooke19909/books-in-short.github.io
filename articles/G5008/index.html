What do different girls and women say about men's salaries and to what extent is it important when choosing a partner?  Is paradise in a hut good for modern women?  Let's try to find out more about what are the requirements and expectations of a lady waiting for her prince - even on a white horse, even on a white Mercedes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thenational.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="earn a man to support a family" class="if uuid-3136765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3136765.jpg"></div><h2>  How many, how many </h2><p>  Some sigh reproachfully, saying that everyone expects something from the stronger sex, and it is often completely unjustified.  Who owes what, and most importantly, to whom?  Yes, and should it at all?  What is this desirable, but rare beast - a rich man?  Is all the fair sex hunting for him?  Traditionally, they are used to thinking that if not all, then almost all the girls are sure: a man owes them something, and first of all, a lot of money, a beautiful life and the fulfillment of all kinds of dreams.  Some time ago, social activists even organized polls in order to assess what the views of the audience are.  How much should a man get to consider himself a desirable prey for women of the opposite sex? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Quite curious are studies on opinions on this topic.  They were organized in the form of surveys of girls.  How much a man should earn, as the organizers noted, many respondents know well.  Often, a lady during the study is almost immediately ready to name the specific amount of the monthly payment that they expect to see from her chosen one.  It seems that many modern ladies have considered this issue more than once or twice, so there is no confusion, there are only clearly stated requirements.  True, they do not apply to the whole country: most often such events are held in the metropolitan area, so the figures given below will primarily characterize Muscovites. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thesavvylife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="earning men women opinion" class="if uuid-3136761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3136761.jpg"></div><h2>  About the specifics </h2><p>  So how much should a man earn?  Surveys of girls in the center of the capital showed that modest enough ladies want their chosen ones to receive up to 150 thousand rubles a month.  At the same time, they indicate that they expect a man to own his own metropolitan apartment and some kind of decent but decent car. </p><p>  Most of the respondents, however, would not be satisfied with such money every month.  According to pragmatic and experienced women, a man must provide his family with at least 250 thousand rubles every month. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The third category of respondents is girls who refused to answer a provocative question, saying that for them the financial side does not matter, but only sincerity and romance are important.  They admitted that they would not ask what the man‚Äôs income was, and they had no reason to figure out the numbers or make demands.  However, even such modest ladies would like the salary of the chosen man to allow him to provide their wishes and requirements, whatever they may be. </p><h2>  Capitalism and daily life </h2><p>  The fact that the husband earns little, women say as much as there is money and salary.  However, according to some, in fact, only today, when capitalism is firmly in charge of our lives, relations between the sexes have become so saturated with the money issue.  Everyone strives for comfort, and its increase is possible only in conditions of material security.  At the same time, prices are rising, you have to take a mortgage to buy a home, and the purchase of expensive goods and the organization of repairs result in a large loan.  Such factors greatly affect family well-being.  It is known that most often serious conflicts and divorces are observed in families suffering from financial instability.  Talking about paradise in a hut is still possible and even fashionable in certain circles, but unfortunately, this attitude does not fit well with the realities of everyday life. </p><p>  The fact that the husband earns little can be heard in the complaints of a friend and neighbor in the last century.  Even then, women recognized by themselves, and the girls absorbed with upbringing that to ensure their own well-being, the first and most important thing is to find a secured life partner.  Making money is perhaps the most important thing in the life of almost any modern person, especially in our country, and the race for extra money forms the daily routine of men and women.  At present, however, examples are not uncommon when a woman‚Äôs salary is greater than her chosen one.  Such marriages are generally considered unstable in society, but in practice they are often more reliable than classical unions.  However, not every woman wants to be part of such a family. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.jw.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much do male girls earn" class="if uuid-3136760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3136760.jpg"></div><h2>  Money and Quarrel </h2><p>  Such a way is considered traditional, when the representative of the stronger sex brings the bulk of the money home.  Some women even developed for themselves their own system of categories of men in terms of income.  If this is already a married lady, she suggests such a system to her daughter, if this is a free woman, she applies it to herself.  True, trying to get a man as wealthy as possible, a woman sometimes forgets about the importance of mutual understanding, and this leads to conflict. </p><p>  Love, which is the traditional basis of marriage, today is closely linked to money.  Financial stability determines the success of a person in society - and at home.  The more money, the higher the ability to survive in society, and material security indicates a strong survival instinct.  As a result, when a man knows what exactly he provides for his household, he automatically realizes how much they love him.  The woman who receives the money feels that through them her companion expresses her love.  This is not always important at the beginning of a relationship, when romance comes to the fore, emotions rule everything, but even in the ‚Äúcandy-bouquet‚Äù period it is very difficult to build a full-fledged relationship without giving each other gifts, without visiting movies and shops - and this requires of money.  Few people seriously discuss future spending at this stage, aiming to attract the attention of the person they like, but over time, the situation changes in the direction of everyday life, and the couple begins to count every penny, trying to stay afloat. </p><h2>  Conflicts: more about the problem </h2><p>  Many modern women can, without hesitation, say how much a man must earn in order to support his family.  The numbers depend on the city.  In the metropolitan region, this is 150-250 thousand, in regional and regional centers one hundred thousand is usually enough, and in very small towns, even 50-60 is sometimes enough to support a wife and a child.  Analyzing the financial side of the relationship, you can see that there are two cash flows: the family‚Äôs profit brought by one or both spouses, and the loss due to spending.  On the one hand, it is important how a person makes money, on the other hand, how quickly they are spent.  Based on these two flows, all family conflicts can be divided into those due to lack and availability of money. </p><p>  Traditionally, it so happens that a man who earns more than his wife is very often sure that his lady spends money excessively.  A woman, trying to defend herself against such accusations, speaks of her husband's greed.  At the same time, she may also mention the one devoted to how much a man should earn, the opinion of women.  If a person brings home the sums indicated above, it seems that there can be no conflicts over money: there is nothing to spend, no one will accuse anyone of treason or waste. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bloemfonteincourant.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="categories of men income" class="if uuid-3136764" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3136764.jpg"></div><h2>  Is it that simple? </h2><p>  According to psychologists, it‚Äôs much more difficult for a man to spend money than it is given to a woman.  It is generally difficult for the stronger sex to part with what they have earned.  If the expenses are due to the woman you love, the spouse first makes sure that she is a suitable lady, that she is worth what he spends on her, that a penny will not be overpaid.  Usually men practically do not spare money for a lady in whom they are confident, which they love and long for.  But this situation is ideal, and in a marriage such relationships are not always fully preserved. </p><h2>  About types </h2><p>  Since there has been a long discussion in society about how much money a woman needs from her chosen one, a system has been developed for classifying all members of the stronger sex.  Some are generous, others are romantic, others are analysts.  A representative of each of these groups may be well-off. </p><p>  A wide soul - a generous type, ready to provide money to provide comfort for himself and loved ones.  He likes to spend time interestingly, and he takes the cost of it, believing that the result is above the cost.  A romantic is a man who enjoys spending money on a chosen one.  He does not want to endure her needs and is ready to fulfill any whim.  He wants the lady to shine, no matter what the cost.  Analysts are more neutral, but do not blame their lady for spending, they only calculate in detail all expenses and incomes, take into account opportunities to save, optimize expenses.  If the chosen one wants something, the man agrees, if the lady proves the need for the acquisition, but at the same time assesses the possibility of minimum costs for obtaining the item. </p><p>  As you can conclude from this description, you need not only to know how much a man should earn.  It is equally important to carefully evaluate the selected person.  The first two types described are the ideal of a modern woman.  It‚Äôs better not to think of anything better, but only such princes are rare, especially among those who have good capital and income. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gobankingrates.com" data-author=": sdecoret, "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much should a man earn" class="if uuid-3136763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3136763.jpg"></div><h2>  Sometimes harder </h2><p>  In addition to those described, there are men who know how to count money, get a good salary, but are not so attractive to ladies due to the difficulty of communicating with them.  It is customary to divide such into types: stingy, petty, self-serving. </p><p>  The first does not want to give darling funds.  This is an authoritarian person who can directly prohibit spending.  One has to literally beg for such a finance, but he almost always accuses the chosen one of squandering and claims that she can do perfectly well without all that she wants. </p><p>  For a modern woman, a man without money is far from ideal.  However, petty, but rich - this is such a representative of the opposite sex, with whom, if better, then not by much.  In such a man, every penny is a penny.  He scrupulously calculates all the expenses, is boring, not romantic, never makes wide gestures.  He likes to wonder where people come from who spend impressive amounts of money on something that does not have obvious benefits. </p><p>  A mercenary is someone who is ready to give a woman money, but only in exchange for something.  Lady wants a new thing?  You are welcome!  Only at first she needs to do something for her life partner. </p><h2>  Communication Rules </h2><p>  If a woman has a chance to choose a spouse who receives more than good earnings for a man, while the man himself belongs to a rather complex type, you need to learn how to behave correctly.  All the described types of people are persons with whom it is not easy to get along.  If love does not see obstacles and a woman decides to put up with current difficulties, she must first put herself right in family relationships, so as not to be humiliated due to financial aspects.  Indeed, making money, working is hard enough, whatever the work.  Any representative of the stronger sex who receives a lot of money has the right to reasonably spend what he happened to get.  At the same time, you need to understand that the chosen one is not someone else, but a chosen person who completely deserves a normal life, as well as justified and justified expenses.  If at the same time the woman does not show dependence on husband money, it will be easier for him to respect the lady. </p><p>  They will and will talk about how much men earn in Russia.  Many receive 15-30 thousand rubles a month, and some receive even less.  There are those whose salaries are decent, but there are relatively few people who know how to bring home more than 150 thousand a month, especially outside the metropolitan area.  The task of a woman who has chosen a life partner is not only to spend his money, but also to smooth out difficult, conflict situations.  It will be useful for both her and her husband.  It is equally important to be able to properly present the positive aspects of making a particular purchase.  It is important to share the joy of new clothes with a man, to show him how much happiness a present gives.  A woman must by all means demonstrate her attractiveness and make it clear that she is such because her chosen one is generous and kind.  It is equally important to thank the man in time and sincerely, who spent the difficult work not on himself, but on the lady. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sciencedaily.com" data-author=": graja, "><img itemprop="image" alt="husband earns little" class="if uuid-3136762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3136762.jpg"></div><h2>  Strength and Home </h2><p>  Some women are firmly convinced that a man should earn more than he is currently receiving.  It is no secret that a large salary is simply not given, efforts must be made for this.  As a result, the spouse, stimulated by the chosen one, gives all she can at work, gets tired, returns home and simply does not have the strength to participate in everyday family life.  To any whims of the lady, he rightly answers that his resource has been exhausted at work, where he gave everything to the last drop to ensure her needs and requests.  Being the target of attacks due to inattention to the spouse and children, such a representative of the stronger sex quickly begins to get angry, feeling like an object of undeserved and unjustified bullying, and demands to leave him alone.  As a result, the conflict begins. </p><p>  The task of a woman in this situation is to treat the chosen one with understanding.  You need to love your life partner even when he is tired, only this way there will be no additional conflicts, you will not have to complain that the man does not know how to make money.  To make it easier, spouses can share positive emotions with each other - first of all, a woman with her exhausted, but everyday companion.  Listening to her stories, the man relaxes, sees the source of the positive, is energized, and with great pleasure goes to earn a new salary. </p><h2>  Yesterday Today Tomorrow </h2><p>  About how much a man should earn, not only the fair sex knows, but also their princes, who would like to be always shining dream objects for their second half, arriving in a white Mercedes.  Perhaps today it is a person who receives enough money at his work to be such an ideal, but some are justifiably afraid that tomorrow there will not be this work, and with it livelihoods will disappear.  Here is a paradox: the more a man earns, the more a woman loves him, the more substantial his fear of losing such a job, and with it the finances and the reason he is loved.  It often so happens that it is the well-earning men who believe that the ladies choose them only and strictly because of money, and it is worth losing the security, as they will be alone. </p><p>  To ensure peace in the family and give her chosen one enough strength to cope with stress and not be afraid for the future, a woman should not only know how much a man should earn, but also be able to let him know that money is not the most important thing.  Fortunately, even having lost his job, a man can find another one that will also allow him to provide for his family.  If the spouse is in a difficult situation due to professional problems, this almost always affects his behavior at home, and only a wise woman can smooth out the conflict, help her companion overcome a difficult life period. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thepurposeisprofit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much money does a woman need" class="if uuid-3136766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3136766.jpg"></div><h2>  About stereotypes </h2><p>  No wonder modern women almost always can, almost without hesitation, say how much a man should earn.  Our society is ruled by generally accepted ideas that the representative of the stronger sex is the one who should provide for the family.  This is due to the historical past, when a man went hunting and obtained food for domestic purposes.  This is explained by the abundance of socially desirable qualities, which are approved by the public and are inherent in the first place to men.  Often a woman who knows what income she expects from a chosen one sees a man as an unquestioning family leader who will be responsible for the family.      ,   ,           ,    250  ,    . </p>
