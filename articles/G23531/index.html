The lake created by nature in the shape of a crescent is a favorite place of celebrity and ordinary people, all those who want to be alone with nature for several days in silence. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="47.3510713" data-lng="8.549166600000035" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/7/9/6/17796.png"></div><h2>  Rest on the lake </h2><p>  Despite its wide popularity, the lake is not considered a popular resort area.  On its shore are small hotels or houses for rent.  However, a good rest for those who came to swim and sunbathe, will not work.  Grassy beaches around the perimeter of Lake Zurich are not equipped for a full beach holiday.  Mostly tourists come to these places to get acquainted and take a walk along the old streets of the city, as well as cruise on the lake, whose length is forty kilometers and a depth of 200 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.themostperfectview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lake in zurich" class="if uuid-3231412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231412.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the fact that the description of Lake Zurich does not shine with bright colors, there is definitely something to do here.  Especially for lovers of active water recreation.  To services of tourists - windsurfing, diving, water skiing.  Sailing and yachting occupies a special position among the preferences of tourists.  And of course, fishing.  The best in Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The land is rich in land entertainment.  Basically, these are mountain walks calling at local villages where you can buy the freshest dairy products, vegetables and meat.  Fans of antiquity will find excellent routes to ancient castles and churches, of which a lot have been preserved on Lake Zurich. </p><p>  The period of festivals and national holidays is a special time for locals and tourists.  Fun performances take place on the streets, playgrounds are being built, cruise ships offer routes with a special entertainment program that includes songs and dances. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Direct flights to Zurich depart from Moscow, as well as from St. Petersburg.  If you decide to go to the lake while traveling in Europe, then you can get on comfortable trains from all European cities. </p><p>  You can rent a car so that you can slowly enjoy the views of Alpine villages, stop at dairy farms, and try local food and drinks.  In addition, if you are considering all the options for how to get to Lake Zurich, do not ignore river transport.  To this end, about twenty ferries and cruise liners of the Stadt Zurich company, as well as five steamships of the company Stadt Rappelsville, ply the lake.  Interestingly, shipping companies have been operating since 1909. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.malloryontravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cruise ship" class="if uuid-3231416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231416.jpg"></div><h2>  Cruises and river walks </h2><p>  Zurich Lake in Switzerland is famous for its cruises.  The season begins in April and ends in October.  The main point for the departure of liners is the marina of Burklaplats in Zurich.  Here you can not only buy a ticket for a lake walk, which lasts an hour and a half.  You can also rent a boat, which is nice to ride on the Limmat River, which flows into the lake and feeds it with its own waters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Boat trips at sunrise and before sunset are especially popular.  For the sake of this spectacle, tourists come to Lake Zurich not only from nearby cities.  Here you can meet people from all over Europe and even America. </p><p>  The small village of Rappelsville, which is also a large port for water transport, is an area for a comfortable life.  Real estate in this part of Zurich, although expensive, is well-maintained according to all the canons of architecture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theselfishyears.files.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="swans on the lake" class="if uuid-3231413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231413.jpg"></div><h2>  Upper and Lower Lakes </h2><p>  Before choosing a vacation on Lake Zurich, photos of which are presented in the article, remember that there are two of them.  One shallow, overgrown with thickets of reeds and water lilies.  Guides and experienced tourists advise this place to those who prefer a relaxing holiday with a fishing rod in their hands.  You don‚Äôt really swim there and you can‚Äôt frolic in the water, but the place is ideal for fishermen.  This is all Upper Lake. </p><p>  With Lower Lake, everything is exactly the opposite.  It is striking in its depth, and this place is a great option for lovers of diving and all kinds of dives to the depths.  On the territory of the Lower Lake there are beaches equipped for swimming with clean beaches cleaned of grass.  There you can have a great time with children, sunbathe and swim in the clear waters of Lake Zurich. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inyourpocket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sailing regatta" class="if uuid-3231419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231419.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels and guest houses </h2><p>  On the shores of the lake there is no such problem as the lack of hotels.  On the contrary.  Along the coast, in different directions, entire groups of small cozy hotels and guest houses are located.  I must say that in general the cost of the hotel fund of Zurich is quite high, and you will not find ordinary European hostels here.  Be prepared to pay $ 50 per day for a day of your stay in a comfortable hotel.  For this amount, you will be provided with all the items necessary for a comfortable everyday life, and they will also organize a wholesome breakfast of products that are delivered by local farmers to the table. </p><div class="photo" data-original="patch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beach on the lake" class="if uuid-3231422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231422.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Zurich Lake and its environs are not in great demand among travelers who prefer warm ocean waters and hot sand under their feet.  However, those who visited this alpine pearl are very pleased with their trip and do not regret it at all.  According to tourists, everything is exactly as the travel agencies represented, and the place met their expectations.  Tourists praise the dishes that are prepared in local restaurants, drinks, and especially wine.  He is advised to definitely try even those who do not drink alcohol at all.  Travelers are delighted with cruise trips, which is what Alpine holidays are designed for. </p>
