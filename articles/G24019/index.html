    <p>  The first step is filling out information on the vehicle.  In this section it is necessary to indicate: make and model, identification number, state registration plate of the machine, series and number of Title or certificate of registration.  After the introduction, it is necessary to check all data for validity in order to avoid errors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Personal data for the contract </h2><p>  After entering the vehicle data, you will need to provide information about the policyholder and owner.  For this you need a passport.  In order to conduct online registration of OSAGO "ROSGOSSTRAKH" (customer reviews indicate), the following data must be entered: passport information, date of birth, registration address and contact details. </p><h2>  The final stage of the acquisition of the policy </h2><p>  After entering all the necessary information, it remains to verify the accuracy of the specified information and make a payment.  You can pay by any credit card.  After payment is made, the CTPL electronic form will be registered in a single PCA database and sent to you electronically by e-mail.  It remains only to print the form and put it in the car. </p><h2>  Difficulties in acquiring a contract </h2><p>  There are some difficulties when buying OSAGO online ("ROSGOSSTRAKH").  Customer reviews suggest that not everyone can purchase the required form as simple as the insurance company promises. </p><p>  The first problem is checking the diagnostic card.  The thing is that cars older than three years, according to the law, must undergo a technical inspection.  As a result of the inspection, each driver receives a diagnostic card form. </p><p>  All diagnostic cards are registered in a single EAISTO database.  It turns out that if the form is lost, the representative of the police or the insurance company can check its availability by identification number. </p><p>  When you register CTP on the company‚Äôs website, it‚Äôs not possible to check for a technical inspection.  It turns out that car owners over three years old can not yet use online insurance.  In the future, these problems promise to fix. </p><p>  When issuing OSAGO through the World Wide Web, an inspection of KMB takes place (discount for a trouble-free year).  Very often, drivers complain that the current discounts are not reflected, and the company offers to issue a policy without them.  It turns out that in order to save discounts, you must personally contact the company office and conclude an agreement. </p><h2>  Buying a policy online </h2><p>  How to buy cheap OSAGO online?  Reviews of some insurance companies are beckoning, promising an insurance policy with a good discount.  It is no secret to anyone that over the past year the value of the insurance contract has almost doubled.  In connection with this increase, almost every motorist is forced to look for a company that will offer a compulsory policy at a minimum price. </p>

As a rule, company representatives are ready to provide an additional discount due to commission.  Agree, it is more profitable and more convenient.  Many insurance agents are ready to deliver a CTP policy for free, at any place and time convenient for you.

    <h2>  Online Insurance Fraud </h2><p>  Today online insurance is in great demand.  Reviews speak about all the benefits of a quick policy purchase.  The thing is that the so-called insurance brokers offer to buy an insurance policy at the lowest price, for only 2-3 thousand rubles. </p><p>  This form is false, but visually is no different from the present.  At the same time, customers know that these are not genuine forms, but they are purchased only to provide police officers on the road.  It turns out that many cannot afford to buy an expensive policy and protect themselves on the road. </p><p>  However, there are companies that offer online insurance for the lowest price.  Reviews of people who have already used the services of this organization must be studied, and only after that make payment.  There are many scammers on the World Wide Web who want to sell fake and make good money. </p><h2>  What to do if you purchased a fake policy online </h2><p>  Unfortunately, every third policy that is sold through the Internet is a fake.  In order not to become a victim of scammers, do not agree to pay the policy in advance.  Let's consider in more detail how to check the CTP form for authenticity. </p><p>  The first thing to do is to purchase a compulsory insurance contract with home delivery and payment to the courier.  You should not pay in advance for the policy, there is a risk that you will not receive it at all. </p>

This is done very simply.  In the upper right corner of the insurance policy is located the individual number of the form, which is registered in a single PCA database.  You need to go to the site and check whether the policy really belongs to this insurance company.  If it is not possible to check the database, it can be distinguished by visual signs.

    <h2>  Visual differences of the real CTP policy from false </h2><p>  This policy is a couple of centimeters longer than a regular A4 sheet. </p><p>  On the original letterhead, on the back, is a protective silver thread that is sewn into the polis.  A fake silver dotted line is simply printed on the fake. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of the original form is the PCA inscription visible in the light.  This is a kind of protective hologram. </p><p>  The number of this policy is convex, which can be determined by touch. </p><p>  Thanks to these tips, every motorist will be able to identify a fake policy and protect themselves from waste. </p><h2>  What to do if a fake OSAGO form is purchased </h2><p>  In most cases, policyholders will find out that the purchased policy is not real, only upon the occurrence of an insured event.  When contacting an insurance company, such customers are refused.  How to be in a similar situation?  Unfortunately, the refusal of the insurance company to pay is a legitimate action. </p>

    <p>  As practice shows, it‚Äôs almost impossible to find scammers.  Therefore, experienced specialists advise, before paying for CTP insurance online, the reviews of people who have already used this service are studied very carefully. </p><p>  Do not trust the very first insurance broker who promises not only a form of a policy at the lowest price, but also free delivery.  If, after studying the reviews, you doubt whether to purchase the form or not, it is better to contact the insurer personally.  In the official office of the insurance company you can buy a real form, which will be a little more expensive. </p><p>  Risking and buying a form with a good discount or overpaying and be sure of its authenticity - each motorist decides independently. </p>
