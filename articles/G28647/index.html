    <h2>  Island history </h2><p>  The island has been inhabited since the Paleolithic era.  The first inhabitants who inhabited Kefalonia were the Leleg tribes (15th century BC), they worshiped the king of the sea Poseidon.  In the Bronze Age, the ancient Greek peoples of Tilev and Tafia lived here. </p><p>  According to one version, the island of Kefalonia (Greece) got its name in honor of the mythological hero Kefal.  Some historians associate the name of the island with the genus Kefalins.  Homer called the island of Sami, but in his time it was still little populated.  Since the classical period, the island is known by its current name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the Middle Ages, the island was part of the Byzantine Empire.  Later it was captured by different peoples: Venetians, Turks and Normans.  Since 1797, Kefallinia was under the protectorate of Venice, and later the French occupied the island.  Under the influence of the French revolutionaries, the local population overthrew the feudal system.  Subsequently, Kefalonia entered the so-called state of the 7 Ionian Islands.  In 1864, all the Ionian Islands merged with Greece. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kefalonia on the map of greece" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/371656.jpg?1397164872930" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Shrines of Kefalonia </h2><p>  Having seen all of the above attractions on the island, you can continue excursions in Kefalonia to the shrines.  There are two monasteries here - St. Andrew Miliapidias and St. Gerasimus.  Both of these monasteries are female. </p><p>  Saint Gerasimos, who led an ascetic life in caves, is the patron saint of Kefalonia.  An ascetic was born in 1506 in the city of Trikala (Peloponnese).  After receiving his education, he began to travel throughout Greece, managed to visit Constantinople.  On Mount Athos, he began his monastic lifestyle in Kapsala Cave.  Later he went to Jerusalem, where for 12 years he served in the <span>Church of the Holy Sepulcher.</span> </p><p>  Wishing peace and solitude, the saint goes to the island of Zakif.  And in 1555 he moved to Kefalonia, here he lives for five years in the Lassi cave near Argostoli (at the present time a temple was built above it).  Since 1560, he moves to the Omala region, where he carries out restoration of the chapel and builds a convent with a sisterhood.  He called it "New Jerusalem." </p><p>  A cave with a narrow entrance has survived to this day, where the saint lived for about 19 years.  Gerasim died in 1579.  His relics are in a glass crab in the church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  In the monastery there are three plane trees planted by Gerasim himself, 37 small wells and three springs.  The saint is known for being able to rid himself of obsession. </p><p>  The monastery of St. Andrew Milapidias was founded in the Byzantine era.  In 1264 he was transferred to the Latin episcopacy.  After a hundred years, it fell into decay and was reborn only in 1579, when it was bought by three sisters - Leonty, Benedict and Magdalen.  They settle in it, and soon the monastic community is growing.  In 1639, after a shipwreck, the Greek-Romanian Princess Roxanne fell into the monastery.  She made a huge property contribution to the monastery, but most importantly, the princess gave the monastery the relics of St. Apostle Andrew the First-Called from Mount Athos.  The monastery also has a museum with rare ancient icons and relics. </p><h2>  Phenomenal phenomenon </h2><p>  A rather unique phenomenon occurs in the village of Markopulo.  There, on the day of the Assumption of the Virgin, an incredible amount of <span>poisonous snakes crawl</span> on their heads with a small cross.  They rush to the church, climb right into its dome, and then crawl to the icon of the Virgin.  Surprisingly, until the very end of the service they do not leave her.  The local population reveres snakes as saints.  Many consider this a good omen. </p><h2>  Kefalonia island, Greece.  Hotels </h2><ul><li>  Emelisse 4 *.
