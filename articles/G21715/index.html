    <h2>  Despo Hotel 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  According to the reviews of many tourists, relaxing in this hotel is pleasant, and most importantly - economically.  Although the hotel is located on the 3rd line of the beach, it was not so far from it, moreover, after a hearty breakfast it is even pleasant to walk.  The staff watched the beach: there was no rubbish or loud vacationers.  But sunbeds and umbrellas are paid.  Tourists were satisfied with the number: although it is small, but comfortable, it suits a modest family.  It was unpleasant to find out that only beds and showers were free, everything else, if you want it to work, you had to pay.  And the view from the windows is beautiful, and the price, in principle, suited many.  In short, the hotel is perfect for a budget holiday. </p><p>  Many guests noted that it is very convenient to stay here for those who do not want to overpay for an overnight stay.  The rooms are comfortable, comfortable, linen is clean, everything was needed.  In addition, the friendly staff tried to please everything, smiled and responded to any requests.  The beach and the sea are gorgeous, there are many entertainments for every taste and budget.  The service is wonderful, no need to get to the airport for a long time. </p><p>  What else do guests of the <span>Despo 3 *</span> hotel <span>(Greece, Crete)</span> say <span>?</span>  <span>About nutrition, reviews are also mostly positive.</span>  <span>Tourists</span> highlight wonderful and delicious cuisine.  In many "star" hotels, dishes are much worse in quality and inferior in variety.  Everything is fresh here, and from the abundance ripples in the eyes, the desire to go to restaurants and spend extra money completely disappears.  Parents were pleased with the availability of a children's menu.  Of course, small picks often refuse the proposed dishes, because there are exotic dishes, but the native porridge goes with a bang.  The hotel itself, although small, but very beautiful and comfortable, is suitable for families with children.  Pleased with the availability of entertainment: the kids are always busy with their important things on the playground or in the pool, so parents can calmly sunbathe and relax. </p><p>  However, many tourists noticed that the hotel is not always comfortable staying with animals.  The administration allows you to bring with you only pets weighing less than 3 kg, which is not very convenient.  But the beauty and convenience of the hotel is not inferior to the network giants.  The cuisine is delicious and diverse, the rooms are clean and comfortable, the beach is pleasant, and the sea is warm - all that is needed to escape from everyday problems and gain new strength. </p>
