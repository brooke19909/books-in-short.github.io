His great-grandfather, Nikolai Ivanovich, was a colonel.  He took part in the Battle of Borodino and was a knight of the Order of St. George IV degree, and in the 1840s he acted as Perm city man. </p><p>  Father F.I. Trukhina, Ivan Alekseevich, rose to the rank of staff captain, and after his resignation he became a full-time state adviser and an indispensable member of the provincial presence of the city of Kostroma.  Rumors that he was allegedly the leader of the local nobility did not find documentary evidence. </p>

    <h2>  The fate of loved ones </h2><p>  The Trukhins family had five children: four sons - Alexei, Sergey, Fedor and Ivan, as well as the youngest daughter - Maria.

In World War I he fought in the army under the command of General Samsonov.  He died in <span>East Prussia</span> in the summer of 1914.  Ivan and his father were shot by the Bolsheviks in 1919.  It turned out that they were one of the organizers of the peasant anti-Soviet uprising in their native Kostroma district. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 1920s, Sergey Trukhin studied the native land and was a member of the local scientific community.  Despite the fact that he was not a military man, he was also repressed in 1938.  By that time, only one brother remained alive - Fedor Ivanovich Trukhin. </p>

    <h2>  In captivity </h2><p>  General Fedor Ivanovich Trukhin, whose biography changed dramatically after the German invasion of the USSR, on June 27, 1941, on the orders of Colonel General Kuznetsov, who was then the commander of the North-Western Front, went to observe the withdrawal of Soviet troops in the Penevezys area.  It turned out that just south of the Lithuanian city of Jakobstadt a column of enemy armored vehicles broke through.  Trukhin‚Äôs car was spotted and shot.  His adjutant died, and the general himself was wounded and taken prisoner.  On October 6 of the same year, the GUK NCO for No. 090 him, as a missing person, was excluded from the lists of the Red Army. </p><p>  On June 30, Fyodor Ivanovich was taken to a camp, located in the city of Stallupenen (now Nesterov, Kaliningrad Region).  A little later he was transferred to Hammelburg in Oflag XIII-D.  In October, he signed the document, thereby giving his consent to fight against Soviet power on the side of Nazi Germany.  He immediately joined the RTNP (Russian Labor People's Party) and began to develop a number of documents for transmission to the German government. </p><p>  Trukhin held various posts in the propaganda camps of Wustrau and Zittenhorst.

    <h2>  Vlasov General </h2><p>  In the winter of 1943, Fedor Ivanovich Trukhin visited Berlin.  There, when he was visiting Baydakov, he was introduced to Lieutenant General A. A. Vlasov, and on March 25 he received an offer to head the ROA school in Dabendorf.  There, he worked first as the head of the training unit, and then completely headed it.  Trukhin's responsibilities included organizing the selection of cadets and their training.  It was he who managed to turn ordinary propaganda courses into a real center for training high-class command personnel for the future Vlasov army. </p><p>  In March 1945, in Slovakia, near Bratislava, Trukhin organized an intelligence school for a hundred cadets for KONR (Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia).  Despite the fact that he had noble roots, he was very cautious about the entry into this organization of former White Movement participants, including such as B.S. Permikin and A.V. Turkul. </p><p>  Given the April situation at the front, Fyodor Ivanovich was appointed commander in chief of the KONR Southern Group.  It was he who initiated the advancement of his troops in the Czech Republic with the goal of uniting them with a group of Major General S. K. Bunyachenko.  In early May, the Southern Group and the headquarters of the KONR Armed Forces were located in Austria, near Reinbach.  While he was negotiating with representatives of the American army, he received news of the whereabouts of A. A. Vlasov, as well as the decision of S. K. Bunyachenko to take the side of the Czechs preparing the Prague uprising. </p><p>  To clarify the joint actions, Major General V. G. Baersky was sent to them.  When he did not return, Trukhin decided to go to Bunyachenko and Vlasov himself.  On the way to them, he, along with General M. M. Shapovalov, was captured by Czech partisans on May 8, and the next day handed over to the Soviet command, which transported him to Moscow. </p>

    <h2>  Pay </h2><p>  A criminal case against Trukhin was initiated in early September 1942, as soon as the Soviet government learned of his betrayal.  At the initial stage, the deputy chief of the NKVD investigative unit, State Security Captain Zarubin, was engaged in this matter.  On December 8, 1945, the former Red Army general was sentenced to be shot, but at the end of March next year this decision was canceled. </p><p>  The investigation was resumed again.  This time, the inquiry was led by Major Kovalenko, an employee of the SMERSH GUKR.  On April 11, General Trukhin Fedor Ivanovich was acquainted with the indictment, after which he fully admitted his guilt.  According to the HCVF sentence, he and several of his associates were hanged on the night of August 1.  The execution took place on the territory of the <span>Butyrka prison.</span>  On January 7, 1947, Trukhin was posthumously stripped of all awards and titles by a special decree of the Presidium of the USSR Armed Forces. </p>
