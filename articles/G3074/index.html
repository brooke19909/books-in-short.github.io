    <h2>  Check-in, cleaning </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, the administrators of the Vera Seagate Resort, which we are now reviewing, in most cases adhere to the hotel policy regarding the check-in of newly arrived guests in their rooms after two in the afternoon.  However, some tourists managed to speed up this process by paying a certain amount.  But in any case, even if you arrive at the hotel early in the morning, you will not have to spend several hours in the lobby with your suitcases waiting for check-in.  So, upon arrival, they will immediately put on your bracelets, and you can use the entire infrastructure of the hotel along with other guests, leaving things at the reception. </p><p>  As for the cleaning of the rooms, in general, our compatriots were satisfied with its quality.  True, according to them, the maids sometimes came at a not very convenient time or forgot to leave clean towels, but these problems were solved after a call to the reception.  Cleaning is carried out every day.  Towels and bed linen are updated several times a week.  By the way, many guests note that both towels and linen are new and snow-white.  So using these items is a pleasure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel vera seagate resort" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1022894.jpg" width="600"></div>
