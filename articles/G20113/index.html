    <h2>  About booking </h2><p>  Capital Coast Resort &amp; Spa 4 * <span>(Cyprus)</span> receives mostly positive <span>reviews</span> .  And many people, having read the comments pleasing to the eye, decide to experience all this on themselves.  Therefore, the numbers "grab" very quickly, especially shortly before the start of the season.  Therefore, it is better to reserve an apartment a couple of months before the trip. </p><p>  Check-in at 15:00 and check-out until noon.  The hotel can accommodate children of any age.  If the child is not even two years old, then a separate cot is provided.  And you do not need to pay extra for accommodation.  Only in order to receive it, you must contact the property.  And at least a day before arrival - so that the staff has time to prepare the crib and install it in the room. </p><p>  It should also be noted that when booking, you will need to indicate not only your details, but also credit card information.  The hotel warns that they can block the funds in the account before the arrival of the guests.  This acts as a guarantee.  Since many people reserve rooms in advance in order to leave them for themselves, and then cancel them because of broken plans or poorly planned trips.  And this does not allow real guests to book apartments.  So a guarantee is needed. </p><h2>  About staff </h2><p>  Now we can say a few words about what tourists leave about staying at Capital Coast Resort &amp; Spa 4 * reviews.  They are mostly positive, and this can be understood. </p><p>  Many guests pay special attention to the staff and the quality of service.  Actually, this is an important nuance.  Firstly, it is encouraging that the staff speaks six languages.  These are Turkish, French, English, German, Greek and Russian.  The latter is especially pleasing to people who are not polyglot. </p><p>  As many claim, despite the fact that the check-in starts at 15:00, the administration can make concessions and check in guests earlier than this time.  If, of course, there is such an opportunity (or, in other words, the room has already been prepared and put in order after the recently arrived guests).  The rooms are cleaned carefully, towels are changed every other day. </p><p>  By the way, guests recommend booking apartments with pool views.  There, they claim, is quieter.  But, in principle, you can always close the door to the balcony and, if it's hot, turn on the air conditioning. </p>

    <h2>  What else is worth knowing </h2><p>  Many people leave reviews about Capital Coast Resort &amp; Spa 4 *.  The year 2016 was successful for Greece, especially in the summer.  Many of our compatriots flew to her resorts.  And many stayed at this hotel. </p><p>  Tourists say that the pool is very helpful.  There is access to the sea, you can literally walk in a couple of minutes, but in windy weather there are waves.  And there are stones too.  Although it scares only those people who are used to the sandy bottom and the beach.  In fact, stones are not so bad.  The sea is rarely polluted, and the inconvenient entrance can be endured.  However, every 15-20 minutes from a nearby bus stop there is a flight to a sandy beach called Coral Bay.  A ticket costs one and a half euros.  You can buy a travel card.  Daily, unlimited costs five euros.  But a taxi for a short distance will cost 10-12 euros. </p><p>  In general, people who visited here liked the rest.  This conclusion can be made based on reviews.  So, for example, many people say - if you order a cocktail at the bar, then you can give a second one for free, and then also shot or even a hookah.  By the way, in the bar and restaurant there is a very wide variety of dishes and drinks, everyone will find something for themselves. </p><p>  In general, this is an excellent hotel, corresponding to the level of four stars.  If you want a vacation to be remembered for a long time, you should go here. </p>
