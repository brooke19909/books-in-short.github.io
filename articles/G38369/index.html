    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Finally - a few words about what Anda Beachside Hotel 4 * <span>(Phuket)</span> receives <span>reviews.</span>  In general, guests looking forward to a budget holiday in a pleasant place are satisfied.  At first, the hotel evokes mixed feelings, as it is located next to the road.  But the way the rooms are provided completely smooths this impression.  The apartments, one might say, are ideal - everything is new, the furniture is comfortable, air conditioning with climate control, a lot of decor elements, there are spotlights.  The rooms look really great.  So I do not want to leave them.  Guests are advised to take a "luxury" if possible. </p><p>  Even at the reception they give out towels for a beach holiday, always clean and fresh.  In general, the staff here is excellent, as people who have been here assure.  If tourists arrived earlier than the time when check-in begins (which is from 14:00), then they will be settled, despite this.  Of course, if there are free rooms.  By the way, for the same reason, experienced travelers are advised to book apartments in advance. </p><p>  And of course, attention is paid to a good location.  Yes, the hotel is located next to the road.  But there is everything nearby that can come in handy!  These are restaurants, shops, currency exchange points, pharmacies, massage parlors - you do not need to go anywhere, everything is nearby. </p><p>  In general, if we make a general conclusion, we can confidently say: this is a hotel for those people who dream to spend their holidays in an exotic place while living in luxurious apartments.  You should go here and see for yourself. </p>
