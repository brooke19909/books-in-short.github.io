    <p>  The history of the island is rooted in antiquity.  Then he was named after the great hunter Kefal, the ancestor of Odysseus.  By the way, the homeland of Odyssey - Ithaca - is separated from Kefalonia by a strait of 3.5 kilometers wide.  Not so long ago, ancient burial places were found here, testifying to the presence on Kefalonia of the kings of the island, the ancestors of the hero of the Homeric poem. </p><p>  An abundance of attractions is what Kefalonia is known for.  Reviews about them are so attractive that you involuntarily want to see all this with your own eyes.  The capital of Argostoli is famous for its museums - archaeological and ethnographic.  Here are collected all the finds of archaeologists, allowing deeper understanding of the history of the island and the whole of Greece.  Of the natural attractions, the cave of St. Gerasim was most popular.  This hermit has lived in a cave his whole life; he is considered the patron saint of the island.  Lixouri is the second largest city of Kefalonia.  Here you can visit the old library, the Jacobath Palace, as well as wander through the ruins of the ancient state of Pali. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the most amazing places on the island of Kefalonia, reviews of which are certainly left by all the tourists who have been there, is the Melissama Cave.  In antiquity, it was the sanctuary of the pasture god Pan.  Inside this cave is a lake with perfectly clear <span>azure-colored</span> water <span>.</span>  Once the cave was completely plunged into darkness, but over time its dome collapsed, and now the sun freely penetrates into it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kefalonia reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/283448.jpg" width="600"></div>

Rare representatives of the flora grow here, many of which are listed in the Red Book. </p><p>  The beaches of Kefalonia will not leave anyone indifferent.  Mitros beach is rightfully recognized as the best, the line of which is covered with white fine sand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece Kefalonia hotels" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/283451.jpg" width="600"></div>  In any part of the coast you can find good housing.
