In addition, the hotel organizes banquets, buffets and tea and coffee breaks. </p><h2>  Impressions of regular customers </h2><p>  It is comfortable in the hotel not only to domestic guests, but also to foreign ones.  Foreign television works for them.  Bring daily newspapers.  Therefore, guests are always aware of important events. </p><p>  The hotel is quite young, but has already successfully established itself in the metropolitan market.  However, many people who have already spent time in this institution claim that every year the service is getting worse.  Workers are often inhospitable and tired.  It is not uncommon to have to call twice before bringing what is missing to the room. </p><p>  Another negative point is the distant location from other institutions.  If you do not like the kitchen that the complex offers, you will have to look for another restaurant for a long time.  There are no upscale cafes nearby.  But most visitors are delighted with the dishes and menus. </p><p>  Nearby is a shopping center, which is connected to the hotel by a passage.  There you can buy everything you need. </p><p>  Getting to the place with your car is not easy, there are traffic jams around.  Saves the proximity of the metro to the Renaissance Monarch Hotel.  Leningradsky Prospekt 31a - the address of the complex. </p>

    <h2>  Key Issues </h2><p>  Each room is equipped according to international requirements.  There is a TV, a reliable safe, landline phones.  There is a minibar.  But if you do not leave a deposit at the entrance, it is closed right in front of the visitor‚Äôs nose, customers complain.  An iron and ironing board are also included.  Like any high-quality establishment, the Renaissance Moscow Monarch Center hotel made sure that the rooms had a comfortable, well-lit workplace.  Phones are equipped with a speakerphone and an answering machine.  Therefore, guests share, you can do business without leaving the hotel. </p><p>  Among the rooms there is a five-room presidential suite. </p><p>  The walls are well soundproofed.  Neighbors and noise from the corridor are not heard, as guests say.  But the windows miss the sounds.  The construction work and the signals of the machines interfere with sleep in the morning.  However, most residents of large cities are accustomed to such "music." </p><p>  The Renaissance Monarch establishment offers large and spacious rooms.  The rooms have expensive air conditioning, the air is clean and fresh. </p>

    <h2>  The view of the guests </h2><p>  Very spacious bathtubs.  There is a hairdryer and a full set of hygiene products.  But visitors are confused by the manufacturer - China.  Often customers complain that there are not enough bathrobes, towels or slippers.  However, if you inform the staff about this trouble, then these things will immediately bring.  There are no toothbrushes and caps for a shower, guests complain.  Dressing gowns are standard size, so full people are not comfortable wearing them. </p><p>  A pleasant surprise for guests is the fact that in addition to a minibar in the rooms, electric kettles and coffee with tea.  There is also an ice bucket.  The beds are very wide and soft. </p><p>  It has a very convenient location "Renaissance Monarch".  Metro is nearby.  You can exit at the Dynamo or Jogging stations.  The hotel is only 5-10 minutes walk.  Near the main attractions of the capital.  Therefore, it is immediately good to go on excursions from here. </p><h2>  Comfortable rest </h2><p>  You can come with children.  The pool is shallow for them.  And staff, upon request, can deliver two small cots to your room.  However, parents recommend that you first read the menu.  After all, not all guys like foreign delicacies.  Therefore, someone may remain hungry. </p><p>  In general, it meets all the standards of the Renaissance Monarch.  The hotel is very stylish and beautiful.  However, along with the pros, there are minor disadvantages.  For example, often the equipment in the room does not work.  Therefore, to use a kettle or iron, you have to contact the administration. </p><p>  Another of the significant disadvantages is electronic keys.  Eviction must take place before 12:00 p.m.  If you forget something in the room, you will have to call the administrator, because you cannot open the door with your card. </p>
