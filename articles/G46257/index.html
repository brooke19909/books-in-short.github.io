Many tourists come to this place to enjoy the fabulously beautiful nature and architectural attractions.  The places here are picturesque: green hills, bottomless lakes, dense forests, and in the center of all this beauty is the legendary Trakai Castle.  This building is one of the best examples of Gothic.  The palace of the prince is surrounded by a thick fortified wall with defensive towers.  The interior consists of frescoes, stained glass windows depicting moments from the life of Lithuanian rulers. </p>

The second was built earlier and during the battles took the brunt.  He was repeatedly captured by the crusaders and destroyed to the ground.  Trakai Castle was built in 1409, at that time it was the most beautiful and powerful in the whole principality, therefore it repeatedly became the residence of rulers.  Enemies have never managed to conquer a fortress, which was considered the most impregnable in all of Eastern Europe.  The castle lost its military significance after the <span>Battle of Grunwald,</span> then Prince Vytautas arranged here chic receptions of foreign ambassadors, feasts for meeting distinguished guests.

The Trakai castle was first destroyed only in the XVII century, but until that time the Crusaders, to fight with which it was built, have long been forgotten.  In the 15th century, on the basis of <span>Magdeburg Law,</span> Vitovt granted Trakai self-government, and in the future rulers did not interfere in the life of this city.  Citizens paid tribute for the right to be considered independent, and also guarded bridges and fortresses. </p>

Trakai Castle lost its former grandeur, and the town itself became provincial.  In 1665, the fortress was captured and plundered by the Russian <span>Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich.</span>  The reason for this act lay in the myriad riches hidden in the cellars of the castle.  The conquerors did not find anything, because the locals managed to take out the treasures, and some of them were hidden at the bottom of the lakes.  By the twentieth century, only ruins remained from once powerful structures.

    <p>  Trakai Castle began to be restored only in the 30s of the last century, and serious work was carried out only after the end of the war.  In the 80s, the Island Fortress was restored exactly as it was under Prince Vitovt in the 15th century.  During archaeological excavations, scientists discovered several treasures, but most of them are still stored at the bottom of the lakes.  The number of exhibits totals more than 100 thousand, and all of them are genuine.  Recently, Trakai Castle has again begun to receive foreign guests to sign important documents.  Presidents of many countries, monarchs of Sweden and Denmark visited it. </p>
