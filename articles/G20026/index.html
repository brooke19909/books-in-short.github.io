In Russia, the <span>cost of living</span> is slightly more than this amount.  And so it is logical that people think about the opportunities that they will have.  You can often hear that someone exists for 10,000 per month for 1 person, and some even contain for this amount a whole family of several members.  And all this is far from a fairy tale.  Therefore, it is sometimes very difficult to understand how to live on 10,000 rubles a month. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to live on 10,000 rubles a month" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130620.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  With payments </h2><p>  In general, it is customary to believe that you can live alone on the indicated amount.  But only if you constantly deny yourself everything.  Indeed, in this matter, it is also necessary to take into account <span>utility bills.</span>  In most cases, these costs (they are classified as basic, mandatory) take about 5000. </p><p>  Only half remains.  In principle, the average student is able to live like this and eat normally.  But rarely.  No frills, daily meat consumption and some delicacies.  It‚Äôs enough to buy everything you need.  For many, such marginal savings are simply unacceptable.  Therefore, if people are interested in how to live on 10,000 rubles a month, often implies the absence of spending on utilities.  In this situation, you can follow some useful tips that will not let you deny yourself everything. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Supermarkets </h2><p>  You should completely forget about such a word as ‚Äúsupermarket‚Äù.  In a crisis, prices are rising extremely fast.  And so one purchase in a store costs the average buyer in Russia about <span>500 rubles.</span>  Purchased products are usually enough for 2-3 days maximum. </p><p>  What turns out?  If you take 500 rubles to the food store every 2 days, then the monthly expenses per person will be 7,500 rubles.  This amount includes only the most necessary products.  It turns out that one person can live on 10,000 per month.  But a family or a couple is no longer there.  But how do people somehow cope with this situation?  Indeed it is.  How?  They just don‚Äôt go to supermarkets every day.  And in general they forget about their existence. </p><h2>  Markets </h2><p>  Considering how to live on a family of 3 people for 10,000 rubles a month?  This is actually not so difficult.  Of course, a lot depends on where you live.  In Moscow, for example, it is impossible to ‚Äúmeet‚Äù even the indicated amount alone, not to mention a couple or family.  Therefore, we will not talk with you about the capital, but the average provincial town. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to live on a family of 3 people for 10,000 rubles a month" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130622.jpg"></div>

    <p>  They forgot about supermarkets.  Wonderful.  But where then to buy products?  The answer is simple - the market.  It is here that you can find the same products, but at a lower cost.  In addition, in the markets very often the quality of the products is better.  It is advisable to purchase for a long period of time.  And often do not go shopping.  In this case, you don‚Äôt have to rack your brains on how to live a family of 3 people for 10,000 rubles a month.  In general, if you do not pay attention to various goodies and harmful products, then buying on the market will help to survive the crisis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Without children </h2><p>  And here is a rule that can save you from unnecessary and unwanted expenses in difficult times.  This is especially true for those who think how to live a family of 4 or more for 10,000 rubles a month.  And indeed, in any cell of society where there are children. </p><p>  It is extremely simple - go shopping strictly without younger family members.  To explain to the child that you cannot buy him a toy or Kinder due to the fact that you do not have money, as practice shows, is useless.  Instead of understanding, you will get tantrums, tears, and resentment.  As a result, an extra purchase will be made, which is not very cheap at current prices.  Or the child harbors a grudge against you that will make itself felt in the future.  Therefore, you will have to make all purchases without small children.  Then it will not be necessary to panic once again how to live for a family of 10,000 rubles a month. </p><h2>  Goodies </h2><p>  Another rule is to buy only the most necessary.  No matter how you would like, but in a difficult financial situation, you will be forced to take products without frills.  That is why advice has already been given - not to go shopping with children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to live on a family of 2 people for 10,000 rubles a month" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130619.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Please note: you also have to deprive yourself of the pleasures in food.  No chips, Coke, sodas, prepared pizzas and so on.  To live on 10,000, you need to buy only those products that are stored for a long time, do not indulge the stomach, but saturate it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is worth forgetting about different cakes, pastries, as well as some fruits and vegetables.  On average, a kilogram of apples now costs about 70 rubles.  It is enough for one person, for example, for 3 days.  In this case, restrictions on fruits and vegetables can be lifted.  If the family has children, then you will have to deny yourself this pleasure almost always.  After all, all vitamins will need to be given to the rising generation to the maximum. </p><h2>  Semi-finished products </h2><p>  How to live together for 10,000 rubles a month?  It has already been said that you should buy everything you need and on average leave in stores at 500 rubles a day.  But not for a person, but for two.  With such purchases, you can really live and eat normally. </p><p>  However, it is difficult to comply with this rule.  What else can be abandoned to cope with the crisis?  For example, from semi-finished products.  Finished products are a huge waste.  And the portions that will be offered to you will be extremely small.  Sometimes one dinner (for example, pizza 350 grams) costs 300 rubles.  But there is still breakfast and lunch! </p><p>  Do you need to somehow live a month for 10,000 together?  Feel free to go around all the counters in stores with semi-finished products and finished products.  For example, supermarkets have their own kitchens where they prepare meals.  Forget about them too.  And remember the holy rule of economy - now you have to cook all the time yourself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to live on a family of 4 people for 10,000 rubles a month" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130618.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Stocks </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt go to supermarkets, you will have to use one little trick.  How to live together for 10,000 rubles a month on food alone?  Or, for example, a small family? </p><p>  A variety of sales and <span>promotions in stores</span> will help here <span>.</span>  <span>Flyers</span> are often thrown into the mailbox <span>,</span> in which you can always see which goods are sold at what discount and on what date.  Compare, choose the products you need and go shopping at a particular store.  This does not mean that you need to immediately buy everything.  Sales and promotions must be approached wisely. </p><p>  This option can be used if you do not want to severely limit yourself.  Yes, you will not be able to afford most fruits and vegetables, but if you look carefully, you can always buy them at moderate prices at sales.  That is how people survive the crisis by 10,000 rubles.  They study stocks, choose the best deals, and then go shopping.  The main thing is not to forget about the measures.  And do not watch products that are not necessary. </p><h2>  Bookmarks </h2><p>  How to live on 10,000 rubles a month with two children?  Are there any other means of saving and survival for families?  They are available, but not everyone will be able to observe them. </p><p>  A good option is to control your own spending.  Get yourself a special diary.  In it, make bookmarks with banknotes for every day.  200 rubles a day.  This is the amount you can spend on products.  And then try to minimize the number of shopping trips.  Did you miss 1 day?  Then next time you can spend not 200, but 400 rubles.  Etc. </p><p>  Of course, it‚Äôs better to spend less.  Collect all leftovers from the month and put them in the envelope.  Let it be funds for some outside needs.  For example, detergent, hygiene products or utensils.  It will be difficult for families with children to abide by this rule.  But a couple or a single person is quite real.  That's so easy and simple you can save, live on a small salary, and also save some money.  Even if it will be 200-600 rubles a month, it‚Äôs already good. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to live a family of 5 for 10,000 rubles a month" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130621.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Transport </h2><p>  Well, one cannot ignore such a moment as transport costs.  Sometimes the question is "How to live on 10,000 rubles a month?"  meaning that utility bills are not included in this amount, but other expenses are quite.  And transport too. </p><p>  The car can be left standing on the street.  And try to ride it to a minimum.  Don't you have it at all?  Then there will be no problems either.  It is better not to ride public transport either.  Or try to use buses / trolleybuses more.  Minibuses - an extreme option, when there is no other way. </p><p>  To live for 10,000, taking into account transport costs, walk more and walk.  Or bike / roller skate.  It is enough to exclude frequent travel by public transport and your own car, and you will notice a huge cost savings.  By the way, you can also forget about taxis. </p><h2>  Cafe </h2><p>  We have already said that the family is able to live on the amount indicated in the article, but will have to cook at home.  If you need to somehow hold out for a month (or live permanently) for 10,000, then no finished products and dishes. </p><p>  Cafes, restaurants and fast foods should be strictly prohibited.  If you want something "harmful", learn how to cook it at home.  For example, many favorite french fries or <span>chicken nuggets</span> can be home-made.  They are not inferior to those bought in a cafe.  Is that the price of such a treat will be less in the "home" version. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to live on a family of 10,000 rubles a month" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130617.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Can't learn how to cook any fast food dish?  Discard them completely.  Yes, it will be hard.  But sometimes you can‚Äôt do without such restrictions.  After all, saving shows the result only if you constantly monitor yourself.  Also avoid shopping centers and places where you might be tempted to place an order. </p><h2>  Wholesale bases </h2><p>  How to live on a family of 5 people for 10,000 rubles a month?  Only food expenses and nothing more are taken into account.  It would seem unrealistic to do this.  Or you have to exist, not live. </p><p>  But this is not so.  If you think carefully, then any family is able to live on the indicated money, if this amount goes only the purchase of products.  And to do this is not so difficult.  Just go shopping at wholesale stores.  It is in such places that you can purchase food at reduced prices. </p><p>  In some cities there are such wholesale food bases in which the prices of any product are simply ridiculous.  For example, instead of 600 rubles for 2 kilograms of chicken, you will give 250 rubles.  And while the quality of the products does not differ from the store version.  Or, packing a gelatin candy will cost 10 rubles, not 130. Similar places are available in every city.  And if you managed to find such a base, you can rejoice - you can live with the whole family for 10,000 rubles a month, without denying yourself anything. </p><p>  True, procuring on such bases will have to be thorough.  Sometimes it‚Äôs better to call a taxi once for the return trip.  Try to buy exclusively long-term storage products: freezing, cereals, pasta, cheeses, semi-finished products (this is allowed here), plus something that can generally ‚Äúlie‚Äù for a long time, such as sweets and chocolate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ak live on 10,000 rubles a month with two children" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130616.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The main problem of modern residents is that many believe that buying at wholesale food bases is simply humiliating.  Pride needs to be hidden away.  And then there will be no problems.  After all, products that are sold in such places are often outbid by the same supermarkets and make huge margins.  It turns out that for the same goods, buyers overpay. </p><p>  In the article we gave tips that will help you learn how to live on a family of 2 people or more for 10,000 rubles a month. </p>
