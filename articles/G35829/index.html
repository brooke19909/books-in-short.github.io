The reason for the high demand, judging by user reviews, is the high quality of the European assembly, modern design and innovative technologies.  But, like any equipment, washing machines from this manufacturer may fail.  The causes of failure can be different: improper operation, wear of components, marriage, etc. In this article, we will consider the main malfunctions of the Virpul washing machine with vertical loading, their characteristics, error codes that indicate a breakdown, elimination methods and tips for correct operation of the device. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The Virpul washing machine with vertical loading has all the functions that are available in front-mounted units.  The structural difference of vertical automatic machines is the location of the parts: doors for loading laundry and a control module located in the upper part of the case.  Detergent dispenser on the inside of the laundry door.  Many models of vertical automatic machines are equipped with rollers located on the bottom of the case, which allows you to move them without much effort. </p><p>  Another feature is the drum.  It is equipped with two wings.  Opening and closing the wings is done manually, by pressing the latch.  Thanks to this design, the user is able to report the laundry during washing, having previously stopped the running mode. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.skroutz.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine drum" class="if uuid-3138596" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3138596.jpg"></div><p>  It is this loading method that makes it possible to reduce the dimensions of the washing machine.  The width of such models is a maximum of 45 cm. Small dimensions allow you to install the equipment in rooms with a small area.  It should be noted that the indicator of linen capacity is from 5 to 8 kg, depending on the model of the washing machine. </p><h2>  Qualitative characteristics of washing machines </h2><p>  In models of this type of machine, dry laundry is loaded into the drum in the upper part of the body.  It is the type of download that indicates the main advantages of using this technique: </p><ol><li>  Interrupt the execution of an installed program.  If you need to change the program or add laundry to the machine, you can interrupt its operation and restart by installing another program. </li><li>  Control system options: mechanical, electronic or mixed control. </li><li>  Methods of warning about a malfunction of the Virpul washing machine.  Using the unit health diagnostic program allows owners to quickly identify the ‚Äúculprit‚Äù of a breakdown. </li><li>  The use of the additional Aqua Stop function protects the unit from water leaks during the execution of the Wash option.  When pressure changes, the unit will cease to function. </li><li>  Using innovative Sixth Sense technology.  This technology allows you to adjust the washing parameters taking into account the weight of the laundry placed in the drum.  The program used, in automatic mode, determines the required amount of water and the time it takes to wash, which reduces the consumption of water and electricity. </li><li>  Application of inverter direct drive motor.  Engines of this type are not equipped with brushes, which can significantly reduce the level of noise during the execution of installed programs.  The part is installed directly on the tank using fasteners. <div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="malfunction washing machine virpul" class="if uuid-3138572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3138572.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Types of management </h2><p>  The manufacturer produces models with three types of control.  The consumer has the opportunity to choose the best option for himself.  The control of the Virpul washing machine can be: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Electronic.  Such models are equipped with a display and buttons located on the control panel.  The program is installed using the buttons.  The display shows information about the time and wash cycle, as well as about breakdowns.  When determining a malfunction in the Virpul washing machine with vertical loading, a code value will be displayed on the display panel. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine with display" class="if uuid-3138612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3138612.jpg"></div></li><li>  Mechanical.  Such models are equipped with a manual regulator, with the help of which the necessary washing program is set.  Also on the control panel are service indicators that inform not only about the washing cycles that are being performed, but also about malfunctions. </li><li>  Combined.  On the control panel will be placed the mechanical adjustment keys and electronic control system. </li></ol><h2>  Compliance with the rules of operation </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the installation and start-up of the device, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the manufacturer's instructions, which indicate the types of functions, the programs used and how to manage them. </p><p>  When determining the location of the vertical loading washing machine, it is worth taking care of the free access to the upper space, where the laundry will be loaded and unloaded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine whirlpool" class="if uuid-3138588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3138588.jpg"></div><p>  Of great importance is the correct installation of the device.  Setting by level will exclude its vibration during the execution of specified programs.  The surface of the floor should be flat.  Judging by the feedback from users, for the correct installation and reduction of vibration, many use special soft pad supports.  They are made of soft rubber, and are able to absorb strong vibrations of the device during the spin cycle. </p><p>  Compliance with the basic requirements of the use of washing machines with vertical loading will increase their service life.  The manufacturer recommends: </p><ul><li>  do not exceed the norm of the weight of the loaded laundry in the drum; </li><li>  choose the right program depending on the type of product, and also taking into account the degree of contamination; </li><li>  do not exceed the norm of the detergent; </li><li>  Perform periodic maintenance of equipment </li><li>  prevent foreign objects from entering the tank. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="bid.auctionbymayo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="whirlpool bug" class="if uuid-3138619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3138619.jpg"></div><h2>  The main malfunctions of the Virpul washing machine with vertical loading and methods for their elimination </h2><p>  According to user and expert reviews, the following problems most often arise: </p><ol><li>  A malfunction in the control unit.  In this case, after turning on the machine, there is a chaotic light up of all indicators or in the process of performing the ‚ÄúWash‚Äù function its mode is violated.

To correct this malfunction of the Virpul washing machine with vertical loading, you need to contact a qualified specialist. </li><li>  Failure to perform the ‚ÄúWater Drain‚Äù option.  This problem can occur only in the last cycle of the washing machine.  If water remains in the tank, disconnect the device from the power supply and drain the water using the emergency drain hose.  The cause of the breakdown may be accumulated debris or failure of the pump.  It is necessary to clean the filter of accumulated dirt. </li><li>  Failure of the heating element.  If within 10 minutes after starting the machine in the "Washing" mode there is no increase in water temperature, then the "culprit" of the breakdown is a tubular electric heater.  Such a malfunction of the Virpul washing machine, both front-loading and vertical, most often occurs due to hard water, poor-quality chemicals or power surges.  If the heating element fails, it will need to be replaced. </li><li>  Spontaneous opening of the leaves of the unit.  In case of malfunction of the valves, it is necessary to stop the operation of the washing machine, as it may jam the drum.  The cause of this problem may be an excess of the loading rate, uneven distribution of things inside or a malfunction of the drum latch. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine whirlpool trouble codes" class="if uuid-3138593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3138593.jpg"></div></li><li>  Noise level increase during the execution of the installed program.  In the case of increased vibration, the appearance of cod, knock during operations, it is necessary to stop the operation of the washing unit.  There may be foreign objects in the drum.  In this case, the laundry should be removed from the drum and inspected for foreign objects. </li></ol><h2>  What is an error code? </h2><p>  Useful option for vehicle owners.  The fault codes of the Virpul washing machine are displayed on the electronic display panel of the unit.  In this way, the control system notifies of the detection of poor functioning or failure of parts.  Each error value in the Virpul corresponds to a specific breakdown.
