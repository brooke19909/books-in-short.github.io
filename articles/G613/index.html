    <p>  After the advent of the economical and comparatively fast ASUS Google Nexus 7 on the latest Android platform, many were able to try a powerful multimedia assistant in business: reading, games, surfing the Internet and watching videos - all this can be easily done without problems. </p><p>  After the release, ‚ÄúNexus 7‚Äù became a real headache for Apple, competing with the iPad mini.  After a fruitful collaboration between the two famous brands Google and Asus, their offspring in the coming months occupies about 10% of the entire market for Android devices, which is more than an excellent indicator for one ASUS Nexus 7. The price of the device varies from 10,000 rubles , which also makes many competitors in the segment nervous. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Google has once again chosen a Taiwanese company as a partner, and this is not surprising: with its rich experience in the field of tablets, coupled with high-quality assembly and relatively inexpensive materials, it makes cooperation extremely beneficial for both parties. </p><p>  The flagship ASUS Nexus 7 2013 32Gb has retained its previous proportions, but it looks more compact, and the technical specifications have been significantly improved.  First of all, the owner will be pleased with the new screen, which received a higher resolution, while maintaining the previous diagonal.  Here you can add a new generation processor, twice the amount of RAM of the device, increased autonomy and the appearance of a second camera in addition to the front camera. </p>

    <p>  Together with the announcement of a new tablet, Google introduced an updated version of Android, which, along with all the software, received the touchscreen of ASUS Nexus 7. The gadget with all its characteristics became another and dangerous argument for the struggle between Google and Apple.  User reviews are full of positive emotions, and judging by their quantity and quality, the new gadget is in a clearly better position than similar devices from Apple. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The pricing policy of the new model is more than favorable for the average user.  For example, ASUS Nexus 7, the price of which ranges from 12 thousand rubles, has 32 GB of internal memory and a full-size 3G network, while a more modest version with less memory will cost about 8-9 thousand. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Some significant changes in terms of design, compared with previous models, the new gadget did not happen.  The ASUS <span>Nexus 7</span> tablet is easily recognizable by its outlines, but it could not do without some additions. </p>

    <p>  The very concept of an elongated device with smooth contours and attractive side faces was not touched, but the new device is now thinner and the weight, respectively, is less by 50 g. The Nexus 7 has become more convenient in terms of mobility, you can take it with you by putting pocket of a jacket or jacket. </p><p>  As in previous models, the back of the tablet is made of soft touch plastic.  The surface has exclusively dark shades and, judging by the reviews of the owners, continues to collect fingerprints and dust.  The original drawing, previously present on the fifth and sixth versions, is no longer there, now the surface is smooth, with the exception of the signature stamping in the center of the device with the name of the series. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Many users in their reviews are wondering why the designers abandoned the original and visually attractive surface, replacing it with a more utilitarian smooth plane, while losing an interesting design decision. </p><p>  Compared to its predecessors, the ASUS Google Nexus 7 is slightly extended up, and the width of the device has been slightly reduced.  The difference visually may not be so noticeable, but now the gadget has become more convenient to carry and just hold in your hands.  Ergonomics has improved significantly, but you have to control the device, as before, with two hands. </p><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  The overall impression of the assembly is positive, but with one nuance, which is very often noted in the reviews by users: if you press the screen at the bottom of the tablet, the device emits a warning creak.  The past rulers suffered a similar flaw, but this moment did not affect the device‚Äôs functionality or suitability, so if you don‚Äôt specifically ‚Äúpoke‚Äù this place, you won‚Äôt be bothered by unpleasant clicks. </p><p>  Well-known laboratory Android Authority recently conducted a crash test ASUS Nexus 7 32Gb 3G.  Based on its results, grades were put out according to which the tablet was classified as a relatively fragile device.  When the model fell from a height of human growth onto a concrete / asphalt surface, the model received damage to the body (chips, cracks, glass intact), but there were no failures in the work, so the repair cost little loss. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  The controls of the ASUS Nexus 7 32Gb 3G are located correctly and do not interfere with the device.  On the left side you can see the volume rocker and the screen lock button.  It‚Äôs quite easy to click on them, the places are well-chosen, allowing you to use them blindly. </p>

    <p>  The headphone jack is located on the upper end, and the microUSB port is located on the bottom, that is, during the connection of all the wires they do not interfere with each other or the user. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  ASUS Nexus 7 32Gb is equipped with a 7-inch screen with a modern IPS-matrix and a resolution of 1920 by 1200 pixels with a density of 323 ppi, which when compared is close to the level of top-end smartphone models.  Moreover, in terms of pixel saturation, the Nexus 7 overtakes almost all tablets, both small and large. </p>

    <p>  For example, the same iPad mini from Apple can boast only 162 points, so the new product from Google offers a clearly better image than the apple company. </p><h2>  Display Features </h2><p>  Specialists and user reviews note a large margin of brightness of the device and an intelligent automatic adjustment system.  The touch performance of ASUS Nexus 7 is also impressive: the screen is touch-sensitive, it is convenient to work with it both with gloves and with wet hands.  Some owners of Nexus complain about too wide frames around the screen, which is especially noticeable on <span>light backgrounds</span> and when watching a bright and saturated video.  But the problem is partially solved if you use the device in landscape orientation. </p>

    <p>  As a means of protecting the display, engineers equipped the device with a practical and proven coating from <span>Gorilla Glass,</span> which is used in many top-end devices. </p><p>  According to users, the dimensions of the gadget and display are not so large, but using it with one hand is not so comfortable, although compared to the previous line, it became more convenient to hold the device in your hand - the small width of the case affects it. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  ASUS Nexus 7 can work with 3G networks, and there were no problems with our mobile operators in terms of availability or incompatibility.  For stationary data transfer, you can use the microUSB port, which is located at the bottom. </p><p>  A Wi-Fi 802.11 module at b / g / n points is provided as a wireless communication source, as an alternative - Bluetooth of the fourth version with reduced power consumption.  The last advantage of the tablet was rated in the positive reviews of many owners. </p><h2>  Media </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worth saying right away that the ASUS Nexus 7 was extremely pleased with the browser, namely its high speed.  Any scaling, clicking on links, scrolling and other actions during web surfing occur absolutely without delays or any delays. </p>

    <p>  The same can be said about most games that feel great on this platform, showing a high FPS. </p><p>  A high-quality screen allows you to watch high-resolution video in 1080p without delays or jerking, but despite the good stuffing, the software and codecs built into ASUS Nexus 7 can‚Äôt cope with some formats, and user reviews are full of perplexities and solutions in the form of third-party applications. </p><p>  The tablet successfully implements a new speaker system that produces more or less high-quality sound above and below the device, thereby obtaining surround sound.  The gadget's volume reserve is decent, and if desired, you can use it as a small music speaker somewhere on vacation. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The battery capacity is very enviable - 3950 mAh.  The device works much longer than models of past rulers and shows good results.  At maximum brightness when watching a video in HD-quality, the device worked for about eight hours. </p><p>  Indicators with an average load fluctuate within 1-2 days, and if you use the gadget sporadically, you can reach up to a week.  In this regard, the tablet is not inferior to its closest competitors, in particular the iPad mini, and thanks to the remote charging function, the owner will receive a rare opportunity for today, which many users are extremely positive about. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The new model from two famous brands turned out to be very successful: the gadget has become more powerful, more compact, performance and other parameters have significantly improved.  Here you can add a second camera, an excellent display.  For the price that is asked in stores, you get an extremely balanced device in its class. </p><p>  Depending on the amount of memory (16/32 GB) and the availability of network modules, the device can be purchased from 150 to 200 dollars.  Generally speaking, the Nexus 7 is one of the best models for its money.  You can recommend the device to anyone who is looking for a device that is balanced in all respects, both for work and for entertainment. </p>
