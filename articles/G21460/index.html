    <p>  But such work did not particularly interest Aleksandrov, and soon he again returned to the fleet.  After completing retraining courses for senior officers at the Military Academy, in 1931 he became commander of the legendary cruiser Aurora. </p><h2>  Teaching and business trip to Spain </h2><p>  While in this position, A. Alexandrov again decides to go into science and engage in teaching activities.
