Soft drinks are included in the overall nutritional concept.  The same is with alcoholic beverages, but only locally produced.  Foreign alcohol will have to be paid separately.  The restaurant serves delicious dishes of chicken, turkey and lamb.  There is a fairly good selection of vegetables, salads and snacks.  There are also enough fruits.  The assortment of desserts is good. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  SPA-center </h2><p>  Holiday City Hotel 4 * has its own small spa and wellness center, where you can undergo several types of massage, body treatments, beauty treatments, visit a traditional Turkish bath, sauna, relaxation area.

A bus runs from the hotel to the sea a couple of times a day; walking takes 10-15 minutes by walking.  The complex has its own sandy beach with paid umbrellas and sunbeds. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Holiday City <span>Hotel 4 * (Turkey),</span> as we already mentioned, is located two kilometers from Side.

Holiday Point City Hotel, like other hotels, has its own guides who offer trips along the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holiday city hotel 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1484019.jpg" width="600"></div>

At the same time, Side has hotels of various levels: from apart-hotels to fashionable complexes.  In the west of the city there are beautiful beaches with numerous hotels, as a result of which there are always a lot of people. </p><p>  But in the east, the coast is less crowded, and therefore it is much more comfortable to relax on it.  In addition to the city itself, Side also includes a number of beaches that have gained considerable popularity in recent years: Sorgun, Kumkoy, Kyzylgach, Cholakly, Kizilot. </p><p>  As you know, Turkey is famous for its unusually long sandy beaches.  The west coast of Side is safer and less deep, which is why it is more popular.  On the beaches, tourists are offered many sports activities.  Here you can try parachuting and sailing, fishing and diving, go water skiing and go on a boat trip.  Vacationers who do not like hustle and bustle can walk along the coast to a turtle beach, which is considered one of the best in the Mediterranean. </p><p>  Side is not the best place for divers, but the wreck of the Second World War (the French ship San Didte), which may be interesting for scuba diving enthusiasts, is not far away.  And 200 meters from the village of Manavgat peacefully rest the remains of the American military aircraft Hadley's Harem.  Part of the details of the aircraft has long been raised and is currently in the Museum of Istanbul. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Entertainment and Attractions </h2><p>  Historical and archaeological interest is the ancient city of Side.  It is located on a small part of the peninsula.  A moat with a wall separates it from the mainland.  To this day, Side has preserved many interesting objects that are worth seeing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holiday point city hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1484018.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The complex can be accessed through the main gate, well preserved from the time of the Hellenes.  And then you should move along the street with columns (though only debris remained from them) to public baths.  It is in the building of the bathhouse that currently houses a museum, behind which there is an agora with the ruins of the temple of Fortune and Tiche (2nd century BC).  This place was once used by pirates as a slave trade point. </p><p>  Here are the ruins of a colossal ancient theater where gladiators fought.  It is considered the largest theater in all of Pamphylia.  And nearby is the temple of Dionysus and the restored fountain.  In addition, in Side there are ruins of three more temples, a fountain and an aqueduct. </p><p>  Side is not only a historical place, but also a center of entertainment.  The city has a large number of discos that entertain guests until the morning.  The club "Oxide" is considered the best.  The city is no less interesting for shopping enthusiasts as it has carpet, jewelry and leather goods stores.  The best shops are located on Pillar Street, you can safely shop in them, without fear of fakes. </p><p>  In Side, you should definitely visit the local museum near the theater.  It exhibits tombs, columns, murals, capitals and other archaeological finds dating back to the Hellenic period. </p><p>  The most active tourists can book the following trips at any tour desk: safari canyon, mountain river rafting, travel to Pamukkale and the <span>Green Canyon</span> , etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel holiday point city hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1484017.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Rafting along the river will not only allow you to get a certain dose of adrenaline, but also admire the beauty of nature.  Particularly popular with vacationers is a jeep safari, passing through the picturesque places of the coast.  Such entertainment is quite safe, as it takes place under the supervision of experienced instructors. </p><h2>  Holiday City Hotel Reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to refer to the reviews of tourists who have been here.  The complex has a good location.  However, there is no own territory as such.  Guests note that the hotel is new, it can be seen from the interiors and good furniture.  The rooms are very nice, spacious, with working appliances and plumbing.  The furniture in the apartments is also new and comfortable.  Cleaning is carried out daily and pretty well, but the maids do not know Russian at all, and in English it is not always possible to explain.  A huge plus is the availability of free Wi-Fi, which is even in the rooms.  Air conditioners are not very conveniently located, as cold streams are directed directly to the bed. </p><p>  The hotel is located next to the road, so rooms facing the sea automatically look at it and noisy cafes.  These apartments are quite noisy in the evenings, even with the windows closed. </p><p>  As for food, I would like to dwell on this issue in more detail, since it causes the greatest number of disputes among tourists, no matter how good the hotel may be.  Breakfast (buffet), lunch and dinner, service in bars are subject to the all inclusive concept.  Not everyone is satisfied with the quality and variety of nutrition.  Sometimes reviews are quite contradictory.  Although most tourists note the abundance of dishes and their good taste.  The buffet serves dishes of lamb, chicken, turkey, sea fish.  In the morning you can enjoy fresh pastries.  Not bad with fruits and many desserts.  In general, the food is quality and good.  Perhaps there are no more refined dishes typical of five-star hotels, but they are unlikely to be expected from a four-star complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holiday city hotel 4 side kumkoy" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1484739.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  All non-alcoholic and local alcoholic drinks are served free of charge, and foreign brands must be paid.  For dinner, guests are offered ice cream daily. </p><h2>  Sea and entertainment: reviews </h2><p>  Holiday City Hotel 4 * (Side) has virtually no territory.  It consists of the building itself and a small pool in front of it.  Near the hotel there is a promenade along which you can walk in the evenings, making a promenade.  The complex has a spa center, its services are not included in the package price, so those who wish to attend relaxation and massage sessions will have to pay, but it's worth it.  Tourists are very pleased with the spa service. </p><p>  The hotel is not on the first line, to the coast eight hundred meters.  In principle, a slow step can be reached in 10-15 minutes.  However, this beach does not belong to the hotel, and is partially rented from another complex, so the beds and umbrellas on it for guests of other hotels are paid.  The coast is sandy, but with large pebbles at the bottom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holiday city hotel 4 turkey" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1484015.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel offers a free shuttle service to another beach, which is a ten-minute bus ride away.  The coast here is very clean, sandy, there are absolutely no stones, algae too, and the water is transparent.  Sun loungers and sun loungers are free for tourists, but still there is one drawback.  You can‚Äôt bring water and food to the beach, all this must be purchased at the beach bar, which does not belong to the hotel, which means that all inclusive does not work here.  The hotel bus brings tourists ashore only a few times a day, taking them at 10-11 a.m. and picking up at 16-17 a.m.  It is very uncomfortable.  Of course, you can get to the hotel on your own by city bus, but the nearest stop is a ten minute walk. </p><p>  Most of the hotel guests are European pensioners, and the rest are our fellow citizens.  The hotel staff does not understand Russian and English, it is more oriented to the Germans.  However, this does not make him less friendly and pleasant.  The waiters are well served in the restaurant.  But with regard to animation, it is practically not in the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holiday city hotel reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1484044.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you want not only to soak up the sun, but also to see the sights, then you will not need the hotel‚Äôs entertainment program.  Knowledgeable tourists are advised to go on a jeep safari, which will give you many unforgettable minutes.  To see the old Side and its museums, it is not necessary to book a tour with a local guide.  The city can be reached by bus.  The road will not take more than fifteen minutes.  The fare for one passenger costs 2-3 lira.  For those who are going on a trip by the company, it will be easier to order a taxi.  The city is certainly worth seeing antique sights.  But do not forget about the amazing field trip to the wonderful <span>Manavgat waterfall.</span>  Here you can not only admire the beauty of nature, but also dine in one of the restaurants on the river bank, which specialize in cooking delicious dishes of fresh fish.  Side is a beautiful city with many interesting places, so everyone can find something interesting for themselves. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, I would like to note that Holiday Point City Hotel 4 * (Side) can be recommended for leisure to active tourists who want to not only spend time on the beach, but also want to see the coast, because the hotel has a convenient location, which makes it easy to get to to Side.  And for those tourists who want to relax on the first line (with young children) and have an active animation, you probably should find another place to stay. </p>
