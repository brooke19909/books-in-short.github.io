Monks from square pieces of paper stacked figures of animals, birds and flowers.  Now this technique has gained popularity around the world, the number of origami fans is increasing annually.  Handicraft lovers in our country did not remain indifferent.  Learning to stack various figures is easiest according to the schemes.  They can be found in print media or on Internet sites. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make an origami bird out of paper with your own hands.  We will provide some interesting step-by-step schemes, according to which it is easy and simple to assemble the craft.  All origami is made only from square sheets.  If you like to do such crafts, then make yourself patterns out of cardboard by drawing them using a triangle.  In origami art, clarity is incredibly important.  If the error in the calculations is equal to 1 mm, then the figure will turn out to be already crooked and sloppy. </p><p>  Novice origami masters make squares from sheets of paper in A-4 format, folding one of the corners to the opposite side.  The excess strip is cut with scissors.  It is advisable to additionally check the dimensions with a ruler.  Next, we will look at how to make origami birds out of paper with a few examples.  A step-by-step job description will help you cope with the task in difficult places. </p><h2>  Crow </h2><p>  In the photo below there is an assembly diagram of a ravenous bird of prey.  It is best to make a craft out of thin colored paper, since from thick sheets for the printer the craft turns out to be too coarse and dense, it is difficult to make bends.  In the diagram, folding patterns under No. 1,2,3 are understandable, so we will skip the explanation.  Let's start with tips on how to make an origami bird out of paper right away with number 4. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.chine-culture.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami crow" class="if uuid-3204916" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3204916.jpg"></div><p>  Between the folds of the triangles you need to stick your finger in and raise the connection of the two elements up.  From the corner in the center, bend the paper so that you get a sharp corner.  Repeat the procedure on the other side.  Get the figure at number 6. Bend the corners from the middle in opposite directions.  These will be the crow's paws.  Fold the workpiece in half in length and make one fold in the place indicated by the dashed line. </p><p>  Then bend the figure in half again, but already wide.  At this stage, the contours of the future bird become noticeable.  Lay the upper part where the head is located inward and turn the head to the front side.  It remains to bend the paper 5 mm inward to form a beak.  Use a marker to draw eyes and the bird is ready! </p><h2>  Penguin </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the penguin knows how to swim and has completely forgotten how to fly, he is considered a bird.  Further we will consider how to make origami a bird living on the seashore from paper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="br.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami penguin" class="if uuid-3204951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3204951.jpg"></div><p>  The paper folding scheme is understandable, the only thing you need to pay attention to is turning the parts to the back.  So, when bent along a dotted line to form a head, the part consists of stripes of the front and back sides of colored paper.  It is necessary to make a bend, then open the workpiece and turn the part to the other side, adhering to the bends made.  Get a blue detail.  Follow the same procedure with the fold on the penguin‚Äôs stomach.  When the part is turned on the other side, the tail will be visible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Swan </h2><p>  How easy it is to make an origami bird out of paper can be seen in the next step-by-step photo.  Fold a square of paper in half diagonally and bend the corners in different directions.  Then the workpiece is turned upside down and bent in half.  Further in the direction of the dashed line fold the neck of the swan and its head.  Press the outermost corner inward, bending the paper 2 mm.  This will be the beak of the bird.  It remains to form the folds in the shape of the tail and the swan is ready! </p><div class="photo" data-original="br.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami swan" class="if uuid-3204961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3204961.jpg"></div><p>  If you attach two swans to a sheet of cardboard with your beaks to each other, after pasting a big red heart, you get an interesting card for Valentine's Day.  You can give such a craft for a wedding.  Newlyweds will appreciate the efforts of your child and will keep this craft for memory for a long time. </p><h2>  Blue bird of luck </h2><p>  Next, we will figure out how to make a bird of happiness out of paper (origami is such an art, as you can see, that allows you to do anything you like).  Usually it is depicted in blue, so prepare a square of such paper.  First you need to fold the sheet in half diagonally on one and the other side to indicate the center lines.  Then the workpiece is doubled, and a strip from the middle is bent along a dashed line. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chine-culture.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blue bird good luck" class="if uuid-3204937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3204937.jpg"></div><p>  Make sure that its sides are parallel.  A second fold is formed in the center of this strip.  He divides the double triangle into equal parts, which must be deployed in opposite directions, as shown in the figure under No. 5. </p><p>  Then we connect the two halves together and lift the wings up in a dashed line.  It only remains to form a beak.  This is done in the usual way, already familiar to readers from other descriptions. </p><h2>  Dove </h2><p>  To work on this version of the origami dove, prepare not only a sheet of square paper, but also scissors, since some sides of the workpiece will need to be cut, and parts of the others cut off altogether. </p><div class="photo" data-original="origami-art.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami dove" class="if uuid-3206590" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3206590.jpg"></div><p>  The folding scheme is quite simple, so it does not need a step-by-step explanation.  It is necessary to act from top to bottom and from left to right.  Where a <span>dashed line is</span> drawn <span>,</span> folds are made. </p><p>  Now you know how to make an origami bird out of paper, and photos with schemes for folding a square sheet will help to make crafts easily and simply.  Have a good start! </p>
