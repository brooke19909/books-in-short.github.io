    <p>  Interesting places and sights of Togliatti are represented by another unusual building.  Behind its back, the monument has a very moving history.  It is installed in honor of the dog, which faithfully waited for its owners.  The story happened in 1995 on one of the highways.  Residents of the city noticed a dog who every day sat in one place and stubbornly waiting for someone, while trying to stop passing cars passing by.  Residents began to find out how the dog appeared here, during which it became known that there had recently been an accident at this place.  A young couple rode in the car and their faithful dog, the only one who could survive in this disaster.  For seven years the dog stubbornly waited for its owners in the same place.  Having never found out the name of the dog, the inhabitants of the city gave him the nickname ‚ÄúFaithful,‚Äù some called him ‚ÄúKostik‚Äù.  The dog always waited in its place, it became a kind of living legend.  They tried to take her more than once home or to a shelter, built houses and so on.  But all this did not help, the dog came to that place by any means, hoping that the owners would take it away.  In 2002, the dog died, but his trace remained forever, because soon a monument was opened at this place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>On June 1,</span> 2003, the opening took place.  It was the first monument of the city that was not dedicated to political issues.  A huge number of people came to the opening.  Now the monument is one of the most favorite places of the city residents.  These are unique sights of Togliatti.  Description, addresses of other places that must be visited are presented below. </p><h2>  Monument of AvtoVAZ OJSC, Southern Highway </h2><p>  This monument was erected in honor of modern automotive industry.  In Togliatti, the main office of one of the largest automobile construction companies is located.  It was this company that initiated the construction of the monument.  Residents and guests of the city have a unique opportunity to go on excursions in workshops where brand-new cars go off the assembly line.  A visit to the factory is carried out by special groups.  Such a visit must be planned in advance, because for this you need to get special permission.  Typically, such an excursion is carried out through travel agencies, which have established contact with the leadership. </p><p>  Today, the plant is engaged in the production of cars of the brand Lada, Nissan.  Thanks to continuous development, the world saw another car series called Renault. </p><h2>  Museum complex "Heritage" </h2>

    <p>  A special place with amazing energy.  The performances of this theater are simply mesmerizing.  A person plunges into the world of incredible magic, new feelings and emotions, and all this thanks to the wonderful production of the Stagecoach Theater.  The theater begins its history since 1992.  The actors of the theater had to go through a lot, but the main thing is the years of training in their field.  During its existence, "Stagecoach" presented to its audience about 50 wonderful productions.  The theater moved several times, but in 2012 it found its final place of deployment.  Today it is located at 93 Stepan Razin Ave. Of course, not every tourist can see all the sights of the city of Togliatti.  There are a huge number of them, but this theater is definitely worth a visit. </p><h2>  Art Museum </h2>
