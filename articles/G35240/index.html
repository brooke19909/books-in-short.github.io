    <p>  If you come to the south and are looking for the most environmentally friendly beach, "Mandarin" (Adler), whose reviews are purely positive, is the best option.  And in fact, the owners of the beach try to keep it in good order, cleaning it several times a day.  The beach area is constantly updated with new attractions and infrastructure facilities, and the equipment provided for rent is high quality. </p><p>  If we talk about the entire complex "Mandarin" (Adler), reviews about it are mixed.  First of all, guests are dissatisfied with the services provided at the local hotel, it is about the service, which, in their opinion, leaves much to be desired.  Negative impressions of the hotel are smoothed out by the opportunity to soak up the sun, swim in the warm sea and pass the time in local entertainment facilities. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  SEC "Mandarin" (Adler) is also famous for a large number of projects that are implemented there every season.  First of all, it‚Äôs about the ultramodern laser show ‚ÄúArgonauts‚Äù, which is based on popular myths about the travels of the ancient Greeks on the ship of the same name.  Despite the fact that the performance takes place only on Tuesdays, getting a ticket for it is very difficult, sometimes you have to book tickets 2-3 months in advance. </p><p>  Another highlight of the complex is the concert hall, which was opened in the fall of 2013.  The hall can accommodate 1180 spectators, the space itself is located opposite a large pool equipped with a stage, as well as with all the necessary infrastructure for performances.  Some of the stars of show business conduct their concerts here when they come to Adler and Sochi.  In addition, it is here that corporate events of various local enterprises are often held. </p><p>  One of the main differences of the complex is the presence of a playground, which can be used even by children with disabilities.  When creating children's attractions, high-quality and environmentally friendly materials made in soothing colors were used.  On an area of ‚Äã‚Äã800 square meters, animators, teachers and psychologists are constantly working, with their help it is much easier for children to get used to a new place. </p>
