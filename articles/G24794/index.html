And our imagination draws either familiar places where you have already visited, or fabulous landscapes that pop up from nowhere.  Dreamily you ask yourself: "Where to go?"  Mentally run a glance around the map ... Of course, even knowledge of geography does not guarantee you to find such fabulous places.  But we will try to help you by filling this gap!  Let's go with you on a journey (albeit virtual) to the most exotic and exciting places on the island of Mauritius. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nationsonline.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mauritius from above" class="if uuid-2295327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2295327.jpg"></div><h2>  Paradise  Mauritius reviews </h2><p>  There is a place on Earth that many tourists have not heard of.  Especially those who are just beginning their discovery of the world outside their homeland.  This is the island of Mauritius, reviews of which will make up your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe place of the proposed vacation.  It is located in East Africa, near Madagascar.  The Portuguese, French, and British alternately presented and had rights to it.  The island has preserved traces of the influence of the cultures of these states, today they form part of the tourism industry, which he lives on.  This is not to say that this piece of land has been chosen by millions of tourists around the world, but still some people prefer to spend their holidays here. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.africaodyssey.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ryan corner of the earth" class="if uuid-2295331" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2295331.jpg"></div><p>  Turning directly to the topic of the reviews of visitors to the island of Mauritius, it is worth noting that most of the travelers are in complete awe.  The first thing you should pay attention to is the condition of many hotels on the island.  According to tourists, all the rooms are of a high standard, spacious and clean.  But it will not get worse if each visitor adds their own reviews about Mauritius hotels.  Natural landscapes and the coast deserve special attention.  So you want to dissolve in the snow-white hot sand or plunge into the azure water. </p><p>  Mauritius is also great for spending holidays in the winter.  At that moment, when a blizzard was sweeping in Russia, you can catch a wave and a fair wind on the island. </p><h2>  Waking fairy tale </h2><p>  Why is the island of Mauritius so attractive to some tourists?  A tale of sleepy volcanoes, snow-white beaches, turquoise waters, exotic animals and plants will charm anyone who finds themselves in this place.  Most likely, sooner or later you will find yourself here again, and perhaps choose this paradise as a place for constant rest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flyedelweiss.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panoramic view of Mauritius" class="if uuid-2295343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2295343.jpg"></div><h2>  All that is needed </h2><p>  If you choose the island of Mauritius as a vacation destination, reviews of which have become your main argument, then you will have the opportunity to choose between noisy parties until the morning and a relaxing family vacation.  And at your service will be extreme types of recreation.  Beautiful landscapes will make you feel like a great photographer, in your album photographs of the island of Mauritius will be a source of pride. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Wait by the sea for weather </h2><p>  I would like to note the climatic and weather conditions.  In February and March, cyclones have a strong effect, which is expressed in strong winds and showers, sometimes causing flooding, other months are favorable for rest in Mauritius, feedback about this can always be heard from numerous vacationers.  Nevertheless, in May, October and November, tourists will receive the most suitable climate for recreation.  The ocean will pamper them with warm water with a temperature of plus 22-26 degrees Celsius.  True, in these months there are heavy, but short rains that can be waited in comfortable places of residence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cote d'Azur" class="if uuid-2295339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2295339.jpg"></div><h2>  Sleeping volcanoes </h2><p>  The volcanic origin of the island left an indelible mark on nature.  She is beautiful!  Multiple plateaus surrounded by mountains, rivers and waterfalls would make up a picture for photo wallpaper that would be a success.  Volcanoes, it should be noted, are extinct here.  By the way, the names of the mountains in these parts are very funny.  Here you have the Cat, and the Mouse, and even the Thumb! </p><p>  Part of the island in the southwest is decorated with <span>volcanic sands.</span>  They are painted with purple and red flowers!  Visitors to Mauritius with a child have feedback about this indescribable!  Firstly, it should be noted separately the presence of ennobled beaches.  You‚Äôll not meet this everywhere!  Vegetation is represented on this part of the island by Canadian pines and eucalyptus trees.  But the eastern part of the island of Mauritius is famous for mangroves.  Coconut groves stretch along the beaches in Mauritius.  There is a reserve on this exotic island.  It's called the Black River Goge.  It is inhabited by such outlandish birds as necklace parrots and pink, no, not flamingos, but pigeons!  If you had the opportunity for a child to visit such a truly beautiful place, how would you react?  Of course, there would be no limit to joy!  Sand, blue sea, bright sky and bright sun above your head.  This is why many adults fly to Mauritius with their children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pink dove" class="if uuid-2295337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2295337.jpg"></div><h2>  The eye rejoices </h2><p>  Sights of the island of Mauritius, reviews of which are always excellent, as a rule, are of natural origin.  The capital of this small island nation is Port Louis.  The city was founded by the French.  On the one hand, the city is surrounded by mountains, on the other - there is a bay, the picturesqueness of which will not leave tourists indifferent.  The observation deck, which is located in Fort Adelaide, is also popular with them.  It was erected by the colonialists and today is used for colorful shows.  The administrative buildings in the colonial style and located in the city center Arms Square are part of urban architecture, which captivates the views of vacationers.  There are also Chinese and Muslim quarters, and they are also of interest to tourists.  Leo Bay, with the Lion Mountain above it, is another attraction of the city.  The plaster statue of Laval, touching which you can count on luck, is another attraction of the place where the tomb of the founder of Catholicism in Mauritius is also located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.constancehotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mauritius nature" class="if uuid-2295336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2295336.jpg"></div><h2>  There is that there is </h2><p>  The traditions and cultures of different peoples, mixed on the island, could not but leave their mark on the kitchen preferences of the islanders.  French, Indian, Chinese, African!  The combination of these kitchen traditions is impressive.  Spice!  Lots of spices! </p><p>  This is the main component of all dishes.  They add sauces, based on tomatoes.  And, of course, how can the islanders do without seafood? </p><h2>  January blizzard and the azure sea </h2><p>  When all of Russia is covered with snow in the cold January days, most tourists begin to think about holidays in hot countries, in this case Mauritius is the best solution.  In January, wonderful weather conditions for relaxation await you, sometimes precipitation is possible, but there will be no scorching sun and sweltering heat.  This is a great time for families with children.  Reviews about the <span>rest in Mauritius</span> in January are positive.  As practice shows, winter is the most popular time of the year for a trip to this wonderful island. </p><h2>  If you want to be healthy, have fun! </h2><p>  Holidays at sea is a beach.  Well, and excursions.  And what can the Mauritius island with its resorts offer in this regard?  Horse riding will be an interesting entertainment for lovers of exotic, and if you have never jumped with a parachute, but always dreamed of doing it, then with experienced instructors make this dream come true.  For those who are involved in the "secular fun", and here there should be a lot of them, there are golf and tennis courts.  If you are not inclined to this kind of entertainment, then you can just take a bike ride.  And what about without water activities?  They have any coastal resort, and here they are presented in all forms.  The entertainment available on the island of Mauritius has only positive reviews. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.afd.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mauritius population" class="if uuid-2295344" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2295344.jpg"></div><h2>  Underwater splendor </h2><p>  Water rides at Leisure Village - Mauritius pride!  But the island can still offer outdoor activities for diving enthusiasts.  The world opening for them is vast and boundless.  To find yourself among the sunken ships, keep company with dolphins and see the diversity of tropical fish species - for this you should even overcome the fear of diving and become a diver!  A swim among the sharks?  Holidays in Mauritius, according to tourists, is famous for everyone.  Here you will have a similar chance in the east of the island.  Certainly, enough thrills for a long time!  But after all, not all of us love such a vacation.  In this case, a boat tour with a transparent bottom is at your service.  You can contemplate everything that is revealed to the diver.  Well, almost everything!  And that is a lot. </p><h2>  For the long memory </h2><p>  Holidays on the island will remain in your memories for a long time.  Most tourist reviews show that Mauritius is a great place to spend your holidays.  It is perfect not only for passive relaxation, here you can also find entertainment for active tourists.  Why not?  Have a great holiday! </p>
