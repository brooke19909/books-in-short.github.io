This lights, and household lighting, and, of course, TV screens and various gadgets in which there is a screen or display area.  This article will focus on the SMD 5630 LED. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Emissions from a solid-state diode were first noticed in 1907 by Henry Round.  He found that electroluminescence was observed when current passed through a metal and silicon carbide.  And then similar phenomena were noticed by the Russian scientist Losev.  Who even published his discovery, but due to the fact that the science of that time did not allow a full explanation of the phenomenon, it remained almost unnoticed.  Losev was able to evaluate the practical significance of his discovery, which made it possible to create small-sized solid-state (vacuum-free) light sources with a very low supply voltage and unlimited potential for speed.  He received two copyright certificates for ‚ÄúLight Relay‚Äù.  In 1961, Robert Byard and Gary Pittman from Texas Instruments discovered and patented infrared LED technology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="smd 5630" class="if uuid-2262767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48362/2262767.jpg"></div><p>  Nick Holonyak at the University of Illinois managed to develop the first workable diode.  His LED worked in the red range. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For a long time, LEDs were very expensive to manufacture.  Their average price was about $ 200, which greatly affected the scope.  Get the same cheap LED turned out by the Japanese in the early nineties.  Since then, LEDs have been found in almost every device on Earth. </p><h2>  What is LED for? </h2><p>  LEDs are widely used in industry and in everyday life for a number of useful characteristics: </p><ul><li>  high light output - in terms of the amount of light received from one Watt, the LED is much superior to standard lamps; </li><li>  high strength and good tolerance to vibrations and vibrations; </li><li>  durability; </li><li>  a large range of radiated heat of light; </li><li>  low cost; </li><li>  the absence of high voltages, which means lower than the input threshold of specialists and installers; </li><li>  good tolerance of low and ultra-low temperatures; </li><li>  environmental friendliness. </li></ul><p>  This is also confirmed by user reviews. </p><h2>  LED operation principle </h2><p>  The operation of any LED is based on electron-hole conductivity.  In practice, this means that the element has two different semiconductors with different degrees of conductivity.  One of them has a positive type, the second negative.  That is, hole and electronic, respectively.  At the moment when an electric current is passed through the LED, the transition of electrons to free holes occurs at the place of contact of the two semiconductors.  At the same moment, energy is released, which is expressed by glow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="smd led 5630 specifications" class="if uuid-2262777" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48362/2262777.jpg"></div><h2>  SMD 5630 LED </h2><p>  The design of the element is a panel with dimensions of 5 mm by 3 mm by 0.8 mm.  The case is made of heat-resistant plastic, inside of which a powerful crystal is placed.  SMD 5630 has 4 pins.  However, only 2 are involved. In all specifications, it is customary to designate the anode with the number 4, and the cathode with the number 2. On the back side there is a special heat-conducting substrate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Parameters </h2><p>  Specifications for the SMD 5630 are often manufacturer-specific.  But almost all of them are subject to common standards and manufacture elements within acceptable standards.  This means that power can be between 0.5 and 1.1 watts.  The voltage range varies from 3 to 3.8 volts.  Operating and pulse currents are respectively 150 and 400 milliamps.  The declared service life is usually 30,000 hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cukii.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://cukii.com/product/5m-lot-dc-12v-2835-smd-3528-smd-5630-smd-5050-smd-rgb-led-strip-light-60leds-m-flexible-led-light-rgb-string-home-lighting-lamp?sku=121069001"><img itemprop="image" alt="smd 5630 72 led" class="if uuid-2262818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48362/2262818.jpg"></div><h2>  Comparison of SMD 5630 with an ordinary bulb and the closest analogs </h2><p>  With conventional incandescent bulbs, any LED wins to a large extent.  Power SMD 5630 starts at 0.5 watts.  An ordinary light bulb, as a rule, is from 65 and above.  The brightness of the element, although lower in relative terms and amounts to only 57 lumens, can overtake the competitor if you translate it all into power per meter.  SMD 5630 shows 0.34 lumens per square meter.  cm, and the bulb is 0.031 lumens per square meter.  see With regard to the duration of service, here the LED noticeably breaks forward.  If the standard bulb is designed to work for 1000 hours, then the SMD 5630 can boast of 30,000 hours.  At the same time, the cost of electricity is many times less.  This is due to the supply voltage of both elements.  The bulb needs about 200 Volts, and the LEDs need only about 3. </p><p>  The closest competitors to the SMD 5630 are 3528, 5050, 5730. It is worth noting that the marking of these LEDs corresponds to their size.  For example, the SMD 3528 has a size of 35 by 28 mm.  And 5050 - 50 to 50 mm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ledz.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smd 5630 LED specifications" class="if uuid-2262778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48362/2262778.jpg"></div><p>  Of all these elements, only SMD 3528 stands out with its power so far. It starts from 0.11 watts.  In terms of brightness, 5730 with their 60 lumens lead among all the elements.  The viewing angles of almost all LEDs are the same and are 120 degrees.  Operating time also does not change much and is on average indicated by a figure of 30,000 hours.  In terms of brightness, in relation to lumens per watt of all the LEDs presented, 5730 wins with a value of 120. The SMD 5630 has 114. </p><h2>  Application area </h2><p>  Since the SMD 5630 LED has exceptional characteristics, its range of application is quite wide.  It is used in tapes to provide illumination of various devices and devices.  Cars, shop windows, as well as the interior of living quarters.  In some cases, good intensity allows you to use the technical characteristics of SMD 5630 LEDs in <span>street lighting.</span> </p><p>  The structure and design of the elements allow it to be mounted on a printed circuit board.  With independent soldering, it is recommended not to exceed the temperature of the soldering iron more than 200 degrees.  You should also refrain from prolonged touching the element. </p><p>  <span>Characteristics of SMD</span> 5630 <span>LEDs</span> allow its use almost everywhere.  To illuminate large surfaces, a set of several elements or the so-called rulers are used.  As an example, the SMD 5630 72 LED line.  It is a small panel with 72 elements placed on it.  Having completed them together and mounted on the necessary site, you can achieve excellent lighting of a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe exterior. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ledz.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smd 5630 power" class="if uuid-2262779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48362/2262779.jpg"></div><p>  Standard bulbs for lighting rooms are gradually starting to leave the market, in their place come LEDs that are more profitable in technical characteristics.  A 100-watt light bulb can easily be replaced by an LED analogue with a power of only 11. And this is a significant energy savings. </p><p>  The <span>LED lamp</span> for home lighting usually includes several LEDs.  Together, they allow you to create much greater brightness than a conventional incandescent lamp. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smd 5630 72 led" class="if uuid-2262780" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48362/2262780.jpg"></div><p>  LED strips based on SMD 5630 are also actively used as decorative elements in interior lighting.  If the room is equipped with decorative niches, various elements that stand out, then accenting them using LED lighting will give the room elegance and a special style.  LED strips contain several LEDs that are placed with a certain step.  This allows you to diffuse light, which gives the room the effect of full illumination.  Such tapes are mounted, as a rule, through a special adapter, which can supply the entire set of LEDs with the necessary power and stable voltage. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  LEDs have had a great impact on almost all types of industry.  It has become possible to create cost-effective lighting fixtures.  And this in turn led to a decrease in the amount of pollution and emissions into the environment.  The compactness and convenience of working with LEDs has attracted a large number of specialists in this area.  Almost everyone can deal with the connection of ready-made LED strips to the adapter, and then to the mains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cukii.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smd 5630 power per meter" class="if uuid-2262781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48362/2262781.jpg"></div><p>  The use of LED backlighting in high-tech products has also not gone unnoticed.  Modern televisions began to give a more saturated bright picture.  Smartphones have acquired an energy-efficient backlight system for their screens.  Various means of indicating devices using LEDs have become much smaller and more economical. </p>
