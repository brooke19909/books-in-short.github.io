This is a place where people can swear, rush and knock down.  And, it would seem, nothing beautiful and magnificent in these "holes" and can not be.  But it was not there.  It turns out that there are still subways in the world that have become original art workshops.  Creative people gathered here who could make something more from the ‚Äúsubway‚Äù than just one of the modes of transport. </p>

    <p>  Now it‚Äôs even difficult to determine what is the most beautiful metro in the world.  Over the past few decades, many skillful underground parks have been created in European countries.  The most attractive are located in <span>Moscow, London,</span> Munich, as well as outside Eurasia - in El Salvador, Valencia, Shanghai and Tokyo. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The first underground opened in London.  The first line stretched only 6 kilometers.  They launched it back in 1863.  Initially, the metro operated on steam traction and only eventually switched to electric.  By the end of the 19th century, the first elevated line was launched in America. </p>

    <p>  Later, a reaction to this type of public transport followed around the world.  The subway opened in Budapest, Glasgow, Paris and Berlin.  In Russia, the first underground park appeared in Moscow in 1936.  Then they began to open the metro in St. Petersburg, Kiev, Baku, Kharkov, Tashkent, etc. But at that time no one thought that in a few decades there would be people who want to find the most beautiful metro. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beauty underground </h2><p>  It so happened that in many cities around the world the subway has become not just a means of transportation, but also a cultural center.  Art objects underground have also become the place where exhibition halls, contests and festivals are organized.  Some subways are visited by tourists just to see the beauty and appreciate the artistry of the design of the halls. </p><p>  The most beautiful metro stations can now be found in <span>St. Petersburg, Minsk,</span> Munich or Stockholm.  They are all very different and are stunning with their architecture.  The subways have a bizarre shape, an unusual design and interesting color schemes. </p><h2>  Scandinavian art </h2><p>  Unusual turned out <span>Stockholm metro station.</span>  The Town Hall remains special.  This station is considered the most popular among tourists.  Building was not easy.  I had to cut tunnels at a depth of 30 meters.  Moreover, the base underground was rocky. </p>

    <p>  It was the rock that it was decided to make the basis of decorative decoration.  The metro was commissioned by leading artists and sculptors.  They had to process everything in the Scandinavian style, preserving the national flavor.  Each station turned out to be individual and unique, one of a kind. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Just one piece </h2><p>  But the <span>metro of Munich</span> initially did not stand out.  Westfriedhof station was built in 1998 and for three years was considered a gray and unremarkable platform of the metro station.  In 2011, designers decided to add just one detail that transformed the surrounding interior.  Now it can be argued that such a move has definitely become successful for the tourism industry.  To attract the Munich metro, travelers added 11 huge lamps that glow in blue, red and yellow. </p><p>  To the tone of the underground "chandeliers", the travel stations were also made ultramarine.  The station has become a modern metro, despite the lack of pronounced architecture.  The Westfriedhof turned out to be solemn and attractive not only for visitors, but also for residents of the city. </p>

    <p>  By the way, K√∂nigsplatz is also considered an interesting station.  Huge square-shaped columns are installed on the platform.  They have a pixel panel and are highlighted in the same blue color as Westfriedhof. </p><h2>  Young and modern </h2><p>  Relatively recently appeared and the Arab subway.  Dubai will be remembered by everyone who visits there at least once.  The metro station also turned out to be unforgettable.  It was built not so long ago, and the opening was very original.  The designers decided to choose a symbolic time for the presentation and presented the world at 09:09:09 09.09.2009 a new metro. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Dubai is a very expensive and beautiful city.  Therefore, the subway stations look no less luxurious.  The entrance to the ground is almost the same everywhere - in the shape of a shell.  It is striking that in just a couple of years, almost 50 underground "points" were built. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro dubai" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1446382.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Now it is believed that this metro station is the most automated and longest in the whole world.  The interior emphasized four elements.  One of the marine-style stations received original jellyfish-like chandeliers. </p><h2>  Italian flavor </h2><p>  It turned out that the most beautiful metro stations can be found in Naples.  This city cannot be considered the safest and richest.  To get rid of the imposed stereotype, the city authorities decided to give the metro station to the best architects and designers.  The first winner was the Toledo stop.  This station received the award as the best building of 2013. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro in naples" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1446381.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Such an event was justified.  The architects managed to achieve a bewitching effect, which is similar either to the starry sky, or to the sea depths.  There are both water elements and neon lights.  And the main thing is that the whole impression was created thanks to the mosaic. </p><h2>  Soviet luxury </h2><p>  It's hard to believe, but with all the restraint and severity of the times of the USSR, the artists managed to create something beautiful underground.  The metro in St. Petersburg opened in 1955.  The departure point was the Avtovo station.  The ceiling is held by 46 columns, some of them are marble, and some are lined with glass.  Magnificent chandeliers made in a warlike style hang from the ceiling. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro in saint petersburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1446372.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The station ‚ÄúBucharest‚Äù also looks unusually.  Granite <span>floor, marble</span> white ceiling and smalt panel.  Similar to her and the station "International".  It also has <span>marble walls</span> and a ceiling, granite gray floor and a smalt panel, but of a different theme. </p><p>  The metro in St. Petersburg fully characterizes the city.  It is neat, intelligent and bewitching.  Most stations are designed in a restrained style, in gray or white colors.  But from all this luxury stands out "Obvodny Channel".  This station is similar to a spaceship that goes to the past and carries a passenger into the 19th century. </p><h2>  Moscow creations </h2><p>  The most beautiful metro in the world is in Moscow.  An example of this is the Slavyansky Boulevard station.  It was opened in 2008, so the architecture here is more modern, in the Art Nouveau style.  The station really looks like a boulevard.  There are ornate benches and lantern trees.  The walls are made in a dark green shade.  The floor is made of black granite. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro in Minsk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1446378.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Unusual, one might say, tsarist stations are considered to be Komsomolskaya and Kievskaya.  Residents of the capital have long been accustomed to such luxury, but tourists are impressed by the interior of the metro station.  On the walls and ceiling stucco.  Everything is made in snow-white and gold tones.  Stations resemble palace chambers. </p><h2>  Minsk restraint </h2><p>  On the expanses of the CIS subway, it is easy to find unusual stations.  Each of them retained the features of the Soviet era.  The metro in Minsk also has its own beautiful favorites.  Petrovschina is the most popular metro station point in the capital.  It is worth a visit to all tourists who come to Minsk.  The thing is that the main highlight of this station is the starry sky. </p><p>  Unusually looks and "Uruchie".  The station opened in 2007.  It turned out in sky blue.  The center of the station is occupied by columns.  And after a few meters, screens are installed here.  ‚ÄúKuntsevschina‚Äù turned out to be very bright.  Such a metro in Minsk is unusual.  Made in white and yellow. </p><h2>  The American dream </h2><p>  New York also has its most beautiful metro in the world.  It has become popular due to its complex route system.  Not all stations can be called beautiful.  Some of them are very dirty, and here you can meet rats.  But there are also champions. </p><p>  City Hall station opened in 1904 on the first line.  She is unusually beautiful, executed in yellow-green deep colors.  Around the beautiful lighting and mosaic.  But the station worked until 1945.  The thing is that it turned out to be too short.  Such a design was unsafe for stopping trains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Stockholm metro station" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1446379.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Now City Hall can be considered part of the New York Museum.  And not everyone can visit here.  Only a metro employee can wander through it, who will enroll in the queue and purchase a ticket. </p><h2>  Game location </h2><p>  Well, one can not help but mention the ancestor of the subway - England.  The Westminster station, which is located in the capital, turned out to be original and simple.  Hi-tech style is present in every detail.  The station resembles a factory floor with beams and chains.  "Westminster" was shot for the fifth part of the film about the wizard boy "Harry Potter".  Also, the location was familiar to those who played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. </p><h2>  Record holders </h2><p>  Finding the most beautiful metro in the world is easy.  It is located in Kaohsiung in Taiwan, in Frankfurt, in Singapore and other cities.  The design of the metro station can be completely unpredictable.  Somewhere he emphasizes the national flavor, somewhere just creates a good mood.  One way or another, in the matter of aesthetics it is difficult to single out one winner. </p><p>  As it is difficult to determine the largest metro.  In depth, the record holders are stations in St. Petersburg, which are deeper than 50 meters underground.  The Admiralteyskaya is generally at a depth of 102 meters.  But the longest subway was New York.  Its length is 1355 kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the biggest metro" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1446376.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Of course, the largest metro needs to be sought in megacities.  Perhaps, in this case London will be the winner.  Its paths stretched over 410 km.  268 stations are located on 11 lines.  Half of them are on the surface, the rest is underground.  According to statistics, the <span>London Underground</span> daily transports more than 3 million inhabitants. </p>
