    <p>  Another famous beach of Dvuyakornaya bay is called "Under the Saddle".  Here is a local attraction - a rock, which in its shape resembles a saddle.  The beach is directly below it.  The coast is strewn with large pebbles and stones.  Here lovers can swim and dive with a mask.  If you go around the rock, then next to the bay there is another small wild and cozy beach. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the east coast there are Katran and Start boathouses, where tourists are offered a comfortable but not cheap vacation.  Boathouses have their own clean and well-equipped beaches.  The downside is the lack of entertainment and walks, for which you have to get to the village. </p><h2>  Provato Bay beaches </h2><p>  The most famous among them is Agate Beach.  It is located under the mountain Vasyukovka on the shore of the Koktebel Bay.  Scenic views open from the coast, water strikes vacationers with transparency and purity.  The beach is named after the agate stones that can be found along the coastline. </p><p>  The seabed on the Agate beach is rocky, and the coast is pebble-rocky.  The descent to the beach is very steep, so there is a ladder specially for the descent and ascent.  There is a cafe near the start of the descent, and you can rent sun loungers and umbrellas on the beach.  This place is famous for the underwater ridge of reefs, which is located immediately at the entrance to the sea. </p><p>  In the bay of Provato there are also not very cozy narrow beaches with large pebbles.  They are called Factory.  Despite the fact that access to them is difficult, a small number of holidaymakers can be seen here. </p><h2>  Other beaches </h2><p>  In the west of the village of Ordzhonikidze, between small toes there are small beaches visited.  They are famous enough, and many seek here to retire in private and snorkel.  These beaches do not have names, they are simply given numbers.  There is no access to them.  You can get to the beaches along the paths or along the coastal strip.  Due to the privacy and secrecy from the eyes, these beaches were chosen by lovers of sunbathing naked.  Here you can also meet campers. </p>
