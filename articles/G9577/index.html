We want to talk about one of the hotels of the famous resort called Nha Trang.  Thang Long Nha Trang is a three star hotel located off the coast. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel ... </h2><p>  Thang Long Nha Trang is on the second line, 300 meters from the beach.  The hotel can be attributed to fairly young institutions, since it was built in 2011.  The hotel consists of one fifteen-story building located in the center, the so-called European quarter. </p><p>  The hotel offers its guests to use the services of a paid shuttle service to get from Kamran Airport, located 26 kilometers away.  Thang Long Nha Trang stands out from the total mass of complexes.  A tall narrow building remotely resembles a candle. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Thang Long Nha Trang offers 57 rooms, including apartments in the following categories: </p><ol><li>  Deluxe (Deluxe room). </li><li>  Improved <strong> </strong>  Room (Superior). <strong></strong></li><li>  Standard </li><li>  Suite (Suite). </li></ol><p>  All rooms of the hotel are equipped with national-style wooden furniture, air conditioning, wireless internet, flat-screen TVs, minibars, satellite channels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thang long nha trang" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1726886.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The rooms at Thang Long Nha Trang are small but comfortable.  They have everything that vacationers may need.  You can get into your room by elevator, in total there are two of them in the building.  All apartments are located on both sides of the narrow corridor and have a standard layout.  It's nice that the rooms have windows.  As you know, in Vietnam there are often cases when the rooms have absolutely no access to sunlight.  In this sense, Thang Long Nha Trang 3 * will not bring unpleasant surprises, since absolutely all of its apartments are equipped with windows. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Thang Long Nha Trang 3 * has a restaurant where breakfast is served in the morning.  Every day, guests can see local and international dishes at the buffet.  For breakfast, usually served the usual set of food: rolls, coffee, pastries, meat, sausages, eggs, bacon, scrambled eggs, soups, fruits, cereals and much more.  Throughout the day, guests can order food from the restaurant's menu. </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the hotel there is a sufficient number of different restaurants and cafes where you can always eat.  As a rule, tourists prefer to try food in several places, then to give preference to one of the institutions. </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  Thang Long Nha Trang 3 * <span>(Vietnam, Nha Trang)</span> is a small compact hotel consisting of one building.  The hotel does not have its own territory.  There was supposed to be a pool on the top floor of the building, its construction was started, but to this day there is no reservoir in the hotel.  In the basement of the building there is a parking lot, which helps a lot if you still decide to rent a motorbike.  The hotel is in a place with well-developed infrastructure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thang long nha trang 3" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1726887.jpg" width="600"></div>

A small cozy room, of course, does not really correspond to the pathos definition of ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù, but nevertheless, they are well prepared here and are always glad to see guests. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Thang Long <span>Nha Trang Hotel (Nha Trang)</span> is a ten minute walk from the coast.  The insignificant distance from the beach does not bother at all.  The hotel does not have its own plot on the coast, so guests have the opportunity to visit the municipal coast, equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas.  The hotel provides beach towels for guests, which are issued daily at the reception. </p><h2>  Thang Long Nha Trang (Vietnam): reviews </h2><p>  In order to have a more complete picture of the hotel, let's turn to the reviews of tourists who have already rested in it.  It is thanks to their opinion that you can get a more real idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe institution.  I would like to note that numerous positive reviews already say a lot.  According to tourists, the hotel Thang Long Nha Trang 3 * (Vietnam) - confirmation of this - fully matches the three stars on its sign.  Of course, as in any institution, there are drawbacks here, but they are not so significant that you can ignore them.  But let's talk about the advantages and disadvantages in more detail ... </p><p>  When choosing a hotel for relaxation, of course, tourists pay attention to the cost of living and the location.  It's no secret that the most popular are hotels located on the first line.  Not everyone will want to spend precious minutes of rest on long walks to the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thang long nha trang vietnam reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1726888.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Thang Long Nha Trang Hotel 3 * (Nha Trang) is located on the second line, the coastal road, even at the slowest pace, takes from seven to ten minutes.  If you are not tired of short walks, then you can pay attention to this complex.  The location of the building in the center of the European quarter provides several advantages, as there are bus stops, grocery stores, restaurants, cafes and ATMs nearby.  Leaving the hotel, tourists immediately find themselves in the center of spa life.  But at the same time, there are no extraneous noises in the hotel, so a relaxing stay is guaranteed. </p><h2>  Hotel room reviews </h2><p>  What rooms does the Thang Long Nha Trang Hotel (Vietnam) offer?  Reviews of tourists give reason to say that the number of rooms in the complex is quite acceptable for a budget institution.  Since the hotel is quite young, its apartments are equipped with modern appliances and furniture. </p><p>  All rooms are compact enough, but at the same time they have everything you need.  Each room has a window, which is nice, because in Vietnam, as already mentioned, often the window openings in the apartments are missing or go into the office corridors.  Some apartments offer beautiful views of the Long Sean Pagoda with Buddha and mountains.  From other rooms you can enjoy the cityscape.  According to guests, the only thing missing in the rooms is the balconies.  Even the superior apartments have no terraces, but there are panoramic windows. </p><p>  The bathrooms in the rooms are small, but clean and beautiful, and all the plumbing is in good condition.  Daily maids update detergents.  Instead of the usual slippers, guests are offered slates (we usually call such shoes Vietnamese). </p><p>  Rooms are cleaned daily with a change of towels.  But bed linen is changed once every few days.  The apartments are maintained in excellent condition thanks to quality cleaning.  According to tourists, the rooms need a little repair, since there are visible signs of scuffs.  But in general, the rooms are cozy and perfect for relaxing if you do not plan to spend all day in them. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel serves buffet breakfast.  The restaurant itself is quite small, but there is enough space for everyone.  A standard set of dishes is served daily in the morning, including: meat, rice noodles, fish, seafood, fruits, salads, and delicious <span>Vietnamese coffee.</span>  By the way, a pleasant woman who cooks Pho traditional soup right in front of you, discusses all the visitors with a smile. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thang long nha trang 3 vietnam reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1726897.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Some tourists complain about the monotony of breakfast food.  But still you won‚Äôt be able to stay hungry, because there are always enough dishes on the tables.  If something ends, the staff quickly replenishes supplies. </p><p>  For lunch and dinner, you can also eat in the hotel restaurant, or you can head to the nearest cafe.  There are a lot of various catering facilities near the hotel, so tourists always have a choice. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel ... </h2><p>  According to tourists, the disadvantages of the hotel include the lack of a pool.  Of course, vacationers spend more time on the beach, but during storms, an artificial pond can be a good alternative. </p><p>  The staff of the complex does not speak Russian at all and knows English very poorly, so sometimes it can be difficult to explain.  Otherwise, the hotel employees have no complaints.  During registration at the reception, a passport is taken as a deposit.  He is returned after you pass the number.  This approach is even convenient in some ways, since there is no need to keep track of documents; in the safe at the reception they will be completely safe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thang long nha trang hotel vietnam reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1726892.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Here you can also rent a motorbike from the staff, which is useful for trips around the resort if you want to see the sights on your own.  The hotel has a parking where you can leave your transport.  Wireless internet is available throughout.  And in the hotel lobby there are three computers that you can use if necessary.  One of them is even equipped with a Russian keyboard. </p><p>  As for the remoteness of the hotel from the coast, the road to the beach takes a little time, and it passes through an interesting residential quarter, in which there is something to see.  The municipal coast is equipped with paid sunbeds and umbrellas, and beach towels can be taken at the hotel.  Sandy beach and warm sea are the main attractions of the resort.  The water here is clean and clear, except for those periods when the wind and storm begin, then from the sea it brings a lot of garbage.  At such moments, it is better not to enter the water. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  If you are planning a trip to Nha Trang, then you should think about what you would like to see in advance.  Vietnam is a stunningly interesting country, the sea and the beach are far from all its attractions. </p><p>  The most famous temples in the Nha Trang area are Po Nagar towers.  It is hard to imagine that these buildings are already more than a thousand years old.  The towers were once part of a single temple complex built during the kingdom of Champa.  The Vietnamese believe that this amazing place is endowed with great spiritual strength.  That is why Buddhist ceremonies are held here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thang long nha trang vietnam nha trang nha trang" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1726893.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tourists come to Nha Trang not only for a beach holiday, here you can also take healthy baths and mud.  In the vicinity of the resort is the famous mud bath Tzap Ba.  The wellness center has a very beautiful area, surrounded by flowers.  Here visitors can bathe in a hot pool with mineral water, take a mud bath. </p><p>  Not only adults, but also children will be interested in visiting the Institute of Oceanography.  Under its roof there is also a research center, an aquarium and a museum.  The institute was opened in 1922 to study the South China Sea.  Over the years, it accumulated a lot of marine items, which have constituted the exposition of the museum, which has been hosting guests since 2005. </p><p>  One of the most visited places in Nha Trang can be considered the Long Sean Pagoda.  This place is considered one of the most beautiful, in addition, the pagoda has the status of the main Buddhist temple throughout the province of Khan-Hoa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thang long nha trang 3 vietnam nha trang" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1726896.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tourists will also be interested in visiting Monkey Island, located twenty kilometers from Nha Trang.  Currently, about 1,500 monkeys live here in natural conditions.  Animals show incredible friendliness to guests, but sometimes they can play pranks by stealing a panama hat or glasses from their heads. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, we can safely recommend to tourists as a place to stay Thang Long Nha Trang (Vietnam, Nha Trang).  Nha Trang is considered to be the beach capital of Vietnam.  Many hotels have been built here, among which you can find both expensive and more budgetary establishments.  A bustling and cheerful city with beautiful beaches and clear sea is one of the best places for a beach holiday in Southeast Asia. </p>
