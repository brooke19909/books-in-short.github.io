    <h2>  the date of the beginning </h2><p>  The fighting was primarily due to the refusal of Russia to actively support the continental blockade, which was seen by Napoleon as the main weapon in the fight against Great Britain.  In addition, Bonaparte pursued a policy towards European countries that did not take into account the interests of Russia.  At the first stage of hostilities, the domestic army was retreating.  The <span>battle of Borodino took place in</span> front of Moscow <span>.</span>  From June to September 1812, the advantage was on the side of Napoleon.  From October to December, Bonaparte's army tried to maneuver.  She sought to move to winter apartments, located in undisturbed areas.  After this, the Russo-French War of 1812 continued with the retreat of the Napoleonic army in conditions of famine and frost. </p>

    <h2>  Prerequisites for the battle </h2><p>  Why did the Russian-French war?  The year 1807 determined for Napoleon his main and actually his only enemy.  They were the United Kingdom.  She captured the French colonies in America and India, creating obstacles to trade.  Due to the fact that England held a good position at sea, the <span>continental blockade was</span> Napoleon's only effective weapon <span>.</span>  Its effectiveness, in turn, depended on the behavior of other powers and their desire to follow sanctions.  Napoleon demanded that Alexander the First carry out a more consistent implementation of the blockade, but constantly met with Russia's reluctance to break off relations with its key trading partner. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1810, our country participated in free trade with neutral states.  This allowed Russia to trade with England through intermediaries.  The government adopts a barrage tariff that raises customs rates, primarily on imported French goods.  This, of course, caused extreme discontent of Napoleon. </p>

    <h2>  Offensive </h2><p>  The Russian-French war of 1812 at the first stage was favorable for Napoleon.  On May 9, he meets in Dresden with allied rulers from Europe.  From there he goes to his army on the river.  The Neman, which divided Prussia and Russia.  On June 22, Bonaparte appealed to the soldiers.  In it, he accuses Russia of not fulfilling the Tizil agreement.  Napoleon called his attack the second Polish invasion.  In June, his army occupied Kovno.  Alexander I at that moment was in Vilna, at the ball. </p><p>  June 25 was the first clash with.  Barbarishki.  Battles also occurred at the Rumshishki and Popartsy.  It is worth saying that the Russo-French war took place with the support of Bonaparte by the Allies.  The main goal at the first stage was the crossing through the Neman.  So, on the south side of Kovno, a group of Beauharnais (Viceroy of Italy) appeared, from the north - the corps of Marshal MacDonald, from Warsaw through the Bug the corps of General Schwarzenberg invaded.  On June 16 (28), soldiers of the great army occupied Vilna.  On June 18 (30), Alexander I sent Adjutant General Balashov to Napoleon with a proposal to make peace and withdraw troops from Russia.  However, Bonaparte refused. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Borodino </h2><p>  On August 26 (September 7), the largest battle took place 125 km from Moscow, after which the Russo-French War went according to the scenario of Kutuzov.  The forces of the parties were approximately equal.  Napoleon had about 130-135 thousand people, Kutuzov had 110-130 thousand. The domestic army did not have enough guns for 31 thousand militiamen of Smolensk and Moscow.  Peaks were handed out to warriors, but Kutuzov did not use people as <span>cannon fodder.</span>  They performed various auxiliary functions - carried the wounded and so on.  Borodino was actually an assault on the soldiers of the great army of Russian fortifications.  Both sides made extensive use of artillery in both attack and defense. </p><h2>  Council at Fili </h2><p>  The battle of Borodino lasted 12 hours.  It was a bloody battle.  Napoleon‚Äôs soldiers at the cost of 30-34 thousand wounded and killed broke through the left flank and pushed the center of the Russian position.  However, they failed to develop their offensive.  In the Russian army, losses were estimated at 40-45 thousand wounded and killed.  There were practically no prisoners on either side. </p><p>  On September 1 (13), Kutuzov‚Äôs army was located in front of Moscow.  Its right flank was at the village of Fili, the center - between s.  Trinity and with.  Volynsky, left - in front of with.  Vorobyov.  Rearguard is located on the river.  Setuni.  At 5 o'clock on the same day, a military council was convened in the house of Frolov.  Barclay de Tolly insisted that the Russo-French War would not be lost if Moscow were given to Napoleon.  He spoke of the need to preserve the army.  Bennigsen, in turn, insisted on holding the battle.  Most of the remaining participants supported his position.  However, Kutuzov put an end to the advice.  The Russian-French war, he believed, would be ended by the defeat of Napoleon only if it was possible to maintain the domestic army.  Kutuzov interrupted the meeting and ordered a retreat.  By the evening of September 14, Napoleon entered deserted Moscow. </p>

    <h2>  The Expulsion of Napoleon </h2><p>  The French did not stay in Moscow for long.  Some time after their invasion, a fire engulfed the city.  Bonaparte's soldiers began to lack food.  Local residents refused to help them.  Moreover, partisan raids began, a militia began to organize.  Napoleon was forced to leave Moscow. </p><p>  Kutuzov, meanwhile, placed his army on the retreat of the French.  Bonaparte intended to go to cities not destroyed by hostilities.  However, his plans were hindered by Russian soldiers.  He was forced to head almost along the same road that he had come to Moscow.  Since the settlements along the way were destroyed by him, there was no food in them, nor were people.  Exhausted by hunger and disease, Napoleon‚Äôs soldiers were constantly attacked. </p><h2>  Russian-French war: results </h2><p>  According to Clausewitz, the great army with reinforcements numbered about 610 thousand people, including 50 thousand Austrian and Prussian soldiers.  Many of those who were able to return to Koenigsberg almost immediately died of illnesses.  In December 1812, about 225 generals, a little more than 5 thousand officers, 26 with a few thousand lower ranks passed through Prussia.  As contemporaries testified, they were all in very miserable condition.  In general, Napoleon lost about 580 thousand soldiers.  The remaining warriors formed the backbone of Bonaparte's new army.  However, in January 1813 the battle moved to the lands of Germany.  Then the fighting continued in France.  In October, Napoleon‚Äôs army was defeated at Leipzig.  In April 1814, Bonaparte abdicated. </p>

    <h2>  Long term effects </h2><p>  What did the won Russian-French war give the country?  The date of this battle has firmly entered history as a turning point in the issue of Russia's influence on European affairs.  Meanwhile, the country's foreign policy strengthening was not accompanied by internal changes.  Despite the fact that the victory rallied and inspired the masses, successes did not lead to a reform of the socio-economic sphere.  Many peasants who fought in the Russian army marched across Europe and saw that serfdom was abolished everywhere.  They expected the same action from their government.  However, serfdom continued to exist after 1812. According to a number of historians, at that time there were still no solid prerequisites that would lead to its immediate abolition. </p><p>  But a sharp surge in peasant uprisings, the creation of political opposition in the progressive nobility, which followed almost immediately after the battle ended, refute this opinion.  The victory in the Patriotic War not only rallied people and contributed to the uplift of the national spirit.  At the same time, the boundaries of freedom expanded in the consciousness of the masses, which led to the uprising of the Decembrists. </p><p>  However, not only this event is associated with the year 1812.  It has long been suggested that all national culture, self-awareness received a push during the Napoleonic invasion.  As Herzen wrote, the true history of Russia only opens since 1812.  Everything that was earlier can only be considered a preface. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Russian-French war showed the strength of the entire people of Russia.  In confrontation with Napoleon, not only the regular army participated.  <span>Partisan movement</span> rose in villages and villages <span>.</span>  Militias formed detachments and attacked soldiers of the great army.  In general, historians note that before this battle in Russia, patriotism was not particularly manifested.  It should be borne in mind that in the country the common population was oppressed by serfdom.  The war with the French turned the minds of people.  The masses of people, united, felt their ability to resist the enemy.  It was a victory not only for the army, its command, but also for the entire population.  Of course, the peasants expected a change in their lives.  But, unfortunately, they were disappointed with further events.  Nevertheless, an impetus for free thought, resistance has already been given. </p>
