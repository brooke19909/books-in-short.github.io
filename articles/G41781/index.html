Archaeological Open Air Museum</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  No one can say how many secrets are hidden under the earth and sand, caused by centuries.  Usually discoveries and discoveries are made by chance.  That is how in Cyprus a farmer came across a mosaic panel while plowing the ground.  It happened in 1962 near the harbor of Paphos.  Thanks to this find and subsequent excavations in Cyprus, the Paphos Archaeological Park appeared. </p><h2>  What excavations tell </h2><p>  It is not surprising that the excavations that began at the site of the found mosaic, gradually, layer by layer, opened up new, interesting traces of civilizations that once lived on this island.  The history of Cyprus is very interesting.  Once it was owned by the Greeks and Romans.  Then the story speaks of the belonging of Paphos to the Byzantine and then to the Ottoman empires.  Owned the island and the UK.  Excavations continue to be carried out at the present time.  When constructing objects, there is always some kind of artifact from ancient buildings. </p><p>  The found ancient mosaic attracted the attention of many scientists and archaeologists.  For 20 years, archaeological expeditions from different countries bit by bit collected a unique coating, made, as it turned out, in the richest villas of the 2nd ‚Äì 3rd centuries AD.  It is amazing that the mosaic has not lost its color.  In addition to mosaics and ancient buildings, temples, city walls, a bridge, basilicas, stone streets were literally ‚Äúdug‚Äù from the soil. </p><h2>  Archaeological park </h2><p>  Everything found during the excavation is a large single complex, which is called the Archaeological Park of Paphos.  Since 1980, the park has been a world cultural heritage and is under the protection of UNESCO.  The valuable mosaics found by the first are in the so-called villas of Dionysus, Aeon, Theseus and Orpheus.  They can be visited by tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The names of the villa were obtained from the heroes of Greek mythology depicted on the mosaic fields, of course, no one knows the names of the real owners of the villas.  An interesting amphitheater, well preserved in the layers of soil and the ruins of the castle "Forty Columns", which served as a fortress.  The forum, the temple of the healing god Asclepius and the basilica are open for visitors. </p><h2>  Park Tours </h2><p>  The historic complex is open to tourists year-round.  The entrance fee is about 4-5 euros.  The sites where excavations are still underway are closed to the public.  There are lovers to wander around the park without a group, sit on the steps of the amphitheater, imagine what happened here many thousands of years ago.  Yes, and more time to consider the relics, take photos.  It usually takes at least four hours to visit the park. </p><p>  For organized groups of tourists, excursions are carried out together with a guide, who, guiding the group through the streets of this archaeological <span>museum in the open air,</span> tells historical facts and myths related to a particular park artifact.  Tours begin from the ruins of four villas, which are the most valuable in the Archaeological Park of Paphos, and date back to the 3rd ‚Äì 5th centuries AD.  e.  The mosaics found during the excavation of these villas, collected from small elements, preserved images of the gods and heroes of Greece and Ancient Rome. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Villa Dionysus </h2><p>  As a result of excavations, a picture of a dwelling with ruined walls, but a well-preserved mosaic floor, was opened before archaeologists.  It was assumed that the villa of Dionysus, located in the archaeological museum, occupied an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 500 square meters.  meters and had forty rooms.  Subsequently, it turned out that this villa was built on the foundation of an even more ancient dwelling, in which there was also a floor mosaic.  The construction dates back to the 2nd century AD.  e.  Unfortunately, the villa of Dionysus and other buildings of Paphos were destroyed by an earthquake in the 4th century. </p><h2>  Mosaic floor technology </h2><p>  You should pay attention to the mosaics, created initially from a simple stone with a simple geometric pattern in a three-color range: black, brown, white.  Then the mosaics became more complicated.  The technology for making mosaic floors has changed.  They laid out by special technology on stones with lime.  On this "pillow" were placed patterns and paintings from the smallest pebbles, special glass and marble chips, which were brought to Cyprus.  It was a very expensive product.  Only very rich people could afford the luxury of a mosaic floor. </p><p>  Immediately at the entrance to the dwelling, the floor is decorated with one of the ancient mosaics of Cyprus.  It depicts Scylla, described in the poem of Homer - "Odyssey."  Nearby is a pair of dolphins.  Geometric pattern in tricolor.  By the way, they discovered the mosaic by accident when they began to erect a canopy over the main exhibits found by that time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  In the interior of the Paphos Archaeological Park are later mosaic floors.  Here is another approach to the color scheme of laid out mosaics.  On one of the mosaics is an image of Narcis framed by lined drawings of the seasons and seasons.  Visitors appear in the form of carpets on mosaics of hunting scenes, images of animals, bunches of grapes.  Mosaics on the themes of love stories are very accurately conveyed by artists of those times. </p><h2>  Theseus Villa </h2><p>  From mythology, we are familiar with the feat of Theseus, who won the labyrinth of the Minotaur.  The villa named after him is a huge building.  During the earthquake, it did not survive, but was rebuilt.  However, the villa was destroyed by the Arabs in the 7th century. </p><p>  In the mosaics made before the earthquake, Roman technologies of making mosaic floors are already visible.  One of the mosaics of the archaeological park depicts a scene in which Theseus fights with the Minotaur.  Mosaic dates from the III century BC.  e. </p><p>  Near this mosaic, the guides tell a moving story about the fact that you should not forget about your promises.  And Theseus, having killed the Minotaur, forgot to change the sails on his ship to white, thereby announcing his victory to his father.  He sailed home under black sails.  And when the father of Theseus Aegeus saw black sails, he realized that his son was dead and his father threw himself off a cliff into the sea, killing himself.  According to this legend, the sea bears the name Aegean - Aegean. </p>

    <h2>  Orpheus House </h2><p>  Even before the excavation began, these ruins of Paphos were already known.  Many artifacts have sunk into oblivion, and part of the stone ruins was used for the construction of houses, since in those years no one thought about the historical value of these ruins.  The outlines of several rooms have been preserved.  Those mosaics that were on the floors date back to the 2nd century AD.  e.  Geometric drawings and the ancient Greek inscriptions on the mosaic managed to understand that this house belonged to the Roman subject Titus Guy Restitution.  However, the house is named, like the previous ones, according to the main image on the mosaic.  It was Orpheus, playing the lyre, surrounded by forest animals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="house of orpheus" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1986360.jpg" width="456"></div>

    <h2>  Villa Aeona </h2><p>  On the other side of the street, a no less interesting dwelling is located in a sheltered building, excavations of which are still ongoing.  But even that which is open to observation speaks of its wealth.  On the destroyed remains of the walls, unique murals are visible.  Mosaic floors are covered.  But most striking is the coverage of the central part of the home.  It depicts the god of justice Aeon. </p><p>  This filigree work is made of the smallest pieces of glass, granite and pebbles.  It conveys the volume in the image of faces on mosaic canvases.  On other mosaics - images of mythological plots about Cassiopeia, Apollo and Zeus.  Mosaics date back to the 4th century A.D.  e.  It is assumed that ongoing excavations will also reveal mosaic floors and wall murals. </p><h2>  Forty Column Castle </h2><p>  The majestic castle of Saranta Colones was built by the Byzantines in the 7th century on forty basalt columns in the form of a defensive structure.  He was destined to build and collapse, to reborn again and again to collapse. </p><p>  When the crusaders captured the fortress in 1191, King Richard the Lionheart not only rebuilt the castle, but also created a good defensive complex around it.  The devastating earthquake of 1222 destroyed this fortress.  Visitors can see among the ruins of the once-existing castle of Saranta Colones wall faults, ruins of buildings and an arch from the gate leading to the castle. </p>

    <h2>  Other park facilities </h2><p>  Agora or market square, composed of stone slabs in the form of a rectangle.  Its construction dates back to the II century BC.  e.  Like any square in the city, this one in Paphos was a meeting place for trade and citizens.  It was destroyed, like all buildings, as a result of an earthquake in the IV century.  It was destroyed during the earthquake and the amphitheater.  But it was restored: it is literally composed of stone blocks found during excavation belonging to the amphitheater.  An open-air amphitheater is currently operating.  Of the 25 rows that once existed, 11 are repaired and restored, here, according to the guides, performances of ancient Greek tragedies are staged. </p><p>  Of interest to visitors is the Temple of Asclepius.  This is a complex of several buildings built in the II century BC.  e.  These buildings were used for healing people.  And the main building of Asklepion is a prototype of the current hospitals.  The steep slope leading to the sea, all in stone caves.  Once upon a time, stone was taken for construction. </p><h2>  And this is also Paphos </h2><p>  What else to see for tourists in this historic city with centuries of history?  There is a large ethnographic museum with a variety of collections, it was founded by a man who was fond of folk art, history, archeology - George Eliades.  The museum displays exhibits ranging from the Neolithic to the present day.  It can rightfully be called one of the archaeological museums of Cyprus. </p>

    <p>  One of the attractions of Paphos is the Byzantine Museum.  Bishop Chrysostomos initiated its creation.  The exposition of the museum is the icons of the 7th-8th centuries, there are also icons painted in the <span>Byzantine style of the</span> 12th-14th centuries.  All icons are in good condition.  The museum exhibits ceremonial robes of priests.  A large collection of church books is also on display at this museum. </p><p>  There is something to see in Paphos outside the walls of museums.  This is located near the Paphos harbor burial times from the IV century BC.  e.  and until the III century AD  e.  In the crypts carved into the rock, there are more than 100 graves.  There are also burial places - <span>this</span> is <span>a necropolis,</span> in which many interesting artifacts were found.  And this is primarily evidence of the life and life of the people who lived here. </p><p>  To see all these attractions, you can buy a tour package and the flight Moscow - Paphos to fly to Paphos International Airport.  By the way, if you are drawn to Cyprus to wander through the ruins of ancient cities, it is better to go to the homeland of Aphrodite from November to April.  Firstly, it‚Äôs not hot, and secondly, you will actually enjoy the nature of these fabulous places, and not languish from the heat.  Tickets for the Moscow ‚Äì Paphos plane are almost always available. </p>
