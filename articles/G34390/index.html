Wonderful mild climate, bewitching nature with its beauty, hospitality of local residents and a lot of interesting places that await both tourists and pious pilgrims - these are not all the "chips" of the country.  First-class service and a friendly attitude towards foreign tourists determine the popularity enjoyed by Israeli resorts.  The Red Sea, the Mediterranean, the Galilee, the <span>Dead, the</span> Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãGalilee - there are quite a lot of reservoirs washing this desert country.  And they all have their own specifics.  Beach resorts in Israel are divided into several zones.  Each of them has its own climatic features.  The beaches of the Mediterranean Sea await holidaymakers in the summer and in the velvet season.  But the southern part of Israel is most comfortable in spring or late autumn.  In this article, we will pay attention to the country's resorts located on the Red Sea coast.  What do tourists say about them?  Read about it below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Israel Resorts Red Sea" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1122515.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Eilat </h2><p>  Looking at the map of Israel, it is easy to guess which of the resorts of Israel is washed by the Red Sea.  Straight, as if drawn by a ruler, the country's borders narrow to the south and touch a thin wedge to the Eilat (Akaba) bay.  The Red Sea here, crashed into the northern coast with a wide fjord, is incredibly beautiful and conceals in its bowels a rich underwater world.  The city of Eilat is an endless series of resort hotels, beautiful beaches, duty-free shops.  It is also one of the country's largest ports, connecting Israel with the <span>Gulf</span> countries <span>.</span>  The duty free zone attracts shopaholics and business travelers.  Those who have little sun and beach also like Eilat.  After all, the border with Egypt can be reached on foot.  You can also go to Jordan and Saudi Arabia.  Other cities in Israel are far from here.  Jerusalem is 307 kilometers, and Tel Aviv is three hundred and fifty-five.  And the northernmost city, Haifa, is separated from the Red Sea coast by as many as four hundred twenty-seven kilometers.  Therefore, if you plan to go to Eilat, it is best to take a flight to your local airport.  Alternatively, you can land in the Egyptian Sharm el-Sheikh. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Israel resorts on the red sea prices" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1122533.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  When to visit Israeli resorts in the Red Sea </h2><p>  Eilat lies in the subtropical climate zone.  The sun seems to have settled here forever.  Only in winter, no, no and even the sky will rain with rain - so long-awaited in this arid area.  December - February in Eilat is a time for lovers of excursions and Christmas sales.  In the summer, not all Europeans are able to withstand the extreme heat that prevails on the local coast.  Therefore, in June - August it is best to go to the more northern resorts of Israel.  The Red Sea is best visited from early March to late April.  In the afternoon, the temperature is very comfortable: + 26-31 degrees.  Eilat is also good in late autumn, in October and November.  Then the air keeps summer heat at + 27-33 degrees.  And the sea in the Gulf of Aqaba is the same almost all year round.  If you are interested in long swims in coral gardens without a heat-insulating suit, the best time for you is September and October.  Then the water temperature in the Red Sea is at around + 26 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Israel Resorts in the Red Sea Eilat" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1122595.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The nuances of Israel </h2><p>  A visa for Russians and Ukrainians is not required to enter the country.  Unless, of course, you want to visit Israel for the purpose of tourism.  Nevertheless, it is better to plan your trip ahead of time.  The fact is that the country has many religious and secular holidays.  And at this time, the locals fell on the spas of Israel.  The Red Sea is a favorite holiday region.  Eilat hotels are stably crowded during the Passover and Rosh Hashanah periods.  If you land in Israel on Friday evening, you are unlikely to have a chance to get to your vacation destination by public transport.  Here the Sabbath is holyly honored, which begins the day before the rise of the first star.  And even more so, you will not leave for Yom Kippur.  On Judgment Day, the Israelites only pray and ask God for forgiveness.  In this regard, the streets are deserted - not even taxis run. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="All Inclusive Resorts in Israel" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1122509.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Eilat resort area </h2><p>  This city is very ancient.  It existed back in the days when King Solomon ruled.  During the period of the Roman Empire, the port of Isla was noisy here, and a military garrison was located in the fortress.  But later the city fell into disrepair and was slowly abandoned by local residents.  This continued until the thirties of the twentieth century.  Seventy years ago, on the site of chic avenues and glamorous embankments, there was a modest caravanserai for camel drivers.  After the proclamation of Israel (1948), the revival of the city began.  First of all, the laid highway, which connected Eilat with the capital and other regions of the country, played a positive role.  This resort received the status of a city only in 1953.  Now in Eilat almost fifty thousand inhabitants live permanently. </p><h2>  Resorts of Israel in the Red Sea: prices </h2><p>  A trip to Eilat cannot be called a budget trip.  But if you try, you can find cheap hotels.  <span>Combined tours</span> to Israel are usually organized from Russia.  They include visits to the sights of the Holy Land, check in to the Dead Sea and, finally, a <span>beach holiday.</span>  For the last stop, tour operators usually choose Israeli resorts on the Red Sea.  All Inclusive, a holiday program so beloved by Russian tourists, is practiced by hotels in Eilat.  And you can choose between the ‚Äúfives‚Äù, ‚Äúfours‚Äù and ‚Äútriples‚Äù.  Of the chic luxury hotels with All Inclusive you can recommend Herolds Boutique 5 * (from 13 thousand rubles per night).  An equally worthy option would be to stay at the Hotel Central Park 4 * or Leonardo Plaza 4 * (from seven thousand).  "Treshki" with "All Inclusive" is "Americana 3 *", "Siesta" and others (from five thousand).  Israelis themselves prefer bed and breakfast hotels or apartments.  Let's understand the nuances of Israeli hotels in Eilat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best resorts of Israel on the red sea" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1122518.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Beach areas.  North side </h2><p>  The eleven-kilometer coast of the southernmost city of Israel can be divided into three parts.  The first is North Beach.  In fact, he is not alone.  The sandy coast, in turn, is divided into smaller sections of beaches.  On the northern side of the Gulf of Aqaba are the <span>best</span> Israeli <span>resorts</span> in the Red Sea.  These include the Herolds Deluxe already mentioned by us, which consists of three parts: a boutique, a palace and a vitalis.  Dan Eilat Deluxe is a luxury hotel that positions itself as a place of purely family relaxation.  But all these hotels are behind the highway.  The only hotel directly on the first line is Le Meridien 5 *.  The beaches in Eilat are municipal and free.  Hotels, no matter how stellar they may be, can only rent a small part of the coast and reserve it for their guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What resorts in israel on the red sea" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1122532.jpg" width="552"></div>

    <h2>  Urban Area and South Beach </h2><p>  In Eilat itself, it is not a problem to find budget housing.  There are even campsites and hostels.  If you stay within the city limits, it is best to reserve apartments with a kitchen.  Reviews praise Cousteau Club, Holiday and Amdar Village.  Coral Beach stretches south of the city.  Its name speaks for itself.  The only drawback of these places is the entry into the sea from the pontoons.  But what a paradise for those who like to explore the underwater world.  The coral reef comes very close to the coast.  Hotels here are designed for sports youth.  But there is no shortage of expensive hotels.  What resorts in Israel on the Red Sea recommend tourists in the south side of Eilat?  The number one sympathy is Orchid 4 Sap.  This hotel is decorated in Thai village style.  A scattering of bungalows and luxury villas with a private pool is surrounded by lush greenery and flowers.  Hotel Isrotel Princess is the best, according to tourists, of the "fives". </p><h2>  Natural Attractions Eilat </h2><p>  The sun, sea and coral reefs - these are three components, because of which tourists choose Israeli resorts on the Red Sea for relaxation.  The city of Eilat is sheltered from the cold winds by mountains from three sides.  And with the fourth - splashing the blue Gulf of Aqaba.  It is unique in that it is the northernmost water area where you can see corals.  Yes, what!  It is best to admire them by taking a short swim from Migdalor Beach.  The reef there comes very close to the shore.  And on the beach there are free sunbeds and awnings.  The bottom is rocky, and therefore the visibility under water is excellent.  And if this doesn't seem enough to you, reviews are advised to go on an excursion to the nearest marine reserve Shmurat Almogim. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Which of the Israeli resorts is washed by the Red Sea" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1122535.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Things to do in Eilat </h2><p>  But what about those who can‚Äôt go scuba diving to the depths, and diving with a mask and snorkel is difficult?  What are the attractions of Israeli resorts for such tourists?  The Red Sea has been and remains one of the main <span>attractions of Eilat.</span>  Therefore, the authorities decided to acquaint the "land" tourists with the beauties of the underwater world through an aquarium.  But in Eilat, no corals are raised from the bottom for all to see.  Tourists themselves go down the spiral staircase laid inside the reef.  At a depth of five meters below sea level, a large hall is equipped, from where you can observe the inhabitants of the Red Sea through glass.  And in the diving center "Dolphin Reef" you can swim in the company of friendly bottlenose dolphins.  But this is far from all the entertainment in Eilat.  The ancient citadel of Masada, the amusement park "City of the Kings", a camel or jeep safari in the Negev desert, boat trips or fishing in the Gulf of Aqaba - all this, according to tourists, is worth the money spent.  And do not forget: Egypt and Jordan from Eilat are within walking distance. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  The duty-free zone makes Israeli resorts on the Red Sea very popular.  Prices in Eilat are significantly lower than in the rest of Israel.  Tourists recommend visiting the Mall a Yam.  This three-story shopping center of one hundred and twenty shops and boutiques stands right on the promenade.  Another mall, Big, is located in the city center.  What is being brought from Eilat?  Mostly jewelry from famous Israeli companies - Mehrot Even, Padani, Stern, Kadurit, and Bursa Takhshetim. </p>
