In addition to everything else, the country is able to provide luxurious relaxation conditions to all tourists coming here.  Here you will find any conditions that novice tourists and experienced travelers accustomed to luxury will find acceptable. </p><p>  Reviews of Italy hotels inspire those who have never been there to travel.  By the way, those who at least once came to Italy are returning here again.  Because the sensations of trembling delight in contact with a great culture cannot be compared with any of the pleasures of the service of luxury sea resorts. </p><p>  <strong>The hotel world of Italy is enormously diverse</strong> .  It presents completely unlike each other <span>hotels, hotels,</span> pensions that are able to meet all international criteria.  Hotels vary in location, staff qualifications, prices for services provided. </p><p>  <strong>Italy hotels differ from any other in the world</strong> even by their classification.  They are not divided by service levels; they are divided culturally, geographically, and thematically. </p><p>  Specialists divided hotels in Italy into hotels in the cities of art, at sea and <span>thermal resorts,</span> on lakes, hotels for surfers, skiers, hotels - cultural monuments, designer hotels and wine castles. </p><p>  As can be seen from this division, for almost any tourist there is ‚Äútheir‚Äù hotel, which will meet his preferences in terms of cultural recreation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Traditionally, hotels in Italy vary in "stardom."  However, this division is purely Italian and often does not comply with international standards.  However, the level of all hotels in Europe is high. </p><p>  <strong>In Italy, more than 35 thousand hotels of various levels.</strong>  City hotels for the most part are three-star, high-quality and sound.  Beach hotels, as a rule, are characterized by a higher level of service and developed infrastructure.  For travelers on excursion tours, it is best to choose hotels with 3 stars.  But for a rest on the sea it is better to book a 5-star hotel, because you have to spend a lot of time in it. </p><p>  Hotel room prices vary depending on the time of year.  A common occurrence for Italy is the "boarding obligations" of tourists - a pre-agreed minimum number of days of residence. </p><p>  <strong>The best hotels of the country are in Rome.</strong> </p><p>  Hotel Terminal (3 *) </p><p>  This is a small hotel in the city center.  From here it is easy to reach the main sights of Rome on foot.  A great option for tourists and business travelers. </p><p>  Hotel Valle (3 *) </p><p>  The hotel is of exquisite design, similar to a palace.  The rooms are equipped with all the achievements of civilization, including internet access.  This hotel can offer discounts and special accommodation conditions. </p><p>  Hotel Prime Hotel Saint John (4 *) </p><p>  Located in Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano.  The hotel rooms are functional, high-quality service, qualified staff. </p><p>  Hotel Eurostars International Palace (4 *) </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A modern hotel in a classical style, but with some frills characteristic of the Renaissance era.  Located on Via Nazionale in the center of Rome.  There are non-smoking rooms, massage services are available, which can be ordered in the room. </p><p>  Hotel Majestic (5 *) </p><p>  This hotel is the oldest in Rome; it was opened in 1889.  This is a real palace with huge apartments.  Here, Fellini worked on episodes of Dolce Vita.  The level of the hotel is the highest, designed for distinguished guests. </p><p>  Holidays in Italy, reviews of which invariably vary from enthusiastic to inspired, are designed for those who like to relax with dignity.  And in terms of comfort, and in terms of satisfying spiritual aspirations.  You should not go here just for the sake of the beach season.  This is not enough for Italy.  She is worthy of respect and reverence, awe and sincere admiration. </p><p>  Italy is good for those who love the freedom of sensations, who are not lazy to go forward, in a literal and figurative sense.  And you can go here many roads.  It is impossible to get around them all.  But you need to choose at least some. </p><p>  <strong>Rome</strong> ... the eternal city.  Antiquity and modernity paradoxically coexist and coexist peacefully in a huge, stunningly beautiful city.  Magnificent squares, fountains, churches are carried away during the Renaissance.  Even the hotels in Italy in this city are characterized by indescribable sophistication of stylized architecture. </p><p>  <strong>Florence</strong> ... Michelangelo, Donatello, Botticelli and other great masters worked here. </p><p>  <strong>Venice</strong> ... This is not even a fairy tale, and not a place.  This is the inexplicable fantasy of the craziest romance that has come true.  Canal streets are transferred to another dimension.  So unusual, so beautiful, so unique. </p><p><br>  If you are planning a trip to the Mediterranean, hotels in Italy need to be booked in advance.  You can even choose a hotel of any level without leaving your home: city, starryness, additional services.  It can be Rome, Sorrento, Venice, Turin, Milan, Florence or any other city of your choice. </p>

    <p>  Holidays in Italy, reviews about which can only be positive and enthusiastic, are worth taking care of organizing a trip in advance.  The easiest and most reliable way to do this is through intermediaries, represented by professional <span>travel agencies.</span> </p><p>  And believe me, if you do not consider yourself a fan of this country, then after the trip you will certainly become one. </p>
