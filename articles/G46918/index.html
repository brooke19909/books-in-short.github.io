    <p>  For sewing a tunic, it is required to take the same measurements as for a men's shirt.  On many sites, the measurements for the pattern are written in the form of an abbreviation, which is not entirely clear for those who are just starting to engage in sewing. </p><p>  When taking measurements, you need to stand on the side of the person, when measuring, the centimeter should not be too stretched. </p><p>  To create a military tunic of war years on a figure, it is necessary to take the following measurements: </p><ul><li>  In order to properly design and stitch the collar of the right diameter, you need to measure the coverage of the neck (OS in the abbreviation).  During measurements, you need to put your thumb under the centimeter.  This is required so that the gate does not go too tight. </li><li>  OG - chest coverage, measured by its protruding points. </li><li>  Be sure to find out the size of the waist - OT.  To do this, find a thin spot between the last ribs and the beginning of the pelvic bone.  For accuracy, the waist can be tied with thread or elastic. </li><li>  Measure the hips around the protruding points of the buttocks. </li><li>  Knowing the width of the chest SH is very important, because the size of our tunic depends on this.  To make the measurement easier, you need to insert small rulers or wooden sticks as high as possible into the armpits, after which it remains to measure the distance between these two points. </li><li>   - back width is needed to build a back pattern.  It is measured by analogy with SH. </li><li>  DR is also measured - the length of the sleeve in order to properly sketch the future sleeve.  To do this, measure the distance from the beginning of the shoulder seam to the bone on the thumb. </li><li>  Shoulder coverage (OP) in creating a <span>sleeve pattern is</span> also important. </li><li>  At the end, the DI itself is measured - the length of the product.  This value is very important for those who learn in practice how to sew a tunic.  It is necessary to measure the length from the seventh vertebra of the spine to the point where the product itself is supposed to end. </li></ul><p>  This is perhaps the most basic thing you need to know for someone who wants to sew a tunic for a boy.  After these measurements, you need to start building the pattern. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Creating a good pattern for a boy </h2>

    <p>  The construction of a pattern for a tunic is done on the basis of a pattern for a shirt or children's jacket.  The main difference is that in front of the zipper or lock, 2-3 cm is added to the zipper. </p><p>  The added fabric is shown by a dashed line on the pattern from the middle of the front.  To ensure that the length of the tunic is correct, another 6-8 cm is added to the length of the bodice. 2.5 cm should also be added to the tab for the elastic on the ribbons. </p><p>  You can make a tunic with the bottom lowered, in which case you need to stitch the tab below. </p><p>  To narrow the sleeves at the bottom, it is recommended to sew small tabs 4-6 cm long. </p><h2>  Building patterns for the collar </h2><p>  The collar cut to the tunic is made in the form of a rectangle, the long side of which should be 1/2 of the total neck circumference plus an addition of 2 cm. For example, with a neck circumference of 24 cm, the following goes: 24: 2 = 12;  12 + 2 = 14.  This means that the size of the collar is 14 cm. These are calculations for the distance from point a to b.  The short part from point b to point c is only 8 cm. </p><p>  From point b to point d, 2 cm are laid to cut the collar in front in an oblique line. </p><p>  From point a to point d lay 2 cm under the cut of the collar.  The next step is to draw an oblique line of the inner slice from point g to d. To draw a clear line in front of the collar, connect point g to point c.  The formation of the bottom occurs by creating a slightly indented line, gradually shortening it by 1 cm at point c. </p><p>  This is the basis of everything; without it, it will not be possible to sew a tunic for a boy correctly. </p><h2>  A simple option for a girl </h2>

    <p>  After building the pattern of the soldier's tunic, you need to transfer it to the fabric and cut it out.  Before drawing the fabric, you need to steam it well and iron it thoroughly.  If a material is selected that can give a precipitate after washing, wash it in warm water and dry thoroughly before use.  After the necessary preparation, you can safely proceed to the cutting. </p><p>  The paper pattern must be cut carefully, strictly along the drawn pencil line, otherwise the product may turn out to be smaller than necessary.  After this, it is necessary to fold the fabric with the front side inward and gently circle all the details of the pattern using a special chalk.  Cut fabric with allowance for allowances of 1 cm. </p><h2>  Sewing a military tunic </h2>
