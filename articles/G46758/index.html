    <p>  Equipped with a brushed aluminum alloy frame and Gorilla glass on the front and rear surfaces, the S6 is significantly different from the devices of the previous five Galaxy generations.  Obviously, this is a completely different device, the appearance of which fans have been expecting for many years. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  So, the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Edge S6 has the familiar shape of <span>Samsung</span> tablets <span>with</span> rounded top and bottom and straight sides.  The power button and nano SIM card slot are located on its right side.  On the left, the case contains connectors for MicroUSB and a headset, at the bottom there are separate buttons for adjusting the volume (as in the iPhone 6). </p><p>  The central metal Home button connects two capacitive keys to open the latest applications and return back.  A stunning new feature allows you to press the Home button twice to start the camera at any time, even if the phone is locked (although it will take a little longer).  Samsung has also developed a fingerprint scanner that can be used to securely unlock your phone.  Instead of dragging numbers down the sensor, now you can simply throw them to Home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  However, disadvantages can also be noted - the camera protrudes slightly on the back, and this may not be very convenient for some users.  In addition, the glass surface of the phone is likely to be covered in spots and fingerprints.  However, this problem can be solved for the Samsung Galaxy Edge case, covering its back surface.  S6 is not waterproof. </p><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  The S6 looks sleek and slim, especially when compared to the slightly more bulky Galaxy S5.  Due to its straight edges, the smartphone does not look as organic as the iPhone 6 with rounded sides, but still the design of the device is impressive.  At the same time, the Samsung <span>Galaxy S6 Edge,</span> whose price is slightly above average, makes confident attempts to match high-end "apple" devices. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The colors are rather modest - both models come with a platinum color frame in addition to the black sapphire and white pearl cases.  The back surface of the device glistens and reflects light.  Samsung developers say this effect should add depth and warmth, but users say that such relentless reflection can be annoying.  The white version minimizes this effect, but it is still evident outdoors. </p>

    <p>  Comparison with Apple's device is no coincidence.  <span>The Samsung Galaxy S6</span> Edge, a review of which is presented in this article, looks too similar to it.  Despite the fact that it is larger in size and has more straight sides, its shape and placement of components such as buttons, a headset jack and speaker grille are surprisingly similar if you place two devices side by side.  Moreover, in white there is an almost indistinguishable shade of matte silver finish. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the basic configuration of the Samsung Galaxy Edge 32Gb includes teardrop-shaped in-ear headphones that look like Apple's new model - EarPods in the iPhone. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Samsung does not use the largest display size in this model - 5.1 inches, its AMOLED resolution of 2,560x1,440 pixels with a density of 577 pixels per inch (PPI) is currently the best on the market.  Looking at streaming video, enlarged texts and HD-wallpapers, it can be noted that no interference and individual points are not displayed at all. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  But in standard everyday use, such a high density S6 screen may seem tedious for the eyes. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  For years, users have complained about the rude and heavy TouchWiz interface that Samsung uses as the user layer over Android.  There will be no more of this flaw.  Using the Android version 5.0 led to the introduction of more convenient settings into the smartphone, which rely on the basic design from Google.  Samsung developers were able to create a simpler layout without losing functional software. </p>

    <p>  The installation process is now much easier thanks to Lollipop, and the supplied instructions will help to avoid all possible difficulties (for example, setting up S Voice and a fingerprint scanner). </p><p>  Samsung experts also reduced the menu.  The multi-window mode for viewing a split screen still allows you to open two programs at once, but instead of switching and selecting from the pop-up menu, the Recent tab has become available.  You can still drag and resize these windows, even turning them into floating images. </p><p>  Other useful additions include private mode and call blocking, Do Not Disturb mode, as well as popular gestures and SmartStay.  A more complete list of quick access controls and settings is available, which you can see by pulling down the notification bar with two fingers. </p><h2>  Preinstalled applications </h2><p>  Several folders filled with applications have a simplified look.  One of them is Google Apps services and services, another is Microsoft applications (this folder contains Skype and OneDrive, for example).  There is also a nice bonus: you can edit the color of folders. </p><p>  As for the pre-installed programs, there are many of Samsung‚Äôs own services - for listening to music, watching videos and so on.  To download more applications from Samsung Apps and affiliate programs, you need to open the shortcut and select the one you need from the list.  One of these affordable services is Fleksy, an alternative to the keyboard, which is offered free of charge to all users of S6 phones. </p>

    <p>  The smartphone also has a powerful and high-quality Exynos processor (unlike the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, which can be found in most competing devices of a high price class on Android).  Samsung Galaxy Edge S6 is also equipped with <span>wireless charging</span> and compatibility with the new version of VR-accessories.  You will not find these two features on either the iPhone or most other gadgets. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy Edge - architecture features </h2><p>  The processor consists of two quad-core chips - one with a frequency of 2.1 GHz for performing energy-intensive tasks such as games and streaming video, while the 1.5GHz chip takes on simpler options, such as text messaging or surfing the Internet .  All this power means that the system works at tremendous speed without any slowdowns. </p><h2>  Payment systems </h2><p>  About the improved <span>fingerprint reader</span> has already been mentioned above, and this service is used not only to unlock the phone.  He also sets up settings for making mobile payments using the Samsung Pay system, which was launched in trial mode in the US and South Korea.  Today it is not known in which countries this feature will become available in the future, but its convenience has already been appreciated by users.  The appearance of this payment service in the Samsung Galaxy Edge, reviews of which are only positive, is likely in the near future in the CIS countries. </p><p>  At the same time, you can use GooglePay or various other payment applications, there are no restrictions on their installation. </p><h2>  Camera features </h2><p>  The 16-megapixel camera protrudes slightly from the back of the Samsung Galaxy Edge.  Its technical characteristics in many ways resemble the camera present on the 2014 model, GalaxyNote 4. The lens itself has updates that were included in the Galaxy S5. </p><p>  The S6 and S6 are Samsung‚Äôs second wave of phones that incorporate optical image stabilization, which should help smooth out trembling hands.  The new Auto-HDR (High Dynamic Range) feature means you no longer need to interrupt shooting to improve some settings.  The option will automatically adjust the balance of color and lighting. </p><p>  You can also take good selfies with this 16-megapixel camera, which has optical image stabilization and allows you to get a clear picture. </p><p>  On the front of the device, Samsung mounts a 5-megapixel camera for wide-angle selfies and guarantees an improvement in the quality of photographs taken in low light.  As in the previous model, you can shoot yourself by tapping the sensor on the back of the phone, and also download a separate Samsung self-portrait shooting mode, which allows you to shoot from the phone‚Äôs rear camera. </p><p>  The right edge of the screen containing the camera‚Äôs settings includes effects and a timer, plus adjusting shooting options such as autofocus tracking and voice control.  Meanwhile, the ‚ÄúMode‚Äù button on the right side offers six alternative shooting options, including panorama and slow motion.  Pro mode allows granular settings for macro shooting and white balance, while virtual shooting allows you to get an image in a moving GIF format. </p><h2>  Battery operation </h2><p>  Immediately after the release of the Samsung Galaxy Edge plus smartphone, questions were raised about whether the 2600mAh battery can really provide decent performance.  Unfortunately, the battery life of the smartphone is not too long.  The high resolution of the display and the powerful processor hardly allow the device to last on one charge all day.  In addition, the device‚Äôs battery is non-removable - it cannot be removed and replaced. </p><p>  A small charge saving might be that the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge consumes very little standby power.  If your phone spends most of the day, being on the table, in a bag or pocket, you can rest assured that the device will work quietly until the end of the day. </p><h2>  Positive traits </h2><p>  The sleek case of the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, the review of which is presented above, is made of glass and a brushed metal frame, which allows it to look luxurious.  An improved fingerprint reader and convenient camera settings will also be appreciated by any user.  Android 5.0 provides convenience and high functionality. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The main disadvantages of the device are a non-removable battery and the lack of expandable memory.  In addition, the battery is not powerful enough. </p><h2>  Final verdict </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, priced at $ 329, looks great and has first-class features.  Despite the shortcomings, this is one of the best smartphones of 2015. </p>
