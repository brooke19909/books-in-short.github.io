Similar companies are issued by such companies as Nikon, Kenon, Samsung.  You can add Olympus to their list.  The Olympus SZ-14 was recently introduced.  It is compact, small in size, and many customers like the technical specifications.  You can buy this camera at the moment in specialized stores for 5500 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="olympus sz 14" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1941908.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The camera is released immediately in several price options.  The most popular model is gray.  For girls, those options that are painted in red are more suitable.  But you need to know that no matter what tone the camera is for sale, its lens will be standardly black.  If you turn on the device, then this part extends, so that you can achieve a 24-fold increase. </p><p>  What do customers like most?  As a rule, all devices with such a zoom are created with huge dimensions.  What can not be said about the <span>Olympus</span> SZ-14 <span>camera</span> .  Dimensions: 10.7 √ó 6.9 √ó 4 cm. They are not very compact, but stand out from the competition.  Many people wonder how a lens that has a focal length of 25 to 600 mm can fit in such a housing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="olympus sz 14 camera" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1941909.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Optics </h2><p>  Small dimensions did affect the optics.  Unfortunately, when working with zoom, the aperture drops.  The manufacturer at an official presentation said that this parameter has an indicator of F3-F6.9.  A similar drop occurs due to the huge number of optical parts in the case and, of course, due to the minimum size of the camera itself.  This effect occurs even with the fact that the device has special lenses of several types.  But worry about such a defect is not worth it.  Due to the strong zoom, the shutter speed may increase, but this is not a strong drawback.  The device has an optical stabilization of the double type.  It works by shifting the matrix.  Due to this, the pictures will not be blurry. </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  The Olympus SZ-14 camera body, the price of which is low, received a "hump" on the top.  Below it is a flash that can be turned on or off if necessary.  She is quite powerful.  With its help, you can light up to 7 meters closest to the camera. </p><p>  On the back is an LCD type screen.  He is bright.  To the right of it are buttons that are responsible for the controls.  These keys are different in size and have their own functions.  In the center is a multi-position disc.  Of course, the developers took care of the presence of the buttons for turning on the video recording.  It is located above all others and has a decent size.  To call help, the manufacturer created a separate key. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="olympus sz 14 price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1941911.jpg"></div>

As already mentioned, it is installed LCD type.  The manufacturer used a pretty good screen, which shows itself best among competitors from the budget category.  The resolution of the Olympus SZ-14 display (price indicated above) is 430 thousand pixels.  The picture is as clear as possible, so you can consider any detail in the picture taken.  On the screen, the device shows itself perfectly.  It does not fade and the image is visible well.  There is no sensor coverage.  Buyers note that it is not needed.  The menu is well implemented without it.  Even a novice without experience using this device will be able to quickly and without instructions figure out what's what.  The viewfinder is missing.  But this solution is quite understandable, since if it were, the cost would increase by 50% or more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="olympus sz 14 camera price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/1942167.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Matrix </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãinstalled exactly at 5500 rubles, for which the device is sold.  Therefore, you will not have to wait for special quality.  The sensor is the most common.  Its diagonal is 1 / 2.3 inches.  Resolution - 14 megapixels.  The matrix was created using CCD technology, which has long been considered obsolete.  It should be noted that a small resolution of the matrix has benefited this device.  Thanks to this, photosensitivity and photocells are implemented as well as possible.  Even at low ISOs and low shutter speeds, photos have no noise.  Of course, this is true only for those pictures that are taken in well-lit rooms.  As soon as the sun disappears, slight distortion will appear. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The camera got a pretty good processor.  In a second, it is capable of processing up to 10 frames.  Therefore, owners can use the already favorite shooting mode of the series.  Its maximum size is 43 photos.  For a simple device at a low cost, this figure is simply excellent.  There is a self-timer: for 2 seconds and 12. </p>
