  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mario Sorrenti: the legendary photographer</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The American photographer Mario Sorrenti is famous all over the world for his extraordinary style and vision of a naked female body.  Photographs by this artist are simple and innocent, which cannot but fascinate.  Mario‚Äôs life is filled with various spontaneous decisions and tests, which you can learn about by reading his biography. </p><div class="photo" data-original="the-talks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sorrenti mario" class="if uuid-3092906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3092906.jpg"></div><h2>  early years </h2><p>  Mario Sorrenti was born on the twenty-fourth of October 1971.  A guy was brought up in a creative family: his father was an artist, and his mother worked as an advertising agent in New York.  Mario is not the only child.  In addition to him, two more future photographers grew up: brother David and sister Vanina. </p><p>  Ten-year-old Mario Sorrenti and his family decided to move to New York, where they currently live.  Thanks to American coloring and eternal journeys, the boy found inspiration in flowers.  A wide palette to this day nourishes the imagination of the Italian. </p><div class="photo" data-original="purple.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sorrenti mario family" class="if uuid-3092908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3092908.jpg"></div><p>  The first to find himself in the photograph was his older brother David.  At seventeen, he laid the foundation for a new direction in photographic art - "heroin chic."  The guy created amazing portraits of thin and exhausted models.  Because of his addiction to drugs, David died at the age of twenty, and later Mario Morrenti wrote a book about him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Carier start </h2><p>  Mario began to get involved in photography at the same time as his brother, but before the tragic event he did not leave his shadow.  One shot became a "goldfish" for the photographer. </p><p>  It was an advertising campaign for Obsession perfume from the famous brand Calvin Klein.  Mario Sorrenti and Kate Moss (a young, still unknown to anyone seventeen-year-old model) made photography truly legendary.  The beauty and the photographer worked alone in natural conditions, so each shot accurately conveys all the feelings and sensations.  After his work, they were exhibited in such world fashion capitals as London, Paris, Monaco, New York. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.maxim.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mario sorrenti 2" class="if uuid-3092904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3092904.jpg"></div><h2>  Universal recognition </h2><p>  In 2004, the first exhibition of photographs by Mario Sorrenti was held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  The atmosphere was saturated with creative mess and was distinguished by the characteristic features of the New York loft.  Magazine clippings and polaroids demonstrated the beauty of nude girls, the elegance of bends and the tenderness of disheveled hair. </p><p>  A year later, the photographer was invited to conduct a portrait photo shoot with the unique Winona Ryder for Another Magazine.  In 2008, the pages of the November Paris issue of Vogue reflected the results of the thirty-seventeen Sorrenti photo shoot and two models, Anna Selezneva and Eva Herzigova.  In 2012, a man received a proposal to develop a Pirelli calendar. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.harpersbazaar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mario Sorrenti and Kate Moss" class="if uuid-3092902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3092902.jpg"></div><p>  Since then, Mario has fruitfully collaborated with the global brands Max Mara, Bulgari, Calvin Klein, Kenzo, Emporio Armani, Mango, Chloe.  His pictures flaunt on the pages and covers of glossy fashion magazines GQ, Vogue, W Magazine and Playboy. </p><p>  Mario Sorrenti is not just a photographer, he is a real artist and creator.  The models who worked with him more than once noted the amazing atmosphere that reigned on the set.  Even the smallest details will not go away from his lens, a unique vision of the creator helps to reveal human beauty from completely different sides.  That is why you need to view all of his work, get the most out of yourself and get inspired. </p>
