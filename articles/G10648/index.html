All travelers usually talk about popular and well-trodden tourist routes.  Not a single Italian trip is complete without visiting such famous cities as Rome, Florence, Milan or Venice.  Fortunately, Italy is such an amazing country that only these cities can not do. </p><p>  The topic of our article will be devoted to the small provincial town of Varese in Italy, which is famous not only for its attractions, but also for relaxing on the banks of the magnificent lake of the same name.  Let's get to know each other better! </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The history of this province originates, according to official documents, from 922.  The Middle Ages can be described as the interweaving of the events of the Genoese republic and the Lavagna family.  Over time, power over the city was transferred from one generation to another, one surname was replaced by another.  Despite this factor, by the end of the 20th century, Varese served as a favorite vacation spot for secular aristocracy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.kudoybook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Urban architecture" class="if uuid-2464697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2464697.jpg"></div><h2>  Attractions Varese </h2><p>  In Italy, almost every town has its own unique buildings or cultural monuments that keep a whole history.  Province of Varese is no exception to the rule.  Among the most interesting places on its territory, the most distinguished palace is Estenese, where the sanctuary of Monte Sacro is located.  For those who first hear about a place like Monte Sacro, it‚Äôs worth knowing that it is from here that the procession begins!  Nearby, at the foot of the hill, is the equally famous church of Santa Maria del Monte.  These two main attractions of Italy in Varese are considered the most valuable in the country, since thousands of pilgrims from all over the world come to them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having carefully studied religious monuments, you can go to a nearby small village, where to this day you can see fancy medieval buildings.  In the shops you can find unique handmade souvenirs that are unlikely to be bought in other popular <span>resort cities in Italy.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City of Varese" class="if uuid-2464692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2464692.jpg"></div><h2>  Italy villas </h2><p>  Art galleries, monuments, wide squares and other historical monuments are far from the only attractions on the territory of Varese.  In this wonderful town you can still go on an excursion to one of the unique villas that are in great demand among tourists.  For example, the villa ‚ÄúMirabello‚Äù can serve as an interesting object, because it contains a collection of paintings by Italian painters, as well as a full-fledged archaeological museum. </p><p>  Villa ‚ÄúRecalcati‚Äù is one of the most spectacular architectural monuments.  In the XIX century, this building belonged to one of the richest and most influential families in Italy - the Morozini family.  At some point, the family suffered financial difficulties.  Therefore, they were forced to lease part of the premises.  There are many important people among the visitors to the villa, including the famous actress Eleanor Duse. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Entire golf courses can serve as a separate object for an interesting pastime!  In the vicinity of Varese there are more than five of them, there is also a separate hippodrome where you can ride horses.  Here is such a wonderful city of Varese in Italy.  Do you still doubt whether it is worth visiting?  Then continue our review! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itinari.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Villa in Varese" class="if uuid-2467035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2467035.jpg"></div><h2>  Lake Varese </h2><p>  In Italy, holidays on famous lakes such as Garda, Como or Maggiore are very popular.  This kind of pastime is preferred by all local residents, so as not to rush along the sea coast among the crowds of tourists, but to escape from the bustle of the city somewhere in the middle of nature for the weekend.  Many travelers completely forget that somewhere in the province of Varese there is the lake of the same name Lago di Varese!  But this is a great option for a summer beach holiday, boat trips and yachts.  An interesting fact is that Lake Wazere is of glacial origin and is located at an altitude of about 236 meters above sea level.  Here you can find quite rare birds: a red heron or a big bittern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.kudoybook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of Lake Varese" class="if uuid-2464699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2464699.jpg"></div><h2>  Estense complex </h2><p>  In the central part of the city is the main historical symbol - the Estense palace and park complex.  This building primarily impresses visitors with its scale and luxury of the facade, which has survived to this day in its original appearance.  At the moment, the Estense complex is a striking example of the Baroque style and the most memorable monument located in the city.  As for the park separately, it is worth saying that this is a whole fascinating journey into the world of various sculptures, beautiful fountains and pools.  Definitely worth a visit! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Estense complex" class="if uuid-2464706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2464706.jpg"></div><h2>  Baroffio Museum </h2><p>  Speaking of cultural institutions located on the city territory, it is worth highlighting the Baroffio Museum.  Here the main part of the exhibits is devoted to religious subjects, but even if you are not a fan of religion, this place will not leave you indifferent.  Once upon a time, a rich baron lived in Varese, collecting all objects of art on religious subjects.  Actually, subsequently his entire collection was redistributed to the Baroffio Museum.  Today it is one of the most unusual museums in the city that is visited daily by pilgrims from all over the world. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  The weather in Varese (Italy) is usually mild.  Due to its geographical location, climatic conditions are very liveable here: saturated hot summers with periodic precipitation and warm winters.  The province of Varese is located in northern Italy, so the climate here is very similar to Milanese.  Between May and October, the air temperature fluctuates between 23-30 degrees Celsius, but in winter the thermometer does not drop below 7 degrees.  Therefore, you can safely go here in the winter to the thaw in the hope of at least some time to forget about the harsh weather in Russia.  In general, you can come to rest in Varese almost at any time of the year, because for Italy there is no bad weather!  On the photo below - Varese (Italy) in the spring. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vivivarese.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The central part of the city" class="if uuid-2464710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2464710.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Holidays in Varese are the most wonderful way of spending time!  Here, definitely, a wide selection of attractions and what you can do.  I like outdoor activities - play golf on one of the fields or ride a horse, enjoying the picturesque views.  A lake, fresh air and a beautiful landscape - all this will help you brighten up your vacation in Italy.  The city of Varese is perfect not only for family people, but also for a noisy company.  Here you can rent an apartment, a loft or stay in a hotel room on the eve of the May holidays.  We hope that our article helped you to form your own opinion about this heavenly corner of the planet.  Have a nice rest and new discoveries! </p>
