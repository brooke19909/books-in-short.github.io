Today it is considered one of the most prestigious quarters and the main business center of the French capital. </p><p>  Montparnasse in Paris, which keeps the memory of the great masters who worked here a century ago, is incredibly popular among tourists and provides an opportunity to stroll through historical places.  The mecca of metropolitan poets and artists is famous not only for its special atmosphere, but also for various sights that have become the highlight of the country. </p><h2>  History of the bohemian region </h2><p>  The famous area is located on the left bank of the Seine River.  Once there was an earthen mound, where students came to recite verses heated with wine.  It was they who nicknamed the hill "the hill of Parnassus," recalling the sacred mountain in Greece, on which the muses of singing and poetry lived.  In the 1920s, Raspail Boulevards were laid on this site. <em> </em>  and Montparnasse, which intersect in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãP. Picasso.  In the 19th century, lovers of bohemian life moved from a decent center to the outskirts of the city to have fun in a cabaret and have fun <span>burning their lives.</span>  Creative young people gathered here, but the true glory of this place was brought by famous painters who became regulars in inexpensive coffee shops in Montparnasse.  They paid with their works, and now the most famous museums in the world envy the art collections of cafes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montparnasse in Paris" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1665175.jpg" width="600"></div>

After the Second World War, he could not regain the glory of the bohemian corner and began to slowly turn into a business district.  In the middle of the last century, the reconstruction of the historical site began, which continues to this day.  She radically changed the face of the southern part of the city, but many corners remained untouched and continue to delight travelers. </p><h2>  Tour montparnasse </h2><p>  So what to visit first of all for tourists who find themselves in the former Mecca of the creative intelligentsia?  The main attraction of the area is the 57-story Montparnasse skyscraper in Paris, the gigantic dimensions of which against the background of the historical center have been constantly criticized.  However, the tower is considered the most popular tourist attraction of the capital of France. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montparnasse height in Paris" class="if" height="492" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1665205.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Previously, there was a small train station at this place, and as the city grew, it ceased to cope with the increased traffic volumes.  On the territory of the complex of buildings dismantled by decision of the authorities in 1972, a monolithic structure of metal and glass grew, from the observation deck of which there is an amazing view of the picturesque city.  <span>Montparnasse Tower</span> in Paris, awkwardly towering over the historic district, is 210 meters.  At the foot of the building, resembling an oval cigar, there is a huge shopping center, and business offices are located on 57 floors.  It is curious that the skyscraper, which was repeatedly recognized as an ugly metropolitan building, goes far underground, and metro lines intersect under the block. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Viewpoint </h2><p>  The top point of a skyscraper - a helipad - is rarely used for its intended purpose.  But for the guests of the city it is of particular interest.  It is not very crowded, and every tourist without haste and fuss will enjoy from above the views of the surroundings of the capital.  Using high-speed elevators, you can climb to the last floors of the tower in just 40 seconds, and interactive tools, photographs and maps will introduce the history of the city.  The 200-meter height of Montparnasse in Paris allows you to admire the amazing panorama and see the city in full view. </p><h2>  Gare montparnasse </h2><p>  In 1969, the dismantling of the old station began, the buildings of which did not meet modern requirements, and the construction of a huge complex of structures made of glass panels began.  Montparnasse train station in Paris is one of the busiest places in the capital.  Every year it receives up to 50 million people who change trains from the metro and do not go outside, which is very convenient for tourists.  The new and beautiful building stands out from the houses located nearby.  From the landscaped train station connecting Paris with the Atlantic coast, commuter trains leave for the journey. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montparnasse train station in Paris" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1665193.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Jardin atlantique </h2><p>  On the roof of the Gare Montparnasse is an amazing living area, combining the best achievements of landscape art and engineering technology.  Located at an 18-meter height, Jardin Atlantique is completely invisible from below, and you can get upstairs by elevator or stairs inside the building.  Opened 23 years ago, the Atlantic Garden is decorated in a marine style, and even the sidewalks resemble a ship deck.  The green oasis, consisting of two parts, will appeal not only to lovers of meditation and relaxation, but also to those who prefer an active holiday.  Guests should not be afraid that they will miss the train: all announcements in the garden are perfectly audible. </p><h2>  Cimeti√®re du montparnasse </h2><p>  In 1824, by decree of Napoleon, the Montparnasse Cemetery was founded in Paris.  One of the most famous metropolitan necropolises covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã19 hectares.  Tourists walking along the paths on each plate of the monument or crypt will see famous names.  Unusual tombstones contain many interesting stories about the life and death of those who found the last refuge under them.  Guides will help you navigate the well-groomed cemetery and tell a lot of new things about idols, on whose graves loyal fans leave notes, toys and flowers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montparnasse tower height in Paris" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1665194.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Comfortable and safe stay </h2><p>  Tourists who plan to relax in the capital of France, book a flight and hotels in Paris in advance.  Montparnasse is a relatively remote area from the city center in which hotels are distinguished by their accessibility for each guest of the country.  There are no luxurious five-star establishments, as in other districts, but no one will leave home unhappy with comfortable rooms with a comfortable bed, bath, air conditioning and TV.  The business district hotels are located next to the tower, not far from the metro.  And the average price of a room with excellent sound insulation ranges from 50-100 euros per day.  The price includes breakfast - buffet.  According to tourists, living in this area is very convenient and safe. </p>
