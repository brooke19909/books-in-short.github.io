This will help potential customers make the choice: </p><ul><li>  According to customer reviews, Sberbank credit card allows you to get a loan for citizens with a sufficiently large limit (six hundred thousand rubles).  If the client does not apply to the bank for the first time and has no comments on previously issued loans, the bank may increase the maximum amount. </li><li>  Interest on a credit card of Sberbank, according to customer reviews, always accrues only on funds that were withdrawn from the card.  No additional fees will be charged. </li><li>  Many users have difficulty understanding the conditions for using a Sberbank credit card.  According to reviews, the interest accrued after the end of the grace period of the loan often turns out to be greater than the estimated calculations of customers.  Here you can give only advice: you need to clearly understand how long the grace period lasts.  For example, if the reporting period started on June 8, and on the same day payments were made for purchases, then there is time until July 27 to pay off debt without interest.  If the purchase is paid on June 22, then until July 27 there are thirty-five days to pay off the full amount of the debt at 0% (fifteen days of the reporting period and twenty days of the payment period).  Remember that the duration of the grace period is easily calculated using the online calculator from Sberbank. </li><li>  Judging by the reviews of Sberbank credit cards, their main advantages are two points.  Firstly, the ability to withdraw money throughout the country, as well as anywhere in the world.  Secondly, the ability to issue a card online. </li><li>  According to reviews of Sberbank credit cards, their main disadvantages are also in two points.  Firstly, the need to pay a fee for cash withdrawals.  Secondly, the need to provide a statement of income when agreeing on a card limit of more than one hundred thousand rubles.  To do this, you must have a positive credit history and confirmation of employment. </li><li>  Reviews about "Master Card Gold" from Sberbank, a credit card of this level is called the most convenient means of payment.  It is especially suitable for lovers of traveling in Europe. </li><li>  Visa's reviews of Sberbank Gold credit card confirm that it is possible to receive pleasant discounts at almost all airports in the world, which allows traveling with special comfort. </li></ul><p>  Such diverse products are offered by Sbrerbank to its customers. </p>
