In accounting, such operations have a specific name - unbilled deliveries.  These are transactions that inspecting authorities pay special attention to.  Let us consider in more detail the order of their accounting. </p><h2>  Decor </h2><p>  In 2001, the Ministry of Finance of Russia developed ‚ÄúMethodological Instructions for Accounting for MPZ‚Äù.  They indicate that unbilled deliveries are stocks that arrived at the organization without settlement documents: invoice, payment request, etc. Such goods are accepted under the acceptance certificate (form No. 132).  It is compiled in duplicate.  The first remains with the buyer, and the second is sent to the supplier.  The act shall indicate: the name of the product, its unit of measurement, quantity, price, amount with and without VAT. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unbilled deliveries is" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/1473046.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Accounting for Unbilled Supplies </h2><p>  The organization must take all measures to obtain documents from the supplier in the reporting period and to capitalize goods under the general rules.  Unbilled deliveries come in the same way as the MPP.  In analytical and synthetic accounting, accounting (market) prices are indicated. </p><p>  Unbilled deliveries in accounting are recorded by posting DT10 (41) KT60.  If after posting it turns out that the actual cost differs from the registered cost, then it will be necessary to make changes to the document.  The order of this process depends on the timing of receipt of securities.  If the posting of goods and receipt of the invoice was carried out for one calendar year, it will be necessary to adjust the price of the materials received, but not by difference, but by reversal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Example 1 </h2><p>  OJSC concluded a flour supply agreement.  In March, the company received a batch of raw materials without documents.  The accountant capitalized it at the prices of the previous delivery of goods from this supplier (110 thousand rubles).  In the same month, the flour was transferred to production, bread was made from it, which was immediately sold.  In April, the supplier presented settlement documents, according to which the cost of raw materials amounted to 121 thousand rubles.  We reflect in the balance of the buyer unbilled deliveries.  Postings: </p><ul><li>  DT10 KT60 - 100 thousand rubles.  - accounted for flour at market prices. </li><li>  DT19 KT60 - 10 thousand rubles.  - VAT included. </li><li>  DT20 KT10 - 100 thousand rubles.  - flour transferred to production. </li></ul><p>  After receipt of documents from the supplier: </p><ul><li>  DT10 KT60 - 100 thousand rubles.  - reversed the cost of raw materials. </li><li>  DT19 KT60 - 10 thousand rubles.  - VAT reversed. </li><li>  DT20 KT10 - 100 thousand rubles.  - the cost of raw materials transferred to production is reversed. </li><li>  DT10 KT60 - 110 thousand rubles.  - the cost of flour according to the documents is taken into account. </li><li>  DT19 KT60 - 11 thousand rubles.  - VAT included. </li><li>  DT68 KT19 - 11 thousand rubles.  - VAT is deductible. </li><li>  DT20 KT10 - 110 thousand rubles.  - written off the cost of raw materials for production. </li><li>  DT43 KT20 - 10 thousand rubles.  - the difference in cost is taken into account. </li><li>  DT60 KT51 - 121 thousand rubles.  - payment has been made to the supplier. </li></ul>

In each specific situation, it is necessary to verify the fulfillment of the first of these conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unbilled wiring supplies" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/1473045.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Posting </h2><p>  If the accounting of unbilled deliveries is carried out on the basis of the TORG-12 invoice, the organization has the right to deduct VAT on such purchases.  If the tax during the audit recognizes this operation is invalid, you can challenge your rights through the court. </p><p>  Controversial in this situation are the conditions for the transfer of goods to the buyer.  If the goods are shipped at the location of the supplier, then he is obliged to issue (through the carrier) to the buyer a waybill.  Its absence will indicate the unprovenness of the organization‚Äôs receipt of reserves, the absence of grounds for accepting <span>VAT</span> for <span>accounting.</span> </p><h2>  Invoice </h2><p>  Suppose that invoices are transferred to the accounting department several months late for unbilled deliveries.  This is a violation of Art.  169 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation.  It says that the supplier must invoice within 5 days from the date of shipment or transfer of ownership.  VAT can be deductible only after receiving the invoice, but you must choose the right tax period.  According to the letter of the Ministry of Finance No. 253, the deduction can be accepted only in the period when the buyer received the invoice.  But such tactics can attract the attention of tax authorities.  Then you have to defend your point of view in court. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Unbilled deliveries are considered deliveries when" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/1473044.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you refer to the letter of the Ministry of Finance, then in practice this situation may arise.  The supplier indicates the date of July 17, 2015 in the document, but the buyer receives the invoice only on August 18, 2015.  VAT can only be deductible in the month of August.  In order not to have questions about the tax, you should first prepare a document confirming the fact of receiving the invoice in August.  This can be an envelope with a stamp, a cover letter, a correspondence register. </p><h2>  Income tax </h2><p>  Unbilled deliveries are considered deliveries when the supplier did not submit the documents on time.  When calculating income tax (NPP), such supplies cannot be taken into account.  In the examples discussed earlier, it can be seen that the materials can be written off in production before receiving the documents.  In this case, the base when calculating the NPP for the expenses of the organization will need to be clarified. </p><p>  If the documents are handed over to the buyer prior to the submission of the declaration, the adjustment on an accrual basis will be carried out in this order.  The base for NPP decreases for the period in which the goods were sold.  In direct and indirect costs, it is necessary to distribute the materials written off to production.  In the first case, the costs are taken into account during the period when the products were sold, and in the second - at the time of the release of goods and materials into production.  If the organization uses the <span>cash method,</span> the NPP base should be reduced when unbilled deliveries are written off to production.  This is indicated in Art.  320 Tax Code of the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Accounting for Unbilled Posting Supplies" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/1473050.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If the supplier submitted the documents after the submission of the declaration, the organization may (but is not required to) submit a ‚Äúclarification‚Äù.  An error in the calculations did not lead to a reduction in the amount of tax.  Therefore, the value of unbilled deliveries can be reflected in the current period. </p><p>  If the organization uses PBU 18/02, the resulting temporary differences will result in the formation of a tax asset.  In the balance sheet you will need to reflect the following transactions: </p><ul><li>  DT09 KT68 - tax asset accounting. </li><li>  DT68 KT09 - write-off of a tax asset after reducing the base for NPP. </li></ul>
