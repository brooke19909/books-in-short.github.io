  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pongur Waterfall in Vietnam</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  You can endlessly look at three processes - how water flows, how fire burns and how someone works.  You can look at waterfalls forever.  A majestic, amazing sight, breathtaking and not leaving anyone indifferent.  In them lies some primordial power, amazing, fabulous, inhuman.  Not for nothing that for hundreds and thousands of years waterfalls were places of worship, amazing legends and traditions connected with them.  They became a place of new life and new deaths, executed and merciful.  And even now, water falling from a steep wall and breaking into billions of drops leaves no one indifferent. </p><p>  One of such incredible beauty of spectacles was the Pongur waterfall, only recently opened for tourists, and until then - hidden from prying eyes. </p><p>  The waterfall is located not far from the city of Dalat, the central highlands of Vietnam in the province of Lamdong, and is considered a natural miracle of Vietnam. </p><h2>  City Dalat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.welovesolo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Landscapes of Dalat" class="if uuid-2580166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94551/2580166.jpg"></div><p>  Until the XIX century, Dalat was little known, although it is located in a place comparable in picturesqueness to the Alps, and in this nature speaks for itself.  However, as the tourist interest in Vietnam began, the town began to upset, in the 20th century hotels and villas began to appear, and the city began to be called the Vietnamese resort with its many rivers, lakes and a whole system of waterfalls.  But we will only talk about one of them, the pearl of this cascade - Pongur. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pongur Waterfall </h2><div class="photo" data-original="designlooter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pongur waterfall how to get" class="if uuid-2580155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94551/2580155.jpg"></div><p>  This unreal in its beauty waterfall was opened for tourists recently, a little more than five years ago, but has already managed to become a resort and tourist attraction.  What is most pleasant and interesting is that this place has not yet become so massive, there are almost no tours there, there are few laid routes, and tourists mostly get to the waterfall on their own, and therefore this place is even more valuable.  Without crowds of people with cameras, without constant fumbling and chatter, you can freeze next to the jets, as people froze thousands of years ago. </p><p>  The Pongur waterfall will not amaze the tourist with its size, because, in comparison with the world famous, it is not so large - only 40 meters high and about 100 meters wide, but this is not its beauty. </p><p>  The incredible appeal of Pongur in numerous terraces, ledges, on which water breaks dozens of times, turning into spray and foam.  These terraces turn Pongur into a cascade of waterfalls, bewitching the eye. </p><h2>  When is the best time to visit Pongur? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="designlooter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pongur waterfall photo" class="if uuid-2580160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94551/2580160.jpg"></div><p>  The best time to visit this place is the rainy season in Vietnam, for months - from June to October.  It is at this time that the waterfall will be maximally full and will be able to give the most beautiful sight.  There was no sense in hurrying before, even those who traveled in mid-May said that the waterfall does not look so impressive.  Another tip is to choose weekday and non-holiday days to visit.  Although Pongur has not yet become a mass tourist attraction, the locals love it, and on weekends they often have youth gatherings with festivities and bathing, so if you want to enjoy the peace and nature, come in the middle of the week. </p><h2>  How to get to Pongur waterfall? </h2><p>  About 50 kilometers from the city of Dalat to the waterfall, however, to overcome these kilometers, you will have to try.  There are no organized excursions, but you can take a car with a guide or get on your own.  If you decide to visit Pongur Falls, how to get there, take care in advance. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="11.6895661" data-lng="108.2637019" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/9/5/6/4956.png"></div><p>  You can get from Dalat to the waterfall on two roads, DT 725 highway and on the road to Prenn Waterfall, which eventually converge into one highway near the airport on the way to Ho Chi Minh City. </p><p>  If you go on a circular route, you can have time to visit other waterfalls - Elephant, and on the way back - Prenn, and they usually recommend this path, as the most picturesque.  After the airport you need to drive about 12 kilometers along the highway, then turn right at the sign ‚ÄúTh√°c Ponguor‚Äù and then go for about 6 more kilometers to the very entrance to the park. </p><p>  The road to the waterfall is good, the track has recently been repaired, and it will not be difficult to get to it. </p>
