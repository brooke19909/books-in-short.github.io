If you are at a loss to answer this question, then this article is especially for you.  At first glance, its location does not inspire much confidence, the cold Baltic Sea is not very welcoming.  Of course, this is not Sochi, but it is Svetlogorsk that is distinguished by the longest warm days in the Baltic states.  Every year a huge number of tourists (more than 120 thousand people) from Russia and nearby European countries have a rest here.  The climate here is comfortable for treatment and relaxation.  As a rule, the swimming season extends to July and August, although most often you can sunbathe and relax on the beach in spring and autumn.
