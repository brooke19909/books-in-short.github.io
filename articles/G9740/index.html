  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to install Cydia and what is it for?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you are the lucky owner of a device made by Apple, namely Iphone or Ipad, then you must have heard of a procedure like Jailbreak.  This procedure makes it possible to significantly expand the capabilities of your device - install the so-called tweaks that provide new features, as well as install free games and applications for which otherwise you would have to pay.  In this article, we will explain how to install Cydia, the main application that appears after the JailBreak procedure. </p><p>  First of all, we consider it our duty to warn readers that the procedure for obtaining full access to the file system of the device is not approved by Apple and deprives the owner of the device of the right to warranty repairs and maintenance.  You perform all the procedures described in this article at your own risk. </p><p>  So how to install Cydia on our i-device?  First of all, you will need the device itself with a connection cord and a personal computer.  On a personal computer, you need to download and install one of the hacker applications - Absinthe or RedSn0w.  After that, you need to connect the device to the computer and make a full backup, and then reset it to the factory settings - this will help free up memory, which means that it will significantly accelerate the ‚Äújailbreak‚Äù - that‚Äôs what the hackers called Iphone and Ipad hacking.  After the backup copy is saved and the device is virgin, you can safely launch the downloaded application and press the Jailbreak button - after that the installation of Cydia will begin.  The whole process takes about twenty minutes, during which it is best to go to the kitchen to have a coffee at all - the more you look at the black backlit screen of the Iphone or Ipad, the stronger the desire to intervene in the unlocking process, and you absolutely must not do this . </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After all the necessary operations are completed, the device will reboot.  If everything went well and you were able to install Cydia, then its icon will appear on the first desktop.  If there is no icon, try restarting the device - perhaps after that Cydia will appear.  If even reboot did not help, most likely some error occurred during installation, and the only way out would be to repeat the entire procedure. </p><p>  So, we figured out how to install Cydia, but readers are probably wondering what needs to be done next?  And then you need to go into the program that appears on the desktop, and then enter the addresses of the main repositories (they can be easily found on the Internet) in the Sources section.  After the URLs are registered and added, you can begin to install additional packages.  As a rule, most users do Jailbreak in order to be able to install hacked copies of paid toys and programs on their i-devices.  If you are one of them, then you will need the Installous program, which contains links to the latest versions of most hacked programs.  Be prepared for the fact that the download will be made from free file hosting, which means that the download speed will leave much to be desired.  Also remember that although they will offer you to update the hacked application in the App Store, you will not be able to do this, because the system will notice that you did not pay for the program you are trying to update.  Well, if you just want to make your iPhone or iPad more beautiful - there are a lot of interesting tweaks that add various decorations to the iOS interface. </p><p>  We hope that after reading this article you have no questions left about how to install Cydia.  Once again, we remind you that for all actions performed by you with your equipment, the publisher is not responsible.  You perform all operations solely on your own initiative, fully aware that their consequences may differ from those described in this text. </p>
