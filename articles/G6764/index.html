Openwork sweatshirts summer: models, patterns</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Openwork sweaters, summer or demi-season, practically do not go out of fashion.  Of course, styles, cuts and patterns change from year to year, but hand-knitted products are still relevant and valuable.  Moreover, many craftswomen have come to the conclusion that knitted angora or mohair <span>openwork jacket with knitting needles</span> for women is an extremely light, elegant and beautiful product. </p><p>  This article provides photographs, patterns and a description of knitting of two interesting sweaters that can be made using almost any yarn: cotton, rayon, silk, microfiber, as well as fine wool or fleecy thread. </p><h2>  Classic jacket with a pattern of rhombuses </h2><p>  Considering this product, even an experienced knitter can not immediately understand the pattern.  The model is quite simple: a back detail, two shelves and two sleeves.  However, being made in the form of a combination of several schemes, this jacket invariably attracts the eyes and causes curiosity. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork sweaters with knitting needles with diagrams and description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1470776.jpg" width="407"></div>

    <p>  It fits from top to bottom, from the shoulder to the lower edge.  However, this is not raglan, all the main parts are simply manufactured separately. </p><p>  The first row of parts for the back and shelves is the shoulder line.  Next, the craftswoman forms a roll out of the neck and armhole.  After that, knits sections of paintings that fall on the waist.  At this point, you can narrow the details a little, the pattern drawing offers just such an option.  Of course, this is not necessary, since even openwork sweaters look very good, made with knitting needles (with diagrams and description). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork sweater knitting" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1470779.jpg" width="538"></div>

The sleeve is also knitted in the same way: starting from the ridge, narrowing to the cuff and closing the loops where in conventional models there is a set edge. </p><h2>  Attention knitters: high level of difficulty </h2><p>  Those who wish to connect this model will have to activate all their attentiveness and zeal, because the finished schemes serve only as a guide.  Such openwork sweaters with knitting needles (with diagrams and a description or according to your own design) are obtained successfully if you observe several important conditions: </p><ol><li>  The correct selection of yarn (average thickness, lack of melange and boucle). </li><li>  Well-executed control sample. </li><li>  Reliable calculations and, as a result, correct sizes and proportions. </li><li>  Accurate shutdown. </li></ol><p>  The last item can include beautiful trims, cuffs and a bottom line.  Neglecting these nuances can negate all the efforts of the knitter, because only with a beautiful frame the picture looks complete. </p><h2>  Pattern distribution </h2><p>  From the shoulder line to the waist, the craftswoman performs a pattern according to scheme A.3A.  The background is <span>hosiery,</span> and narrow rapports are distributed over the fabric of the part with equal intervals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork jacket for girls" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1470777.jpg" width="433"></div>

    <p>  Later, when the transition to scheme A.4A is performed, each of these rapports becomes the basis for the rhombus.  Part of the canvases of the shelves and the back from the waist to the bottom is knitted according to the scheme A.4A.  An openwork <span>jacket for a girl</span> can be completed with several rows of 1: 1 elastic, and a product for an adult should be decorated with an openwork border. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The pattern shown in diagram A.5A allows you to create an interesting ornament in the form of triangles. </p><h2>  What to do with a sleeve? </h2><p>  When the main parts are finished, it's time to start making sleeves.  As already noted, the typesetting is the tip of the okat.  Then the craftswoman should work according to scheme A.6, so that two rhombuses of different sizes form. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork sweatshirts summer" class="if" height="202" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1470802.jpg" width="600"></div>  After this, use the pattern A.3A, which serves as a continuation of the central part of the ornament.  The finished part of the sleeve is completed with several rows of elastic and the loops are closed.  If desired, cuffs can be made with garter stitch.

    <p>  Craftswomen who are not confident in their abilities or simply want to get a new thing soon, can use a simplified version of the model.  With the use of A.3A and A.6, an excellent jacket with delicate sleeves will come out.  The front and back can be knitted with any familiar pattern, but it is better just to have a smooth surface. </p><h2>  Unusual <span>openwork sweaters</span> with <span>knitting needles</span> with diagrams and description </h2><p>  The following photo shows a raglan-knitted blouse.  There is nothing complicated in it, however, it looks rather eccentric due to the fact that the clasp is located at the back. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted sweater knitting for women" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1470780.jpg" width="396"></div>

    <p>  To knit such a blouse is much easier than the previous one, because there is only one ornament and there is no need to tighten the silhouette. </p><p>  Recommendations regarding yarn: a thin cotton or viscose thread is best suited (then the pattern will be clearly visible). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="drawings of patterns for openwork raglan sweatshirts" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1470782.jpg" width="550"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Do not take yarn with a long pile, as the advantage of the ornament will be lost: because of the fibers, the fabric will be weak and the pattern fuzzy. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  Begin work from the neckline.  It is divided into four unequal parts: about 30% is allocated to the back, 40% is assigned to two shelves (because of the bar) and divided into an equal number of loops, about 30% (15% each) to both arms.  All sections of this long row are separated by four planks of three loops and marked with markers. </p><p>  To form raglan lines, eight new loops are added to each front row.  This is done at four points of the canvas, before and after the three marked elements.  When the raglan is formed, it will be beautifully designed with narrow slats. </p><p>  Along with the expansion of details, you need to work on the pattern.  Knitting sweaters with knitting needles with diagrams and a description is quite simple, because there are necessary instructions.  A schematic illustration of the ornament is shown in diagram A.1. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jacket with lace sleeves" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1470781.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <p>  A strip of pattern from one rapport is placed on each plank of the back.  Detail of the front is fully made openwork.  Sleeves do not contain any ornament.  They are knitted in stocking, and their simplicity only emphasizes the geometric accuracy of the pattern. </p><h2>  How to tie the bar </h2><p>  The manufacture of such details as planks is a separate art form for many craftswomen.  It is necessary to calculate its width in advance (the number of loops) and the gaps between the button holes. </p><p>  The bar is performed simultaneously with the main canvas.  Most often, for this element, a <span>garter stitch is</span> chosen <span>,</span> since it is quite dense and prevents deformation of the product. </p><p>  A solid bar is knitted on one of the shelves, and holes are made on the other, at regular intervals.  It should be borne in mind that the first one should be near the typesetting edge, and the last should be 5-7 cm from the bottom line.  With this arrangement of buttons, the clasp will be convenient to use. </p><p>  To get a neat openwork jacket, knitting the strap with a garter pattern should be accompanied by the same strapping on the bottom of the product and on the sleeves.  Of course, it can be replaced with an elastic band, but the effect will not be the same.  Also, do not try to perform any trims for which you need to tuck the edge of the part.  When working with a thin thread, this technique is not very effective. </p>
