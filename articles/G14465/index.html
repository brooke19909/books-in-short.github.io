    <h2>  Rich functionality </h2><p>  If for something people love the fifth iPhone, it‚Äôs for its rich functionality and attractive design.  It is worth recognizing that the engineers of the corporation responsibly approached the matter and carefully thought out all the details.  So the fifth version of the phone has become even thinner - only 7.6 mm.  Weight is also small - 112 grams.  Despite these parameters, the screen size was increased, a new operating system was installed (7th iOS). </p><p>  A lot has changed in the phone when compared with the previous model, but the most important innovations are performance, OS stability, battery life and, finally, display brightness.  So if the question arose about whether to buy an iPhone 5s or save and buy a 4th model, then you definitely need to take that phone, which is newer and better. </p>

    <h2>  Fifth or sixth? </h2><p>  Why buy an outdated model (if you can call it a phone that was released for the first time just 2.5 years ago) if there is a newer version, that is, the sixth?  Should I buy iPhone 5s in this case? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Here the decision depends on the preferences of the person himself.  Differences, of course, exist.  Firstly, phones are fundamentally different from each other in appearance.  The sixth iPhone is wider and longer.  But this, I must say, is not a plus for every person, since some, on the contrary, prefer more compact models.  For others, on the contrary, it is important that the display is as wide as possible.  It was expected that in the sixth iPhone the camera will become better - by as much as 2 megapixels, however, it remained the same - 8 MP. </p><p>  The novelty is also equipped with various sensors: manufacturers have increased the number of sensors in the phone.  In general, Apple continues to improve its inventions.  Everyone has long known that every new corporation is a serious upgrade.  However, many people simply do not need all these additional applications.  Is it worth buying iPhone 5s if you just need to make calls, listen to music and use the Internet?  It is possible, however, for such purposes both the fourth and third models are suitable. </p><h2>  Owners opinion </h2><p>  How many people, so many opinions, and about whether to buy iPhone 5s in 2014, there were many sayings.  Especially often this question arose in December, since then the sixth model was already planned to be released.  The owners of the new items believe that after the 6th release, buying the 5th iPhone is pointless.  Allegedly, it is not much cheaper than the 6th, it has no special marketing innovations, and the design is too conservative.  Plus, the platform: not every person liked the 7th version of iOS.  Therefore, even last year, when doubts arose about whether to buy the iPhone 5s or wait for the iPhone 6, many made the choice in favor of the latter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Everyone knows that Apple is a brand, and the world-famous and today considered one of the best.  Therefore, the products manufactured by this corporation are expensive.  This applies to everything - whether it's an iPad, iPod, iPhone or MacBook Pro.  If a person in Russia has an Apple phone, this indicates his abundance. </p><p>  But in America, in the homeland of a smartphone, this is the most ordinary gadget.  So, for example, in America, the 5th iPhone costs only 199 dollars!  This is really very small given the standard of living in the United States.  If you translate into rubles at the current exchange rate, then about 12,300 rubles will come out.  Remembering that before the dollar was much cheaper, one wonders how much the fifth smartphone from Apple cost then.  However, even now it is cheap, since the current cost of the 5th iPhone is at least 28 thousand rubles.  Therefore, if you have a trip to the United States and want to buy a new phone, you don‚Äôt even have to think about whether to buy iPhone 5s in America: if you can, then you should definitely take it. </p>

    <h2>  iPhone in Russia </h2><p>  Today, quite a few Russians have an iPhone, although the vast majority use phones running on the Android platform (Explay, Samsung, Lenovo, HTC, etc.).  Everything is again explained by the price, or rather, its relationship with quality.  But many people buy an iPhone, and quite actively, for example, when the last model was released, the sixth, in many stores there was no news on the first day.  Prices, of course, are high, but here everything is relative.  But the last model, the sixth, costs about 50 thousand rubles (64 GB version), and this is the minimum figure. </p>

    <h2>  A budget option </h2><p>  If you really want to buy a phone, but there is no necessary amount, then there is a way out of the situation.  This refers to various sites that sell iPhone on hand, that is, used.  Many people do just that - they buy equipment from someone and use it.  By the way, this is a great option. </p><p>  Some mistakenly believe that it is not necessary to buy used goods: you never know in what condition it is.  However, the previous owners do not sell their phones because they are faulty.  Some of them are used to changing smartphones with the release of new items.  This, by the way, is the most common reason.  Therefore, if in doubt, is it worth buying the iPhone 5s on Avito or is it better to save up money and spend money on a completely new phone, you can safely throw them aside.  And it will turn out to save, and to acquire a phone, almost new.  For example, the new iPhone 6 Plus 16 Gb in excellent condition, which has been used for literally several months, will cost less than 40 thousand rubles, while in the store you will have to pay at least 6 thousand more.  The maximum cost of this model is 62,000 rubles. </p><p>  In general, if you want to buy a phone, you should think carefully about which version it costs to purchase, new or used, and for how much.  After all, the purchase is serious, and you need to approach it responsibly. </p>
