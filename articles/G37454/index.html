    <p>  Novomikhaylovsky resort is located between the resort towns of Dzhubgo and Tuapse.  The village received its historical name in 1864 in honor of the fortification of Mikhailovsky (now Arkhipo-Osipovka), which heroically fought and was destroyed in the war against the Highlanders in 1840.  Here was the Shapshug coastal battalion, which carried the protection of the southern borders of our homeland.  Later, in 1966, the resort was renamed the village of Novomikhailovsky. </p><h2>  Camp "Eaglet" </h2>

    <p>  <span>Novomikhailovsky beaches</span> are famous for their cleanliness and the presence of a variety of entertainment for children and adults.  <span>The seashore is</span> strewn with sand and small pebbles.  Parents with children and citizens who do not know how to swim should be extremely careful when entering the water.  A gentle descent into the sea after 2-3 meters significantly increases the depth and can be dangerous for this category of vacationers.  Touring on catamarans and water skiing, on a boat and jet skis, diving and paragliding can be enjoyed by tourists spending their holidays in Novomikhailovsky.  <span>Recreation centers</span> and pensions for outdoor enthusiasts offer a tourist tour of the surrounding forests, all-terrain vehicles and ATVs.  Here, among the unique wildlife, you can visit dolmens and picturesque waterfalls, swim in a mountain river and take mud therapeutic baths. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Yacht Club "Tornado" </h2><p>  Holidays in Novomikhailovsky have long been chosen by people who are not indifferent to boat trips on yachts and boats.  The sleeping buildings of the Tornado recreation center are located on the very shore of the Black Sea.  Tourists are provided with a wide selection of comfortable rooms with all amenities, of various price categories.  Almost all windows of the living quarters face the azure sea.  But the main feature of the Tornado recreation center is a large selection of leisure services.  In addition to the pool, playgrounds, billiards, private beach, cafes and bars, you can book a walk on the sea on a yacht or boat.  Having sailed a short distance from the coast, diving enthusiasts will dive with scuba diving in the water, and passive vacationers can admire (with luck) dolphins, often swimming in the area.  The recreation center "Tornado" is ideal for those who value comfort and quality and decide to spend their holidays in Novomikhailovsky.  Feedback on services and maintenance can be left on the official website of the yacht club. </p><h2>  "Wild" rest and car camping </h2><p>  Perhaps it is worth telling about another <span>type of vacation</span> in Novomikhailovsky.  For tourists who are accustomed to do without refined and comfortable living conditions, for which the main thing is the bright sun, clean air and warm sea, there is the opportunity to settle in a car camp near the Orlenok camp.  For a small fee, you can put up tents, take advantage of cafes and shops, a sandy beach and water attractions.  On the campsite there are dry closets, drinking water and showers.  Here you can spend an unforgettable time at sea, reviews about the rest in Novomikhailovsky confirm this. </p>
