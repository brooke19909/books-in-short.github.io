Today, almost everyone knows how to convert dollars to rubles and vice versa.  A similar procedure has become part of everyday life.  However, there are very risky ways to exchange currencies that are best avoided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to convert dollars to rubles" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17458/340436.jpg" width="407"></div>

    <h2>  All honestly, without cheating </h2><p>  The least risky thing is to entrust your savings to employees of banking institutions.  They will be happy to help convert US dollars to rubles.  At the same time, the risk of receiving false bills is almost completely eliminated. </p><p>  An important nuance that you should not forget about is the exchange rate.  The official quotes set by the Central Bank may vary significantly in each case, both up and down.  Today, the dollar is at around 35 rubles, but it is worth remembering that it is constantly changing. </p><p>  So, before you go to the bank with your hard earned money, you must: </p><ol><li>  Refine the official exchange rate.  You can do this on the website of the Central Bank or in its nearest branch. </li><li>  Choose a reliable bank with the best quotes. </li></ol><h2>  Who does not take risks, does not drink champagne </h2><p>  How to convert dollars to rubles with the greatest benefit?  This question is relevant for many people.  Those who are not satisfied with bank quotes and who are willing to take risks can be advised to turn to "street money changers".  As a rule, they have a more favorable <span>exchange rate</span> , but they do not provide any guarantees of the success of the transaction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dollar exchange rate to rubles" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17458/340433.jpg" width="300"></div>

One of them is a sign with a deliberately overvalued exchange rate.  The client, seeing her, will hurry to make an exchange.  But when recounting the money received, it often turns out that a decent amount is missing.  The thing is that this information is relevant only when foreign exchange transactions are made with large amounts, starting with 5 thousand dollars.  It turns out that the client was warned about this in advance, because the conditions on the plate were written in Russian in black and white, however, in very small print and in the corner. </p><p>  The next method of making profit "money changers" is very similar to the previous one.  The whole difference lies in the fact that a commission is laid in the quotes of such exchange points.  Therefore, in order to convert the indicated dollar rate into rubles, it will be necessary to deduct it. </p><p>  Two of the above methods are relatively legal.  However, there are many illegal methods.  Therefore, it is worth thinking twice about how to convert dollars into rubles best. </p><h2>  Conducting currency transactions via the Internet </h2>

    <p>  Modern technology has penetrated into all spheres of human life.  And such a profitable business as currency exchange is gradually moving to the Internet.  Indeed, that may be more convenient than the exchange made by pressing a pair of buttons.  But for convenience, as you know, you have to pay. </p><p>  It should be noted that the Internet is a space that is even more subject to the action of scammers.  The decision on how to convert dollars into rubles should be made by their owner.  At the same time, one must always remember that no organization will act at a loss.  Therefore, if in any exchanger the dollar exchange rate is much higher than the official, then it is worth considering before you bring your savings there. </p>
