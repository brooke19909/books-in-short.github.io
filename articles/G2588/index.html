These animals can be found in many areas of Africa and Asia.  The one-humped camel is kept in these areas as a pet. </p><p>  When they were tamed, today it‚Äôs hard to say for sure.  According to some reports, their domestication took place on the <span>Arabian Peninsula.</span>  Most likely this happened in the third millennium before the beginning of our era. </p><p>  The first mention of camel riders is on the Assyrian obelisk.  There are images on the reliefs of 661-631 years.  BC  e.  On them, as a rule, two riders on a camel are shown.  The one in front controls the animal, and the second, turning, shoots with a bow. </p><p>  As a pet, a one-humped camel spread quite late.  According to some reports, the domestication of animals probably did not occur earlier than the second half of the 1st millennium before the beginning of our era.  Subsequently, the distribution environment was constantly increasing.  The most common camels in the desert. </p><p>  Today man has bred various breeds of one-humped camels.  Each breed performs specific tasks.  There is, for example, a flat, mountain one-humped camel. </p><p>  The name - "dromedar" - is translated from Greek as "running".  Unlike other representatives of this family, Camelus dromedarius has higher legs, lighter hair.  The one-humped camel has structural features of some details of the skull and bony processes in the vertebrae. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The length of the dromedar is about 2.3-3.4 meters.  At the withers, it can reach from 1.8 to 2.3 meters.  Unlike the Bactrian, the Dromedar has one hump.  Camelus dromedarius weighs from three hundred to seven hundred kilograms.  The tail of a one-humped camel is not more than fifty centimeters in length.  As a rule, wool has a sandy tint, but individuals from white to dark brown are found.  On the upper part of the head, back and neck, the hair is longer. </p><p>  One-humped camels are distinguished by a long neck, elongated head.  The upper lip has a bifurcated structure, the nostrils are presented in the form of crevices, which, if necessary, the animal can close.  The one-humped camel has very <span>long eyelashes.</span>  On his feet, knees and in some other places he has numerous corns.  Like other members of the family, a one-humped camel has only two toes. </p><p>  Animals are highly adapted to the arid climate.  They are able to do without water for a long period, preserving its supply in their body.  The hump on the back contains fatty deposits.  Their animal uses for energy.  The liquid in camels is stored in the stomach. </p><p>  It is noted that the body temperature of the animal at night is significantly reduced.  In the afternoon, the temperature rises very slowly.  This allows the camel not to sweat.  During particularly dry seasons, an animal can lose more than twenty-five percent of its weight without dying of hunger or thirst.  At the same time, the camel drinks very quickly.  As a result, in almost ten minutes, he can recover lost weight. </p><p>  The distribution area of ‚Äã‚ÄãDromedars as pets extends throughout North Africa, throughout the Middle East to India itself.  The northernmost point of their habitat is Turkestan.  Here, as in <span>Asia Minor,</span> one-humped camels can be found along with the Bactrians. </p><p>  In the daytime, dromedars are quite active.  Those camels that live in the wild usually form harem groups in which there are several females, a male and offspring.  Often young males come together in groups.  But such associations do not last long. </p><p>  Camels are herbivores.  They feed on plants of various species, including salty and prickly. </p>
