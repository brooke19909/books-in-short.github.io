With its location in the heart of Krasnogorsk, the estate would rightfully receive recognition of the pearl of the city, but because of the passivity of the authorities, it would rather be a reproach to it.  The ensemble of magnificent construction is in decline and ruin. </p><p>  A highway runs along the territory of the property, dividing the buildings and the park of one of the most beautiful places in the Moscow region in half. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  History </h2><p>  The history of the Znamenskoye-Gubailovo estate dates back to 1620.  At that time, there were wastelands.  They were given into possession of Semyon Vasilyevich Volynsky after his participation in the Battle of Kulikovo.  After the death of the owner in 1668, the land passed under the control of I.F. Volynsky.  Here, by 1683, he had built a stone church of the Sign of the Blessed Virgin Mary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Original plan" class="if uuid-2707375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2707375.jpg"></div><p>  Later, after the great-granddaughter of the owner Anastasia Vasilievna, married V. M. Dolgorukov, the estate began to belong to this ancient family.  In fact, this marriage with the prince and military leader who annexed Crimea to the Russian Empire merged the oldest noble houses. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  Manor at Dolgorukovs </h2><p>  V. M. Dolgorukov became a military man as early as 13 years old, and already at 14 he stood out during the fighting at the Perekop fortification.  However, all the time while Anna was at the throne, he did not receive ranks.  When Elizabeth became empress, in 1741, his promotion began on the career ladder.  Participating in the Swedish war, after 4 years he receives the rank of colonel.  Commanding the regiment, he managed to make him the best in the Russian army of that era. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The next rank assigned to him was the rank of major general.  Immediately after that, in the same 1755, he participated in the Seven Years War.  On it, he is injured, promoted and awarded the Order of Alexander Nevsky. </p><div class="photo" data-original="autotravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="central house" class="if uuid-2707380" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2707380.jpg"></div><p>  After the coronation of Catherine II, he becomes an General-Chef, receives the Order of St. Andrew the First-Called.  This becomes an anticipation of his subsequent exploits in the war against the Turks.  Dolgorukov‚Äôs division covered the borders with the Crimea, and after 3 years he crossed the Perekop, commanding an army of 38,000 soldiers.  He passed through the entire peninsula, preserving the garrisons of coastal cities and villages.  Then he inflicted a crushing defeat on the army of 95,000 thousand Tatars and Turks. </p><p>  This victory provoked the escape of the Crimean Khan Selim-Girey and the enthronement of Bakhchisaray - a supporter of the Russian Empire, Khan Vahib-Girey.  In the same 1772, an alliance agreement was signed, according to which the Crimea finally passed into the power of the Russian Empire. </p><p>  Vasily Mikhailovich Dolgorukov-Crimean was personally thanked by Catherine II in the writings written to her.  As a reward, he received the Order of George of the 1st degree, a golden snuffbox with a portrait of the empress, 60,000 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2 aria-level="2">  Resignation </h2><p>  A wave of poems in honor of the prince went around the country.  Despite modesty, he succumbed to the dizzying effect of fame.  This was reflected in the fact that when he received the new title - Crimean - of diamonds for a sword, he considered this insufficient.  He wanted to get the field marshal‚Äôs rod, because he considered his exploits higher than the exploits of Razumovsky and Bestuzhev-Ryumin.  They received their wands before him and with less merit.  Being unhappy, the prince resigns. </p><p>  However, he returned to serve after 4 years, replacing Volkonsky.  Volkonsky managed to win the respect of everyone in Moscow during his 9-month service, interrupted by his sudden death.  He had great life experience, was open.  The actions of this nobleman were based on common sense. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  Last years </h2><p>  As for Dolgorukov, he died after several years of his assumption of office.  In 1782, the estate began to belong to his son, V.V. Dolgorukov.  He also had several awards for participating in hostilities, acquired the rank of Privy Councilor Paul I. </p><p>  He married Catherine Baryatinsky, Princess and daughter of the murderer Paul III.  She was the first beauty among the courtiers of Catherine II.  She was famous for her beautiful voice, grace of movements, participation in operas.  Paul I exiled the entire Dolgoruky family to the village, then they moved outside of Russia.  It was Catherine who became the last of the Dolgorukovs who owned the Znamenskoye-Gubailovo estate. </p><p>  The estate has preserved only a few buildings.  Once there was a beautiful house in the style of classicism.  Pavilions were built in the parks; there was a hermitage and grottoes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After the Dolgorukovs, many merchants lived in the possession until 1885. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  Polyakovs </h2><p>  Since 1885, the merchant A. Ya. Polyakov acquired the Znamenskoye-Gubailovo estate.  He owned a cloth factory, a weaving factory.  After bankruptcy, ownership passed to his brother N. Ya. Polyakov.  The reconstruction of the main house of ownership, the expansion of the Znamensky temple.  There is evidence that the owner himself liked to wear a mug with church fees.  The opening of the elementary school took place immediately. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1932 photo" class="if uuid-2707386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2707386.jpg"></div><p>  The director of the factory later became Yakov Alexandrovich Polyakov.  A little later, the construction of the Fox Mountains took place - the home of master Y. A. Polyakov.  With the death of A. Ya. Polyakov, his children immortalized his memory.  A chapel was constructed over his burial. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  Further fate </h2><p>  In the future, this beautiful place in the suburbs attracted many cultural figures.  It was owned by the nephew of the famous merchant who died here.  Sergei Alexandrovich Polyakov was a man of original unique thinking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krasnogorsk.jimdo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor building at the end of the 18th century" class="if uuid-2707401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2707401.jpg"></div><p>  He owned manufactories, was a mathematician, a polyglot, who knew 15 languages. </p><p>  Among his main accomplishments are poems in the style of symbolism.  He was a kind of connecting link between the creators of this direction. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  After the revolution </h2><p>  The post-revolutionary life of this leader was tragic.  Sergei Polyakov courageously kept losing his property.  Repeatedly tried to continue publishing, was arrested.  Earned by translating articles.  In 1929, he was evicted from Moscow, all the largest cities were closed to him.  He died at the height of the war in 1943 in Kazan, being there in exile.  In Krasnogorsk, in the Znamenskoye-Gubailovo estate, a peculiar monument to the family has been preserved.  This is the tomb of the Polyakovs, it is distinguished by its unique style and beauty. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  Ensemble </h2><p>  The architectural idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex was once based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa broad ‚Äúavenue‚Äù.  On both sides of it were the central building and the rest of the house.  This device was popular in Peterhof cottages, erected by status courtiers in the era of Catherine II.  The cottage on the Peterhof road could be built only by persons with a special rank at the imperial court.  Lands were issued from the department of the palace. </p><div class="photo" data-original="autotravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="manor temple" class="if uuid-2707379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2707379.jpg"></div><p>  The Znamenskoye-Gubailovo estate currently includes a central house, several outbuildings, a 17th-century Znamensky church, a tomb, and a steward‚Äôs house with a horse yard. </p><p>  The temple, built in 1683, was restored a century later, and then underwent reconstruction at the beginning of the 20th century.  During the reconstruction, it was supplemented with extensions of the pseudo-Russian style.  In the era of the USSR, the church did not work, the upper tiers of its bell tower were destroyed. </p><p>  The temple was restored in 1993, and a couple of years later the bell tower was completed.  Due to the loss of old murals, all the walls were re-painted in the 1990s.  From then until now, a gymnasium has been operating within its walls. </p><p>  The real grace of the Znamenskoye-Gubailovo estate is the tomb of the Polyakovs.  It has been preserved since 1920.  It is decorated with rich glazed polychrome ceramics.  Its interior has survived to our years.  The portal is decorated with majolica.  However, at this point in time, a magnificent chapel is surrounded by forests.  Restoration is not planned. </p><p>  The central building is a 20th century neo-empire masterpiece built on a classic ancient base.  The front hall, lobby, and entrance hall have been preserved.  The walls are decorated with decorative elegant stucco molding.  The interior decoration is also partially preserved - ancient corner stoves, cornices.  At the moment, this building has a center for children's creativity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tomb of the Polyakovs" class="if uuid-2707388" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2707388.jpg"></div><p>  Special attention should be paid to the wings built right after the house.  Their facades are decorated with porticoes with columns of the Roman Doric order.  Already in the 19th century, closer to the 20th century, second floors were added to them.  The most complex composition has a residential neoclassical outbuilding.  With a colonnade, a balcony and a veranda, it hides a deep loggia.  It offers a beautiful view in the current era, when in the immediate vicinity there is a town near Moscow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krasnogorsk.jimdo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="horse yard in the 20th century" class="if uuid-2707402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2707402.jpg"></div><p>  Nearby is the horse yard, preserved from the 18th century.  Despite numerous changes, he retained the particles from the original architectural solutions. </p><p>  Like the situation with all suburban residences, the description of the Znamenskoye-Gubailovo estate is most fully disclosed in summer or autumn.  The buildings of ocher color are in perfect harmony with the golden autumn, which makes walking here a deep aesthetic pleasure. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  How to get to the estate Znamenskoye-Gubailovo </h2><p>  When driving from Moscow you need to go to Volokolamsk highway.  Drive along the corners towards Mitino and Ilyinsky.  After leaving the MKAD, you need to pass under the Mitinsky bridge.  Having entered Krasnogorsk, move up the highway to its smooth right turn. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.821678" data-lng="37.32168490000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/2/5/1/7251.png"></div><p>  Already here you can see the home church.  It is located right next to the highway.  Before turning to the recreation center "Podmoskovye" turn to the horse yard, parking is near the traffic police.  From here originates the road leading to the estate territory. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  Reviews </h2><p>  At the moment, reviews about the Znamenskoye-Gubailovo estate indicate that there is a restoration of individual outbuildings.  The central building is adapted for the house of children's creativity.  Park alleys with urban recreation areas are surrounded around.  Noteworthy sights of this park are the oldest cedars with larch, which were planted by the owners of the estate.  Their age exceeds 200 years.  The park area is large and clean. </p><p>  Visitor reviews say that the formerly significant estate today Znamenskoye-Gubailovo presents several buildings that look beautifully golden in autumn, in harmony with nature with its classic ocher and white color scheme.  One of them is open to visitors, and there are several modern exhibitions in it.  An interesting exhibition of dolls, as well as rooms in a communal apartment. </p><p>  And even being right on the territory of a city near Moscow, Znamenskoye-Gubailovo remained a real estate.  No surrounding realities of the modern world could spoil this effect.  Nevertheless, the world still risks losing the legendary estate with all its complex. </p>
