The highest point is Pico de las Nieves (1949 m above sea level).  It is often said that Grancanaria in the Canary Islands is a mini-continent, the conclusion is made, given the diverse climate variations on the island itself.  The north, as a rule, is colder from the hot midday, and the mountainous areas are always more cloudy and rainy.  It is dominated by high temperatures and, as a rule, a lot of sun.  The capital of the island of Las Palmas is located in the northeastern part of Grancanaria in the Canary Islands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.loveholidays.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.loveholidays.com/blog/recommendations/holiday-hotspots/ten-reasons-to-visit-gran-canaria/"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãby the sea" class="if uuid-3210179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3210179.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  It offers numerous hotels on a variety of budgets.

Free time should be diversified a little by choosing excursions in this area.  There are several interesting Grancanaria attractions to choose from.  Extremely diverse landscape, steep cliffs of cliffs, sunny weather and sandy beaches are just some of the many advantages of the island. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.free-motion.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mountain ranges" class="if uuid-3210182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3210182.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth going on an excursion to Telda (it is recommended to visit the picturesque city center and cave houses) or Roque Nublo (monolithic rock). </p><h2>  Regions </h2><p>  The main regions of the island: </p><ul><li>  The Maspalomas region is the most popular Grancanaria region among tourists, covering the southern part of the island.  There are numerous natural attractions, in particular the famous Maspalomas dunes. </li><li>  The Las Palmas region is the eastern region of the island, this is the place where the capital is located - the old and at the same time noisy Las Palmas. </li><li>  The Northwest region is a region that has not yet been fully opened for mass tourism, so here you can find a little more peace of mind.

In ancient times, the Canary Islands, called the Happy Islands, were in the zone of interest of the Greeks and Romans.  The inhabitants of these lands were the Guanches, a nation akin to the Berbers.  Europeans arrived on the islands around XIV.  Over the next centuries, expeditions of French, Castilian and Portuguese went here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelesdunas.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.hotelesdunas.com/en/news/2016/07/28/hiking-trails-gran-canaria/"><img itemprop="image" alt="local nature" class="if uuid-3210181" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3210181.jpg"></div><p>  Grancanaria, however, remained little studied during the so-called era of the Lord, when the Canary Islands were colonized.  Under Spanish citizenship, these places fell only in the Royal era, which began in 1477.  The 17th and 18th centuries brought an economic crisis and emigration.  In the XIX century, between Grancanaria and Tenerife there was a kind of competition for the situation in the region.  The authorities first tried to strengthen the island - a consulate of France and independent military organizations of Tenerife arose.  The current capital of the island, Las Palmas, was founded in 1478.  Since the XX century, the island has become very popular among tourists and has remained so to this day.  Scientists argue about the origin of the name of the island.  It is still assumed that it comes from the name of the Canary dog ‚Äã‚ÄãCan, but now it is believed that the name comes from the word "Canaria" - the proper name of an African tribe who once lived on the island. </p><h2>  Options for outdoor activities </h2><p>  According to tourists, an active form of recreation is very common here.  On most beaches you can go in for various sports, in particular surfing, windsurfing, thanks to strong winds and waves. </p><p>  Diving off the coast of Grancanaria is also popular: it offers the wealth of the Atlantic Ocean - volcanic caves and thousands of species of fauna. </p><p>  Fishing is another recreation option: the surrounding waters are a living environment for many species of fish. </p><p>  The next option is sailing.  The largest harbor is Las Palmas, other popular places where you can dock the boat: Pasito Blanco, Puerto de Mogan, Puerto Rico. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.girlsthatscuba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="canary diving" class="if uuid-3210185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3210185.jpg"></div><p>  From the port in Puerto Rico cruises are organized during which you can watch dolphins.  Many yachts offer boat trips - on ordinary boats, on catamarans, boats with a transparent bottom and even submarines. </p><p>  The island has many clubs and 9 golf courses, including not far from Maspalomas, Playa de Tauro and Las Palmas. </p><p>  Horse riding is popular, especially in the Maspalomas area. </p><p>  Skydiving, a piloting course and excursions by plane are a great offer for thrill-seekers.  5.5 km from San Agustin there is a major parachuting center in the area. </p><p>  Many hotels in the departments have their own tennis courts; in Las Palmas there is also the Club de Tennis. </p><p>  Grancanaria also has numerous spa centers, wellness centers, fitness centers, etc. </p><p>  The mountain landscapes are beautiful, on a hill climbing, hiking, cycling and horseback riding are performed.  The island organizes jeep, camel or donkey safari excursions.  There is also an indoor go-kart in the San Augustin area. </p><p>  Wrestling - a sport known already in antiquity is developing on the island thanks to the island Federation of the Canary Wrestling - on the sandy territory two wrestlers are trying to knock down their opponent. </p><p>  There are many interesting traditional sports in Grancanaria, such as jumping, boulder lifting and pushing, stick fighting, garrot fighting and so on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.civitatis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="camel ride" class="if uuid-3210183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3210183.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Fans of various types of water sports: surfing, sailing, diving, scuba diving and sport fishing have long appreciated the excellent conditions available in the Atlantic Ocean, around the Canary Islands.  On sandy and pebble beaches, lovers of sunbathing and swimming relax.  All visitors are waiting for a reliable constant sun, judging by their reviews. </p><p>  Grancanaria is a great place for hiking.  It has an extensive network of walking routes (about 2 thousand km of paths and roads with varying degrees of difficulty).  Judging by the reviews, the routes are usually diverse, and traveling along them provides a lot of amazing impressions.  A particularly beautiful view opens up from miradores - specially trained points of view (there are more than 30 of them). </p><p>  The island is suitable for a successful family vacation, not only because of the possibility of practicing various sports, but also because of the amusement parks.  They can be interesting to spend the whole day in, for example, watch animal shows or indulge in water procedures.  Another form of entertainment can be tours of the Atlantic with the ability to observe dolphins and whales, with charter flights to other islands of the archipelago. </p><p>  According to tourists, the local cities are beautiful: full of white houses Agaete and Puerto de las Nieves and "little Venice", Puerto de Mogan, where you can stroll along the streets among beautiful bridges and canals. </p><p>  A walk through the historic heart of the old city of Las Palmas is a must when visiting the island.  It is worth going to the largest city beach of the Canary Islands - "Playa de las Canteras", as experienced travelers advise. </p>
