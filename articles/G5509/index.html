You can use the method used by borrowers since the days of the USSR - to write a statement to the finance department at work, the accountant will regularly transfer each month by the details to the Rusfinance account and there is no need to worry about delays. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pulse.com.gh" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Card payment" class="if uuid-2909644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106908/2909644.jpg"></div><h2>  What to do if there is a desire, but there is no possibility? </h2><p>  The convenience of loans was quickly appreciated by the residents of Russia.  But not all regions have reached modern technology.  Not everywhere, especially in rural areas, ATMs are installed, there are no terminals in small shops. </p><p>  But there are telephones, the Internet is connected to them, even in remote villages citizens buy computers.  In this case, you can stop searching for terminals and entrust payments to online portals.  The site of Rusfinance reports that they have an agreement with salons who agreed not to charge fees to customers at the expense of the lender.  There are not many of them, but they are quite popular among the people: </p><ul><li>  Beeline; </li><li>  MTS; </li><li>  Kari. </li></ul><p>  If there is no connection with these sources, an ordinary electronic wallet will help.  There are commissions there, but they are comparable to what you have to add to the ATM.  Sberbank also does not work for free, it takes 1% for its mediation. </p><p>  If the client does not have technical facilities, he is not friends with online sites, he will not be disturbed by the old traditional way of transferring funds - mail.  When concluding a contract, it is necessary to request a printout of postal receipts from the manager.  All details will be filled out in them, the consumer will need to enter only the amount, put his signature and date.  The service is paid.  Payments must be transferred in advance, since this is not an electronic service, significant delays are possible. </p>
