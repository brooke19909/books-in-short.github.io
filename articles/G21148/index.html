Armies of two warring countries - Russia and France came together in battle.  The Russian army was then commanded by Mikhail Kutuzov, the French army was under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte. </p><p>  The battle of Borodino in 1812 was decisive.  About 300 thousand people took part in the grand battle on both sides, and about 1200 guns were used. </p><p>  The battle of Borodino began 110 km west of Moscow.  A day earlier, the advance of the French army was delayed by the Russian avant-garde near the village of Shevardino.  Thus, the main forces of the Russian army were able to gain a foothold in the <span>Borodino field.</span>  Napoleon launched an attack at dawn on August 25th. </p><p>  <span>The battle of Borodino of 1812</span> was notable for bloodshed and bitterness.  Napoleon later spoke of him as the worst of all the battles he had ever given. </p><p>  Losses of the Russian army amounted to more than 44 thousand, the French - 58 thousand people.  According to conservative estimates, about 2,500 people died on the battlefield every hour. </p><p>  Kutuzov, understanding the numerical superiority of the enemy, had to find the most convenient position on the way to Mozhaisk from Tsarevo-Zaimishch.  Experienced officers were sent ahead of time.  On August 22, Kutuzov personally examined the position and gave orders to strengthen it. </p><p>  The chosen position made it possible to protect all the main routes that led to Moscow.  It was impossible to get around the flanks: the right one was covered by the Moskva River, the left - a forest belt.  Ahead, the terrain lay very well visible and made it possible to start shelling if necessary.  Significantly interfered with the maneuvers of the French army, ravines and rivers in front of the front. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Borodino's position greatly limited the capabilities of the French commander.  Napoleon could deeply go around the entire front, but this would lead to undue stretching and weakening of forces. </p><p>  Thus <span>, the</span> battle of <span>Borodino</span> took place at a disadvantageous location for the French army.  Napoleon was forced to accept the battle on the terms of Kutuzov. </p><p>  The famous battle of Borodino began on August 26 at six in the morning with a surprise attack by General Delson.  Almost simultaneously, the French attacked the Bagration (Semenov) flushes, which were the foremost fortifications in the artillery of the entire defensive system on the left flank.  The fights, very fierce, were fought almost noon in this direction.  In an effort to defeat the enemy, the Russian cavalry, infantry and artillery repelled several attacks at once.  Having taken command instead of the wounded Bagration, Konovnitsyn, having assessed the situation, orders to leave the flushes and leave for the Semenovsky ravine. </p><p>  In the afternoon, the obsessed to break through the defenses in the left flank of the Russian army, Napoleon throws into the attack the cavalry corps of Nansuti and Latur-Mobur.  Along with this, Kutuzov orders to take command of the left flank, Lieutenant General Dokhturov, who was able to correctly and timely organize the defense of the Semenov Heights. </p><p>  Despite the fact that for some time the French captured the village of Semenovskoye, they failed to break through the left flank. </p><p>  In the morning, the center of the position <span>(Raevsky‚Äôs battery) of the</span> Russian army was attacked twice, but both attacks were repelled.  However, by noon, a very tense situation was again created here and on the left flank.  Kutuzov gives orders to certain parts of the army to raid the left flank of the French.  This diversion not only distracted part of the Napoleonic army, but also gave respite to the Russian soldiers. </p><p>  In the afternoon, Raevsky‚Äôs battery was again attacked.  The cavalry of Kolenkur, having fallen to the central height, occupied it. </p><p>  The battle continued until the evening.  At the end of the battle, the artillery of the Russian army distinguished itself.  She silenced the French.  Both armies remained on the battlefield by the end of the day. </p>
