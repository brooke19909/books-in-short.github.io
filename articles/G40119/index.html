These territories are very colorful not only in terms of the inhabiting peoples, but also are famous for their natural complexes.

    <h2>  Rise and fall </h2><p>  Where was the Granada emirate located?  The city of Granada itself is located right at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountain range from its northeast side.  Part of the suburbs, which is called the "old", is located on three hills: Sabica, Sacromonte and Albayzin. </p><p>  Modern Granada in the past was inhabited by Iberian tribes.  They also built a settlement, which was later conquered by the Romans and named Iliberis. </p><p>  After the collapse of the Roman Empire, the Granada region went to the vandals, but in 534 the state of the latter ceased to exist, and the area passed into the hands of the Byzantines.  But already in the 7th century, an Iberian state began to grow in this place. </p>

    <p>  The greatest imprint on the modern look of Granada was left by the Moors.  It was they who captured the city in 711 and even renamed it Kalat Gartata.  During the stay of the Moors on these lands, the city was transformed in terms of architecture, received a kind of cultural plaque and lifestyle.  Granada became a scientific and cultural center, the production of silk and elite weapons was born here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1012, Granada took possession of the Berbers and its ruler Zawi ibn Ziri, who made the city the seat of the government Zirid dynasty, had to leave the throne.  Over the century of their reign, the boundaries of the city have expanded significantly, and Granada has become the richest city in Andalusia.  The power of the Nisrid dynasty lasted the longest on these lands, during which the Granada emirate was formed.  Until 1492, many architectural monuments related to the Arab period appeared in Granada. </p>

    <p>  By the end of the 15th century, the Emirate of Granada was a bastion of Islamic religion and culture. </p><p>  The Reconquista did not pass by these lands, and under the onslaught of the Spanish kings the city fell.  This event led to the decline of a flourishing city, it became an ordinary provincial Spanish town.  The appearance of streets, buildings and the city as a whole has changed. </p><h2>  Life of the Granada Emirate </h2><p>  Where was the Emirate of Granada located?  On which peninsula was one of the long-standing strongholds of the Islamic religion?  The last Muslim state in Europe lasted until 1492.  Located on the territory of the Iberian Peninsula in the highlands of the Mediterranean, it was difficult for the enemy to access, it was difficult to surround and isolate.  This became the reason for the viability of the state itself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Emirate of Granada has existed on the territory of the Iberian Peninsula for more than 250 years.  And besides a favorable geographical position, other factors contributed to this. </p>

    <p>  Despite the religious contradictions of Islam and Christianity, the more pressing problems of the medieval world remained completely different.  On the peninsula lived people from a wide variety of faiths.  Moreover, they did not live far from each other, many Catholics lived on Muslim lands and vice versa.  Muslims occupied a significant part of the population.  Jews were the third significant nationality.  The heterogeneity of residence gradually smoothed out the contradictions between peoples and religions and made it possible to form a special type of lifestyle and culture of the emirate. </p><h2>  Wars </h2><p>  The feuds on the Iberian Peninsula did not always arise on religious grounds, but more because of the struggle for new territories.  In addition to Granada, another African force was the North African Marinids.  They, like all other forces, concluded short-lived alliances and ceasefire, which lost their relevance in just a few days.  In the Middle Ages, three main <span>kingdoms</span> were clearly distinguished here <span>: Aragonese,</span> Castilian and Portuguese.  Disunity and civil strife only weakened them. </p>

    <h2>  Culture and religion </h2><p>  Where is the Granada emirate now?  Granada is a beautiful and unique city, not only from a historical point of view.  Ripe pomegranate is the heraldic symbol of this truly heavenly place.  The Emirate of Granada is located in the east of Andalusia, in the south of modern Spain. </p><h2>  Religious tolerance </h2><p>  Christians, Jews and Muslims were left the right to perform their religious rites in their own temples.  Only in return should they recognize secular power and pay certain taxes. </p><h2>  Tongue </h2><p>  In the vastness of the emirate there was no official language.  In legal proceedings and in higher circles of society, both Arabic, Latin, and Jewish languages ​​were fully used.  This was due to the high level of development of Muslim Spain and the presence in the state apparatus of educated Jews and Christians.  The entire population was under the general protection of the ruler, regardless of religion and nationality. </p><h2>  Economic development </h2><p>  The capital of the Emirate of Granada, Granada, is the most economically developed of all the cities of the autonomous community of Andalusia. </p><p>  The population was engaged in agriculture and crafts.  In connection with the provisions of the Koran and the ban on the use of pork, sheep husbandry developed. </p><p>  The mild Mediterranean climate made it possible to actively develop agriculture, and in addition to growing cereals, horticulture and the cultivation of olive trees were well developed here. </p><p>  Craftsmen occupied entire blocks of large Islamic cities.  Craft was a family affair or an occupation of entire communities.  Community life was very active in terms of protecting its inhabitants and guardianship of its poor and sick members. </p>

    <h2>  Trade </h2><p>  The constant state of war absolutely did not weaken the internal and external trade of the peninsula.  During the armistice, merchants even more intensively mastered the markets of their opponents.  The main trading partners were neighbors - the coast of North Africa and Christian kingdoms.  The main products were: olive oil, wool, weapons and jewelry.  Valuable ivory, spices and cotton were brought from Africa to the Granada Emirate. </p><h2>  The Alhambra </h2><p>  The world famous <span>landmark of Granada</span> is the legendary Alhambra palace complex.  It was built during the reign of the Moorish Nisrid dynasty.  Until now, its walls rise on a hill and are visible from any corner of the city.  This is not just a military building, but also a whole residence of Muslim rulers. </p><p>  The Emirate of Granada today is a great place on the Iberian Peninsula, combining several states at once and having a rich centuries-old history. </p>
