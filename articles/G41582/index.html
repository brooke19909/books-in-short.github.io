It is no less important for her that the edge of the product is neat and not too tight - it will be more convenient to wear things.  And no matter what thing the craftswoman knits, she wants to be sure: everything should work out as well as possible.  What needs to be done so that closing the loops with the needle is done correctly, we learn from this article. </p><h2>  To do is right </h2><p>  So, the process of creating a new thing comes to an end.  The only thing that remains is its completion so that the edge of the product is elastic.  It is both beautiful and comfortable.  It is this method that bears the name - closing the loops with a needle.  Because it is with the help of this little assistant that you can complete the work very carefully.  This is not so difficult to do.  But mastering the process will allow the region to look as if the product was manufactured in a factory way.  Using a needle, it is convenient to close the edges of the necks.  This is especially true for huge and high collars on sweaters and jumpers. </p><p>  An embroidery needle will do.  It should be thick, with a blunt tip and a big ear.  The loops must be closed with a working thread, leaving its end in advance, the length of which should be approximately three lengths of the edge to be closed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="needle closure" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1854019.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Closing the front loops with a needle (in fact, like the wrong ones) will not cause any trouble even to not very skilled craftswomen.  There is nothing particularly complicated here.  Loops of the last row remain on the spoke.  It is better to break the working thread, leaving the tip in three lengths (as mentioned earlier).  Poke it in the needle.  Insert the needle into the first loop from the ‚Äúface‚Äù, pass the thread through it and remove from the knitting needle.  Leave the second loop, without touching, from the wrong side.  Now insert the needle into the third loop from the inside and stretch the thread through it.  Insert the needle into the second loop from the ‚Äúface‚Äù and withdraw into the fourth from the inside.  Do the same until the end of the work. </p><h2>  We deal with rubber bands </h2><p>  <span>Closing the hinges with</span> a <span>needle</span> is a pretty convenient way to shut down.  In this way, only gum 1x1 and 2x2 can be closed.  Then the edge of the product will lie naturally and will be able to stretch freely. </p><p>  The closure of the loops is carried out on open loops.  In order for them to be fairly even and not able to bloom, you should finish knitting this part in several rows, which are connected by an additional thread.  Usually their number ranges from three to ten.  The needle is removed from the loops, the edge of the part must be ironed carefully using a damp cloth.  Now dissolve the rows that were previously tied with extra thread.  Into the needle with a large eye, insert the main thread that remains from knitting, make a neat seam along all open loops, and place the product with its front side for convenience. </p><h2>  One front, one back </h2><p>  How to close the loops with a needle in a 1x1 elastic band?  Our article will help you figure this out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the front side, insert the needle into the first edge and second loops.  The part must be bent to itself, and insert the needle from the inside into the first and third loops.  Then from the ‚Äúface‚Äù insert the needle into the second and fourth loops and from the inside into the third and fifth. </p><p>  Closure of loops with a gum needle 1x1 <strong> </strong>  will be simple, the main thing is not to mix anything up. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="closing loops with a needle elastic 2 * 2" class="if" height="426" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1854017.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In such a simple way, introducing the needle into two loops at once from the front and back sides in turn, close the loops along the entire row. </p><h2>  Two facial, two purl </h2><p>  What needs to be done to close the loops with a 2x2 gum needle?  First things first. </p><p>  From the front, insert the needle into the first edge and second loops.  Bending the prepared part to yourself, insert the needle from the wrong side into the first and third loops.  Then from the ‚Äúface‚Äù it is necessary to introduce the needle into the second and fifth loops, and from the inside - into the third and fourth.  On the front side - again in the fifth and sixth loops. </p><p>  That's all.  The closing of the loops with a 2x2 gum needle is completed. </p><h2>  Stretch neck closed with a needle </h2><p>  How to properly handle the edge of the neck?  If the neck is narrow in the model, then it is necessary to close the loops loosely, otherwise when worn the thing will not look very aesthetically pleasing due to the fact that the loops are puffed.  But there is one way to avoid this problem - closing the loops on the neck of the needle.  It is also called the Italian way. </p>

    <p>  To begin with, you should knit two or four rows with a 1x1 elastic band.  If knitting goes in a circle, do so.  First row: only facial loops are knitted, the wrong ones should be removed.  Without knitting, leaving the thread before work.  In the next row, knit only the wrong ones, just knit the front ones, the thread will be at work. </p><p>  It is necessary to measure the thread from the last loop (the length is approximately three neck lengths) and cut off from the skein.  Thread into a knitted needle (differs from the usual one with a blunt end).  Insert the needle into the first facial loop on the spoke so that it goes to the front side. </p><p>  Now you need to pull the thread and insert the needle into the next wrong side (the needle should point out to the craftswoman).  Remove the wrong loop from the knitting needle and insert the tool into the next front loop.  To stretch a needle with yarn - it turns out a certain design of three loops on a thread.  Do not over tighten. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="closing of facial loops with a needle" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1854021.jpg" width="437"></div>

    <p>  Needle closure <strong> </strong>  involves a very neat and attentive work, so you need to follow your every action. </p><h2>  The correct repetition of actions - a neat edge </h2><p>  Let's go back to the wrong loop: stick the needle from the wrong side and bring it to the front.  The loop will be on the thread, now you can remove it from the knitting needle.  It turns out a kind of imitation of the facial loop. </p><p>  Do not pull the thread from the wrong loop, and insert the needle into the next wrong one.  Remove the loop from the knitting needle.  Pull the thread and stick the needle into the front loop, which was removed in advance from the knitting needle and removed from the front, which is still on the knitting needle. </p><p>  Further, such actions must be performed alternately: from the current wrong side - through the removed front to the front loop on the spoke;  from the current face through the wrong side to the wrong side of the needle. </p>

    <p>  Thus, a ‚Äúsnake‚Äù is obtained that flows smoothly from loop to loop. </p><p>  So you should braid the loop around the circle.  When reaching the last loop, pull the needle out of the wrong loop. </p><p>  Bring into the last facial loop, bring it to the first facial loop, and from there from the inside to the last wrong one.  When the whole circle is knitted, it is necessary to fix the remaining ‚Äútail‚Äù and cut off the unnecessary thread.  It turns out a very flat edge, besides quite elastic - it misses the head and fits snugly to the neck. </p><p>  These tips can provide all possible assistance to those craftswomen who are not yet aces in knitting.  But if you follow the proposed recommendations, they should not have any difficulties. </p>
