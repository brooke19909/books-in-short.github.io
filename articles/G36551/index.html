Decoding abbreviations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many abbreviations are ambiguous - their interpretation depends on the context of use.  An example of this is the abbreviation for OOS.  Let's look at its meanings, as well as the definitions of decryption - both widespread and little-known. </p><h2>  Explanation of the abbreviation OOS </h2><p>  Today, there are four values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the reduction of environmental protection: </p><ul><li>  The official all-Russian site "Public Procurement". </li><li>  Reverse negative network in electronics. </li><li>  Feature-oriented scans (in probe scanning microscopy the so-called method of measuring the relief of a surface). </li><li>  Environmental protection. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="tpp.guide" data-author=": " data-source="https://tpp.guide/chances-and-challenges-for-vietnam/tpp-chance-environmental-protection.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="oos this" class="if uuid-2235914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/2235914.jpg"></div><p>  Now let's move on to parsing the values. </p><h2>  Environmental protection </h2><p>  In this area, environmental protection is measures aimed at reducing the negative impact of people on the environment.  These include: </p><ul><li>  Limit the amount of garbage discharged. </li><li>  Creation of national parks, reserves and reserves for the conservation of natural complexes. </li><li>  The ban on hunting, fishing. </li><li>  Limiting emissions to the hydrosphere and atmosphere in order to improve the overall environmental situation. </li></ul><p>  Environmental protection - this is the protection of land, soil protection.  This includes the whole range of agronomic, organizational, economic, land reclamation, technical, economic, legal measures aimed at eliminating and preventing processes that worsen the condition of the land.  It is also the fight against cases of violation of the proper operation of land. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ds.lclark.edu" data-author=": " data-source="https://ds.lclark.edu/mkkoke/china-environmental-history/"><img itemprop="image" alt="OOS: abbreviation" class="if uuid-2235913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/2235913.jpg"></div><p>  Forest protection is also an integral part of the environmental protection system.  Activists fight against fires, concentrated logging, plant diseases, windfalls, pollution of forests, the use of individual selection, which impoverishes the species diversity of trees. </p><h2>  Environmental Protection Activities </h2><p>  When developing such a set of measures, responsible specialists should: </p><ul><li>  Analyze current standards and regulations. </li><li>  Decide on the parameters of the sanitary protection zone. </li><li>  Assess the risk of harm. </li><li>  Make a forecast for the development of emergencies, as well as its consequences. </li><li>  Measure radiation, noise, emissions of harmful chemicals. </li><li>  Calculate the amount of gaseous, liquid, and solid waste generated. </li><li>  Identify adverse factors that as a result of the activities of individuals, enterprises can harm nature. </li><li>  In conclusion, draw up a large set of measures to protect the environment, which will also include alternative solutions. </li></ul><p>  OOS is also actions to eliminate a threat.  For instance: </p><ul><li>  Transition to a new type of fuel, which is characterized by less emissions. </li><li>  Use of new or improvement of old equipment. </li><li>  Installation of waste management systems. </li><li>  The introduction of powerful systems for disinfection, cleaning, neutralization. </li><li>  Organization of a recycling complex. </li><li>  Installation of blocking and monitoring systems, special sensors, etc. <div class="photo" data-original="sampleofessay.blogspot.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://sampleofessay.blogspot.ru/2015/07/people-are-not-paying-attention-to.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="How the acronym OOS stands for" class="if uuid-2235910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/2235910.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Environmental project </h2><p>  Organization of environmental protection at the enterprise is the following measures: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Protection of the atmosphere (air). </li><li>  Competent use of land resources, minerals, soil cover. </li><li>  Rational exploitation of water wealth.  Protection of aquatic resources. </li><li>  Arrangements for the disposal of especially hazardous waste, as well as for their disposal. </li><li>  Protection of flora and fauna. </li><li>  Measures to protect the population from negative factors of production - physical impact, noise, etc. </li><li>  Other activities that protect the environment and humans. </li><li>  Minimizing the risk of accidents. </li></ul><p>  The environmental protection project at the enterprise, in addition, also contains a detailed graphic part, which includes: </p><ul><li>  Situational plan of a certain territory with the boundaries of the sanitary, protective zone. </li><li>  Map with areas of environmental risk. </li><li>  Schematic map showing locations of rare plants and places of residence of animals in the Red Book. </li><li>  The scheme indicating the boundaries of possible environmental pollution due to an accident, improper economic activity. </li><li>  Tables with calculations. </li></ul><p>  This part of the project is compiled on the basis of topographic and master plans, explanatory notes, design of engineering networks, environmental impact assessment, etc. </p><h2>  Official All-Russian Website </h2><p>  OOS is an official resource of the Unified procurement information system.  In other words, a public procurement website.  Tenders (public procurement) is a competitive form for the publication of orders for the performance of work, the provision of services, and the supply of goods for municipal or state institutions within certain periods and volumes.  Competition here should be based on three principles: efficiency, fairness and competitiveness. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pravdapfo.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://pravdapfo.ru/articles/85086-onf-vzyalsya-za-avtomobili-ignateva"><img itemprop="image" alt="Environmental protection at the enterprise" class="if uuid-2235872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/2235872.jpg"></div><p>  As a result, a contract is concluded with the supplier who proposed the best conditions for the municipal (state) institution.  Thus, public procurements satisfy the needs of the state in a wide range of works, services and goods.  The practice of tenders has a beneficial effect on both the country's economy and business development. </p><p>  Today, both legal and physical (IP) persons can become a party to public procurement.  The procedure itself is regulated by Federal Law No. 44 "On the <span>contract system</span> in the field of the provision of services, the acquisition of goods, and the performance of work for municipal and state needs." </p><h2>  Types of public procurement for environmental protection </h2><p>  According to the aforementioned Federal Law No. 44, all public procurements can be found on the OOS resource.  It is also he who is the primary source for all other informant sites in this area. </p><p>  Let's look at the types of public procurement: </p><p>  1. Non-competitive - from one supplier, without bidding. </p><p>  2. Competitive: </p><ul><li>  Open: electronic auction, request for proposals, request for quotations, open tender, tender with a limited number of participants, two-stage tender. </li><li>  Closed: closed competition, closed auction, 2-stage closed competition, limited closed competition. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="anklab.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://anklab.ru/Press/Articles/AKL/akl-20/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Organization of environmental protection" class="if uuid-2235845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/2235845.jpg"></div><h2>  The main criteria for public procurement </h2><p>  All tenders conducted through the bidder must meet the following criteria: </p><ul><li>  Equally fair attitude to the participants - all suppliers have equal rights, equal access to information, equal chances of participation in the tender. </li><li>  Transparency, openness of the process - the customer is obliged to inform about tendering both at the CAB and other media. </li><li>  The economical expense of taxpayers. </li><li>  Responsibility - only strict reporting.  In particular, a detailed justification of the fact why this person was chosen as the winner.  FAS controls this process.  Both the contractor and the customer are responsible for the conspiracy. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.yaplakal.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.yaplakal.com/forum14/topic1689782.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Environmental Protection Activities" class="if uuid-2235862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/2235862.jpg"></div><p>  So we figured out what the acronym OOS means.  In Russian, it has 4 meanings.  The most common today are environmental protection and the all-Russian official website (otherwise - the government procurement website). </p>
