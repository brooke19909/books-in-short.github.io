Of course, a ticket to such a complex will be expensive, but there will be a lot of positive impressions.  One such respectable hotel is the Bone Club Sunset Hotel &amp; Spa in Side, which will be discussed in this article.  Let us consider in more detail the infrastructure of the complex, its number of rooms, as well as the reviews of guests who have been here before. </p><h2>  Where is this hotel located? </h2><p>  The large resort Bone Club Sunset Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * is located on the outskirts of Side.  To be more precise, it was built in the miniature village of Cholakly, fully focused on the needs of tourists.  It is here that along the coast there is a whole chain of expensive five-star hotels.  The village is also famous for its clean beaches.  This resort is perfect for tourists who do not like to leave the hotel without the need.  The local infrastructure is fully focused on a family relaxing holiday.  The center of olaklƒ± is about 2 km from the hotel.  If desired, tourists can easily get to Side, where there are Turkish bazaars, night clubs, restaurants and bars.  You can get to it by bus or taxi in about 30-60 minutes.  It is 11 km away. </p><p>  In their reviews, many tourists note that the beach is far removed from the hotel, which, of course, is considered a lack of location.  To get to it, tourists will have to walk about 550 meters.  The coast is separated from the hotel by road, which also complicates the journey.  At the same time, the complex does not provide a shuttle service to the beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Antalya International Airport is also significantly removed from the hotel - it is 55 km from Cholakli.  Therefore, tourists need to take care of the transfer in advance.  As a rule, it is paid even when buying a ticket.  Then guests will be picked up from the airport by a comfortable bus that will quickly deliver them to the desired hotel. </p><h2>  General information you need to know for future hotel guests </h2><p>  The Bone Club Sunset Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * complex is considered a new hotel, because it was built recently - in 2013.  It occupies a very small territory, on which the main infrastructure facilities are compactly located.  Its area is 7400 square meters.  m. Tourists can stay in one of three five-story buildings, built in a modern style.  In total, the hotel offers 270 comfortable and spacious rooms.  The complex is considered a crowded place to relax, because more than 500 guests can live here at the same time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotel.invia.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Territory" class="if uuid-2437626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2437626.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel has standard check-in and accommodation rules for many hotels.  For example, you cannot come here with any pets, even guide dogs.  But the complex welcomes guests with small children: they are given substantial discounts on accommodation.  The hotel is often visited by tourists from Russia, so you can always find a Russian-speaking administrator here who will help tourists who do not speak English with filling out documents or solving any problems.  The time of eviction from the hotel rooms is also standard - after the end of the rest you need to leave them before noon. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Room Description Bone Club Sunset Hotel &amp; Spa </h2><p>  And although this hotel is considered a five-star, it does not offer a large selection of room categories.
