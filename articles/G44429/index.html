Modern finland</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Finland has been under Swedish and Russian rule for most of its history.  After the turbulent twentieth century, when the country was constantly moving from one conflict to another, today stability and prosperity have finally been established there. </p><h2>  The prehistoric period in the history of Finland </h2><p>  The origin of the Finns is a question that still forces scientists to put forward more and more new theories.  The first people in the territory of modern Finland were hunter groups that came from the southeast about nine thousand years ago, that is, immediately after the glacier left.  Archaeological finds indicate that the Kunda culture that existed in Estonia at that time was widespread in these territories.  Nowadays, this cultural tradition is called Suomusj√§rvi culture (after the name of the cape, where <span>stone axes</span> and processed pieces of slate were first discovered). </p><p>  In the Neolithic era, cultural groups in Finland divided into the culture of pit-comb ceramics and asbestos ceramics, later the culture of battle axes began to prevail.  The settlements of the representatives of pit-comb ceramics were most often located on the sea coasts of rivers or lakeshore, engaged in fishing, hunting for seals and collecting plants.  Representatives of asbestos culture led a semi-nomadic way of life, they were also engaged in hunting and gathering.  The culture of battle axes is characterized by a division into very small groups, a nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life, agriculture and livestock maintenance.  With the introduction of bronze technology, the eponymous, bronze age begins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Already at that time, important contacts with Scandinavia by sea took place in the south and west.  From there penetrated the technology of processing bronze.  New religious ideas appeared, changes in the economy took place, and permanent farm settlements began to appear.  Bronze was an expensive material for local residents, so natural stone was also quite common. </p><p>  Currently, many scholars are inclined to believe that the national language of Finland began to form already a thousand and a half thousand years before our era.  Modern Finnish arose as a result of contacts with between different tribes.  Around the same time, there was a division into three main branches of the local <span>population: the Finns,</span> who lived in the southwest;  tavastes inhabiting Middle and Eastern Finland, Karelians - residents of the southeast, to Lake Ladoga.  Tribes were often at enmity, even pushing the Saami - the indigenous inhabitants of Northern Europe, they did not have time to merge into one nation. </p><h2>  Coastal areas of the Baltic region until the 12th century </h2><p>  The first mention of Finland dates back to the 98th year of our era.  The ancient Roman historian Tacitus describes the inhabitants of this territory as primitive savages, who know neither weapons, nor dwellings, eating herbs, dressing in animal skins, sleeping on bare ground.  The author distinguishes between the Finns themselves and the neighboring people with a similar lifestyle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The vast region, which came to be called Finland only in the fifteenth century, at the dawn of our era did not constitute a cultural or state whole.  The climate and nature were very severe, new methods of production came from the Mediterranean very slowly, so that the area could feed only a few tens of thousands of inhabitants.  Moreover, from the fifth to the ninth centuries, the population of these regions has been steadily growing.  Together with the widespread spread of agriculture and cattle breeding, the stratification of society intensified, and a class of leaders began to form. </p><p>  Before the active settlement of the region and the spread of culture began in the eighth century, the settled population was concentrated mainly on the southwestern coast and in the valley of the Kumo River, as well as on the shores of its lake system.  The rest of modern Finland was dominated by the nomadic Sami people engaged in hunting and fishing.  Further active settlement was facilitated by warming in Northern Europe and the spread of new farming methods.  Residents of coastal areas began to settle in the northeast, and the Slavic tribes settled on the southern shores of Lake Ladoga. </p><p>  Since about 500, the North Germanic tribes have invaded the √Öland Islands.  The first trading points and colonial settlements began to be created by the Swedish Vikings in the years 800-1000.  Since then, Finnish society has become associated with the Swedish element.  True, the Finns then lived in the forests, and the Swedish population was on the coast, so the assimilation of the language was difficult.  After the end <span>of the Viking era</span> , attempts to colonize Finnish lands by neighboring states begin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Swedish rule in the history of the Finnish people </h2><p>  Swedish rule is a very long period of time in the history of Finland (1104-1809).  The reasons for the Swedish expansion are considered to be the need for Sweden to take a strong position to contain Veliky Novgorod, which made attempts to gradually integrate these lands into its composition.  Then Christianity became the dominant religion, later the locals adopted Lutheranism.  The Swedes actively occupied the empty territories, and the Swedish language remained for a long time the official language of Finland at that time. </p>

    <p>  In 1581, Finland became the Grand Duchy of the Kingdom of Sweden.  In the next century, Sweden reached the peak of its power.  For some time, Finland almost separated, the local government had significant powers and independence.  But the nobles oppressed the people, so there were several uprisings.  Later, the Finnish nobility almost completely merged with the Swedish.  Further, Finland as part of the Kingdom of Sweden was waiting for endless wars and civil strife. </p><h2>  Grand Duchy of Finland in 1809-1917 </h2><p>  The Friedrichsham Treaty concluded the Finnish War of 1808-1809.  In the course of hostilities, Russia occupied significant territories of Finland and defeated the Swedes.  Under a peace treaty, the occupied territories (Finland and the Aland Islands) passed into the possession of the Russian Empire.  At the same time, local relocation to Sweden or vice versa was allowed.  As a result of signing the document, the Grand Duchy of Finland was formed, which became part of Russia. </p><p>  Emperor Alexander the First kept the Finnish ‚Äúindigenous laws‚Äù, and members of the Sejm swore an oath to him.  Some laws of that era, which is interesting, have survived to this day.  It was on the basis of these acts that Finland was later able to legally proclaim its own independence. </p><p>  At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the capital of the principality was the city of Helsinki (the former capital of Finland - Turku).  This was done to move the elite closer to Russian Petersburg.  For the same reason, the university was also transferred from Turku to Helsinki.  Alexander the First ordered the construction of the neoclassical type of Petersburg to begin in the capital of Finland.  At the same time, work was done to improve the infrastructure. </p>

    <p>  Perhaps, it was then that the local population for the first time in the history of Finland felt like a single people, with a single language, history and culture.  A patriotic upsurge occurred, an epic was published, which was recognized throughout the world as the national Finnish epic, and patriotic songs were composed.  True, in response to the bourgeois revolutions in the Old World, Nicholas introduced censorship and secret police, but Nicholas was more preoccupied with the Polish uprising, the Crimean War and so on, so he did not attach importance to the nationalist movement in Finland. </p><p>  The rise to power and rule of Alexander the Second Nikolaevich was marked by the rapid cultural and economic development of the region.  The first line of the railway was built, its own cadres appeared in senior positions, the post office and a new army, a national currency, the Finnish mark, was established, and a metric system of measures was introduced.  In 1863, Finnish and Swedish were equalized, and compulsory schooling was introduced.  This time was later called the Era of Liberal Reforms, and a memorial monument was erected on the Senate Square in honor of this (as well as the Russian Tsar). </p><p>  Later, Alexander the Third and Nicholas II limited Finnish independence.  Autonomy was virtually eliminated, and in response a passive resistance campaign began.  During the 1905 revolution, Finland joined the All-Russian strike, Nicholas II noted decrees to limit the autonomy of the region. </p><h2>  Prerequisites for Independence </h2><p>  In March 1917, after the events of the February Revolution, the emperor abdicated.  A few days later, the Finnish government approved the constitution, and in July, parliament declared independence in internal affairs.  The competence of the Provisional Government in foreign policy and the military sphere was limited.  This law was rejected by the Russian government, and the Russian army occupied the building of the Sejm. </p><p>  The last Senate, subordinate to the Provisional Government of Russia, began its work in early August 1917. By the beginning of the October Revolution, the question of Finland had not been resolved.  At that time, the Finnish government was actively seeking to limit Bolshevik influence in the region.  In December, the Senate signed the Declaration of Independence of Finland.  Now this date is celebrated as Finland Day and Flag Day.  This is a nationwide holiday.  The first day of Finland was celebrated just in 1917. </p>

    <p>  After a couple of weeks, the Council of People's Commissars, headed by Vladimir Lenin, recognized the region's independence.  Later, the new states were recognized by France and Germany, the Scandinavian countries, the USA and Great Britain, but the memory of Lenin, as the first leader to recognize Finland, is still preserved.  The country has several busts, and there is a museum named after Lenin. </p><h2>  Finnish Independence </h2><p>  In almost all over the country, in 1917, spontaneous militias began to arise, as the police were disbanded, there was no one else to defend public order.  The detachments of the Red and White Guards formed.  In addition, the troops of Russia remained on the territory.  The government took over the white guard for maintenance, and the government was given extraordinary powers.  The Social Democrats were preparing to carry out a coup. </p><h2>  Civil war in January-May 1918 </h2><p>  The Finnish War has become one of many intra-national conflicts in military Europe.  Opponents were the "red" (radical left) and the "white" (bourgeois-democratic forces).  The Reds were supported by Soviet Russia, the white were helped by Germany and Sweden (unofficially).  During the war, the population constantly suffered from hunger, a catastrophic lack of food products, terror and executions without trial.  As a result, the Reds could not resist the excellent organization of the White forces, which captured the capital and the city of Tampere.  The last stronghold of the Reds fell in April 1918. Together with it, the Finnish Republic of 1917-early 1918 collapsed. </p><h2>  The formation of statehood </h2><p>  According to the results of the civil war, a majority was formed in the country's parliament, excluding representatives of left-wing parties.  Among the deputies, the ideas of the revival of the monarchy were popular, and since many politicians had become disillusioned with the republic during the months of the war, they agreed on a monarchical form of organization.  At that time in Europe there were many monarchies, the world community and in Russia allowed the possibility of restoration. </p>

    <p>  A relative of the last German emperor William the Second was elected king of Finland.  The Kingdom of Finland was established in August 1918.  The king did not rule for long - a month later a revolution took place, and on November 27 a new government began to work.  Its main goal was to obtain recognition of the country's independence from other Western European states. </p><p>  The life of the common people at that time became very difficult, the economy was ruined, politicians lost confidence from the population.  After several replacements and reforms, a republic was established in Finland and presidential elections were held. </p><h2>  The first Soviet-Finnish war of 1918-1920 </h2><p>  The shaky world did not last long.  The government declared war on Soviet Russia.  Finnish troops crossed the border and invaded Karelia.  The conflict officially ended in October 1920 with the signing of the Tartu Peace Treaty.  The document suggested that the whole Pechenga volost, all the islands west of the border in the Barents Sea, the Ainu Islands and Kiy Island, occupied by the Finns of the volost in Russia, went to Finland. </p><h2>  Military cooperation with the Baltic countries and Poland </h2><p>  The Republic of Finland in the early thirties of the twentieth century concluded several treaties with the Baltic states and Poland.  The reason for the agreements was the need for coordination and the search for allies in the event of a war with the USSR.  Preparations for the war were difficult, as pacifist deputies resisted. </p><h2>  The "Winter" Soviet-Finnish War of 1939-1940s </h2><p>  Before the outbreak of World War II, the Finnish Democratic Republic remained neutral, given that relations with the Soviet Union were systematically deteriorating.  In autumn 1939, Finnish artillery fired at the Soviet village of Mainila, and a few days later Soviet troops invaded Finland.  During the Soviet-Finnish war of 1939-1940 (the reasons and results of which are lower), the country offered unexpectedly strong resistance.  But still, when <span>the Mannerheim line</span> was broken, the Finns were forced to retreat. </p><p>  The causes of the military conflict are territorial claims, Finland‚Äôs desire to regain previously lost territories, and unfriendly relations with the USSR (Russia-Finland did not establish diplomatic relations after recognition of the latter‚Äôs independence).  The consequences were the loss of the Karelian Isthmus and Western Karelia, part of Lapland, part of the Sredny, Gogland and Rybachy islands, rent of the Hanko Peninsula.  As a result of the conflict, almost forty thousand square kilometers of territories passed to the USSR. </p><h2>  Soviet-Finnish Front of the Second World War 1941-1944 </h2><p>  Another armed conflict with the Soviet Union is usually called either the Soviet-Finnish War, the Soviet-Finnish Front of World War II (in Soviet history), or the War-Continuation (in Finnish history).  Finland began to cooperate with Nazi Germany; on June 29, a joint offensive against the USSR began.  At the same time, Germany provided Finland with guarantees of preserving independence, and also promised to help return all previously lost territories. </p>

    <p>  Already by 1944, Finland, realizing the likely outcome of the war, began to look for ways to peace, and the successor to the president, who took up his duties in the same 1944, dramatically changed the entire foreign policy of the state. </p><h2>  <span>Lapland war</span> with Germany in 1944-1945 </h2><p>  After a change in foreign policy, the withdrawal of German troops from Finland began, but they did not want to leave the nickel mining region.  All this was complicated by the fact that at the same time it was necessary to demobilize a large part of the Finnish army.  The last German military left the country only in 1945. The damage caused to Finland by this conflict is estimated at 300 million US dollars. </p><h2>  Republic of Finland at the present stage of development </h2><p>  After the war, the country's situation was doubtful.  On the one hand, there was a threat that the Soviet Union would try to make the country socialist, but all of Russia and Finland would establish friendly relations, and develop trade with Western countries, and preserve their own statehood. </p><p>  In the post-war period, life in the Republic of Finland was gradually getting better.  The economy was developing rapidly, and the creation of education and health systems made the country prosperous.  Since 1995, Finland has become a member of the European Union. </p><p>  Modern Finland is a prosperous state in Northern Europe.  The population and area of ‚Äã‚ÄãFinland are now 5.5 million people and 338.4 thousand square kilometers, respectively.  In the form of government, it is a parliamentary-presidential republic.  Since 2012, the president is Sauli Niiniste.  The country is rated by many foundations and organizations as ‚Äúthe most stable‚Äù and ‚Äúprosperous‚Äù.  This is a merit including Sauli Niiniste as the current political leader. </p>
