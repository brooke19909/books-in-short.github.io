If a person does not plan to use the number at all or has decided to temporarily refuse communication services, you can do this without any problems.  The main thing is to know how.  There are several scenarios.  What should I pay attention to first of all?  How can I connect and disconnect the studied service? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="voluntary blocking pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1379672.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Ban on withdrawal </h2><p>  The first thing you need to pay attention to such a moment as unlocking.  After all, it is no less important than connecting the studied service.  All clients using the function sooner or later ask how to remove the voluntary blocking of MTS.  And here they may not be waiting for the best answer. </p><p>  The thing is that unlocking is not always possible.  It all depends on which block was set by the subscriber.  Temporary allows you to return the functionality of the SIM card, but permanent - no.  Therefore, using the service "Voluntary blocking" (MTS), you should pay attention to what type of block will be installed. </p><h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  However, clients indicate that the feature being studied has several ways to connect and disconnect.  For example, you can use the "My Account" on the website of the mobile operator.  How to remove voluntary blocking of MTS or enable it? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You must first visit the site mts.ru, then log in there in the "My Account".  It is further recommended that you visit the online assistant.  The services have the function "Block number".  If you click on this line and follow the instructions (namely, select the appropriate option - is there access to the SIM card or not), it will block the number. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove voluntary blocking pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1379670.jpg"></div>

    <p>  How to disable voluntary blocking on MTS?  To do this, you will again need a "My Account" and an Internet assistant.  If the SIM card was previously blocked, now the line "Unlock" will appear in the services.  Accordingly, its use will help to restore the performance of the number. </p><h2>  Command </h2><p>  Voluntary MTS blocking can be activated using the USSD command.  It should be noted right away: unlocking the number this way will not work.  Therefore, USSD requests are relevant only for connecting the service. </p><p>  What do you need to do?  Dial * 111 * 157 # on your mobile.  Then click on the ‚ÄúCall‚Äù button on the phone and wait for the request to finish processing.  After a few seconds, the voluntary blocking of MTS will be connected.  The first 2 weeks the service is absolutely free.  Starting from day 15, you will have to pay 1 ruble for every 24 hours of using the opportunity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Customers indicate that it is the USSD request that is in greatest demand.  This technique allows you to independently and at any time use the number lock function.  Only the combination studied is suitable for temporarily disabling the SIM card.  So, it will be possible to restore the SIM card when it becomes necessary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable voluntary blocking on mts" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1379671.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Short number </h2><p>  What else can you pay attention to?  There are many options for connecting the studied service, as well as its disconnection.  You can use the call to the short number 1116. Here the voice robot will turn on. </p><p>  The subscriber should listen to everything that will be reported to him after the call, then press the button responsible for blocking.  Just a few seconds - and the job is done.  SIM card will be disabled.  Either temporarily or permanently.  It all depends on which button the subscriber chose. </p><p>  Voluntary blocking of MTS can be removed in the same way.  Only customers do not leave the best reviews about this method.  It works inefficiently, most often a request can be refused.  Therefore, a call to 1116 should be considered mainly as a way to activate the service. </p><h2>  Call operator </h2><p>  Through calls to the service provider, you can connect and disconnect any proposed function.  And blocking / unblocking numbers is no exception.  Especially if you need to temporarily refuse communication services. </p><p>  How to remove MTS voluntary blocking from the phone?  In the same way as connecting it, by making a call to 0890. The subscriber must wait for the call center employee to respond.  Further it is reported what exactly needs to be done: block the number or unlock.  In the first case, you should not forget about the type of lock.  Either permanently or temporarily connect this function. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove a voluntary lock pay from the phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1379669.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Next, a call center employee will ask for your personal data and check it against the database.  After all, all functions with a SIM card can be carried out only by the real owner of the number.  If everything is correct, a subscriber will be asked to activate a particular service.  You can hang up.  As soon as the request is processed, a message will be sent to the mobile device about the successful activation of the "Voluntary Blocking" (MTS) function or about its refusal. </p><h2>  Salon of communication </h2><p>  Another very good way is to personally contact the mobile operator‚Äôs offices to receive certain services.  If you are interested in how to unlock a voluntary blocking of MTS or connect it, you can use this method.  Only for him should I bring an identity card. </p><p>  The first step is to visit the nearest MTS mobile phone salon.  Further, the citizen informs the employees that he wants to block or unblock the SIM card on the phone.  He will be given an application form, which must be filled in personally by the client. </p><p>  Next, the finished document is given to the office workers.  A few minutes - and the connection / disconnection of the function will be activated.  By the way, to enable the "Voluntary Blocking" (MTS) service, you can simply transfer the mobile to the office staff and inform about your intentions to refuse to use the number.  That is, without a statement.  For this, customers leave positive feedback on the work of the company.  After all, it is not at all necessary to do paperwork! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock a voluntary lock pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1379668.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  But unlocking the phone is already a more responsible matter.  And therefore, it occurs only after the transfer of the corresponding application to employees.  Nevertheless, they return the room to working condition very quickly.  Clients indicate that the voluntary blocking of MTS after writing the application is removed in 5-10 minutes.  So, you don‚Äôt have to worry that the process will drag on! </p>
