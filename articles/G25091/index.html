    <h2>  Not taking several photos as a keepsake of pregnancy is blasphemy! </h2><p>  What could be more romantic and elegant photographs of pregnant women?  This question can hardly be answered.  Nine months will fly by so quickly, and they will not be returned.  It is definitely worth making a photo shoot in memory of the nascent life in the womb.  Such moments are unique, unrepeatable, it is for them that it is worth living! </p><h2>  The best time for a pregnancy photo shoot </h2><p>  When the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa photo session for pregnant women with her husband appears, for starters you need to choose the most suitable time for it.  According to many professional photographers, this is the period when the gestational age reaches about 7 months, the time for maternity leave.  The tummy is already large, but mom is still quite active. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, all this is very individual, you need to build on your well-being, but for the most part, during pregnancy 7 months, women are quite mobile, and by the end of the eighth, beginning of the ninth, it becomes difficult for future mothers to even dress, shoe, shortness of breath, back pain , very quickly comes fatigue from elementary actions, and here it‚Äôs not up to photo shoots! </p><p>  In addition, closer to childbirth, some develop edema, lips grow, and sometimes the nose.  This does not always add beauty.  Thus, the ideal time for a photo shoot is about 7 full months of pregnancy. </p>

    <h2>  This raises the question of how best and where to be photographed. </h2><p>  What would be the best <span>idea for a pregnant woman</span> with her husband?  You need to carefully select the scene: </p><ul><li><p>  It could be a pregnant photo shoot with her husband in the studio.  Ideas for further work depend only on imagination and wishes.  Now there are a huge number of studios with a variety of interiors, expositions, all kinds of accessories can be used.  T-shirts with funny and cute inscriptions, for example, ‚Äúsomeone lives here‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming to you soon‚Äù, ‚Äúmade with love‚Äù, ‚Äúkinder surprise‚Äù, ‚Äúdo not disturb, form‚Äù and with others always make a humorous note. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div></li></ul><ul><li>  A little cheaper, as a rule, is a photo session of pregnant women with her husband in nature.  Ideas are not new, but always relevant.  Such photographs, of course, are best taken in the summer so that the woman‚Äôs body and her tummy are not hidden by several layers of clothing, but you can take interesting photos in the colder seasons, if you choose the right clothes, angle.  Often pregnant women are told that they seemed to have eaten watermelon.  This association can be used advantageously during a photo shoot in nature.  Bright colors of nature in combination with a watermelon no less juicy in color with a striped crust, red pulp and black stones will help to make photos very cheerful and unusual. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  For the most economical option, a photo session of pregnant women with her husband at home is suitable.  The ideas here can be embodied by the boldest.  There are no prying eyes at home, which means you can give free rein to imagination.  If the family has a good camera, you can pre-prepare, put it on a delay and the photo together with her husband is ready.  A professional photographer can also be invited home, if it is in the cozy home walls that the couple feels relaxed and comfortable.  The original idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa photo session for pregnant women with her husband in a home atmosphere is the use of face painting on her tummy.  This service is also called the ridiculous word "puziart".  The paints used are made only from natural ingredients and are absolutely harmless to mom and baby.  A bodybuilder professional called to home, and in this case, a puziart, will help to realize and realize any fantasy. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="photoshoot of pregnant women with husband on nature ideas" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45271/1482298.jpg" width="333"></div></h2><h2>  A little frankness will emphasize the grace of a woman </h2><p>  Photos look beautifully, in which a woman is dressed only in underwear, lace peignoir.  Lingerie should be non-vulgar, emphasizing femininity.  Or you can take an airy light tissue, cover it with places that cannot be shown to everyone, and leave the rest of the body naked. </p><p>  The pristine beauty of the female body has always been striking in its grace, thin lines, and rounded outlines.  The beauty of the body of a pregnant woman is doubly beautiful!  An experienced photographer using a favorable angle and properly configured lighting can only transfer it to photo paper. </p><h2>  Ideas of a photoshoot of pregnant women with a husband and a child </h2><p>  If the family already has one, or maybe two or three children, you must definitely capture how they are waiting for a brother or sister. </p><ul><li><p>  Dad and the child can, for example, pretend that they want to bite or eat their mother‚Äôs tummy. </p></li><li><p>  You can lie to everyone.  Put mom in the middle so that the belly is in the spotlight, and all the rest of the family around him.  Photos in a supine position look very interesting. </p></li><li><p>  Dad can throw and catch a child, and mom can doll.  This photo is also very original. </p></li><li><p>  Dress everyone in clothes of one color scale and one style.  This technique creates a very harmonious image of a friendly family. </p></li></ul>
