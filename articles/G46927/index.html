The district was formed in 1944.  However, in 1953, the territorial unit was abolished, and in June 1954 they were re-formed.  As of the beginning of 2017, 205 thousand people live in the district. </p><p>  Previously, the Sverdlovsk <span>district of Irkutsk</span> was the village of Glazkovo.  The district also included several settlements: the village of Kuzmikha, the village of Glazkovo, Melnikovo and Sinyushina Gora. </p><p>  The first inhabitants in this area are mentioned by N. Sappharius from 1675.  And at the end of the 18th century, Mogilev Kuzma founded a village here.  Then Glazkov Efim appeared in the settlement, in all likelihood, the village was named in his honor.  Both names are by far the most common in the region. </p>

    <h2>  May Day </h2><p>  One of the youngest neighborhoods in the city.  The development project for this part of the Sverdlovsk district of Irkutsk by local architects was carried out from 1970 to 1990.

At the same time, it is a compact microdistrict with developed infrastructure and a well-established public transport network. </p><h2>  Sinyushin Mountain </h2><p>  One of the largest microdistricts of the Sverdlovsk region of Irkutsk on the left bank of the Angara River.
