But far from everyone will be able to answer the question of where Karlovy Vary is located.  People of the Soviet era reliably know that this city is located in Czechoslovakia.  And everything seems to be true, except for the trifle that such a country has not existed on the political map of the world for more than two decades.  There is news in geography too, and sometimes it‚Äôs useful to update the information in the database, in particular about where <strong> </strong>  are Karlovy Vary.  A simple reference about this resort can be useful for both people in need of better health and ordinary tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where are Karlovy Vary" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/291812.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Where are Karlovy Vary on the map</strong> </p><p>  The famous resort town is located in the west of the historical region of Bohemia, near the borders with Saxony and Bavaria.  Carlsbad - this city was so named for a long time in accordance with the German linguistic tradition - is located in a picturesque valley between wooded mountain slopes at the confluence of the Tepla and Oh≈ôe rivers.  This mountain valley is located at an altitude of about four hundred meters above sea level, which largely determines the local microclimate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city of Karlovy Vary is famous primarily for its hot springs of mineral water.  There are about sixty of them in the city area.  But only twelve are actively used for medical purposes.  The water in the sources varies slightly in their chemical composition, but differs greatly in carbon dioxide content and temperature.  The healing properties of this water can significantly improve the health of those who have problems in a number of ways.  To take an interest in where Karlovy Vary is located, it is primarily necessary to suffer from metabolic disorders, diseases of the digestive system and gastrointestinal tract. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Karlovy Vary how to get" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/291811.jpg" width="499"></div>  In addition, a stay at the famous mountain resort can have a general strengthening effect on the body due to special climatic factors and various kinds of physiotherapy exercises.  The level of resort-medical technologies here has been practiced not even for decades, but for centuries.  Karlovy Vary spa has become a symbolic sign of the quality of treatment and the level of service.  He is known not only in Europe, but also far beyond its borders.  The resort received a powerful development in the last twenty years of its history.  This is due to financial investments in it, received after the Czech Republic gained independence. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Karlovy Vary city" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/291881.jpg" width="496"></div>
