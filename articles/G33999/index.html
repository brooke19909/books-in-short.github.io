However, no one wants to have only sweaters with a high collar in the wardrobe, so that there is an opportunity to close the throat from the cold and cold.  And then many are faced with a difficult choice - to go against their desires or to risk their health.  At the same time, few people realize that there is another way out - knitting the shirt front with knitting needles. </p><h2>  What is a shirt shirt </h2><p>  The product that we recommend the reader to knit for themselves and their loved ones is the upper part of the sweater, that is, a high collar, diverging with a "skirt" to the shoulders.  This accessory can be worn over the jacket.  Although it is more common to hide it underneath so that only the collar is visible from the outside.  Shirt-guards are worn by both adults and children.  Many men wear this accessory without thinking about scarves that need to be learned to knit effectively to look fashionable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knit shirt for men" class="if uuid-2961614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2961614.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting a shirt front with knitting needles is not particularly difficult.  Therefore, even novice masters will cope with the work.  The main thing is to carefully read the article. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  To tie a beautiful product, you need to seriously prepare.  Professional craftsmen recommend that you first consider the style of your product.  Indeed, the ‚Äúskirt" can be rounded, triangular and square.  There are also options in which it does not reach the shoulders, but only slightly cover the chest.  Having chosen a style, immediately proceed to knitting a shirt front with knitting needles.  Because it is still important to think over the design of the accessory.  Female models abound with ruffles, braids, plaits.  Men's are performed in a more classic version.  And children are beaten with the help of color, while the pattern can be the most common. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sincorp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Openwork scheme" class="if uuid-2966009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/2966009.jpg"></div><h2>  What yarn can be used </h2><p>  There can be no strict recommendations regarding the choice of knitting threads.  Therefore, each knitter can choose the material, focusing on their taste.  However, experienced craftsmen recommend taking into account that the product will come into contact with delicate skin on the neck and chest, so you should not choose spiky, too stiff or synthetic yarn.  Otherwise, wearing the item will be impossible.  Particularly carefully knitting a shirt front with knitting needles should be treated for people suffering from allergies.  They should consider yarn designed for children.  Even sensitive skin perceives it well, so there will be no problems when wearing the product. </p><h2>  Most suitable tool </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knit shirt with steps" class="if uuid-2961606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2961606.jpg"></div><p>  You can knit a shirt-front not only with knitting needles, but also with a crochet.  However, professional masters note that the second tool is more suitable for performing lightweight openwork things.  But for the studied accessory, you should not choose it.  Except for edge trimming.  It is much better to get good knitting needles.  And it is better to choose hosiery and knit a seamless product.  To complete the "skirts" may require an additional set of knitting needles.  It is also important to note that experts recommend giving preference to those tools that are made of metal.  Because it is precisely this material that is responsible for good gliding, and, accordingly, for the speed and quality of knitting the shirt front for women, men and children. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Braid pattern" class="if uuid-2966017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/2966017.jpg"></div><h2>  Required Parameters </h2><p>  To knit a product that exactly fits the size, you need to correctly measure the customer.  To do this, we prepare a pen and a piece of paper to fix all the parameters.  A centimeter tape is also required.  With its help, we will determine the parameters necessary for knitting the studied accessory, according to which we will later draw up a scheme for knitting the shirt-front for a woman, man or child. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knit shirt front how to knit" class="if uuid-2961609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2961609.jpg"></div><p>  So, to bring our idea to life, we need the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  neck circumference; </li><li>  neck length; </li><li>  the distance from the base of the neck to the alleged edge of the shirt front; </li><li>  girth of shoulders. </li></ul><h2>  Preparing a sample of the pattern and converting centimeters to the desired units of measurement </h2><p>  Professional knitters are advised to practice in the implementation of the selected pattern on a small fragment.  This will help to better understand the technology, to avoid problems and errors when knitting a shirt front with knitting needles.  We study the pattern scheme very carefully.  It indicates the number of loops and rows that make up the horizontal and vertical reports of the pattern.  They must be taken into account when calculating the necessary values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the implementation of the studied accessory.  After all, it will look spectacular only if the ornament is not interrupted.  If the product has several inserts, we knit a sample and calculate the parameters for each. </p><div class="photo" data-original="femme-today.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Diamond pattern" class="if uuid-2966010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/2966010.jpg"></div><p>  A sample of a pattern that will help us calculate the loops and rows needed to draw a pattern and knit a shirt front for a woman, man or child is not required too large.  A square with a side of ten centimeters is enough.  We count in it loops and rows.  Divide both parameters by 10. Then we multiply: </p><ul><li>  neck girth for the number of loops; </li><li>  neck length by the number of rows; </li><li>  the distance from the base of the neck to the alleged edge of the shirt front by the number of rows; </li><li>  shoulder girth on the number of loops. </li></ul><p>  Each new parameter is fixed on the schematic image of the desired model of the studied product.  It is on them that we will carry out knitting for the shirt front for women, men and children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knit shirt for children" class="if uuid-2961612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2961612.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitting shirtless technology </h2><p>  Having dealt with the preparatory phase, we move on to the main one.  On it we will explore how to bring our ideas to life.  In fact, it is not difficult to do this, because we have already calculated the necessary parameters.  And now we will simply observe them when knitting a shirt-front with knitting needles.  A description of the necessary actions by which the reader can navigate, we offer further.  Beginners are advised to follow it step by step.  So let's get started: </p><ol><li>  The implementation of the conceived accessory begins with a set of the number of loops equal to the circumference of the neck. </li><li>  We distribute it on hosiery knitting needles and knit it, moving in a circle. </li><li>  If you want to make a simple collar, the number of rows equal to the length of the neck should be knitted only once.  If the reader prefers a high collar that can be folded several times, you need to increase the calculated number of rows.  However, a too multi-layered collar should not be done.  Otherwise, it will press and interfere. </li><li>  When the part of the right size is ready, proceed to the set of loops for knitting the "skirt". </li><li>  To do this, we again turn to mathematics and divide the number of loops, equal to the circumference of the shoulders, by the number of rows equal to the distance from the base of the neck to the supposed edge of the intended product.  Thus, we find out how many loops need to be added in each row to make this part beautiful and neat. </li><li>  We distribute the additional loops evenly, after which we proceed to knit the product. </li><li>  When we get to the end, close the loop.  If desired, we make out the edge with a lace frill, crocheted. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knit shirt description" class="if uuid-2961617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2961617.jpg"></div><p>  That's the whole description of knitting a shirt front with knitting needles.  Any pattern can be selected for this product.  The main thing is to be guided by the wishes of the person for whom the fashion accessory is being prepared. </p>
