Chechulin - one of the founders of the architectural direction of the time, which was later called the "Stalin Empire".  Hotel "Beijing" (Moscow), how to get to which, tourists will tell any resident of the capital, was built in the postwar years.  Officially, it was put into operation in 1956, although the project by which the building was built was developed back in the thirties.

    <p>  For a number of reasons, the process dragged on for a long time.  Initially, the building was intended as a hotel for employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of State Security.  After the end of World War II, it was divided into departments.  The wing overlooking Bolshaya Sadovaya was supposed to move to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  And the rest was shared between these two law enforcement agencies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Opening </h2><p>  In 1956, the Beijing Hotel (Moscow), a photo of which at that time did not differ much from its modern appearance, had already received guests, although repair work inside the building was still ongoing.  This name was not chosen at all by chance: it symbolized the policies of the USSR of that time and was intended to confirm friendly relations with China. </p><p>  The Beijing Hotel (address - Moscow, Bolshaya Sadovaya St., 5) already had an elevated level from the very beginning.  On its eleventh floor there were exclusive and very expensive rooms at that time.  The ceiling height in them was six meters.  Rates for accommodation in each such room were determined by special decree of the Moscow City Executive Committee. </p><h2>  Famous guests </h2><p>  In the Soviet years, many foreign guests stayed here, some famous personalities lived for a long time.  For example, during her visits to the capital, Marina Vlady was surely registered here, who left her clothes in the room (most often it was her sheepskin coat) to confirm residence, and she herself went to Vysotsky.  At different times, Vasily Stalin (after the death of his father), Arkady Raikin (a very long time rented a room on the eleventh floor) lived here.  In addition, Lolita Tores, Dean Reed, <span>Marcel Marceau</span> and other celebrities of that time preferred to stay here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
