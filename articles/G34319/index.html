The classification of hotels indicates the quality of rooms and the services offered. <br>  Let's consider in more detail. <br>  The hotel room refers to the accommodation service.  The room is usually multifunctional.  Different hotels have different room categories.  Regardless of the category, in each room are obligatory: a chair or an armchair, a bed (with clean linen), a table, a wardrobe designed for clothes, a wastebasket, lighting (at least general).  In addition, there must be information about the hotel itself with an evacuation plan. <br>  Other services that complement the required minimum are also possible: a swimming pool, conference rooms, sports equipment, dry cleaning, car rental, medical services, a hairdresser, and more.  It depends on how they are formed and decorated: what type of enterprise the company will be: a sailor, fleet, boat, rotel, guest house, guesthouse, hotel-garni, motel, etc. <br>  For a more convenient definition, classification features have been created (classification of hotels).  We single out the most used ones. <br><br>  1. Levels of comfort - a comprehensive criterion, its components: <br>  - condition: the area of ‚Äã‚Äãrooms, the number of single multi-room rooms, the number of apartment rooms, the absence or availability of communal amenities directly in the rooms; <br>  - condition of inventory, furniture; <br>  - catering facilities (their availability, condition); <br>  - the condition of the building itself, the arrangement of the territory adjacent to this building; <br>  - technical equipment information support; <br>  - Additional services. <br><br>  Each state has a different approach to understanding comfort, so a single classification of hotels does not exist.  However, there is a standard classification. <br><br>  2. Number of rooms - the number of seats that can be offered at the same time. <br>  Conventionally, hotels are divided into: <br>  - small - (up to 150 places); <br>  - medium (up to 400 places); <br>  - large (more than 400 places). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  3. Functional purpose - the decisive criterion, divided into two groups: target and transit.  Transit (service during a short stop, with limited comfort) and target: <br>  - for business purposes, to serve those on business trips; <br>  - for relaxation (usually resort). <br><br>  4. Location and view from the room. <br><br>  5. Duration of activity (year-round, seasonal). <br><br>  6. Food Security: <br>  - ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù (in addition to accommodation - four meals a day, drinks (including alcohol); <br>  - <span>full board</span> (in addition to accommodation - three meals a day); <br>  - half board (in addition to accommodation - two meals a day); <br>  - Only accommodation, breakfast only. <br><br>  7. Stay by duration: <br>  - long; <br>  - short-term. <br><br>  8. Price range: <br>  - up to 35 ye - budget; <br>  - up to 55 ye - economical <br>  - up to 95 ye - medium; <br>  - up to 195  first-class, apartment; <br>  - up to 425 ye - fashionable. <br><br>  International classification of hotels. <br><br>  1 star.
