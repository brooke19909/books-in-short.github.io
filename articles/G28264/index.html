    <p>  The last time a thief in law Skif was prosecuted in 2005 for extorting 15 thousand US dollars.  The court sentenced him to ten months in prison.  He served time in Tomsk. </p><p>  Golubev was a friend of Grandfather Hassan, so he was involved in all the most important processes of the criminal society. </p><h2>  Detentions </h2><p>  We note a series of events that took place in the life of Skiff.

    <p>  It is known that Andrei Golubev lived on 38 <span>Poletaeva Fedor</span> Street in Moscow.  He is Russian by nationality.  He was crowned at 30.  His godchildren were Vasin S.V. (Vyatlag) and Turkadze E.Z. (Kutaisi Guja). </p><h2>  What do they say? </h2><p>  Andrei‚Äôs associates say that he was a very decent person, he loved and respected Ambal Tolik, he came to visit him in Donetsk.  When Ambal fell ill, Skiff organized an operation for him.  As a result, very good doctors performed the operation in Moscow.  After Ambal died, Andrew began to help his family. </p><p>  When he was serving his term, everyone respected him for his human simplicity.  He always answered letters to everyone, never put himself above others. </p><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  It is known that the thief in law Thunder (Gromozdin Alexander) once stated that hard drugs should not be used.  Then the thief passed through all the zones.  True, with the permission of Thunder, prisoners could smoke weed.  This rule has been strictly observed for about two years. </p><p>  But after the death of Thunder in the colonies, heavy drugs began to be used again.  Although it is not customary in criminal circles to break a rule that has not been canceled by anyone.  Golubev also had a purely negative attitude to drugs.  He said that it was impossible to substitute the potions of relatives with the transfer of the potion, declared that the use of relatives was the last thing, and if it was necessary to deliver, then let the prisoners organize pigeon mail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thief skiff photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/2151669.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Before his death, Golubev "worked" mainly in Moscow.  His accomplices believed that he was a thief of the old formation, who has extraordinary ideas about what is bad and what is good. </p><h2>  Scene </h2><p>  So, you already know how the thief in the law of Scythians lived.  His photo still excites many.  He was an associate of General Usoyan Aslan (Grandfather Hassan), which we discussed above.  How was he killed? </p>

    <p>  It is known that at 22:40 Golubev was ambushed near house No. 141 (Building 2, Volgogradsky Prospekt).  He was driving home from a cafe in the company of the Belarusian mafia Korsak Vladimir and his ‚Äúorderly‚Äù Ivan Gnilovsky.  Skif himself lived not far away, on the street of Poletaev Fyodor, so he turned into the yards in order to get to the house faster. </p><p>  A criminal from a machine gun opened fire on a car when an Infinity SX50 jeep drove into a dark courtyard.  The first bullet hit Golubev.  He instantly released the steering wheel from his hands, and the car crashed into a garbage container.  After that, the gangster finished off Korsak.  Only Gnilovsky survived: his criminal did not touch. </p><p>  Almost five minutes later, Skif's friends rushed to the scene (apparently, they knew that the boss went to an unreliable meeting).  The men were very aggressive and even tried to break a camera to one of the journalists. </p><p>  Bagmet Anatoly (head of the Investigative Department of the UPC RF in Moscow) said that what happened was a criminal showdown.  He said that the roots of this murder are in different regions of Russia.  Golubev's activities encompassed a very wide area.  Four years before his death, Andrei, by order of Grandfather Hassan, tried to take control of entertainment organizations in the Urals. </p><p>  Then Skif planned to declare war on the well-known associations "Center" and "Uralmash."  Moreover, he secured support at the very top.  In the Urals, two advisers to Cherepkov, who was then a State Duma deputy, met at the airport of Skif.  But then the local UBOP detained the Moscow guest.  However, he was released very quickly. </p><p>  Golubev also supported Grandfather Hassan in a fight with another Georgian influential businessman Oniani Tariel.  They even decided to discuss the dispute at a large-scale gathering of thieves in law, led by Tariel.  The banquet was organized on the boat, but at the height of the meeting, employees of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the federal central district landed on board.  It was rumored that the people of Hassan had framed Oniani and his friends.  Probably a friend of Usoyan paid for it with his life. </p>
