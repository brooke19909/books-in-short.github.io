    <p>  Luxurious, spacious beaches, clean sand and a warm sea - this is what Kemer is primarily characterized by.  Royal Palm Resort 5 * has in this regard a significant plus - its own territory under the sun.  The coastline is 400 m long. The beach is mixed, sand and gravel. </p><h2>  Spa &amp; wellness </h2><p>  Rest at the resort is unthinkable without wellness and relaxing treatments.  Turkey knows a lot about this.  The hotel offers its guests the services of a fitness center (if necessary, you can contact a doctor and a nurse), a vitamin bar, various spa treatments, a traditional Turkish bath, a jacuzzi and saunas, popular massages, and relaxation rooms.  All this is usually included in the price of the permit. </p><h2>  Royal Palm Resort (Turkey) 5 *: tourist reviews </h2>

    <p>  Estimates of travelers not only from our country, but also from all over the world regarding the designated hotel are often contradictory and subjective.  In general, we can say that it is not for capricious and pampered guests.  More focused on young families, couples, companies.  Hotel guests note its not very fresh look, which is not surprising, because it was built 20 years ago, but for all that, the rooms are clean, the cleaning is regular, and the furniture is solid.  Negative reviews are offset by marks that the beach is excellent, as are the views around.  In general, visitors put not a five, but a solid four to the Royal Palm Resort.  Royal Palm Resort involves a budget holiday, but it is not without comfort and quality service, vivid impressions and delicious food, picturesque panoramas around. </p>
