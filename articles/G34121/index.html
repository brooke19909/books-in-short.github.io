  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crochet a plaid for our baby</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Covering your baby with a warm, <span>soft rug is</span> always a pleasure.  This thing is sometimes indispensable for a walk in a stroller, and even the baby‚Äôs home, wrapped in a lacy fluffy bedspread, is especially touching and sweet.  You can crochet a plaid.  This needlework tool allows you to create creative, fantasy things, sometimes made from the remains of bright yarn.  The hook is convenient in that it is easy to knit small individual parts with it, which are then combined into a single multi-colored fabric.  They are made in the form of squares or circles, plain or striped, decorated in the course of work with embroidery and knitted appliqu√©s.  A crochet hook is perhaps the most versatile tool for translating any creative fantasies. </p><p>  To crochet a blanket for a newborn, first of all, you should choose the right yarn.  It should be a light and soft thread made of cotton (for summer), acrylic or wool of the best grades (alpaca, mohair) for cold weather, so that the baby feels comfortable.  Colors, of course, should be selected delicate, pastel, which with a multi-colored version can be complemented by bright saturated tones of blue, yellow, orange.  Then you should decide on the model.  If you have accumulated a lot of residues of high-quality yarn of different colors, crochet the plaid from multi-colored squares, which can be made in one single color, or combine several different shades.  Squares are knitted both from the center with circular knitting, and simply with transverse rows of columns without a crochet or with a crochet.  It turns out to be very creative knitting, consisting of a combination of dense squares made with ordinary columns, and lace, connected by a beautiful fantasy pattern of columns and air loops.  In this embodiment, a crocheted plaid can be made of three or four colors that combine well with each other, but at the same time, each square is knitted in one whole color. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A plaid knitted from soft fluffy yarn of light pastel color combined with satin ribbons looks very beautiful and infantile.  Such a model can consist of separate squares, along the edge of which there are knitted stitches from air loops, or from a solid canvas, divided by these stitches into longitudinal and transverse stripes, into which at the end of the work a satin ribbon is pulled close to the main color or contrasting with it. </p><p>  For clarity, I will give an example: we will connect a single canvas with hemstitches.  To do this, we knit a chain of loops equal to the width of the plaid, and in the first row we knit thirty crochets in a row, then ten air loops, skip ten loops of the previous row and knit thirty columns again, so to the end.  After the necessary number of rows is knitted in height to make a square, the number of rows, we begin to knit a transverse hem.  It will consist of five double crochet posts with a chain of air loops between them.  Then the pattern repeats.  We decorate the finished <span>plaid with a</span> satin ribbon, drawn in longitudinal and transverse stitches.  The ends of the ribbons are fixed at the edge of the knitting.  After the stitches are filled, we tie the work with a lace border, crocheting the edges of the ribbons.  In the center of dense squares, embroidery with narrow satin ribbons or simple stitch in the form of elegant bouquets of flowers will look very nice.  For a boy, such a plaid can be decorated with a colored applique from motifs also crocheted. </p><p>  A knitted blanket for the baby can be made up of squares made in a circular knit from the center of colored balls of yarn.  In the central ring tied with eight pairs of air loops and double crochets, we knit the subsequent rows of two double crochets and an air loop, making them staggered (we knit the columns over the air loop of the previous row).  In the course of work, we outline 4 corners, knitting not two, but three columns.  Change the colors of the thread through each knitted row.  You will get multi-colored squares, from which we then collect the plaid, picking them by color. </p><p>  A beautiful and original plaid for a baby can be knitted quickly, because its dimensions are small (1x1 m).  When performing such a product, craftsmanship is sharpened well, because a plaid can consist of several different lace motifs. </p>
