After all, the country has a system of individual formation of pension savings.  This means that the money set aside for old age must be stored somewhere.  What has the Future <span>Pension Fund</span> prepared for its clients and potential investors?  How reliable is this organization?  Understanding all this is not as difficult as it seems.  Numerous reviews will help determine the integrity of the corporation. </p><h2>  About Activities </h2><p>  To get started, pay attention to what the organization does.  “Future” is a <span>non-governmental pension-</span> type <span>fund</span> .  Regarding the activity of citizens, there are no complaints.  Future <span>Pension Fund</span> is a company that offers <span>pension insurance.</span>  An organization was formed from several NPFs recently.  But it has already taken confident positions in the Russian rating.  What does the company do?  She offers future pensioners to form pension savings and increase the funded part of payments due to investments.  Nothing special or incomprehensible! </p><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  Future <span>Non-government Pension Fund</span> is a company that, as noted, was formed by the merger of several <span>non-state pension funds</span> in Russia relatively recently.  But for several years now, the organization has held rather high ranking positions.  Future is one of the fifteen most reliable non-state pension funds and is located at about 10-11 places. </p>

    <p>  Some sources may indicate that this organization is one of the five leaders of non-governmental funds offering pension insurance services.  In any case, the pension fund holds relatively high positions in the ranking, which means that you can trust it.  This is what some potential investors think.  But this is far from the only evaluation criterion.  What else is worth thinking about? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The trust </h2><p>  The Future Pension Fund receives various reviews.  But mostly positive.  In particular, the level of trust in this organization is at its best.  What does it mean? </p><p>  The trust is currently held at position A +.  This is not the best option, but it does.  It stands for "High Confidence."  That is, the population considers the Future Pension Fund a sustainable organization that can maintain and form pensions in the future.  Just what you need! </p><p>  In Russia, customer reviews are highly dependent on the level of trust.  Therefore, NPF Future has no complaints in this area.  Despite its relatively recent origin, the organization, according to statistics, as well as according to customers, is on top.  Not an ideal pension fund, but better than most similar organizations. </p><h2>  Profitability </h2><p>  But the following criterion remains important for those who want to not only preserve their pension savings, but also increase them.  It's about profitability.  What <span>non-government pension fund</span> "Future" receives reviews in this area?  They are very ambiguous.  Many emphasize that there is generally return on investment.  But it is not as significant as it was promised at the conclusion of the contract.  Therefore, some investors may feel cheated. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about numbers, then they promise in the “Future” yield of about 10-12% per annum.  In fact, no more than 7-7.5% come out.  A similar phenomenon is due to inflation, as well as the global crisis.  A similar situation exists in all NPFs.  Therefore, it does not cause a direct negative. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Future Pension Fund, as many say, is a place that will save and slightly increase the funded part of the money deposited for old age.  This is not the best place to use NPFs as a tool to increase the contribution, but it allows you to get some return. </p><h2>  About contracts </h2><p>  The indicated pension fund proposes to future pensioners to conclude agreements on opening deposits.  In this area, many ask lawyers about how “Future” is valid.  The agreement is very detailed, but the organization is silent about some of the nuances.  You have to find out about everything yourself. </p>

    <p>  Lawyers assure that the Future Pension Fund is operating absolutely legally.  Not too conscientiously, but all questions of interest can be clarified.  Someone complains that he did not suspect that his funded part of the pension is stored in this non-state pension fund.  This is also normal.  Such complaints arise from officially employed.  There is nothing illegal - the pension fund concludes a cooperation agreement with the employer of certain citizens.  And the accumulations of all company employees are automatically transferred to the "Future".  It is the employer who is required to notify of these changes, not the NPF.  Based on this, it is not worth blaming the fund for fraud. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What can be said in the end?  Future Non-Governmental Pension Fund is a very new organization, which in Russia is far from the last place.  It works in good faith, although there are some drawbacks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="private pension fund future reviews" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1460165.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  You can open deposits here, it is not planned to take away the license from the fund.  But the "Future" is not suitable for those for whom the profitability of the organization is the most important parameter.  Future non-state pension fund receives mostly good reviews.  Perhaps you should think about saving your savings in this organization. </p>
