    <p>  The most elementary way to turn a bottle into a flower vase is to make a decorative cover for it.  Moreover, it will be possible to periodically change such "clothes" on the bottle.  Very much in this case, sewing and knitting skills come in handy.  After all, the easiest option is to make a cover for the bottle (as in the photo).  It can be knitted using decorative patterns, or sewn, adding lace to taste and combining fabrics of various textures (leather, suede, velvet, plain burlap, etc.).  The second way is to make a beautiful bezel on the main part of the bottle.  You can use corrugated or plain paper, cloth for this.  Using these simple methods you will get an original flower vase in a short time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Method number 2: painting the bottle from the inside </h2>

    <p>  Glass bottles of various shapes and sizes and paint are all you need.  The painting process is not difficult, we advise you to do this from the inside.  So the colors are brighter, and the surface remains flat and smooth.  You can use absolutely any paint, even the one intended for windows and doors will do.  If you are going to paint containers in different shades, then it would be more advisable to buy white paint and several dyes.  Before making vases from glass bottles, be sure to determine the color scheme, which should be harmonious and match the interior. </p><p>  You will also need a large syringe.  In a small container, thoroughly mix the white paint with the dye until the color is uniform.  Then put it into the syringe and carefully pour it into the bottle.  Start turning it around its axis, evenly distributing the paint inside.  Drain the excess.  Place the bottle down with its neck and let it dry completely.  In addition to this standard method, several colors can be used.  To do this, in two syringes, draw a paint of contrasting colors and inject inside.  As you mix and distribute, you get smooth and vibrant color transitions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Method number 3: gluing the bottle with a rope </h2>

    <p>  Using ordinary glue, woolen threads, twine or ribbons you can get a very original bottle vase.  A master class on this issue is a quite simple and doable process.  The surface of the bottle must first be degreased, then greased with glue or use a special gun.  Then, very carefully and slowly, you should twist the rope, starting from the bottom.  Press it as tightly as possible.  You can paste over the bottle completely (as in the photo) or only partially.  After complete drying, the surface can be decorated with additional decorative elements.  Remember the main rule - materials must be combined with each other (natural with natural).  So, wooden beads, flowers made of leather or simple burlap, a seal made of wax and so on are well suited to simple twine.  Crafts from bottles, including vases, pasted over with multi-colored woolen threads, turn out to be cheerful.  This lesson is quite suitable for working with children. </p><h2>  Method number 4: painting outside </h2><p>  This method also has a right to exist.  However, it is used mainly to give the surface the greatest decorativeness, bumps, and a feeling of velvet.  We recommend using matte <span>paint in spray cans.</span>  This is the fastest and most economical option.  Before you make a <span>vase with your own hands</span> using spray paints, be patient.  In this case, the main principle of work is a gradual coating, layer by layer.  Otherwise, the paint will simply flow and the <span>appearance</span> will be hopelessly spoiled. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  This option requires some skills and patience, as the work is quite painstaking.  Decoupage, in fact, is the application of paper applications on any surface.  In addition to special pictures or taken from magazines, you will need glue, brushes and varnish for the final coating.  We will dwell only on the main points, and if you wish, you will be able to complete a full master class.  Crafts from bottles using the decoupage technique require thorough degreasing of the surface and then its priming.  This can be done with ordinary <span>acrylic paints.</span>  Next, the desired picture is very carefully applied and carefully bonded with glue (special or PVA).  Surfaces allow to dry.  The final stage of work is fixing with varnish, you can use a special one that gives the aging effect. </p><h2>  Method number 6: mosaic </h2>

    <p>  Mosaic is a fairly common way of decorating, and many crafts decorate it.  Vases from bottles with its use look like small stained glass windows.  There can be two ways: a real mosaic and its imitation.  In the first case, it is supposed to use a lot of multi-colored glass.  They must be prepared in advance using a glass cutter, being careful not to get hurt.  What shape the elements will be (squares, rectangles, irregular shapes) depends entirely on your imagination.  Before making vases from glass bottles using mosaic, you should choose the correct shape.  A container with even walls is best suited.  For example, large square bottles.  On a fat-free surface, small glass pieces are attached with glue, while leaving a small distance between them.  After drying completely with ordinary grout, fill these joints. </p><p>  Mosaic imitation can be done in two ways.  These are quite simple options for how to make a vase with your own hands from an ordinary glass bottle.  In the first case, <span>copper wire is used.</span>  In an arbitrary, chaotic order or in accordance with a certain plan, it is wrapped around a bottle.  Then each piece is filled with a thin layer of paint.  In addition, you can use various decorative elements.  The second method is similar, only instead of a wire, paint of a certain color (white, gold, silver) is used.  After applying the pattern, she is allowed to dry, and then the resulting squares are filled.  Finally, the entire surface can be varnished. </p><h2>  Method number 7: pasting with decorative elements </h2><p>  In fact, this method is very much like a mosaic, but other materials and a slightly different technology are used.  You can paste over the bottle with everything that is at your fingertips.  If you brought a whole package of shells from a summer vacation at sea, you can easily create crafts from bottles, including vases, using them.  Do not limit yourself to any one material, but create whole compositions.  Along with shells, ordinary rope and sand will look good.  From the seeds that are in every house, you can also create a beautiful combination.  Use sunflower seeds, pumpkins, coffee beans, buckwheat, and more. </p><h2>  Method number 8: bottle trimming </h2>

    <p>  Some bottles themselves have an almost perfect shape and color, so if you just remove the neck, you get an extremely concise and stylish vase.  You can do this in different ways: </p><ul><li>  crop only the neck, for example, as in the photo on the left; </li><li>  cut the bottle 1/3 or half. </li></ul><p>  In both cases, the cut can be made parallel to the surface or at an angle, which also looks quite impressive.  With sufficient skills, it is possible to figure out using special equipment.  Therefore, before making vases from glass bottles using additional decor, think, maybe this method will be enough. </p><h2>  <span>How to cut a glass</span> bottle? </h2><p>  At home, this can be done quite simply and quickly.  You will need: thread, alcohol or regular cologne, matches and cold water.  Observe precautions, wear safety glasses and gloves.  The place of the planned cut should be wrap abundantly with a thread dipped in alcohol, and then set on fire.  Rotating the bottle around its axis, hold the fire for a short period of time (2-3 minutes), and then fill it with cold water.  The glass will crack exactly at the place where the thread was.  At the end, the edges can be sanded so that they look more even and decorative. </p><p>  Here are presented only the main directions, options for <span>what can be made crafts</span> from bottles.  Instructions and step-by-step actions may vary depending on your imagination.  Is it possible to push the creative process into any framework?  Create and create, use a different combination of materials and methods. </p>
