    <p>  The opportunity cost is a theoretical indicator.  He indicates how much should reduce the production of one product in order to produce a unit of other similar goods at the expense of the withdrawn funds. </p><p>  The opportunity cost can be constant and growing.  In the first case, it is said that <span>production factors</span> act as perfect substitutes.  They are used in the same established proportions for the manufacture of both products.  At the same time, doubling the costs of factors doubles production volume.  The growing alternative cost is considered to be the ability to produce a significantly larger volume of one product due to seized factors.  This is achieved by reducing the <span>production volumes of</span> another product. </p><p>  Choice and opportunity cost are always present together.  Accepting one thing, one has to give up something else.  The meaning of the concept can be explained by example.  Suppose a person is offered two options.  Each of them has its own value, each of them has a certain benefit.  However, this will not necessarily be a financial gain.  A person is given the right to choose.  He can accept only one option.  Theoretically, the best will be the most profitable.  It should be chosen by man.  In this case, the opportunity cost will be correctly determined.  A person solves such problems in his life quite often. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the opportunity cost is considered an economic concept, in a sense it can be considered a philosophical concept.  Along with this, it is used in life very widely, especially at the household level.  At the same time, a person, as a rule, does not particularly think about the right choice, choosing what he likes best, for example, refusing unsightly options. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order for the opportunity cost to be determined correctly, you should understand the situation that poses the need to accept or refuse something.  It is important to be able to soberly evaluate the available options and prioritize correctly. </p><p>  To determine the opportunity cost, it is completely optional to resort to mathematical calculations.  To a greater extent, it is necessary to be able to think analytically.  Along with this, the value of one or another option can be determined in accordance with <span>personal preferences.</span>  Thus, different people can determine the opportunity cost in different ways. </p><p>  Faced with the need to accept or refuse one or the other option, one should not immediately discard the unprofitable at first glance.  It often happens that it is the unsightly opportunities that prove to be the most valuable. </p><p>  It should be noted that an increase in the number of options greatly complicates the choice. </p><p>  Before you give preference to something, you should evaluate the benefits of each proposed opportunity.  Often we are talking about material benefits.  However, value may also include <span>intangible goods.</span>  In general, a certain cost should be obtained.  It should be noted that it is often sufficient to determine the <span>material value of</span> one or another option.  In this regard, when choosing, it is recommended first of all to determine the level of costs and try to assess the degree of income for all alternatives.  After that, the first is subtracted from the second indicator.  Thus, the cost of options is obtained, and the highest indicator will be the opportunity cost. </p><p>  The indicated actions will be quite sufficient for economic calculations.  However, often together tangible, options may contain intangible benefits.  In this case, it is necessary to take them into account. </p>
