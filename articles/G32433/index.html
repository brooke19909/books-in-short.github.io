After all, they are connected with Russia not only by a common history, but also by good neighborly relations.  Any of our compatriots can afford a vacation in the Baltic countries, which makes these destinations affordable and in demand for citizens. </p><h2>  Traveling in Latvia and Estonia </h2><p>  Latvia and Estonia are connected not only by good neighborly relations, but also by a common culture and history.  Therefore, having gone on <span>vacation to Latvia,</span> you should definitely visit Estonia, especially since they border on each other.  In order to get to know these two countries better, the journey should begin with their capitals - Riga and Tallinn.  Here you will get acquainted not only with local attractions, but also with the history of Estonian and Latvian peoples. </p><div class="photo" data-original="luxexpress.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Road Tallinn - Riga" class="if uuid-2662845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2662845.jpg"></div><p>  And if you do not know how to get from Tallinn to Riga, then get a tour that includes not only accommodation and meals, but also travel between cities, as well as sightseeing tours.  Although you can go on a similar trip on your own: just get a visa and get a guide to the cities of Latvia and Estonia. </p><h2>  How to get to Riga and Tallinn by train </h2><p>  From Moscow through St. Petersburg, trains leave daily for Estonia and Latvia.  The journey from the capital of Russia to the final destination is about 15-16 hours, which is considered not so much, especially if you choose a reserved seat or sleeping car, where you can relax.  This will greatly facilitate the task and allow you not to get tired on the road.  Thus, getting to Riga and Tallinn by train is not difficult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.battleit.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train Riga - Tallinn" class="if uuid-2662819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2662819.jpg"></div><p>  However, before you go traveling to European countries, you should definitely take care of having an insurance policy and a Schengen visa, and only then buy tickets.  By the way, tickets can be bought both at the box office of the railway station and via the Internet, which will save a lot of time. </p><h2>  How to get to Riga and Tallinn by train </h2><p>  It is a mistake to believe that you can get to Riga and Tallinn only with the help of a regular train.  And although many tourists do so, in order to get to Riga, you can use the high-speed electric train.  He leaves from the Riga or Vitebsk railway station of St. Petersburg. </p><p>  Ticket prices range from 35 to 600 euros, it all depends on the comfort of the car.  Consequently, a passenger train is far from the only way to travel, since you can also get from Tallinn to Riga by electric train, especially since it can be done much faster on it. </p><p>  Tallinn can also be reached from St. Petersburg.  Electric trains go there every day, seven days a week.  On the way from <span>St. Petersburg to Tallinn,</span> both the electric train and the passenger train pass 6 stations: </p><ul><li>  Kingisepp; </li><li>  Ivangorod; </li><li>  Narva </li><li>  Johvi; </li><li>  Rakvere </li><li>  Tapu. </li></ul><p>  However, it is worth remembering that not all stations can go, as a stop at them can last no more than 2-3 minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="resizing.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bus Riga - Tallinn" class="if uuid-2662816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2662816.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to Riga and Tallinn by car </h2><p>  If you have your own car, then getting to Latvia and Estonia will not be difficult.  You can drive to Riga from Moscow in 11 hours, and from St. Petersburg in 8 hours.  In order to arrive in Tallinn by car, you must go along the M-10 highway through Nizhny Novgorod, right up to the Ivangorod-Narva checkpoint.  After registration and customs inspection, you can go further to the final route. </p><p>  Now you know how to get to Tallinn and Riga by car, train and train.  The only thing left is to book a hotel and explore local attractions. </p><h2>  What you can see in Tallinn and Riga </h2><p>  There are a lot of attractions in these cities, and to see everything, you need to not only draw up a detailed plan, so as not to spend a lot of time searching for them and the road, but also know how to get from Tallinn to Riga.  The main attractions of these two wonderful cities that are so popular with tourists are presented below. </p><p>  In Riga: </p><ul><li>  Latvian National Opera. </li><li>  Latvian National Museum of Art. </li><li>  Freedom Monument. </li><li>  Alberta Street and the Ambassadorial District. </li><li>  Church of St. Peter. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="archives.library.illinois.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Riga, Latvia" class="if uuid-2662842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2662842.jpg"></div><p>  In Tallinn: </p><ul><li>  Church of Olivist. </li><li>  Kadriorg Palace. </li><li>  Maaryam√§gi Castle. </li><li>  Church of Niguliste. </li></ul><p>  It does not matter which city to come to first, the main thing is to visit both.

All three methods are very convenient for tourists, we will consider each of them in more detail: </p><ol><li>  By train: there is no direct railway connection between Riga and Tallinn, so in order to get from point A to point B, you need a change in the city of Valga, which is located close to the Estonian border. </li><li>  By bus, the travel time is 2.5 hours. </li><li>  By car, the travel time is about 4 hours, the length of the road is 312 km. </li></ol><p>  Which of these methods is best to choose is up to you.  The main thing is that the trip brings only positive emotions. </p>
