His short-term rule was marked by a sharp internal political struggle in the country, opposition of the opposition and interference of foreign powers in the internal affairs of the state, but his philanthropic and educational activities were remembered by his descendants. </p><h2>  Coup </h2><p>  Stanislav Leshchinsky belonged to a noble Polish gentry.  The future <span>Polish king</span> was born in Lviv in 1677.  He held a number of high posts, including the post of Poznan governor.  However, the real rise of his career came at the beginning of the 18th century in connection with the beginning of the Northern War, when the Swedish king invaded the country and inflicted a number of serious defeats on its ruler, Augustus II, who was an ally of our country.  The local nobility was divided into supporters of the deposed king and invader.  At this stage, the ruler was deposed, and Stanislav Leshchinsky was sent to Charles XII as ambassador.  After some time, the Swedish ruler decided to support his candidacy for the royal throne.  In 1705, the new king took power over the state with the active support of the Swedish side. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Stanislav Leshchinsky" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1337391.jpg" width="369"></div></h2><h2>  Split </h2><p>  However, the position of the ruler was very fragile.  The fact is that a significant part of the <span>Polish gentry</span> took the side of the ousted king.  However, the following year, Charles XII forced the former Polish ruler to sign an agreement under which he finally renounced the crown and title.  However, after the defeat of the Swedes during the war, Stanislav Leshchinsky, in turn, was deposed, and the former king returned to the country with the help of Russian weapons.  Leshchinsky fled the country, first to Prussia, then to France, where he gave his daughter in marriage to the French king, which strengthened his position in political circles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Stanislav Leshchinsky biography" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1337385.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><h2>  Return to Poland </h2><p>  Stanislav Leshchinsky, whose biography is the subject of this review, lived in France until 1733, but this year the Polish king died, and he, with the support of the French side, as well as some influential Polish magnates, decided to regain the crown.  He succeeded, but he did not stay in power for long.  The fact is that Russia and Austria sharply opposed his accession, who wanted to put their protege - the son of the previous king - on the Polish throne. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Stanislav Leshchinsky biography short" class="if" height="489" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1337383.jpg" width="360"></div></h2><h2>  War </h2><p>  The accession of Leshchinsky led to the war for the Polish inheritance, which lasted two years and ended with the final defeat of the ruler and his refusal of further claims to power.  Russian troops in this campaign were first commanded by Lassi, then he was replaced by Minih.  The siege of Danzig continued for some time, which ultimately ended in the capture of this city.  Stanislav fled the country and after these events finally abandoned the crown.  This was legally formalized in two treaties, which provided, however, for maintaining the royal title, as well as considerable compensation in the form of two principalities and significant annual cash payments. </p><h2>  Educational activities </h2><p>  Stanislav Leshchinsky, whose brief biography is presented to your attention, moving away from political life, has successfully proved himself as a philanthropist and author of a number of philosophical works in the spirit of enlightenment.  So, he was familiar with Rousseau, wrote treatises on the topic of socio-political structure.  In addition, he founded an academy for Polish youth, from which a number of famous graduates came out.  Having at his disposal considerable funds, he built up a square in Nancy with this money, built a church and, as a whole, contributed to the development of cultural life not only at his court, but also in this city, whose population was so respectful to him that after his death a decision was made to name the equipped area by his name. </p>

    <p>  Stanislav Leshchinsky, interesting facts about which are associated more with his philanthropic and educational activities than with his political career, went down in history not so much as the king, but as the organizer of the capital of Lorraine, where he even got a bronze monument. </p>
