And it begins to seem that no one needs push-button ‚Äúdialers‚Äù.  But this is far from the case.  Among these phones there are real masterpieces, the price of which is measured in thousands of dollars.  What kind of monsters are these?  We will look at the most expensive push-button telephones in the world and tell a lot about them.  What is most incredible, these devices do not shine with technical characteristics.  They take to others.  And soon you will find out what exactly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mobileslist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the most expensive push-button telephone" class="if uuid-3237988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3237988.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 1. Diamond Crypto Smartphone </h2><p>  Don't let the word smartphone fool you.  This device does not have a familiar touch screen or an incredibly powerful processor.  And yet, this is the most expensive push-button telephone in the world.  Why is that?  The fact is that the body of the device is made of pure platinum.  Moreover, it is also strewn with blue and white diamonds in the amount of a couple of thousand.  Tempting, isn't it?  Also on the phone case you can find ebony inserts.  By the way, this is one of the most useful devices of this type (unlike other trinkets).  A processor is installed on its board, which supports 256-fold cryptographic encryption and reliably stores owner data.  It is impossible to crack this device.  He also has an incredible camera (by the standards of ordinary ‚Äúdialers‚Äù) - 21 megapixels.  The most interesting thing is that this device is produced by one Russian company.  And now the bad news.  The price of the phone is $ 1,300,000.  How do you like such a pipe? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youngisthan.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the most expensive phone in the world" class="if uuid-3237989" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3237989.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 2. GoldVish Le Million </h2><p>  An incredible device that took second place in the list of the most expensive push-button mobile phones.  Firstly, it has an unusual body shape.  It resembles a boomerang.  The manufacturer claims that it is thanks to this form that it lies perfectly in the hand.  Secondly, the client can choose the material from which the phone will be made.  Interesting options are available, such as white, yellow or pink gold.  You can also choose platinum.  But this does not matter, since almost the entire body is studded with WS-1 diamonds.  There are also inserts made of genuine crocodile skin.  They add to the apparatus of "lamp", or something.  In general, an unusual phone for those who have nowhere to make money.  Moreover, his characteristics are rather modest.  Even there is no camera.  However, this is one of the most expensive push-button phones to date.  Its price is 1,300,000 US dollars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="top10mostexpensivemobile.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="expensive push-button mobile phones" class="if uuid-3237990" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3237990.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 3. Gresso Luxor Las Vegas Jackpot </h2><p>  And this is an excellent device, inspired by ancient Egyptian motifs.  Luxor is one of the most expensive push-button telephones in the world, priced at $ 1,000,000.  What is the money for?  To begin with, in his device there are rare black diamonds that are almost never found in nature.  This alone justifies such a high price tag.  Further, some body panels are made of ebony, whose age is at least 200 years.  Incredible exclusive.  Also, the keys of the tube are made of polished sapphire (moreover, one-piece).  In general, you yourself see that asking for a million dollars is not in vain.  The filling of the device is average.  There is even a camera, but especially high-quality photos cannot be achieved with it.  But the "dialer" is very thin.  Its thickness is about 12 millimeters.  For push-button phones, this is a real record. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.google.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the most expensive to date" class="if uuid-3237991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3237991.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 4. Vertu Boucheron Cobra </h2><p>  One cannot ignore the recognized master in the field of production of extremely expensive mobile phones.  This, of course, is about Vertu.  The same company that relentlessly produces exclusive since 1998.  The Boucheron Cobra model is one of the most expensive phones (push-buttons) in Russia, and in other countries of the world.  Therefore, he took an honorable fourth place in our ranking.  This device has a very unusual design.  The entire front panel is elegantly surrounded by a snake made of yellow, white or pink gold and strewn with 500 different stones (sapphires, rubies, diamonds).  The eyes of the reptile are completely made of pure emeralds.  In total, only 8 copies of Cobra were released.  This is a real exclusive.  And such a device costs 310,000 dollars.  And then if you still find somewhere. </p><div class="photo" data-original="top10mostexpensivemobile.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="most expensive phone price" class="if uuid-3237992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3237992.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 5. Black Diamond VIPN Smartphone </h2><p>  Closes the top five device based on a hit from Sony Ericsson.  The cult model of the K series was taken as the basis. The device received a curved case made of the toughest tempered glass, which makes it practically indestructible.  Also, the device received a very high-quality OLED display.  But this does not make it an expensive push-button telephone.  The fact is that there are black diamonds on the front and back panels.  There are only two of them, but this is already enough for the device to receive a price tag of 300,000 US dollars.  At the same time, the phone does not shine with special characteristics.  Like, in principle, everything in this review.  It is rather an exclusive toy that is designed to emphasize the status of the owner and simply connect it with business partners.  This smartphone is not capable of more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.huffpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the most expensive phones in Russia" class="if uuid-3237993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3237993.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 6. Ulysse Nardin Chairman </h2><p>  In general, this company produces exclusive (and very expensive) watches.  But she wanted to show the whole world what a real unique and expensive button cell phone is.  This device is characterized not only by the presence of noble metals, but also by a very interesting design.  On its case there is a special wheel, which, as it were, hints that the watch company created the phone.  The case itself is made of gold or platinum (optional).  There are some diamonds and carbon fiber inserts that add strength to the gadget.  It is also thanks to them that the phone looks very modern.  The price of this miracle is 130,000 US dollars.  For this money, the client receives a truly exclusive device, which no one really has.  But with the characteristics - trouble.  You can only call and exchange SMS messages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.englishvertu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="expensive push-button phones" class="if uuid-3237994" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3237994.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 7. Vertu Signature Diamond </h2><p>  And again, Vertu.  Apparently, this company produces the most expensive push-button mobile phones.  However, there is nothing unusual here.  After all, the company is run by eccentric Britons.  This Vertu model features a platinum, yellow, pink or white gold case (optional).  It is also studded with diamonds.  Their color can also be selected.  But ‚ÄúVertu‚Äù with black and pink stones is considered to be a special chic for wealthy people.  This adds status to the owner.  And the Vertu company - money in a piggy bank.  Such a device costs a lot - 88,000 US dollars.  His characteristics are the same as that of a standard tube for a hundred rubles.  But do not forget about the brand.  Vertu is already a cult.  And for the label on the phone, many are ready to give crazy money.  Unless, of course, they have them. </p><h2>  No. 8. Aesir AE + Y Phone </h2><p>  A phone with such an unusual name simply must look non-standard.  And he does not disappoint.  The device is made of pure gold of the highest test.  The screen is covered with a single piece of polished sapphire.  The keys on the front panel resemble a watch bracelet.  And this is not surprising when you consider that the company produces exclusive watches.  In general, the design of the device is interesting.  But no more than that.  The company obviously did not work on the hardware component.  This phone does not even support MMS.  Only calls and classic text messages.  There is no camera either.  In general, this is an exclusive piece of gold with the function of "dialers".  And he will have to pay about 52,000 US dollars for it.  It is probably easier to buy a gold bar.  There will be as much benefit from it, but it will be cheaper. </p><h2>  No. 9. Mobiado 105 Damascus </h2><p>  This is a unique device, the case of which is made of real damask steel.  And this means that he is not afraid of any fall.  Although its price is quite high, it is not the most expensive push-button telephone in the world.  The front and back panels are made of solid polished sapphire.  And the phone is only going to be manually.  Its cost starts from 4,500 US dollars for the basic package.  However, it can increase to 10,000 if the client wants to add a scattering of precious stones over the device.  Its characteristics are not impressive.  The device can be used for calls, messaging or easy surfing the Internet.  Alas, he is not capable of more.  Nevertheless, the device is very interesting.  Although at an incredible price. </p><h2>  No. 10. Mobiado 3 VG Dahlia </h2><p>  And again Mobiado.  But now no damask steel.  Only anodized aluminum case reinforced with gold brackets.  It all looks very pathos and beautiful.  The front and back panels are traditionally covered with whole pieces of sapphire.  The buttons are also made of it.  It is worth recalling that these phones are made exclusively by hand.  Even metal and stone are polished by hand.  That is why they belong to one of the most expensive push-button phones in the world.  The technical characteristics of the gadgets are not very impressive.  They are able to call, receive SMS and MMS and access the Internet using the outdated GPRS protocol.  But they look really cool.  For this model, the manufacturer asks for "only" 3200 US dollars.  Copecks in comparison with some previous devices. </p><h2>  No. 11. Gresso 3310 </h2><p>  3310?  And what does the unkillable Nokia do on this list?  Firstly, this is not Nokia, but Gresso.  This manufacturer really took as a basis the legendary Finnish pipe.  The original 3310 was well known for its unsinkability.  But now she has become even better.  The case of this unit is made of a single piece of titanium and is characterized by incredible endurance.  In particular, it can withstand a force of 250 kilograms and does not crash even when dropped from a height of 10 meters directly onto the asphalt.  Such a strong phone in history has not yet been.  On the whole, the design resembles the classic ‚Äútube‚Äù 3310. But the filling does not match.  A camera appeared here, it became possible to surf the Internet and receive MMS.  The screen has become color.  In general, there are many innovations.  But I must admit that this is a very successful reincarnation of the classical model (in contrast to what the revived Nokia introduced).  For a titanium phone, the manufacturer asks for $ 2,000.  But invulnerability is worth it. </p><h2>  No. 12. Gresso Meridian Black Edition M4 </h2><p>  And again Gresso.  But this time no classics.  This is a completely exclusive phone, which is also made of a single piece of titanium, but has elements made of gold.  At least this applies to buttons.  They can be made of white or yellow gold, polished by hand.  The device has a miniature size and can be successfully used for various tasks.  And here there is even a very good camera.  And the screen is covered with a single piece of polished sapphire, which is also important.  For this model, the manufacturer asks for $ 1,900.  Not so much for such an excellent phone. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined the most expensive push-button phones in the world.  They are all exclusive.  Therefore, they cost such money.  Among them there are real masterpieces of jewelry craftsmanship.  But they can only afford certain people.  The average user can only look at them. </p>
