Useful Tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The transition to digital television in Russia has been preparing for the past few years.  In 2018, it was announced that everything was ready for the full implementation of this transformation.  The population only needs to purchase special devices to watch digital broadcasts. </p><p>  For these devices, there are several names in parallel: receiver, set-top box and tuner.  How to connect this device to the TV?  This topic will be devoted to the article proposed to your attention. </p><h2>  Model selection </h2><p>  On how to choose the right tuner from the variety presented on the shelves of equipment stores, it was described in a number of articles.  The same material is devoted to another question - how to connect the tuner to the TV?  However, it will not be amiss to once again return to the topic of model selection and dwell on some important points. </p><p>  First of all, it is worth reminding readers that it is much easier to connect two hardware with the same connectors than those whose ports are different from each other.  Therefore, if your TV receiver is equipped with an Hdmi-type connector, it is better that the purchased <span>set-top box for digital television</span> has the same ‚Äúoutput‚Äù.  A receiver, adapted to connect to a TV receiver via the "tulip" connector, is best to buy if the house has a corresponding TV. </p><div class="photo" data-original="es.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tulip Plugs" class="if uuid-3142149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3142149.jpg"></div><p>  If you use the Soviet model, for example, ‚ÄúQuartz‚Äù or ‚ÄúElectron‚Äù, then you need to make sure that by the time you purchase the set-top box in the house there is an RF modulator.  This small device serves as an adapter from standard modern connectors to an antenna ‚Äúinput‚Äù (the only one with vintage equipment). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  These are the few tips that you can add to the many instructions for choosing devices for watching digital television broadcasting.  What else is needed for the console to work properly? </p><h2>  Antenna </h2><p>  The TV receiver receives a signal transmitted through decimeter waves and received using an antenna.  It can be of two types: indoor or outdoor (general or individual outdoor).  If you have such a device or your TV is connected to a common antenna located on the roof of the building, then most likely this device is suitable for watching broadcasts in digital format. </p><p>  How to determine if the antenna is suitable for this purpose?  If it is a room and it has a round part, designed to "catch" decimeter television channels, then such a model, of course, is suitable for broadcasts of a new format. </p><p>  Also, if you watched in the analogue version channels such as MTV and Friday, then your indoor or outdoor antenna will provide a program in the DVB T2 format, which is now used for digital broadcasting in Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb t2" class="if uuid-3142182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3142182.jpg"></div><p>  If you use a common outdoor antenna, it is best to clarify whether it is suitable for receiving a new generation of television.  If this feature is provided, then you can safely connect it to the antenna jack. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV antenna" class="if uuid-3142146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3142146.jpg"></div><p>  This step is the first paragraph in the instructions on how to connect the tuner to the TV. </p><h2>  Analog broadcasting </h2><p>  If, in addition to the twenty free digital channels currently operating in Russia, you also want to watch broadcasts carried out by a local station existing in your city, then in addition to the digital set-top box, you should also connect to the TV receiver and antenna via the appropriate ‚Äúsocket‚Äù. </p><p>  This step is the second paragraph on how to connect a tuner to the TV.  In order to perform it, you need to use the coaxial cable to connect the antenna "output" of the set-top box with the corresponding "input" of the TV. </p><h2>  Splitter </h2><p>  Typically, the antenna output of a set-top box is located next to the jack to which indoor or outdoor means for receiving a signal are connected.  If the receiver you purchased does not have such a port, then you can get out of the situation using a special device. </p><p>  The antenna splitter makes it possible to divide the cable into two parts.  One of these wires must be connected to the input of the tuner, and the other to the same "socket" of the TV.  Performing this operation, you will be able to view broadcasts in two formats - old and new, analog and digital.  If you do not plan to watch regional channels, then you can safely skip this paragraph of the instruction on how to connect a digital tuner to a TV? " </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  Now you should understand directly how to connect the TV tuner to the TV.  As a rule, modern TV receivers have either an HDMI connector or a tulip on their rear panel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jakartanotebook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rear console" class="if uuid-3142171" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3142171.jpg"></div><p>  The same can be said of <span>digital set-top boxes.</span>  The ideal case can be considered when the connectors of these two devices match.  If your equipment has different ports, then you need to think about purchasing an adapter.  Such devices can be called differently (modulator, converter, and so on). </p><p>  And how to connect the tuner to an old TV that has only an antenna input?  To do this, you need an RF modulator.  This is an adapter from the "tulip" or HDMI to the antenna connector.  If you want to watch TV through a stereo system, you should connect it to the set-top box via the ‚Äútulip‚Äù connector, more precisely, through its two ‚Äúsockets‚Äù designed to transmit sound.  How to connect a satellite tuner to a TV? </p><p>  The instruction for connecting this device to a TV receiver is completely the same as that for digital set-top boxes (it is given in the previous chapters of the article).  The difference is only in the form of an antenna: satellite or decimeter, respectively. </p><h2>  Customization </h2><p>  After completing all the points described above, you need to turn on the prefix, specify in the settings the region in which you are located, and start the search for channels in automatic mode. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.conrad.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="remote control" class="if uuid-3142181" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3142181.jpg"></div><p>  If the device does not cope with the task, then the broadcast frequencies must be specified in manual mode. </p><p>  After that, your tuner is ready to go.  Happy viewing! </p>
