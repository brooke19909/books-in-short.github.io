Many specialized stores offer them in abundance, but it is worth looking at prices and comparing them with the level of your own income, as a burning desire to design a new product gives way to disappointment.  A reasonable question arises: is a hobby (the result of which may not become a masterpiece, how lucky) such expenses? </p><p>  Fortunately, there are several methods proven by experienced craftsmen that will help to save money and work out with creativity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="acrylic paint for decoupage" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1339890.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Acrylic paints</span> for decoupage: we save on the main </h2><p>  When decorating objects using the ‚Äúdecoupage‚Äù technique, the largest amount of money has to be spent on the product itself (if it is a wooden blank, furniture or a bottle of alcohol), as well as on the purchase of paints. </p><p>  Acrylic white paint for decoupage becomes the main expense, as it is used for the primer and the formation of the background.  It should be borne in mind that the paint is usually applied in several layers, so the cost increases at times. </p><p>  Shops offer acrylic paints for decoupage of various manufacturers (most often French).  Of course, they are very high quality, but extremely expensive.  Buying a 200 ml tube is an impermissible luxury for economical craftswomen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As an alternative, you should look at the nearest hardware store, or better, a hypermarket (there is more choice).  Here you need to go to the paint department and choose a jar suitable in color, volume and price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="acrylic white decoupage paint" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1339889.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What paint should I buy </h2><p>  Acrylic paints for decoupage can be successfully replaced with any paint for interior work.  Such mixtures are preferable to paints for outdoor use, as they dry quickly and do not give a terrible smell. </p><p>  Acrylic construction paint for decoupage is sold in banks of various sizes: from 350 grams to several kilograms.  If we are talking about a white paint mixture, then you can safely buy a large capacity, because this is the main material and it will be consumed very quickly.  This method is used by those who organize decoupage master classes. </p><p>  A good way to save money is to purchase one common large can for several craftswomen.  It can be immediately divided by casting into other containers with sealed lids, or used in turn. </p><h2>  How to save on color paints </h2><p>  As a rule, it is not limited only to white, because you have to draw something, tint, or even draw fragments of the pattern yourself.  Colored acrylic decoupage paints are needed in large quantities.  At least a minimum base of 6-10 primary colors is needed, which can then be mixed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="acrylic decoupage paints" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1339888.jpg" width="600"></div>

Buying a large can is justified if you plan to manufacture large-scale things.  In other cases, you can choose a coloring pigment, it can perfectly replace acrylic paints for decoupage. </p><h2>  How to apply pigment </h2><p>  You should know that this coloring mixture is used in combination with white acrylic paint.  At the same time, the amount of pigment in the solution should not exceed 10%, since the texture of the paint will change: it will not be so thick, it will not adhere well, forming stains, and air bubbles may also appear. </p><p>  If saturated colors are needed, it is still better to use acrylic paints for decoupage.  But the mixture with pigment will help to get light shades suitable for the background. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="acrylic paints for decoupage" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1339887.jpg" width="322"></div>

    <p>  Colored acrylic can be found not only in stores for builders, but also in office supplies.  Some of them offer a very decent selection of paints in large containers at an affordable price. </p><p>  For beginners who do not yet know which paint will be used most often, it is worth paying attention to small sets that include basic shades.  When the experiment phase is completed, you can purchase a large bucket of paint of your favorite color. </p><p>  Construction hypermarkets will help to save not only on paint, but also on brushes, varnishes, enamels and sponges (this tool can be built by holding a part of the sponge for washing in a clothespin). </p><p>  The beauty of buying varnish in such departments is that it offers a very wide selection of different products: matte, glossy, transparent, color.  In addition, a large volume of packaging is extremely pleasing. </p>
