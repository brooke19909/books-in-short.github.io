Gum Weaving Options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Several years ago, many were carried away by a new kind of creativity, such as weaving from multi-colored rubber bands.  Craftsmen weave not only bracelets, but also animal figures, key rings, phone cases and toys.  In order to create various crafts from gum, you first need to choose something simple, similar to a bracelet, for example, a snake figure. </p><h2>  Weaving options </h2><p>  The question immediately arises of how to weave a snake so that it turns out to be beautiful and neat.  To do this, you need to consider several options for weaving: </p><ul><li>  on the machine; </li><li>  without a machine; </li><li>  on forks; </li><li>  on a slingshot; </li><li>  on fingers. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Weaving on the machine </h2><p>  The easiest option is weaving on the machine.  All parts of the snake on it are woven as standard. </p><p>  On the left edge you need to throw a line of double elastic bands.  On the second column, the same double row is created.  On the right you need to wind the elastic band in 4 turns.  Then along the length of the row with the edge all the elastic bands are woven, after which the second row is formed.  Both links are connected.  So it turns out the body of a snake.  It is transferred to the hook and carefully put on the slingshot. </p><p>  On the machine from paired gum need to weave a voluminous head.  Elastic bands are fixed on the side posts and in the center.  From 4 gum eyes are woven.  Elastic bands must be fixed in the center.  Triangles are worn in the middle of the weave.  After that, the head can be connected to the body of the snake. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By braiding their head, they create an integral figure. </p><p>  The hook is threaded under the elastic from the central column.  Free elastic is fixed by a knot.  The snake is removed from the machine. </p><p>  This method allows you to understand how to weave a snake out of elastic bands correctly and accurately. </p><h2>  Another option for weaving </h2><p>  This is an easier way to weave a snake.  2 rubber bands are thrown.  They need to be pulled out from under the column and one by one in a certain order to put on the next row.  Then a new row is thrown.  When the snake reaches the desired length, a voluminous head with eyes and tongue is created. </p>

    <p>  To weave it, you need to take elastic bands of green, black and white (the color can be chosen at your discretion).  Weaving begins with a green gum.  It needs to be thrown on the posts.  She twists in 2 turns.  Having removed it, they twist it with an eight, and then return it back. </p><p>  On top of the columns 2 more green elastic bands are thrown.  They need to be thrown from the columns to the center of weaving.  A new gum is added.  One lower loop is removed on it from each side.  So 6 green gum, 2 black, 2 white, 9 green, 2 black, 2 white, 9 green are alternately woven.  So the tail turns out.  You can take on the head. </p><p>  In the usual way, 2 pairs of green rubber bands are added in turn.  Gum from the posts are dropped on them.  They must be moved to the left side.  A black elastic is taken on the right column, twisted in 4 turns.  2 green elastic bands are thrown in the usual way.  Black rubber and are located on the left.  A pair of green rubber bands are thrown.  Then all the elastic bands must be removed and thrown to the right.  The first 2 green rubber bands start the hook.  2 green rubber bands are added, stretched through the loop.  The second end is thrown on a hook.  Elastic bands are removed on the left side. </p><p>  A pair of green rubber bands is thrown in the usual way.  On the left they are removed.  Alternately 2 pairs of green rubber bands are poured in the standard way.  Erasers are removed in turn from two sides and thrown to the right side. </p><p>  The hook is wound into a loop, 2 green elastic bands are added, stretched through the loops.  The second end is thrown on a hook.  Gum need to be thrown from right to left.  A pair of green rubber bands is removed.  On the left side, the lower elastic bands are reset, the rest are thrown to the right.  Black gum is added to the left, which is twisted in 4 turns. </p><p>  Then, in a standard way, 2 green elastic bands are thrown.  Black gum and 4 green gum on the right side are removed. </p><p>  The last green pair is added as standard.  On it you need to throw off the upper pairs from two sides. </p><p>  Brown gum is worn as standard.  It is necessary to drop all the elastic bands on it, and it moves to the hook.  The loop is tightened and the snake is ready. </p>

By adding elastic, create a three-dimensional figure.  The tongue and eyes can be made as you wish. </p><h2>  Fingers weaving </h2><p>  It describes how to weave a snake out of elastic bands on the fingers.

    <p>  One loop should be on one finger and the other on the other.  Next you need to put on an elastic band without crossing.  The bottom loops are removed upstairs. </p><p>  A third is put on.  Loops of the second gum are removed.  This creates the body of the snake.  Its average length should be 8 centimeters. </p><p>  After weaving the base for the head.  For it, 5 centimeters are woven in a similar way and connected in half.  On the sides of the head is tied.  From 4 gum, eyes are woven. </p><p>  How to weave a snake from gum?
