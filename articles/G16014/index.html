    <h2>  Necessary equipment </h2><p>  If you want to watch an expanded list of television channels without being distracted by ripples on the screen and other noise, it is worth thinking about connecting a digital television.  Beeline is ready to provide appropriate services to each of its customers.  True, a prerequisite is the presence of a fiber optic network of this operator in your home.  For example, each user of the home Internet provided by Beeline can connect to one of the offered packages of TV channels. </p><p>  But for this, you must first purchase equipment.  Beeline TV home digital television will become available as soon as you buy a set with a set-top box for the TV.  It can be with or without a recording function. </p><p>  The set, in addition to the main set-top box, includes: a control panel, a cable for connecting to a TV and 2 Ethernet cords, a switch.  Of course, a device with a recording function is more expensive than usual.  However, having acquired it, you will get the opportunity not only to save interesting fragments in memory, but also to pause while watching programs, rewind them forward (backward), and return to the beginning of the plot you are watching. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Beeline HD Benefits </h2><p>  It's no secret that the picture that a conventional <span>analog television</span> gives is uncomfortable to watch on large screens.

After all, Beeline digital television provides a choice.  You can decide what and when to watch.  Each client can choose the appropriate channel package for him.  In addition, modern digital television allows you to watch the program for two weeks in advance right on the screen. </p><h2>  Individual settings </h2><p>  Connection of TV packages is carried out only at the request of the client.  Each person himself chooses a suitable tariff plan, focusing on the list of channels that will become available to him after payment for the relevant services.  In addition, all connected to the digital television service can control the viewing of certain films or programs.  To do this, a special function called ‚Äúparental control‚Äù has been created, with it you can block access to a number of channels or to movies from the available ‚ÄúVideo Directory‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Each person who has chosen Beeline Internet and digital television has a unique opportunity.

    <p>  To be able to watch broadcast programs in excellent quality, you need to connect digital television.  Beeline provides the opportunity to buy the appropriate console or rent it.  In addition, you will also need a Wi-Fi router (switch), through which you can connect a computer, laptop or tablet, and a TV tuner to a single network. </p><p>  But the main condition is the availability of home wired Internet from this provider or the technical ability to conduct it.  If there is no problem with this, then it remains only to purchase or rent the appropriate prefix.  By the way, for customers who use the Internet and watch television in HD quality, special payment conditions are provided.  For example, from 10.07.2014 everyone can rent a tuner absolutely free.  A monthly fee for Internet and TV will be set depending on the selected software package. </p><h2>  Connection Features </h2>

    <p>  Having bought the appropriate equipment, you can configure it yourself, or you can invite a specialist who will do all the necessary work.  If you do not want to wait for a person from technical support, then information on how to connect is useful to you.  This is done as follows.  Initially, the switch and set-top box are connected to the network.  After that, a cable of a dedicated Internet line is inserted into any of the ports of the router.  The next step is to connect Ethernet cables, the so-called patch cords.  The presence of a signal is checked by the illuminated indicators on the router.  If this happened, then you can safely connect one patch cord to the computer, and the second to the acquired TV tuner.  After that, the prefix can be connected to the TV and watch your favorite movies and shows through the tuner from the Beeline operator.  Digital <span>television, the list of channels</span> on which the subscriber chooses at his discretion, gives access to advanced features. </p><p>  Further image settings will be made depending on what kind of TV you have and what screen resolution is maximum for it: HD Ready or Full HD. </p><h2>  Channel Packages </h2>

    <p>  So, for example, you need to be prepared for the fact that the console weighs about 4.5 kg.  Only one TV can be connected to it, and it will only work through the AV or HDMI mode.  The computer does not connect to the TV tuner.  If you want to connect digital television to multiple screens, then you will need to purchase the appropriate number of set-top boxes. </p><p>  Each user notes high image quality.  But at the same time, many do not forget to mention that when a problem occurs with the Internet, television also disappears. </p>
