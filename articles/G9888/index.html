  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Ecodole Sholokhovo": owner reviews, addresses and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every modern resident of the metropolis dreams of unity with nature, this is what explains the purchase of cottages, country houses located 100 or even 200 km from the city.  Muscovites are the main proof of this.  Tired of the endless bustle, frantic pace of life and a huge number of people, we run to small villages and towns in order to at least feel as calm and solitary as possible.  At the same time, recently not just apartment buildings, but cottage villages, combining a lot of advantages, have gained immense popularity.  You get your own house with a garage and a plot, as well as all the necessary communications and developed infrastructure.  The best option for many will be the project "Ecodole Sholokhovo."  Reviews about it are very contradictory: some buyers were delighted with the location, comfort, while others, on the contrary, revealed a lot of shortcomings.  Our task is to make the most objective review of the village and determine how suitable it is for the life of modern Muscovites as part of this material. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  The best traditions of suburban construction formed the basis of the copyright project "Ecodole Sholokhovo".  Owner reviews are the best confirmation of this.  Low-rise buildings represented by individual cottages, townhouses and apartments are the best that the modern real estate market can offer today.  An area of ‚Äã‚Äã103 hectares has been allocated for construction, on which it is planned to place about 1,500 comfort-class residential facilities.  A village with developed infrastructure, closed territory and all necessary communications is a modern alternative to urban apartments.  And all this is not far from the capital!  The first reviews of residents of Ecodolie Sholokhovo are enthusiastic, because no one could have imagined that just 15 km from the Moscow Ring Road you can spend your weekdays so comfortably and with high quality, get together with friends and relatives. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="mskguru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="eco-valley sholokhovo reviews" class="if uuid-3189684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3189684.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Reviews LCD "Ecodolie Sholokhovo" confirm the location of the complex: Mytishchi district, the village of Sholokhovo. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.04701619999999" data-lng="37.54023410000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/6/1/0/16610.png"></div><p>  Only 15 km in the direction of the Dmitrov highway separate the MKAD from the construction site.  The place is gorgeous, the cottages are literally buried in the greenery of trees, which contributes to a favorable environmental situation.  Responses of residents of "Ecodolie Sholokhovo" affect the basic concept of the project, the desire of the developer to create the most comfortable living space, preserving the natural landscape.  At the same time, it was possible to avoid cluttering up the space, the feeling of an "ant hill", on the contrary, giving residents a sense of private living. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Customer reviews "Ecodolie Sholokhovo" highlight the issue of project accessibility for various categories of residents.  Many believe that suburban projects are suitable only for those who have a car in their family, even several.  And all because every day to overcome the path to work with many transplants is really tiring.  The "Ecodole Sholokhovo" is a pleasant exception.  It is built up in the direction of Dmitrovskoye Shosse - a highway with heavy and heavy traffic.  Today, there is no railway here yet, but without problems it will be possible to get to the complex by bus or minibus - just pick the most convenient one.  From the nearest metro station, buses leave literally every 10-15 minutes.  If your family has a personal car, the road to the capital will become a pleasant pastime, because you will be able to "fly" to the Moscow Ring Road in just 20-25 minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="dompodberem.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lc ecodole sholokhovo reviews" class="if uuid-3189692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3189692.jpg"></div><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The north of the capital has not been built up over an impressive period of time, and all because the vast territories here were reserved for industrial enterprises and landfills.  But recently, the situation has radically changed: all measurements taken did not reveal any deviations from the norm.  The reviews of the Ecodolie Sholokhovo residential complex confirm that it is easy to breathe here, there is no unpleasant smell, discomfort.  Accordingly, real estate here is an excellent investment in your future and the future of your children. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The level of comfort for suburban complexes is measured by the degree of infrastructure development.  Potential buyers of apartments and townhouses are concerned about the presence of social infrastructure, especially kindergartens, schools and clinics in the immediate vicinity.  So, the project provides for the construction of its own kindergarten, but certainly not in the near future.  Accordingly, parents planning to acquire real estate must first provide for the possibility of registering their child in the nearest institutions located in relative accessibility from the Ecodolie Sholokhovo residential complex.  Reviews of the first residents indicate the possibility of registering children in kindergartens and schools in the vicinity.  To do this, you must apply to the MFC of the city of Lobnya or Dolgoprudny with a written statement.  It is better to do this in advance so that you can get a place in the chosen kindergarten as soon as possible.  And here, parents nevertheless expect certain inconveniences associated with the route of movement, since direct transport has not yet been organized in this direction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="topnovostroek.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="eco-sholokhovo owners reviews" class="if uuid-3189687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3189687.jpg"></div><p>  The same situation is with polyclinics, hospitals, service organizations.  All of them in a huge assortment and variety are presented only in nearby cities.  The territory of the complex is closed, equipped with a 24-hour video surveillance system.  All residents can count on a place in a spacious parking lot. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  The buyers are offered a choice of several real estate options, the most affordable of them is the apartment.  The apartments are presented in three-story houses built using modern energy-efficient technologies, which makes it possible to feel as relaxed and free as possible even with neighbors behind the wall.  A choice of one and two bedroom options from 30 square meters.  These are rather compact living spaces with isolated rooms, a bathroom with a balcony. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novostroev.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="eco-valley sholokhovo customer reviews" class="if uuid-3189700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3189700.jpg"></div><h2>  Townhouses </h2><p>  If you are looking for more spacious apartments, we strongly recommend that you pay attention to the townhouses presented in the Ecodolie Sholokhovo residential complex.  The reviews confirm that at the moment you can buy luxury apartments from 88 square meters for only 4.5 million rubles.  They are represented by a spacious kitchen-living room and bathroom on the first floor, as well as two bedrooms and a bathroom on the second.  And this is the most modest option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="taynhays.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lc ecodole sholokhovo reviews of residents" class="if uuid-3189697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3189697.jpg"></div><h2>  Cottages </h2><p>  And finally, luxurious cottages from 110 quadrant meters, which will be a win-win option for large families.  There are several options to choose from with thoughtful layouts and incredible functionality.  Moreover, all cottage owners will receive a small piece of land. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dompodberem.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="residential complex ecodole sholokhovo reviews" class="if uuid-3189703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3189703.jpg"></div><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  Having made a purchase of real estate in "Ecodolie Sholokhovo", you will definitely come closer to the housing of your dreams.  And another clear evidence of this is the presence of finishes.  The first tenants were already convinced by their example of how well the work was done, with what trepidation and attention designers and craftsmen approached the design of living space. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  Do not worry about comfort, because the communications in Ecodolie Sholokhovo are exactly the same as in a modern Moscow apartment.  The territory of the complex is gasified, water and electricity are connected to it, a full sewage system is functioning.  The territory of the complex is guarded and equipped with a video surveillance system that provides a high level of security. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mytishchi.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="eco-valley sholokhovo reviews of residents" class="if uuid-3189695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3189695.jpg"></div><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Who better than the residents themselves will be able to evaluate the project?  Every modern Muscovite appreciates comfort and independence.  That is why the LCD "Ecodolie Sholokhovo", the reviews of the residents of which we were analyzing, has become so popular and attractive.  The project is unique, has incorporated a lot of advantages.  But at the moment he cannot provide that comfortable life, about which so much is told by the developer.  A certain discomfort is primarily associated with the lack of all necessary infrastructure.  Moreover, at the moment, the transport network is not developed as well as we would like.  Of course, the project is young, its construction began not so long ago, so in the short term, these shortcomings should be eliminated.  However, if these features do not bother you, you have the time and personal transport, be sure to look at the project, visit its territory in order to form your own opinion and, perhaps, to look after your own apartments.  At the moment, real estate here can still be purchased on the most favorable terms. </p>
