    <h2>  History of the study of the archaeological site </h2><p>  Rurikovo Gorodishche (Veliky Novgorod), photos of which are presented below, scientists began to study from the beginning of the last century.  The first excavations were carried out by archaeologist N. Polyansky.  In the summer of 1910, his expedition was replaced by a group of researchers led by artist-philosopher N. Roerich, and from 1975 to this day (with interruptions), the Institute of the History of Material Culture of the Russian Academy of Sciences led by E.N. Nosov has been working there. </p><p>  As a result of research in the vicinity of the Settlement, such ancient cultural layers were discovered as: </p><ul><li>  the remains of a Neolithic site (2-3 millennia BC), </li><li>  settlement of the <span>Iron Age</span> (first millennium BC). </li></ul><h2>  The most significant archaeological finds made at the site </h2><p>  In the study of <span>cultural layers of the</span> 9-11 centuries, scientists have discovered many items of clothing and military equipment.  Also found were <span>birch bark letters of</span> various contents, several princely seals made of lead, three treasures of dirhams, a large number of Arabic, Byzantine and coins of Western Europe, glass, carnelian and crystal beads, as well as slices of almonds and walnut shells.  All these artifacts testify to the active trade relations of Novgorodians with the neighboring and distant states of medieval Europe and Asia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  During excavations, parts of weights, weights, Frisian combs, wooden toy swords, weights from looms, glass traditional Old Russian bracelets, counting tags, spindle, covers and birch bark bottoms, shards of amphora and much more were also found. </p><p>  Rurikovo Gorodishche (Veliky Novgorod) again made itself talk in 2003, when they found a birch bark letter, which is a fragment of a letter from several brothers to their parents, in which the Novgorod prince was mentioned. </p><h2>  "Varyagsky trace" </h2><p>  According to the number of Scandinavian finds, Rurikovo Gorodishche, along with the historical settlement Gnezdovo, located on the banks of the Dnieper, is the richest excavated in Eastern Europe.  These two objects immediately follow the most famous centers of Scandinavia, Birka and Hedeby.  Of particular interest are ritual objects and decorations.  Among them are shell-shaped, equal-shouldered and ring-shaped brooches, 2 bronze pendants, on which there are runic inscriptions, iron hryvnias with symbols of Thor's hammers, a Valkyrie figurine made of silver, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Rurikovo Gorodishche (Veliky Novgorod): the history of the foundation </h2><p>  The best-known reference to this object can be found in The Tale of Bygone Years.  According to one interpretation of this historical document, in 862, the inhabitants of the lands on which Veliky Novgorod was subsequently founded called on the Varangian Rurik to rule on their land.  On the site of the Settlement, a princely residence was built in the form of a fortified village in which he and his squad lived.  She was at the source of Volkhov, right on the way "from the Varangians to the Greeks." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Further history of Rurikov Gorodische </h2><p>  In the 9-10 centuries, the princely residence on the banks of the Volkhov became the first settlement in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmodern Veliky Novgorod, i.e., the Old Town.  It occupied a relatively small area (6 - 7 hectares) on a hill, which was located on the island in the middle of the floodplain.  The width of the ramparts reached 8 meters and a height of 5 meters. </p><p>  The central part of the Rurikov settlement was fortified with a rampart with wooden structures and protected by a moat.  The village had an extremely advantageous location, as it was surrounded by water lines, and from the height of its hill it was easy to trace the passage of ships from the Volkhov River to <span>Lake Ilmen.</span> </p><p>  Opposite the fortress was a pagan sanctuary - Peryn.  Judging by archaeological finds, a significant part of the population of the settlement was engaged in crafts, including bronze casting, bone carving, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Ancient settlement after the 10th century </h2><p>  In 990, the Settlement, retaining the role of the princely residence, ceded the function of the socio-economic center of the region to the settlement that arose around the bishop's court. </p><p>  After the uprising of Novgorod in 1136, the residence of the prince continued to be located on its territory.  However, he was controlled by the landowner, who was in charge of Veliky Novgorod. </p><p>  Rurikovo Gorodishche (address of Novgorod district, village Gorodishche) at one time became the place where the childhood of the future prince Alexander Nevsky passed.  Dmitry Donskoy, Vasily Dark, Ivan the Third and Ivan the Terrible stayed or stayed there at different periods of history. </p><h2>  Church of the Annunciation </h2><p>  Rurikovo Gorodishche (Veliky Novgorod) is also interesting due to the ruins of the church located there at the beginning of the 12th century.  In 1103, it was laid by the son of Vladimir Monomakh and the ruler of Novgorod, Mstislav Vladimirovich.  The Church of the Annunciation was the second after St.  Sofia stone building of the city and the princely residence was moved there.  It, along with St. Nicholas and <span>St. George's Cathedrals (St. George's Monastery),</span> was built by Peter - the first Russian architect mentioned in the chronicles. </p><p>  In 1342-1343, a new one was erected on the site of a dilapidated temple, which stood for 600 years, until during the Second World War it was bombed by enemy artillery.  The ruins of the Church of the Annunciation give a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat damage was inflicted on the cultural heritage of our country during the invasion of fascist hordes. </p>

    <h2>  "Prince Stone" </h2><p>  Rurikovo Gorodishche (Veliky Novgorod) has become one of the main centers for the solemn celebration of the 1,150th anniversary of Russian statehood.  On September 22, 2012, the opening of the ‚ÄúPrince Stone‚Äù took place on the territory of the historical monument.  It is a huge boulder weighing about 40 tons.  It is engraved with a quote from the famous <span>Radzivilovsky annals,</span> which testifies to the important role of the settlement in the history of Russia. </p><h2>  Veliky Novgorod, Rurikovo settlement: how to get there by car </h2><p>  This iconic landmark can be reached by private or public transport.  If you are following in Rurikovo Gorodishche (Veliky Novgorod), how to get there by car, prompt signs.  More recently, yellow sandstone paved the way for him.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  According to those who have already traveled along the route Veliky Novgorod - Rurikovo Gorodishche (distance in km from the center is 2), after laying a new road, you can get there without any problems on cars of any make.  The exception is the periods of bottling <span>of the Volkhov River,</span> when visiting this attraction is not recommended. </p><p>  Positive reviews are usually devoted to the magnificent views that open from the hill of the ancient settlement to the water surface, as well as to the Kremlin and the Yuryev Monastery.  In addition, a sightseeing trip can be combined with relaxation on the beach and a picnic with barbecue in the recreation area, located next to the attraction.  As for the comments of tourists, many travelers claim that the whole impression of visiting the former residence of Rurik is spoiled by the cemetery located in the neighborhood.  In addition, some visitors note that, although this place certainly has great excursion potential, so far it can be attributed to the number of objects of interest to tourists with great difficulty. </p>

    <p>  Now you know what relatively little-known sights you can see when you go to Veliky Novgorod.  The Rurikovo Gorodishche, which can be reached both by Volkhov and by road, is a symbolic place where Russian statehood was born, so everyone who cares about the history of his country should visit it. </p>
