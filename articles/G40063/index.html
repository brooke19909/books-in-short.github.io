    <h2>  Geography of the Samara region </h2><p>  On the territory of the Middle Volga region there is a rather large region - the Samara region.  Its area is 53.6 thousand square kilometers.  The landscape of the territory is very diverse.  Most of the region is occupied by steppes, but there are also more picturesque places.  So, along the border with the Ulyanovsk region there is a relict taiga with unique stone objects.  The region is rich in water resources, except for the Volga, which divides the region into two parts, there are many lakes and small rivers flowing through beautiful landscapes.  All this makes the area very attractive for travelers. </p><h2>  Rating of the most beautiful places </h2><p>  To the question of what beautiful places in the Samara region are worth visiting, there is no definite answer.  It all depends on the time that a tourist is willing to spend on exploring the natural attractions of the region.  But there is a list of must see objects, which include the Zhiguli mountains, the most beautiful lakes, springs, caves, Soksky Yars, the Samara onion conservation area.  For travelers who are willing to spend a lot of time on a trip to the Samara region, it will also be interesting to see historical sites, for example, the place where the battle of Tamerlane and Tokhtamysh took place, ancient sites, unique lakes - Sernoye, Goluboye, Neftyanoye.  Let us dwell on those natural objects that make up the pride of the region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Water beauty </h2><p>  Many beautiful <span>places in the Samara region</span> are associated with water.  First of all, this, of course, is the Volga.  But also in the region there are several unique and very beautiful reservoirs.  The first place among them is rightfully occupied by Blue Lake.  In the Samara region and neighboring regions there is no longer such an unusual reservoir.  Small in size (the surface is about 300 square meters), a rather deep lake (the deepest point is 23 meters) is filled with emerald-blue water.  The reservoir has karst origin, hence its special form, it is filled from deep hydrogen sulfide sources - hence its unique color.  There is no life in the lake, but algae grow on the edges, which only enhance the spectacular effect of the lake. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The lake is located 115 km from Samara, it is most convenient to get by car to the village of Old Yakushkino, then follow the dirt road according to the signs. </p>

    <h2>  In the depths of the earth </h2><p>  On the territory of the Samara region there are several interesting caves.  The most famous of them is the cave of Stepan Razin.  This natural site has karst origin.  Under the influence of water and soil precipitation, the cave gradually becomes lower and lower.  Today it has a rather narrow entrance, and in the old days the height of the passage was such that it could be entered on a horse.  After a narrow corridor, a rather large hall opens.  Today, the ceiling can be reached by hand, and in the past, the height was up to 5 meters.  Several narrow corridors depart from the hall, which can also be inspected.  There are legends about the cave that at one time Stepan Razin was hiding here several times.  A detachment could quietly hide into the passage covered by the forest, and the presence of a second exit allowed them to escape from the persecution or suddenly appear, "as if from the ground."  Today there is no second exit, but tourists still go to see this historic place. </p><p>  You can get to the cave from the city of Zhigulevsk, along the highway to the village of Malaya Ryazan, then follow the signs. </p><p>  Other underground objects of the Samara region are no less interesting: the Greve brothers cave, Sernovodskaya cave, Shiryaevsky adits in Popova Gora. </p>
