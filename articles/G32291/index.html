    <p>  There is no consensus on what is considered a Missoni pattern, and what is a simple zigzag.  The designer himself claims that his name can wear a multi-color knitted fabric, in the change of colors of which the wave is easy to read.  First of all, visual perception is important.  The canvas can be either dense or light (openwork). </p><h2>  Pattern history </h2><p>  The original multi-color pattern is so recognizable that it seems to have always existed.  However, its history originates only in the middle of the 20th century. </p><p>  In 1947, brand founder Ottavio Missoni opened a workshop for sewing knitted sportswear.  He had only three machines.  For this reason, the only way to diversify products was the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking them striped. </p><p>  A little later, an <span>embroidery machine</span> was purchased <span>,</span> which provided the designer with the technical ability to make a zigzag pattern. </p><p>  The first collection of clothing, which brought Missoni great fame, was created in 1958 for La Rinacsente department store. </p><h2>  How to repeat Missoni pattern </h2>

Knitting or crocheting it is very simple to repeat.  The main point is to knit several loops together in the same row and knit the same number of loops from the same row at equal intervals. </p><p>  You can make Missoni patterns with knitting needles and crochet.  There are many options, but the principle of forming a picture is almost the same.  Using this simple technique, you can create a lot of new original products.  Due to the combination of stripes of different widths and colors, the pattern will look completely new every time.  And all this is created on the basis of a single rapport. </p><p>  Missoni's zigzag is great for <span>knitting from leftover yarn.</span>  Thrifty needlewomen can easily turn a mass of littered threads and threads into a convenient, practical and stylish product. </p><h2>  Knit classic Missoni patterns with knitting needles. </h2><p>  It will be easier to figure out a description of a popular circuit if you start by exploring the classic version.  In it, a zigzag is formed by knitting together three loops at the top of the pattern.  This action is performed in the front (odd) rows.  In order for the total number of loops in the product to remain unchanged, crochets are made at the edges (at the lower point of the pattern). </p><p>  In the process of knitting, the color changes, but the number of rows in one color should always be even. </p><p>  In the classic version, the second and all even rows are tied with purl loops.  But if you want to diversify the canvas, part of the even rows can also be knit with facial ones.  This will make the knitted fabric more textured. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__ft9"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__ft9"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__ft9"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__ft9"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, a little variety can be added to the classic Missoni patterns with knitting needles, knitting two loops between the double crochets instead of one, or replacing the front with the wrong one, knitting the loops together. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="missoni zigzag pattern with knitting needles" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19526/399809.jpg" width="313"></div></h2><h2>  Modern Missoni Patterns </h2><p>  Knitting needlewaves from the famous designer needlewomen began to create back in the sixties.  A detailed description can be found in most knitting manuals of the Soviet era.  They were actively used by our grandmothers and mothers, turning small multi-colored hanks into <span>fashionable jackets</span> and dresses. </p><p>  But thanks to the great fame and, as a consequence of the "hackneyed" pattern, today in its classic form it is practically not used.  ‚ÄúUnfortunately,‚Äù the majority will say. </p><p>  Not certainly in that way!  Missoni designers have developed a host of new ornaments, color and volumetric solutions, which are also easy to read the original change of waves.  However, all other external qualities significantly depart from the classic version.  Modern knitters actively use Missoni patterns in their work.  Knitting patterns are most often knitted with needles, called "pleated", "seagull", "excitement." </p><h2>  Hook zigzag </h2><p>  Creating a Missoni pattern with a hook is easy.  Let's say it is planned to knit with double crochet.  Then we knit a chain of air loops of the desired length. </p><p>  Further, all rows of knitted fabric are performed in the following sequence: 3 air loops, from the next loop we knit 2 double crochets, from the next three loops we knit one crochet, from the next three loops we knit one crochet, then 3 more columns three subsequent stitches, and from the 4th loop we knit 3 stitches with a crochet.  We repeat the entire sequence of actions until the end of the row. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting patterns missoni" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19526/399810.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><h2>  Missoni patterns in women's clothing </h2><p>  For more than fifty years, the Missoni fashion house has been creating unique clothing models.  In the collections you can find almost any element of women's wardrobe.  And if half a century ago, the designer developed only dresses and cardigans, now you can also buy shoes, accessories, home goods with the famous wave-like print. </p><p>  Those who love knitting are never forgotten about the brand.  Missoni patterns often become a topic of discussion in many craft clubs.  With skillful hands, light and warm, dense and delicate, always magically beautiful products are created.  After all, nothing so favorably emphasizes the style and personality of the owner of the thing, as a combination of multi-colored waves on a knitted fabric. </p>
