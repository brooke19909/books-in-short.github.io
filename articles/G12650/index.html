    <p>  The first mention of the future location of the Brest Fortress can be found in the "Tale of Bygone Years".  In those days, a settlement called Berestye was founded, which throughout its existence has repeatedly changed its name and owner.  In 1795, Berestye, renamed Brest-Litovsk, became part of the Russian Empire. </p><p>  It was then that the idea arose of building a series of fortresses along the western border of the empire.  The number of settlements near which protective structures will be built includes Brest-Litovsk.  The construction of the fortress began in 1833 and lasted for nine years.  In the spring of 1842 the fortress became operational. </p><p>  Brest-Litovsk turned into a real strategic hub, which possessed a developed network of railways and trade routes, thanks to which it became of particular interest.  In 1909, it was decided to strengthen the fortress; four years later, modernization work began. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Brest Fortress: World War I </h2>

    <p>  Today's Brest Fortress memorial complex played a huge role during the First World War.  At the beginning of the war, the construction was still at the stage of modernization, so the engineers as soon as possible carried out work to strengthen the fortress.  The local population actively helped builders. </p><p>  In August 1915, Russian troops left the <span>Brest Fortress,</span> whose <span>history</span> shocked the world.  Ammunition and all available property were taken out.  The builders burned everything that they could not take out, the bridges were blown up.  A few days later, the troops of Austria and Germany occupied the city. </p><p>  After the end of the First World War, Poland and the USSR aspired to the territory of modern Belarus.  In 1919-1920, the Brest Fortress constantly changed hands, in 1921 an agreement was signed, according to which the final border was established between Russia, Poland, Ukraine and Belarus. </p><h2>  The Great Patriotic War </h2>

At the time of the attack on the USSR, almost 7 thousand people were in the fortress, among them were Soviet military and civilians. </p><p>  The Wehrmacht command planned to take it in a few hours, but the Soviet military was categorical and defended the territory for a week.

    <p>  The Nazi artillery attack was sudden, and the defenders failed to coordinate in time to resist, so several fortifications were organized at once.  The Brest Fortress, 1941 for which was decisive, fought back in the form of small groups of soldiers.  They staged bayonet attacks. </p><p>  About what the Brest Fortress is, how many days its defenders defended themselves from the Nazis, several feature films were shot that cannot convey the whole tragedy of that situation.  According to the residents of Brest of those days, it was defended until August 1941, but as a result, about 6 thousand Soviet soldiers were captured. </p><p>  The Brest Fortress memorial complex managed to preserve all the evidence of that time by which it is possible to track the course of events.  During the defense period, the Soviet military managed to destroy 1,121 Wehrmacht soldiers, which is about 5% of the army losses that the Nazis suffered in the first week of the war. </p><h2>  The suffering of Brest </h2>

    <p>  During the entire occupation during the Second World War, the Brest Fortress lost about 40 thousand of its defenders.  The economy of the city was completely destroyed.  The liberating heroes returned to Brest only in July 1944 together with the troops of the 1st Belorussian Front.  Unfortunately, many defenders of the fortress fell on the battlefield, but the memory of them is still alive in the hearts of local residents. </p><p>  After the end of World War II, the fortress needed reconstruction, repairs were carried out over several years.  In May 1965, the fortress acquired the title of hero, and six years later it was called the "Brest Fortress" memorial complex. "  It entered a number of buildings that have remained in memory of future descendants. </p><h2>  Complex </h2>
