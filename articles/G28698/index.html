The work uses a variety of materials - ribbons and colored paper, sisal and organza, corrugated paper and cardboard. </p><p>  In our article, we will talk about how to make flowers from napkins.  Mostly monophonic products of different densities are used.  If the master wants to create a magnificent airy flower, then it is better to buy multi-layer, but thin products.  For figured slices, napkins are more durable and dense. </p><p>  Crafts made by the methods described below can be used in a variety of life situations.  Flowers from napkins can be used to decorate the title page of an album, a frame for a picture or photograph, decorate the interior of a room, class or office.  Garlands of paper flowers are hung in the yard for the holidays, decorate the halls for an anniversary or wedding ceremony.  Table setting looks much more effective if lush flowers are made from paper napkins and put to each guest on an empty plate. </p><p>  Mom or grandmother for the holiday on March 8 can make flowers from napkins on a card for the figure, only let it be small crafts, you can paste over them either the whole eight, or symmetrically from the bottom and top.  Birthday or wedding cards can also be decorated with such flowers. </p><h2>  Dandelion </h2><p>  A flower from napkins can be made using a stationery stapler.  To create a dandelion, you will need a lot of yellow napkins.  They are folded in an even bundle and the edges are cut off along the perimeter so that there are no bends.  Next, the stapler fixes all the layers in the center, it is better to make the connection twice and crosswise so that the flower does not break up.  Then a circle is cut with scissors.  To make the cut even, it is best to use a cardboard template. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.promaminky.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make flowers from napkins" class="if uuid-2436519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2436519.jpg"></div><p>  Then, around the circumference, you need to cut the edges with thick ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù so that each layer of the napkin is curly.  The last stage of work is to gently lift all layers up. </p><p>  Care must be taken, because the paper in these products is unusually delicate and thin.  The more elements used for the flower from napkins, the crafts will be more magnificent and more beautiful.  If you are planning to make a dandelion on cardboard, it remains to attach a thin green strip for the stem and cut identical identical carved leaves under the stencil. </p><h2>  Flower for serving dishes </h2><p>  To perform this work, wipes will require dense and larger ones.  Each product is laid out so that the paper takes the form of a rectangle and has one fold.  Having folded several dense napkins into a pack, you need to fold all the paper with an accordion.  In this case, the workpiece is turned down and up.  Then the whole "accordion" is bent in half and a strong nylon string or fishing line is tied at the bend. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kitchen.net.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lush flower from a napkin" class="if uuid-2436541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2436541.jpg"></div><p>  The edges are rounded off with scissors.  How to continue to make such flowers from napkins is clearly visible in the frame-by-frame photograph in the article.  Each layer gently opens and rises up.  The edges of the threads are tied around the base, on which the flower will subsequently cling.  It can be made flat on one side and glued onto the cardboard of a greeting card.  If you used a lot of napkins in the creation of the craft, you will get a round volume ball, which can be hung from a central thread or fishing line on a garland or chandelier in a classroom or cafe hall. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bouquet of roses </h2><p>  To decorate the room, you can twist a beautiful original bouquet of roses.  They make such flowers from paper napkins of different colors.  In addition, you need wire for stems, green corrugated paper and pliers, which will need to bend the upper edge of the wire loop.  This will prevent the napkins from falling into the bottom of the stalk.  You need to attach the elements to the core on PVA glue.  Since rose petals must first be rolled up on a stick, then think about what you can use in this case.  It can be a cocktail tube or a knitting straight needle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazinginteriordesign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bouquet of roses from napkins" class="if uuid-2436507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2436507.jpg"></div><p>  For beginners, making flowers from napkins with their own hands will not be easy, you can practice using cheaper materials.  Paper needs to be developed completely in one layer.  Then a rod is put on the edge, for example, a wooden stick for sushi, and a napkin is wound around, but not until the end.  The edge is left in order to be able to create a semicircular petal.  The bundle is obtained on the outer edge, and the thin paper is curled like a candy wrapper from the bottom.  It is for these twists that the petals will gather around the stalk.  They are placed in a flower with a slight shift, so that the petals do not overlap one by one.  To make the stalk green, you can either choose the appropriate shade for the wire or wrap it with a strip of corrugated paper.  The edges from below and from above are attached to the last turn with PVA glue.  A pair of leaves with pointed edges will look beautiful.  The ends of the petals are hidden under a layer of corrugated paper and fixed with glue.  A spectacular bouquet can stand in a vase all winter, until the first spring fresh flowers appear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Petal preparation </h2><p>  As a result of performing flowers from napkins according to the step-by-step instructions in the article, we will get unusually beautiful crafts that can decorate any gift wrapping for a holiday. </p><p>  Plain or with a small pattern of napkins (a flower collected from paper of different colors will look spectacular, for example, put a couple of green napkins from the bottom, then dark pink, light pink, and arrange the middle in white).  For work, you need the following materials: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.facebook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a flower by carving" class="if uuid-2439389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2439389.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Scissors for cutting the roundness of the petals. </li><li>  Thread or thin tape for fastening all parts together. </li><li>  An awl for punching in the center of the ribbon hole. </li></ul><p>  First, the napkin square is folded diagonally, forming a triangle.  Then the paper bends over the median again.  The resulting small rectangular triangle is cut into a semicircle so that the acute angle remains intact.  Then the paper unfolds and several layers of petals are obtained.  A hole is made in the center of the pack and a ribbon is threaded, at the end of which a knot is tied.  To get a magnificent flower, you need to take a lot of napkins and repeat the work done several more times. </p><h2>  Unexpected surprise </h2><p>  It would seem that a simple rose of two napkins, but how nice it will be for a girl to receive it.  For example, when she briefly leaves the hall of the cafe to ‚Äúpowder her nose,‚Äù the young man will curl a flower during this time.  Making the craft is simple, but you can surprise your beloved with such an unexpected sign of attention.  If the tables have colored napkins, then the rose can be made red.  This is the color of love that the girl will additionally like. </p><div class="photo" data-original="poradu.pp.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="two napkin rose" class="if uuid-2436561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2436561.jpg"></div><p>  How to make such beauty?  You need to roll one napkin with a non-tight tube.  Leaving the height of the flower on top, its lower part folds into a wand.  It will be a stalk.  To make leaflets, use another napkin, you can tear off only one half of it.  The winding is done from below so that the sharp corner of the napkin remains free.  It will be a rose leaf. </p><h2>  Poppies for vases </h2><p>  This is an easy craft that is assembled from a dense red napkin.  Folded parts are cut into circles of different sizes, for example, two large, one medium and one small.  The wire is wrapped in advance with a thin strip of colored corrugated paper and the edges of the pliers are wrapped with a loop, which is separately decorated with black paper, because the middle of the poppy has just such a color. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kitchen.net.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="poppies from circles" class="if uuid-2436550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2436550.jpg"></div><p>  A hole is made in the center of each circle and threaded through all layers of wire.  It remains only from below to pick up all the layers in a bundle and tie a thickening with a strip of green paper.  The edges are sealed with PVA. </p><h2>  Ball petal formation </h2><p>  Unusually, you can perform the following version of flowers from napkins (beginner needlewomen will be helped in the work by the photo below).  All five petals are made in an original way.  You need to get a light ball for table tennis or a children's toy bouncer.  The size should be small so that it is convenient to wrap a napkin around it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dway.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hollow flowers on a ball" class="if uuid-2436619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2436619.jpg"></div><p>  Since you need to make five petals for a flower, you need to prepare as many bright monophonic napkins.  They pull the paper over the ball and, like candy wrappers from candy, the ends are twisted on one side and the other. </p><p>  By long twists, the petals are interconnected and are folded into one thick stick.  It will be a stalk that can be hidden under green corrugated paper.  And the outer edges are trimmed so that all the petals are of the same size.  If you wish, you can make interesting middles, then before twisting the petals, you can insert homemade or purchased stamens from plastic. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, you can make interesting crafts with your own hands even from such ordinary material as paper napkins.  The main thing is to want and carefully study the step-by-step instructions given in the article.  Good luck in your work! </p>
