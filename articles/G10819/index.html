Millions of travelers travel to Tunisia, attracted by the possibilities of a varied holiday.  This corner of the earth absolutely confirms all the archaic ideas about the classical resort: kilometers of fantastic flat beaches with white and golden fine sand, picturesque landscapes of immense Sahara, warm dry climate, rich cultural heritage with a touch of French colonial traditions, many unique sights, thalassotherapy centers, spicy cuisine, a unique combination of oriental flavor of the Gallic culture. </p><p>  Tunisia is very difficult to call a dynamic or fast-growing resort, it is generally difficult to suspect it in some growth!  But he does not become less attractive from this and annually stably receives his impressive portion of international tourists. </p><h2>  Visa to Tunisia </h2><p>  To travel to Tunisia, a Russian traveler does not need to go through the infernal visa pre-registration procedure.  The absence of the need to plan vacations in advance all the time and leave the necessary period for paperwork before the expected departure date gives tourists an additional opportunity to save their most valuable resources - time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Novostar Dar Khayam" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1426823.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many will say that many countries popular among Russian tourists also have a simplified visa regime.  Yes, but when you arrive in Turkey, Sri Lanka, Bali or the Maldives, and until recently in Egypt, you still need to pay $ 15 to $ 35 for a visa stamp at the airport, while Tunisia for all Russian and Ukrainian guests accepts for free. </p><h2>  Thalassotherapy in Tunisia </h2><p>  If you carefully take a closer look, then a classic beach holiday in Tunisia can hardly ‚Äúwipe your nose‚Äù with such popular Egypt and Turkey.  Yes, there are excellent beaches, satisfactory hotels, and animation.  However, in Tunisia there is one chip that especially attracts tourists, or rather tourists - thalassotherapy.  This is a special technique for the treatment of various diseases based on sea mud.  There are many thalassotherapy programs.  Basically, lovely ladies take thalasso courses not to solve serious health problems, but to improve their appearance, expel ill-fated cellulite and eliminate other cosmetic defects. </p><h2>  Tunis Hotels </h2><p>  Tunisia is not seeking to get the palm in the nomination ‚ÄúBest hotel sector‚Äù.  Really first-class, high-level hotels in Tunisia, the cat cried.  The official stellar categorization sometimes contradicts generally accepted standards and even the laws of logic.  It may well happen that a 5 * hotel will yield in all respects to the average European three.  While a three-star hotel can be quite a decent place.  So when choosing a vacation spot in Tunisia, special attention should be paid to the reviews of previous visitors.  Today we‚Äôll talk about a hotel like Club Novostar Dar Khayam.  Reviews of tourists about him are extremely positive, but official accreditation awarded him a modest 3 *. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Club Novostar <span>Dar</span> Khayam <span>3 *</span> (Tunisia, Hammamet) </h2><p>  The hotel has an almost perfect location.  It is located right on the shores of the fabulous Mediterranean Sea with access to one of the best beaches in the Hammamet area.  Club Novostar Dar Khayam is located 6 km from the city.  The historic Yasmine Hammamet is 14.5 km away and the shuttle to <span>Enfida Airport</span> is 30 minutes (60 km). </p><p>  The hotel was built back in 1975, a little later than the city of Carthage.  But still, for a hotel this is too old an age.  Everything was pretty dull until in 2009 the hotel joined the Novostar Hotels chain, and then underwent a massive renovation in 2010.  Before the hotel became part of the Novostar chain, it was called Dar Khayam 3 *. </p><p>  Standard check-in time is 14:00, check-out is 12:00.  Tourists in their reviews have repeatedly noted that if the hotel has ready-made rooms, then guests are populated without problems, they are not forced to wait for the official time.  For the summer period, Russian-speaking personnel work here, including Russian children's animators </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  This large complex has a spacious, well-groomed area.  There are only seven pools here.  One of them is a whole sports and entertainment water park with five slides, which delight both large and small tourists who have arrived at the hotel (Tunisia). </p><p>  Club Novostar Dar Khayam 3 * has a common infrastructure with another hotel in the chain called Club Novostar Omar Khayam.  Guests can freely spend time in the open spaces of the neighboring complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are also small children's pools with fountains and small safe slides.  They can be visited from 10am to 6pm.  Sun beds and umbrellas by the pool are free, towels are issued on the security of 20 TND, mattresses are paid. </p>

    <p>  Also on the territory of the Club Novostar Dar Khayam 3 * complex there are: </p><ul><li>  platforms for playing beach soccer, archery; </li><li>  mini-golf courses (12 km); </li><li>  tennis courts; </li><li>  gift shop and shopping center; </li><li>  currency exchange point; </li><li>  SPA complex and beauty salon, sauna, hammam and fitness center with a gym; </li><li>  an amphitheater and a large platform for evening animation; </li><li>  conference rooms. </li></ul><p>  There is free Wi-Fi in the lobby and at the reception, and wireless internet in the rooms must be paid separately. </p><h2>  Food at Dar Khayam NovostarClub 3 * (Hammamet) </h2><p>  The hotel, without a doubt, keeps up with the cult of modern holiday gluttony under the auspices of the all-inclusive system.  This concept would not have won recognition in many resort countries if it had not been so ingenious.  Even if at the end of the vacation, tourists begin to quietly hate ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù, still the next year they again go to a hotel working on this system. </p><p>  Life hack for the beautiful young ladies who are planning a vacation in Club Novostar Dar Khayam: it is better to book a beach photo shoot in a swimsuit for the first half of your vacation.  Because not gaining 2-3 kilograms in ten days at this hotel is almost impossible.  Those who manage to rest for two weeks in Tunisia on the all inclusive system and not get better, it's time to write books and conduct trainings on how to cultivate willpower. </p><p>  The hotel has a main restaurant (Swedish line) and two <span>a la carte establishments.</span>  The main food intake works according to the standard schedule: breakfast - from 06:00 to 09:30, lunch - from 12:30 to 14:30 and dinner - from 19:00 to 21:30.  The menu here is varied.  The choice of food for different tastes is provided: a lot of fruits and vegetables, seafood, meat, fish and side dishes, delicious desserts.  Hot dishes and snacks are mostly European, although they are not without spicy oriental notes.  Their names in the restaurant are signed in Russian.  Coffee, tea and other hot drinks are served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Often in hotels of the highest star rating, coffee and tea are served at the buffet only at an additional cost. </p><p>  There is also a children's menu.  If the hotel has more than 20 children resting, then the main restaurant serves a separate Swedish line with baby food.  In the designated area with children's furniture during the lunch and dinner, kids are constantly helped by a children's animator.  At the time when less than 20 young tourists are resting at the hotel, children's dishes are presented on the common Swedish line. </p>

    <p>  A la carte restaurants have free admission 2 times a week.  Advance booking required.  One restaurant prepares classic Italian dishes, while the other offers spicy masterpieces of national Tunisian cuisine. </p><p>  You need to know that on the buffet and in <span>a la carte</span> there is a non-strict dress code for dinner.  Men are not allowed to come in bathing shorts and sleeveless shirts.  It is unacceptable to visit the restaurant in beachwear for all categories of guests, including children.  This is a standard requirement that exists in many hotels of this type.  No one requires guests to wear starched collars and dresses on the floor.  But to have a clean, tidy appearance during a meal is an adequate rule.  Simply change your bathing suit to a comfortable outfit in an urban style.  Although our compatriots, and especially compatriots, often like to defile on vacation, sparkling with evening toilets. </p><p>  What drinks are served here?  The hotel has 4 <span>bars: a snack bar, an</span> institution on the beach, near a large pool and a lobby bar.  Tourists note the high quality of alcohol in the hotel (especially beer and wine) and the absence of diluted entertainment drinks of unknown origin.  Soft drinks on the bracelet are given in the bar near the pool and on the beach: tea, coffee, milk, mineral water, lemonade, juices. </p><p>  The schedule of the bars: </p><ul><li>  The lobby bar is open from ten in the morning until midnight (from November 1 to May 31) and from 16:00 to 23:00 (from June 1 to October 31). </li><li>  The beach bar is open from 10am to 6pm and offers alcoholic drinks. </li><li>  The poolside bar opens at 10 a.m., closes at 6 p.m. (November 1 to May 31), and runs from June 1 to October 31 until midnight. </li><li>  A Moorish-style caf√© is open from three in the afternoon until one in the morning (paid). </li></ul><h2>  Service for children </h2><p>  The Club Novostar dar Khayam Resort is just the perfect place for a fun, family-friendly holiday.  In this place, really all family members can relax.  A varied service for younger guests at the hotel allows parents to devote part of their long-awaited vacation to themselves and entrust the kids with children's animators. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the children's menu and pools, the hotel also has a children's room and an outdoor playground.  In addition, for guests from 4 to 12 years old there is a mini club.  It has sports animation, art therapy, drawing, modeling, board games, face art with the help of safe face painting, a soap bubble show.  Professional animators at Club Novostar Dar Khayam Resort hold fun contests with the kids.  There is also the opportunity to develop young talents.  The hotel has a children's theater club and a dance club.  A maxi club is open for teenagers, there they conduct master classes, cooking courses, sports, quests.  The age of children for this club is from 12 to 18 years. </p><p>  For families traveling with infant kids, there is a paid Novostar Baby service.  It includes an additional mini fridge in the room, an electric kettle, a tumble dryer, a children's pot and sand kits.  A cot is available upon request to all guests, and not just those who have paid for the Novostar Baby service. </p><p>  The main restaurant has special household appliances for feeding babies, blenders, a cooler with hot water, a microwave, <span>and bottle warmers.</span>  The hotel has the service ‚ÄúBirthday compliments‚Äù (birthday cake) and ‚ÄúSurprise for honeymooners‚Äù.  In their reviews, tourists repeatedly praise the approach of staff to tourists with children.  They note that such a well-thought out to the smallest detail children's service is difficult to find even in the pathos of five-star hotel chains. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  In Tunisia, hotels can not acquire their own sections of the coastline, as in Turkey, so the beach at this hotel is public, like everyone else in Tunisia.  The hotel itself is located on the first line - a stone's throw from the sea.  The beach at Dar Khayam Novostar Club 3 (Hammamet) is beautiful, flat, equipped.  The entrance to the sea is shallow and shallow, ideal for swimming with children.  There is a bar on the beach.  Sun loungers and umbrellas are free for hotel guests, but they need to be taken early, before breakfast. </p>

    <h2>  Animation </h2><p>  Adult animation at the hotel is very active.  Such entertainment programs are a feature of the resorts of Turkey, Tunisia and Egypt.  Russian vacationers like this approach.  Separate Europeans prefer a slightly different way of spending leisure time. </p><p>  Sports animation at the Club Novostar Dar Khayam 3 * hotel (Tunisia) includes group and water aerobics, as well as dance courses.  This is very useful with such a rich "ol inclusiveness."  There is also evening animation, show programs and a disco every day.  Guests can enjoy free catamarans on the beach.  You can try all kinds of water sports for a fee, including kayaking, diving, water polo, windsurfing, water skiing. </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  The total number of apartments is 320. The number of rooms is impressive and is designed for a large number of guests.  But the area at Club Novostar Dar Khayam 8 8 is also huge.  Therefore, guests can have fun in different places of the complex without disturbing each other.  Vacationers can book rooms in the main building or in the bungalow.  Each option has its advantages: the bungalows are closer to the beach, and from the balconies of the rooms of the main complex a beautiful view of the sea opens. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club novostar dar khayam 3 tunisia" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1426813.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The rooms are equipped according to the standards: balcony or terrace, bed, furniture, TV, air conditioning, telephone, bathroom, hairdryer, minibar.  For an additional fee, you can get a safe and a minibar.  Rooms are cleaned every day, bath towels are changed daily, and beds are changed once a week. </p><p>  Tourists in their comments actively praise the food, animation at this hotel, but sometimes speak disapproving of the rooms.  In principle, the rooms are all clean and fully correspond to the category of the hotel.  It's about the fact that the rooms are the only thing that gives out three ‚Äústars‚Äù in this hotel.  Everything else, including service, staff qualifications, a set of services, resembles a five-star hotel. </p><h2>  What interesting places can I visit in Tunisia? </h2><p>  No matter how wonderful the Club Novostar Dar Khayam hotel is, sometimes the curiosity of tourists forces them to leave the hospitable territory of the complex and go in search of interesting places.  In this regard, Tunisia can offer guests a truly unique excursion program.  Throughout the country, many memorials of the glorious past of this marvelous corner of the planet have been preserved. </p><p>  What can the hotel <span>(Hammamet)</span> offer us <span>?</span>  <span>Hammamet</span> Club Novostar Dar Khayam is located near the city of the same name.  So, of course, you can go to the village itself.  This is an old, colorful settlement.  There are many centers of thalassotherapy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia club novostar dar khayam" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1426822.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tunisia's most popular attraction is the majestic ruins of an ancient city.  Everyone probably remembers from the history of the ancient world about the powerful Carthage, which was founded by the Phoenicians, but then conquered by the Romans.  In El Jem, you can see the preserved ancient amphitheater, which is in no way inferior to the Colosseum.  This is the main character of the prints on all the souvenirs that are sold in Tunisia.  You can also go on an excursion or on a jeep safari in the Sahara - the largest desert in the world.  It captures with its greatness, amazing views. </p>
