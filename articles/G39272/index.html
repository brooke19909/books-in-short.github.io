  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Daylight Savings Time in Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Daylight saving time is a special system for <span>determining time,</span> adopted in Russia since 1930.  It lies in the fact that another sixty minutes are added to the belt calculus. </p><p>  Such a project was adopted <span>by the Council of People's Commissars</span> for full-fledged work in the daytime and energy saving.  Maternity hours were canceled in February 1991, but then again entered into force in January 1992.  Once again, it was canceled in March 2011. </p><p>  Maternity time is still valid in some countries of the former USSR. </p><p>  Since 1917, it was customary in Russia to switch to "summer" time, and then return to "winter" time.  This one hour return of the hands was canceled in 1930.  As a result, the so-called maternity time appeared, ahead of the standard time. </p><p>  Since the spring of 1981, a <span>new time</span> was introduced in the territory of the former USSR <span>,</span> which was two hours ahead of the time zone.  At the same time, the return to the ‚Äúwinter‚Äù calculus was restored, which was carried out by transferring the arrows an hour ago in the fall. </p><p>  In 2011, in connection with the cancellation of the <span>transition to winter time, the</span> situation of the 30th year of the last century was repeated.  Only the actual time is two hours ahead of the standard time. </p><p>  But this innovation is not applicable to all regions of the Russian Federation.  So, now in Western Siberia, in Kamchatka and in some other regions, only one hour has been added to the standard time.  And on the territory of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Komi, Chukotka, time corresponds to the time zone.  This confusion arose as a result of the eastward shift of the borders of time zones in Russia since 1992. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to some scholars, the fact that the time calculation used is two hours ahead of the standard time, negatively affects the health of many people. </p><p>  This is due to a violation of the natural rhythms of the body.  In addition, reduced daylight hours can lead to depressive states in both adults and children. </p><p>  At the same time, people working on a schedule from 9 am to 6 pm, as well as schoolchildren attending additional classes, will not see <span>daylight</span> at all. </p><p>  According to other researchers, such a measure, on the contrary, will improve the quality of life and even reduce mortality.  Indeed, most of the wakefulness will be in the daytime, which can reduce the number of accidents and accidents on the roads.  Also, many believe that the time that is two hours ahead of the standard time is psychologically more natural for a person.  This position is also supported by the fact that the transfer of arrows in spring and autumn increases the load on the body.  In the days when the clock was being transferred, the number of acute diseases increased, and the percentage of suicides increased. </p><p>  So, there are two opposing points of view on the problem of time change in Russia.  It is difficult to say how much each of them corresponds to reality. </p><p>  One way or another, most of the inhabitants of Russia are used to living in a new time. </p><p>  If historically maternity time was set mainly to save energy, now the question is not so, because it became clear that the savings, if any, are very small. </p><p>  To a greater extent, one has to think about the health and psychological comfort of citizens.  In fairness, I would like to note that the majority of residents working on a permanent job did not notice a change in their well-being and mood due to the abolition of "summer" time. </p><p>  By the way, now the concept of ‚Äúmaternity time‚Äù is no longer used in Russia.  The new bill on the calculation of time has replaced administrative <span>time zones with time</span> zones that do not coincide with the previous territorial division.  And the concept of maternity time, in accordance with this law, was withdrawn from circulation. </p>
