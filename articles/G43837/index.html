    <p>  During the day, guests can enjoy aerobics classes, basketball, billiards, tennis courts, table tennis, football and a gym.  And on the coast, vacationers can ride a banana, parachute and go diving. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beach complex </h2><p>  Club Tarhan Beach HV 1 has its own sandy beach on the coast, equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas.  A shallow shore with a long shallow approach, which is a characteristic feature of the <span>Didim</span> resort <span>(Turkey).</span>  Children here are incredibly comfortable to swim.  As for adults, you should go to the depths.  However, there is a pier on the shore from which you can dive. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Didim (Turkey) is a place for a quiet measured rest at affordable prices away from such noisy resorts like Fethiye and Marmaris.  This area has several advantages, because it is geographically located on the coast of the Aegean Sea.  The local climate is mild.  Therefore, holidays in Turkey on the Aegean Sea are attractive to many tourists. </p><p>  Didim is a very young resort.  It covers the city itself and several nearby villages (Galluk and Oren).  The city has a long history, the first mention of it dates back to the sixth century BC.  However, the village on the seashore began to turn into a resort of a solid scale only in the nineties of the last century. </p><p>  Currently, Didim is a popular resort that is developing very dynamically.  There is no private airport in the city, so tourists have to use the services of nearby airports - (Milas-Bodrum is 70-85 kilometers, Daklamana is 125 kilometers, Izmir is 145 kilometers). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club tarhan beach hv 1" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1549821.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The resort's advantage is the Mediterranean climate.  In early May, the thermometer mark can reach +35 degrees, and in the summer - +38.  In August and July, the weather is quite dry.  Water in the sea warms up to +29 degrees. </p><h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  What attracts tourists to Didim?  Hotels built on the sea coast welcome guests from May until mid-October.  The beach season lasts long enough.  The local coast has a natural sand and pebble coating.  It is an ideal place for families with kids.  The sea in this region is shallow, and therefore quickly warms up.  The beaches of the resort are awarded the European sign - the Blue Flag - for grooming and cleanliness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="didim turkey" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1549823.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Resting in the city, you can not only devote all your time to beach and sea leisure, but also engage in active water sports and entertainment.  Didim has historical attractions, as it is the archaeological center of antiquity.  The beauty of the resort will not leave indifferent any tourist.  A large number of greenery, pools with water slides and a beautiful coastline with beautiful beaches attract an incredible number of tourists.  The resort has built more than 200 hotels of various levels (from 2 * to 5 *).  There are many entertainments for kids here: mini-clubs, water park rides. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Didim has an archaeological site.  An ancient legend says that the city is the birthplace of Apollo, and therefore the temple of Apollo is considered the main attraction.  Its construction was begun in the 8-4 centuries.  BC.  However, they did not finish it.  The temple never managed to become the eighth wonder of the world.  He was to become the twin of the famous <span>Temple of Artemis at Ephesus.</span>  Two columns, bas-reliefs, stone statues, fountains have survived to this day. </p><p>  Tourists will be interested to see the ruins of an old stadium, where in the old days all kinds of competitions took place.  No less interesting for vacationers will be a visit to Lake Bafa.  Didim has a good location for visiting the sights of the Aegean coast.  Just an hour from it is the famous Ephesus, famous for ancient monuments and natural beauties.  No less interesting for tourists will be visiting Miletus, Pamukkale, Bodrum, Terme Fatsetiny, Gumuldur and Kusadasi. </p><p>  Not far from the town of Didim is the ancient city of Prien, which is ranked among one of the twelve most famous and ancient cities of Asia.  The policy is incredibly well preserved to this day.  And now it serves as a vivid example of the buildings of the Hellenistic period.  Prien experienced unprecedented heyday, but later lost all meaning.  Why this happened is not known exactly.  There are only a few assumptions about this.  The city lasted until the eighth century, and later turned into an unremarkable village.  At the same time, the city is perfectly preserved and is considered the best example of ancient architecture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="currency exchange" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1549824.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  One of the most interesting historical monuments of Didim is the ‚Äúsacred road‚Äù.  This stone path dates from the 4th century BC.  At one time, it connected the temples and was built by the Roman emperor Troyan.  Once it was all paved with expensive red marble.  It is believed that once a walk along the trail took about four days.  In ancient times, marble statues decorated the roadsides.  Among them were male and female figures, as well as lion statues.  Currently, they are all in the British Museum.  Later, several more statues were found during excavations, which are exhibits of the museum in Istanbul.  Of course, now the "sacred road" does not impress tourists with its unsurpassed grandeur, but a tour of it will allow you to get acquainted with the history of Turkey. </p><h2>  Resort Activities </h2><p>  In the town of Dilim there is an international port from which you can go on a <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãvoyage</span> to the island of Kos (Greece).  The resort also offers some healing treatments for its guests.  So, for example, tourists can visit beauty complexes, thanks to which the body and face can be brought into excellent condition.  Also at the service of vacationers are baths of contrasting temperatures, mud therapy, a variety of massages, hammams, warming up and physiotherapy. </p><h2>  Reviews about Club Tarhan Beach 5 * (Turkey, Didim) </h2><p>  Having a conversation about the hotel, I certainly want to refer to the reviews of tourists who visited it in 2016.  Currently, the Club Tarhan Beach Hotel has rather conflicting reviews.  And there are reasons for that.  In the recent past, the five-star complex was a wonderful and worthy place of rest, which many vacationers have long loved.  However, it should be noted that in May 2016 there was some reorganization.  And the hotel passed into the hands of a new owner. </p><p>  Perhaps some of the shortcomings that have appeared here are related to temporary reorganization issues. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club tarhan beach 5 turkey didim" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1549825.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to the guests of the complex, the hotel has a pretty well-groomed territory with a small amount of green space.  Upon arrival, the settlement takes place quickly and without delay.  As for the rooms, here the opinions of tourists differ.  Apparently, the element of luck affects.  Someone initially lodged in excellent spacious rooms, and someone gets quite cramped and uncomfortable apartments.  However, for a surcharge, you will very quickly be moved to a higher category room. </p><p>  The furnishings of the apartments are quite acceptable.  Daily cleaning is provided, as for the replacement of towels, they are changed almost every day.  But bed linen is changed once every three days.  Regarding the quality of cleaning, tourists have different opinions: some are satisfied, while others are not. </p><p>  Club Tarhan Beach (Didim) positions food as "ultra all inclusive."  Many tourists choose this hotel precisely because of this nuance.  In general, the restaurant serves quality food, but not everyone is satisfied with the variety of dishes.  According to All Inclusive, free drinks must be present.  Reviews of tourists say that there are very few alcoholic drinks in the assortment of bars, there are not even the simplest cocktails.  All available alcohol is only locally produced.  But on the tables there is always a lot of pastries and sweets. </p><p>  The hotel does not matter with the Internet.  Wi-Fi only works in two places: the lobby and the pool.  As for the infrastructure of the complex, it is standard for such establishments.  There is a currency exchange at the reception (currency exchange can be done without leaving the hotel). </p><p>  The hotel has excellent clean pools with an equipped relaxation area.  However, during the high season there are not enough places, so you have to take sunbeds early in the morning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="didim hotels" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1549826.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the evenings, guests are entertained with show programs, however, animators conduct them mainly in <span>Turkish.</span>  Most of the hotel guests are Turks, and the rest are guests from the former Soviet Union.  The hotel also has a night disco. </p><p>  Club Tarhan Beach is located near the coast and has its own beach.  The coast has beautiful sand cover and shallow sea, which is a great bonus for young tourists.  Adults are not too happy with such a small approach, but for them there is a separate pier from which you can dive.  The beach of the complex is not too large, in the peak season it is crowded with vacationers.  According to guests, sunbeds and umbrellas need to be replaced, because they do not correspond to the level of the hotel.  Moreover, during the period of mass races they are clearly not enough, vacationers have to take places early in the morning.  The sea in Didim is warm enough due to the warm and mild climate.  True, there is often a disturbance on the surface, but this does not stop swimming, because the sea has a shallow sunset.  Given the characteristics of the coast, we can conclude: the resort is a great place for families with kids.  But it will also be fun for active groups of friends here, given the amount of entertainment that not only the local coast offers, but also numerous sightseeing tours. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Club Tarhan Beach is a five-star family-friendly hotel with children.  The complex is located in a quiet suburb, away from the hustle and bustle.  The proximity to the beach and the excellent warm sea are a guarantee of a good holiday. <strong></strong></p>
