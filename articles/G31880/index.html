  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Union offers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Union-free proposals are those in which several forming parts are combined into one.  Moreover, they are connected not with the help of <span>allied words</span> or unions, but in the following ways: </p><ol><li>  Intonation.  For example: "A terrible guess flashed through my mind: I imagined it was caught by local robbers."  The nature of intonation can be different: listing, explanation, contrasting, conditioning, warning, etc. </li><li>  Within the meaning of.  This is expressed in the fact that all parts of a <span>complex sentence</span> taken together form a statement that has a single meaning.  For example: "Morning came, it was snowing, the wind was constantly blowing from the south."  Here, the details of the overall picture are indicated by listing the parts of the sentence. </li><li>  Also the link may be the form of the verb (for example, form, mood).  They are used to indicate the nature of the relationship.  For example: "The wind flew, tore off the last leaves, heavy rain pounded on the roof."  Here the homogeneous forms of the verb indicate a temporary connection of the described phenomena. </li><li>  A special order of building parts.  When they are rearranged, the meaning of the sentence often changes.  For example: ‚ÄúIt got hot: noon.‚Äù  Here in the first part - the consequence, and in the second - the cause.  You can swap them: "It was noon - it became hot."  But then the consequence will be in the second part, and the reason - in the first.  If you insert the word ‚Äútherefore,‚Äù between them, the meaning will not change. </li></ol><p>  Complex union-free sentences come in two varieties: </p><ul><li>  correlative with allied constructions; </li><li>  inconsistent with them. </li></ul><p>  The latter are relatively rare.  Union-type proposals of the first kind are more common.  They, in turn, are further divided into: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1. Union-free proposals, consisting of the same parts.  They express temporary relationships, as well as oppositions of actions or their comparison.  That is, the structure and value of the proposals of this group are close to complex.  For example: "The ground froze, the branches froze, in some places their ringing was heard."  Parts of this sentence describe events that occur at the same time.  The <span>verb forms of the</span> same type and the intonation of enumeration are used.  Between the parts the insertion of the union ‚Äúand‚Äù is possible.  Although stylistically it is not always acceptable or applied successfully. </p><p>  The proposals of this group can express such actions or phenomena that occur one after another, sequentially.  If they indicate events occurring simultaneously, the forms of the verb in them need not be uniform.  In these proposals, structural parallelism of the parts of which they are composed is sometimes found.  For example: "One for all - all for one." </p><p>  2. Unionless proposals, consisting of different types of parts.  They express determinative, object relationships, consequences, causes, and others.  This meaning brings the union-free proposals of this group closer to the complex ones. </p><p>  For example: "One thing was for sure: he won‚Äôt return home." </p><p>  There are also cases of transition of a sentence from one type to another.  Then there is a combination of structural elements and the meaning of submission and composition. </p><p>  <span>Punctuation marks</span> in a non-union sentence correspond to intonation pauses in oral speech.  For example, a <span>semicolon or a comma is</span> placed when connecting words ("and" and others) can be inserted between two parts.  The colon and dash correspond to longer intonation pauses.  In addition, the sentences in which these signs are placed have different meanings: one part supplements the second, reveals its content, indicates the reason for what is happening.  When setting a dash, the following semantic relationships are constructed between the structures: comparison, conclusion, contrast, quick change of events, as well as time and condition. </p>
