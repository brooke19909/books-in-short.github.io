Calculation of insurance experience</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Russia, everyone has long been accustomed to the phrase "pension reform"; in recent years, almost every year the government makes these or those amendments to the legislation.  The population does not have time to follow all the transformations, but awareness in this area is extremely necessary, sooner or later, any citizen is forced to wonder how to find out his insurance experience and apply for a pension. </p><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  The introduction of this definition into circulation is associated with the continuation of the reform that began in 1996.  Since that time, the establishment of individual registration of citizens in the general pension system has been phased.  One of the levels of conversion is insurance experience.  The Federal Law of 04/01/1996 and July 16, 1999 No. 165 give different interpretations of this concept, due to which a certain contradiction arises. </p>

    <p>  The first law does not mention labor activity at all, the second has a more precise wording, but it also leaves many questions about what insurance experience is in reality.  The contradictions in the definitions make it possible to take into account even the time when a person did not officially work, and there were no transfers to the Pension Fund. </p><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  An insurance record is the total number of lengths of a citizen‚Äôs working life span over a lifetime during which insurance contributions are regularly paid by an employer or individual entrepreneur.  In addition, this also includes the time when the necessary deductions could not be: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  childcare up to one and a half years; </li><li>  being on the stock exchange, with the confirmed status of unemployed; </li><li>  <span>caring for a disabled person</span> or a person older than 80 years; </li><li>  participation in public activities paid in a special manner; </li><li>  the time of residence abroad of the spouses of diplomats. </li></ul><p>  The calculation of the length of service depends on several factors: duration of work in years, as well as features of working conditions: harmful, difficult, climatic, etc. The accrual rate for the general and special length of service is different, sometimes it is very difficult to understand the classification of this or that without professional legal assistance type of activity. </p><h2>  What is the difference from labor </h2>

    <p>  What is seniority is much easier to understand if we draw an analogy with the term ‚Äúretirement pension‚Äù that is familiar to us, it has become obsolete since 2015, and is applicable only to people whose activity counts are carried out until 2002. Since 2003 , all payments will be calculated from insurance premiums. </p><p>  For the assessment, special pension coefficients and points are used, and each year of work will be analyzed separately. </p><h2>  Who is eligible to receive </h2><p>  There have not yet been revolutionary changes in the procedure for providing pensions for citizens of the Russian Federation.  The measures planned by the government to increase the age limit for receiving social security from the state have not yet been taken, although this bill is being actively developed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thus, in 2017, women over 55 can receive their old-age pension, and men over 60. Those who are already close to this age should hurry up and try to study in detail all the information on how to find out your insurance experience .  In addition, since 2015, the state has determined a phased increase in the period of labor activity for the population, it will occur gradually until it reaches 15 years. </p><h2>  Existing species </h2>

    <p>  The classification of labor output depends on the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the length of service, where the first is all the time when there were deductions, regardless of activity, and the second reflects the characteristics of production. </p><ol><li>  Total length of service is the total duration of labor activity during which part of the income is redirected to the Pension Fund of Russia.  In addition to the main working time, this includes other periods recognized by law, this may be caring for a child up to three years old or completing military service. </li><li>  Professional insurance experience - this is the total duration of labor activity associated with difficult or harmful working conditions or an unfavorable climate. </li></ol><p>  The procedure for calculating an old-age pension is difficult for an uninitiated person to understand, but every citizen must understand the principles of calculating his future social security.  Moreover, today the issue of how to find out your insurance experience has been completely resolved.  This can be done at the local branch of the PF, as well as on the official website of the organization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Features of the calculations </h2><p>  Future social benefits to Russians are formed in the mandatory pension system.  The procedure for calculating the length of service is established by <span>federal law</span> dated 17.12.2001 No. 173 ‚Äì  (amended on 11/19/2015).  Payments are assigned and made in the form of an urgent, one-time or funded pension. </p>

    <p>  The calculation of the insurance period is based on calendar values, in case of coincidence of periods, the citizen has the right to choose one of them.  All accumulations are recalculated into special points, their amount depends on the monthly payments by the employer in the PF.  The state indexes these values ‚Äã‚Äãevery year according to the existing inflation.  Moreover, subject to applying for a pension not immediately on time, and later, the size of insurance points will increase significantly. </p><p>  For persons self-sufficient in earning money, which may be members of farms, as well as representatives of small peoples of Siberia, periods of required length of service are calculated provided that they regularly contribute part of their income to the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation.  The same rule applies to individual entrepreneurs. </p><h2>  Accounting for non-insurance periods </h2><p>  The legislation provides for exceptional cases in which a person was not able to make regular deductions to non-state funds for a good reason.  For such persons, the state has established its own system of accruing insurance points: </p><ul><li>  one year of military service - 1.8; </li><li>  caring for a disabled person, a person older than 80 years - 1.8; </li><li>  maternity leave with the first child - 1.8; </li><li>  with the second - 3.6; </li><li>  with the third and fourth - 5.4. </li></ul><p>  Moreover, the period of raising the fifth child is no longer included in the total length of service.  It is not easy to make all calculations on your own, because many people have a question about how to find out their insurance experience.  Today, this can be done without even leaving your home; a hotline operates around the clock in the PF of Russia, and all information is available on their official website. </p><h2>  How to find out your experience </h2><p>  You may need these data not only when going on a well-deserved rest, but also when calculating a sick leave.  Each of these categories has its own calculus system.  The amount of temporary disability benefits depends on the amount of <span>continuous experience</span> : </p><ul><li>  from 6 months to 5 years - up to 60% of the salary is paid to the employee; </li><li>  from 5 to 8 years - 80%; </li><li>  over 8 years already 100%. </li></ul><p>  Difficulties can arise when you lose the supporting document, incorrectly entered entry or its absence.  But even in such a difficult case, you can defend your rights, to confirm oral information it will be necessary to provide employment contracts, certificates from the place of work, extracts from orders and personal accounts where the salary was transferred. </p>

    <p>  You can get the most accurate information on how to find out your insurance experience at your local PF branch.  But today there is a simpler option: since 2015, a service has appeared on the official website of the Pension Fund - a personal account where every citizen of the Russian Federation can get all the information that interests him.  How to find out your insurance experience through the Internet will be described below. </p><h2>  How to find information </h2><p>  The system of sending so-called letters of happiness that existed until 2012 had many shortcomings, first of all, the security of personal data.  Now on the official website of the PF online you can get the help of a consultant, make an appointment or order the necessary documents.  One of the most convenient services is a pension calculator, with the help of which any citizen can calculate the size of future payments. </p><p>  You can solve the question of how to find out your insurance experience under the SNILS, understand the system of calculating points and track payments by the employer in the personal account section.  To register and enter, you will need an email address, phone number and identification card, and passport data for access to some services. </p><h2>  Application practice </h2><p>  Registration on the website of the Pension Fund provides an opportunity for a person to constantly receive information about the amount of payments that an employer makes, to find out the number of points earned, and using a pension calculator it is easy to calculate the size of future social benefits. </p>

    <p>  The service will be useful for those who do not understand anything in the system of calculating the insurance period and have not even thought about the future.  Here you will receive answers to all questions regarding the pension, which means that you can make your own plans for the coming old age. </p><h2>  Notes </h2><p>  Practice has shown that Russian citizens are poorly informed about the procedure and form of calculating old-age pensions.  Many still wonder whether sick leave is part of the insurance record.  Regulatory federal laws include this period in general terms, but provided that the citizen is officially employed. </p><p>  The situation is more complicated with studies, these years are counted only if a person has the right to pension was formulated before the 2002 reform. </p><p>  All calculations of future payments occur for a certain period (usually one year).  If during this period of time insurance contributions were not paid to the Pension Fund, or it was of a partial nature, this may lead to an underestimation of the funded part.  Obviously, the calculation system has many nuances and features, therefore, for information on how to find out your insurance experience, it is better to contact the regulatory authorities. </p><h2>  Forecasts </h2><p>  In early 2017, the Minister of Finance announced that this year all proposals for the reform of the pension system will be finalized and introduced into the legislation.  The following changes are forecasted: </p><ul><li>  an increase in the age limit, as it happens, is still unknown, options for a gradual increase in this threshold or a sharp, shocking jump are considered; </li><li>  retirement of civil servants will change; </li><li>  a new mechanism for voluntary accumulation of money will appear; </li><li>  a guarantee reserve will be created. </li></ul>
