Unlike the previous model FZ30, which was a step forward in terms of design and functionality compared to the FZ20 and filled the niche between compacts and SLR cameras, he showed rather little progress.  The purpose of this description of the <span>Panasonic Lumix</span> DMC-FZ50 is to answer the question of whether the model could become a worthy successor. </p><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  The main characteristics of the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50 are as follows: </p><ul><li>  10.1-megapixel CCD sensor; </li><li>  Leica DC Vario-Elmarit optics with 12x optical zoom (35-420 mm equiv.); </li><li>  Venus Engine III graphics processor; </li><li>  optical image stabilization; </li><li>  full control over photography; </li><li>  2.0 ‚Äùdisplay with a resolution of 207 thousand pixels .; </li><li>  electronic viewfinder; </li><li>  sync contact TTL Flash. </li></ul>

    <h2>  The main differences from the FZ30 </h2><p>  If the previous model was a significant update of the FZ20 both inside and out, the changes in the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50 are more evolutionary than revolutionary, and apart from the new image sensor, they are mostly minor.  The main differences from the FZ30 model are as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  sensor resolution increased from 8.3 to 10.1 megapixels; </li><li>  TIFF format is not supported; </li><li>  next-generation graphics processor; </li><li>  maximum ISO sensitivity increased from 400 to 1600; </li><li>  flash sync appeared; </li><li>  screen resolution dropped to 207 thousand pixels; </li><li>  the display can rotate 180 ¬∞; </li><li>  Added support for SDHC; </li><li>  burst speed decreased from 3 to 2 fps, and the maximum number of frames from 7 to 5; </li><li>  Intelligent ISO function. </li></ul><h2>  Case design </h2><p>  Like the FZ30, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50 was created to look and work (as much as possible) like a traditional SLR camera.  A mechanical zoom with a liquid damper works faster and more accurately than an electric one, and gives a sensation of a quality that will make most DLSR lenses shame.  A few small but important changes were made to the control system (including the new Function button for quick access to such functions as sensitivity settings).  The combination of a deep grip and molded back recess for the thumb makes the FZ50 a very convenient camera.  And its stability is achieved through a balanced distribution of weight.  The large lens automatically becomes the handle for the left hand.  You can shoot with one hand, but the weight of the optics makes the camera a little unbalanced, and the camera trembles much less when supported by both. </p><p>  The model is available in black and silver. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50 battery is lithium-ion (7.2v, 710mAh), the same as its predecessor.  The battery is located inside the handle behind the spring-loaded cover.  Thanks to the energy-efficient Venus III engine and a lower-resolution screen, battery life has increased by almost a third to about 360 shots per charge. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Connectivity options </h2><p>  Above the battery compartment is an SD / MMC card slot.  Ports are grouped under a small spring-loaded lid on the side.  Here are a mini-USB port, which also works as an AV connector, and a socket for connecting a power adapter from the network.  An input for the DMW-RS1 remote control is also provided. </p><h2>  Flash </h2><p>  A fairly significant update was the support for TTL flash.  It is activated manually by a small switch on the left.  The flash is quite powerful and high - it protrudes about 4 cm from the top of the lens, which should minimize the red-eye effect.  With auto ISO, you can use the flash at distances from 30 cm to 7 m. Recharging is very fast.  The usual flash functionality is available - on, off, slow sync, red-eye reduction. </p>

    <h2>  Display and viewfinder </h2><p>  The FZ50 screen was a step back in resolution (from 230 to 207 thousand pixels), but this is invisible.  The display is bright, clear and easily changes position.  It seems a little better in low light, although it is difficult to see anything in bright direct sunlight.  The new Function button opens a mini-menu offering access to ISO, white balance, exposure metering and quality settings.  The main improvement was the versatility offered by the tilt and swivel mechanism.  The bottom screen is hinged and rotates 180 ¬∞, which allows you to shoot self-portraits. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  An electronic viewfinder (EVF) with a resolution of 230 thousand pixels and clear optics make it very convenient, and the new wider eye cup better prevents the penetration of extraneous light.  According to user reviews, this is not a full-fledged replacement for a bright specular viewfinder, but also not bad. </p>

    <h2>  Lens </h2><p>  The manufacturer focuses on a huge 12x optical zoom.  The lens is identical to the well-established FZ30 optics.  This is perhaps the only reason the FZ50 can compete with entry-level digital SLRs.  To cover the focal length range of 35-420 mm, using interchangeable lenses would be very expensive and cumbersome. </p><p>  The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50 zoom mechanism is considered by owners to be pleasant to use.  It works smoothly, quickly and accurately, and is complemented by a damped manual focus ring.  On the side of the lens is a large focus mode selector (auto, Macros AF and manual).  There is also a Focus button for quick activation of autofocus. </p><p>  In conjunction with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50, the manufacturer offers a petal hood that attaches directly to the lens.  It reduces glare in bright light, especially at the wide end of the zoom.  However, it should not be used constantly, as this may interfere with the AF focus in low light and block the flash at short distances to the subject. </p>

    <h2>  Controls </h2><p>  The FZ30 used front and rear mode dials for direct access to shutter speed and aperture settings.  In the FZ50, they can be configured for quick access to exposure compensation settings.  The four-way navigation bar has also changed.  Now there is a small key in the middle that acts as a Menu button.  The main control disk has replenished with the user mode Custom.  You can define up to 3 user sets.  Almost any camera setting is saved (from exposure to ISO, white balance, focus and metering to basic settings such as display format), which makes the model a powerful custom tool. </p><p>  The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50 looks like a serious camera and works the same, offering everything from compact scene modes to advanced manual controls with a high degree of customization.  Two drives provide direct access to aperture and shutter speed settings, and some features of the FZ50 bring the camera closer to real SLR cameras.  Panasonic seems to be the only company that listens to its users, as it introduced the Function button for quick access to white balance and ISO, which eliminated the need to constantly access the menu. </p><h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  All camera controls are located to the right of the 2-inch display.  Above is the AE lock, which also serves to lock focus, the viewfinder / display switch, screen, control buttons and delete.  A new function key copies the LX2 joystick button, displaying a mini-menu that provides quick access to metering, focus, white balance, ISO, image size and image quality.  Further on the right is a four-way navigation bar.  When shooting 3 out of 4 arrow keys, they perform functions of quick viewing of the last saved image, selection of flash mode and self-timer.  The upper arrow cyclically selects AE compensation, flash exposure compensation, AE bracketing, and an unusual white balance setting made in the form of a slider with 20 positions from ‚Äúredder‚Äù to ‚Äúmore blue‚Äù.  In the center is a new Set button. </p>

    <h2>  Top panel </h2><p>  This part resembles SLR cameras in style.  The shutter release is located on the large handle.  The main shooting controls are also here: choosing exposure mode and shutter operation. </p><h2>  <span>Panasonic</span> Lumix DMC-FZ50 photo camera: operating instructions </h2><p>  The camera has a clear and understandable menu system.  The preview screen in recording mode is completely free of any overlays or icons.  When you press the Display button, a simple grid appears for more convenient cropping.  The other extreme is viewing all the information, including a histogram that clutters the already pretty small screen.  If you need to get the most information, but nothing should interfere with the preview, it is better to choose the ‚Äúoff-frame‚Äù mode, designed to simulate a professional mirror viewfinder.  Pressing the shutter button halfway activates exposure calculation and focus, indicating which AF area to use, aperture and shutter speed are selected.  If the camera shakes too much, a warning is displayed.  In P mode, a neat program switching menu is displayed. </p><p>  Manual focus is relatively easy, given the screen resolution and the optional enlargement of the center of the frame.  The user can use the navigation keys to move the enlarged area. </p><p>  The function menu works the same as Canon.  The Function button brings up a mini-list of options, after which you can use the command dials to quickly change focus, metering, adjust white balance, ISO, image size and quality.  Settings are saved, which is a real boon for those who regularly change ISO or WB. </p><p>  There is a faster way to access exposure compensation.  To do this, just turn one of the disks (it can be set in the recording menu), and the AE compensation scale appears.  Pressing the up arrow cycles through exposure compensation, flash level, and AE bracketing.  Their values ‚Äã‚Äãcan be changed using the command dials.  Fine-tuning the white balance has moved to the shooting menu. </p><p>  In manual mode, the command dials change shutter speed and aperture.  Custom allows you to store 3 sets of user settings, covering almost all aspects of the camera. </p><p>  The mode switch now has only one SCN position, and the second is used for Custom.  In total, 16 scenes are provided.  As with all recent Lumix cameras, they are all accompanied by brief descriptions. </p>

    <h2>  Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50: menu overview </h2><p>  The five-page list of settings includes options such as white balance, sensitivity, image size and quality, metering and focusing modes, and image settings.  Here you can find the unique Flip Animation feature that turns a series of photos into a QuickTime movie. </p><p>  The three-page viewing menu offers the usual set of print, delete, protect and slide show settings.  You can add sound to saved files, as well as change their size or aspect ratio.  Here you can format the card.  As in the recording mode, when viewing the user selects the amount of information displayed - from its absence to the complete data and histogram. </p><p>  If you turn the front control dial to the left, 9 thumbnails will be displayed on the screen.  Frame numbering and menu bar are disabled by the Disp button.  You can ‚Äúzoom out‚Äù and see 25 thumbnails and the date of the picture at the same time.  Turning the dial to the right increases the image you are viewing.  There are only 4 zoom steps (16x, 8x, 4x and 2x), but they work very fast.  Navigation keys allow you to scroll through larger frames. </p><p>  The setup menu is accessible from both viewing and shooting modes, and contains 4 pages of basic camera settings from monitor brightness and automatic viewing to power management, sound settings, date and time. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50, as a rule, is not inferior to its predecessor.  The camera is responsive and rarely keeps itself waiting.  High-speed focus works brilliantly (the only drawback is that the on-screen sight during focusing freezes for a split second, but you can put up with this).  The measured shutter lag (about 0.07 s) seems to be much higher than the 0.009 s indicated in the Panasonic press release.  This is due to the fact that the display has a slight lag by a split second.  The actual shutter lag is less than 0.01 s, but since there is no optical viewfinder, this is a moot point.  The only performance disappointment is that the continuous mode, although pretty decent, is not as good as the FZ30 because of the larger files. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  <span>Panasonic</span> Lumix DMC-FZ50 <span>camera</span> user reviews are called one of the most equipped and convenient ‚Äúbridge cameras‚Äù of 2006, which under good conditions provides excellent image quality.  This is a useful and enjoyable tool that offers a compact solution for those who want to get a huge zoom range without changing the lens.  True, we have to compromise.  Lubrication of delicate, low-contrast parts is a hallmark of Venus III.  According to the owners, serious shots are possible only at low ISO.  For many, this is an acceptable compromise, but instead of increasing the number of pixels, users would like to see an increase in image quality.  The camera allows you to take great pictures, but only when the sensitivity does not exceed ISO 200. </p>
