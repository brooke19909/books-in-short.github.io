There were reports <span>that such objects</span> were seen in Germany, Italy, on the Mediterranean coast.  One of the articles was written by an expert in the field of aviation and was of particular interest.  Such notes were followed by a rebuttal by the authorities, who claimed that no such discus was found.  Of course, many suspected that these statements were implausible. </p><h2>  "Fau 7" - a flying disk of the Third Reich </h2><p>  Someone named Mite Richard claimed that there were similar devices, and this was confirmed.  He said that 10 years ago, Germany set about implementing the V-7 project.  However, the exact location of the laboratories and other details were not known.  The publication of the book ‚ÄúGerman Weapons and the Secret <span>Weapons of the Second World War</span> and Their Further Development‚Äù only fueled the scandal and rumors surrounding flying saucer-like objects.  Her translation was carried out in many languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world.  According to some versions, the Fau 7 (flying disk) could be made in Siberia, and the inventor could be the Austrian Schauberger (despite his talent as a brilliant designer, he was a patient of the clinic for mentally ill people). </p>

    <h2>  Base in Antarctica </h2><p>  There are many versions that a laboratory is hidden under the Antarctic ice, where these flying objects can be hidden.  The first mention of this theory appeared in Landing's novels.  However, according to the original version, the location of the laboratory was in Northern Canada.  Perhaps the author decided that Antarctica is a more reliable shelter, and there most likely a Fau 7 flying saucer could be hidden.  Despite the frivolous attitude of many to these theories, some to this day are trying to solve the mystery of the location of the laboratory among the ice.  These ideas were also fueled by the fact that there were speculations about the prepared German base in Antarctica, where the learned minds of Germany were brought, and where Hitler himself later planned to take refuge in case of an unfavorable outcome of the war. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Tests in Peenemuende </h2><p>  The Peenemuende training ground has become another ‚Äúhigh-profile‚Äù place associated with finding German UFOs.  Some claimed that it was here that these <span>aircraft</span> were built <span>,</span> and it was also a favorable place for the first tests.  There wasn‚Äôt enough manpower, and on the initiative of General Dorberger, prisoners from the concentration camp began to be attracted.  One of them witnessed the events taking place at the training ground.  He claimed to have seen a round apparatus that was similar in shape to an inverted pelvis.  In its center was a transparent drop-shaped cabin. </p><p>  At startup, the device made a hissing sound and vibrated.  The former prisoner of the camp saw with his own eyes how the object rose into the air and hung at a distance of 5 meters from the ground.  For some time, the UFO held this position, and then spun around and began to gain height.  During the flight, instability was noted.  Gusts of wind acted very strongly on him, and one of them turned the plate in the air, which led to a decrease in the apparatus.  According to him, <span>this test</span> failed, the plate exploded, and the pilot died.  Also, information about a similar facility was obtained from nineteen officers and soldiers.  They claimed they saw an object in flight that looked like a plate with a transparent cockpit in the center.  Scientists concluded that this device is Zimmermann‚Äôs ‚ÄúFlying Pancake‚Äù.  This object was designed in 1942 and had a speed of 700 km per hour with horizontal flight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Flying Saucer</span> "Fau 7" </h2><p>  German engineers developed several UFO models, each time improving the design and adding new solutions.  The first modification was called "V-7."  Its development was carried out as part of the Weapon of Retribution program.  This unit had more fuel and a more powerful engine.  To stabilize the plate in flight, a <span>steering mechanism</span> was used similar to the one that is present on the plane.  The first tests were carried out in 1944 (May 17) near Prague.  ‚ÄúV-7‚Äù possessed excellent technical characteristics - ascent speed of 288 km per hour and horizontal movement of 200 km per hour. </p>

    <h2>  Cymbal models </h2><p>  Until now, information has been preserved about the existence of eight projects.  The first of them was named "Wheel with a Wing" and was tested in 1941.  It is considered the first object in the world that could take off vertically.  After the "Fau 7" appeared modification "Discolet".  Her test took place in 1945.  In subsequent years, the Belontse Disk appeared.  This was an even more advanced model.  The designers of this unit were Belonze, Mite, Sriver and Schauberger.  A model with a diameter of 68 meters was available in a single copy.  In the engine, the consumed air was compressed, the emission of which was then carried out through nozzles.  The flying object was equipped with an anti-jamming control system, which is supposed to have been developed by Schauberger since the beginning of World War II. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Jet aircraft and rocket science of the Third Reich, no doubt, received a big push and development during the Second World War.  However, the new developments of the Germans were late.  The most modernized "saw the light" at the end of the war.  When the ‚ÄúWeapon of Retribution‚Äù was created, the need for it disappeared.  Those projects that were ahead of their creation time (bombers, fighters, etc.), as well as V-7, the flying Reich 3, were often in one copy and did not have time to strike - the war was already over.  Anticipating their defeat, the Germans destroyed the laboratories, the ranges at which UFOs were tested.  Part of the documentation also disappeared, and flying objects themselves disappeared.  However, thanks to the speed of the offensive of the Red Army, a lot went to the winners.  At the end of the war, these materials were supportive when working on aviation projects. </p>
