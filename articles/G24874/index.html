    <h2>  Distinctive features of 5 * hotels </h2><p>  According to the criteria of the world <span>classification of hotels</span> and hotel complexes, <span>5 *</span> seaside <span>hotels</span> should be located on the first beach line and have their own beach.  They must have the following infrastructure: </p><ul><li>  gym and spa (with sauna and massage room); </li><li>  pools (it is desirable, both open, and indoor, and children's, and adult); </li><li>  lobby and snack bar; </li><li>  several chic restaurants with a large selection of dishes not only local but also European cuisine; </li><li>  a large sports area, including tennis courts, golf, basketball, volleyball, indoor soccer, etc. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="elysium cyprus" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/468270.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  In addition, many five-star hotels belong to the global hotel brands, and they usually order household items (bathrobes, slippers, hygiene products, etc.) to famous brands.  Hotel Elysium (Cyprus) belongs to the global hotel chain Great Hotels Of The World.  The administration orders the household items to the Italian brand Bulgari. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel "Elysium 5 *" </h2><p>  On Paphos - the most elite Cypriot resort - the best five-star hotels of the island are concentrated.  However, the hotel complex Elysium 5 * can be considered the most advanced and, as a consequence, the most expensive of them.  Although, you must admit, not always a high price speaks about quality.  However, when it comes to this gigantic hotel complex, hardly anyone will doubt the quality of its services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="elysium hotel" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/468268.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  In this fashionable hotel, tourists will find a combination of style and luxury, comfort and reliability, excellent service and a helpful attitude, care and hospitality.  It offers both comfortable apartments and chic villas.  The days spent in this hotel remain in the memory of each of the vacationers for a long time.  Especially like here the newlyweds who spend their honeymoon in the walls of the Elysium 5 * hotel.  After all, this attitude of tourists is special here.  For example, upon crossing the threshold of their chic room, the newlyweds immediately see a beautifully made bed, a bottle of champagne and a vase of fruit and chocolate, candles, etc. Caring staff tries to turn every day of their stay at the hotel into a real holiday.  By the way, you can also organize a wedding here.  At the same time, the administration of Elysium Hotel 5 * will take care of all the arrangements for holding this celebration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="elysium hotel cyprus" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/468266.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  This hotel complex is located on the first beach line of Paphos, 30 kilometers from the city airport, where you can fly by direct regular or charter flight from Moscow and other major cities of Russia.  The hotel administration meets its guests right at the airport terminal and delivers luxury cars to the Elysium hotel.  Paphos is an elite resort, and therefore such an attitude towards the guests here is in the order of things.  In addition, this ancient city is the center of various historical monuments.  So, not far from the hotel (25 km) are the Tombs of the Greek kings - one of the main attractions of the city. </p><p>  Of the modern facilities near the complex are various shops, bank branches and shopping centers.  Paphos is a small town.  The main population of the city totals no more than 40 thousand people.  Nevertheless, the infrastructure is well developed here, and the city authorities made sure that the guests of the city, and they mainly belong to the category of wealthy people (VIP), did not experience any inconvenience in Paphos.  The administration of the Elysium 5 * hotel, in turn, is taking all steps to provide its guests with the highest quality service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="elysium paphos" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/468269.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that the hotel consists only of suites that have balconies with sea views.  However, there are rooms that are classified as superior.  These are luxurious royal apartments, as well as luxury villas with private gardens and pools.  All 250 rooms of the Elysium Hotel are adapted for families with children.  The interior uses high-quality natural materials, elegant decor elements that give the premises a luxurious look.  The cost of living in a hotel, depending on the category of the room, varies from 10,000 to 15,000 thousand rubles per day.  True, expensive?  That is the reality.  <span>Holidays in Cyprus</span> (prices for accommodation and hotel services) are very expensive.  However, this does not affect the island's popularity as the best beach resort in the whole Mediterranean. </p><h2>  Room Amenities </h2><p>  As noted above, this hotel provides everything to the smallest detail for a good rest of the most demanding guests.  Next, we present to your attention a list of amenities, as well as a list of services provided to guests by members of the hotel team. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays cyprus prices" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/468267.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  So, in all rooms there are the following amenities: </p><ul><li>  luxurious spacious bathroom with a jacuzzi, shower, a full range of bath accessories and cosmetics, a hairdryer, etc .; </li><li>  a well-equipped balcony or terrace with sea or park views; </li><li>  personal air conditioning system; </li><li>  central heating; </li><li>  direct dial telephone; </li><li>  satellite television and plasma television; </li><li>  minibar with drinks; </li><li>  safe box etc </li></ul><p>  As for the service, the hotel offers round-the-clock room service;  butler or butler service, laundry and dry cleaning services, etc. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that <span>5 * Cyprus hotels,</span> unlike Turkish ones, practically do not work on an all-inclusive basis.  Each of the visitors can choose what type, and in which of the six restaurants to eat.  According to the reviews of some Russian tourists, the menu in the restaurants can‚Äôt be called diverse, however, all the dishes offered, both Greek and European, are expertly prepared and have excellent taste.  Dinners are always themed and take place outdoors in the park, among the trees with lit garlands of light bulbs.  In the hotel's snack bar you can always enjoy cocktails and a varied snack, while at the pools you can enjoy fresh fruits and cold drinks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus hotels 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/468265.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Pools </h2><p>  In the very center of the hotel‚Äôs garden and park zone there is a multi-level pool of an original form with a hydromassage.  As noted above, for guests of the villas in the park there is a separate pool where guests of the central building are not allowed.  For little vacationers there is a special <span>children's pool with slides.</span> </p><h2>  Hotel Facilities </h2><p>  And here is the full list of services that vacationers on the hotel can receive: </p><ul><li>  parking; </li><li>  round-the-clock doctor services; </li><li>  the shops; </li><li>  currency exchange point; </li><li>  wireless Internet; </li><li>  luxury car rental; </li><li>  conference room and meeting room; </li><li>  business center, etc. </li></ul><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Hotel Elysium is mainly designed for a respectable and quiet holiday.  Therefore, on its territory you can hardly find a lot of noisy entertainment.  Of course, in the evenings there is a disco and animation is arranged, but those tourists who cannot imagine their vacation without loud fun later complain about it in their reviews.  The situation is aggravated by the fact that this hotel is located far from the city center, where you can have fun.  But there is a wonderful library. </p>

    <p>  Sports enthusiasts can work out in the gym, play tennis, do aerobics, etc. And the spa center operating at the hotel will provide everyone with a full range of spa and beauty treatments.  As for children's entertainment, there are not so many of them - a club and a pool.  Therefore, kids here are often uninteresting and bored.  This can also be read in the reviews of dissatisfied tourists from Russia, who unanimously reiterate that this hotel, and Paphos itself, is not at all suitable for children </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  The beach of the Elysium Hotel is a weak link in this luxury hotel.  It is very tiny and uncomfortable, so most vacationers prefer to use the luxurious pool.  However, the beach is well equipped, and therefore those who can not imagine a vacation without the sea may well, having closed their eyes not some inconvenience, use it.  There are sun loungers, umbrellas, a bridge for safe entry into the sea, various water activities: scooter, diving, water skiing, banana, parachute, catamaran, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="elysium 5" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/468264.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Rest in a five-star hotel Elysium 5 * will give tourists a lot of positive emotions and impressions.  However, people with an active position, as well as families with children, are better off choosing another hotel that is more suitable for this. </p>
