Such a number of monuments, sights, museums and theaters are not found in any other place in the world.  The city replaced three names for its short-lived (by historical standards) life, and became the cradle of three revolutions.  Built in a swamp, in impassable forests, it sparkled like a diamond, illuminating with its light the history of a great state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg Zoological Museum" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/393956.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The most of the most </h2><p>  The adjective "the most" fits the Northern capital of Russia.  It is not only the most beautiful, here are the most famous theaters, the largest museums.  And if you are interested in flora and fauna, you can plunge headlong into the wonderful world of nature, and the wonderful city of St. Petersburg will help in this.  The Zoological Museum is an amazing place where the secrets of the universe are revealed. </p><h2>  St. Petersburg: Zoological Museum (history of creation) </h2><p>  This institution, like many others, began its existence with the light hand of Peter I. The museum was founded in 1714.  At first it was a Kunstkamera, for which they collected a small collection of outlandish animals.  Interesting exhibits are constantly replenished.  By 1832, there were so many of them, they were of such scientific value that the Kunstkamera was given the status of a museum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zoological Museum in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/395188.jpg?1399952687488" width="600"></div>  And it became known as the Zoological Museum of the Imperial Academy of Sciences.  Six years later, it was opened to visitors.  The first director of the unique institution was Academician F.F. Brant, who made a significant contribution to the creation of the museum fund.  Many scholars gave their collections - this is A. Middendorf, and C. Baer.  Such legendary discoverers as Miklouho-Maclay and Nikolai Przhevalsky constantly brought more and more exhibits from their expeditions.

In 1896, the museum moved to the building of the southern warehouse of the Exchange.  Five years were needed in order to equip new premises and prepare expositions. </p><p>  In 1901, the Zoological Museum in St. Petersburg was inaugurated.  The ceremony was attended by Nicholas II himself and his family members.  After the revolution, in 1930, the museum became part of the Zoological Institute of the <span>Russian Academy of Sciences.</span> </p><p>  It should be noted that in essence it is still a laboratory in which research is conducted in the field of biology and zoology.  At present, the Institute‚Äôs exhibition department includes two biostations, twelve laboratories, a huge library and its own information and publishing department. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zoological Museum in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/393954.jpg?1399816508719" width="500"></div>

Attention is also drawn to the skeleton of a <span>woolly mammoth</span> and the southern elephant found in Kolyma, on the banks of the Berezovka river.  No less interesting are the remains of mammals that inhabited the earth in the fortieth century BC. </p><h2>  Opening hours and address </h2><p>  The institution is located on the University Embankment, building 1.
