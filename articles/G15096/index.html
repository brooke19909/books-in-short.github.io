It has existed for a very long time, since those times when there was no concept of a mobile bank and ATMs.  Employee notes on the passbook pages served customers as a bank statement.  Until now, this tool is in demand among the population, although more and more people prefer plastic cards, as it is more convenient than standing in line for a bank employee.  Therefore, many customers are wondering how to transfer money from a passbook to a card.  It is pretty simple. </p><h2>  Transfer from a savings book in a bank office </h2><p>  Money can be transferred from a savings book to a Sberbank card using the following tools: </p><ul><li>  At a branch of Sberbank with the help of an operator. </li><li>  Through an ATM. </li><li>  Through a personal account on the website of Sberbank. </li><li>  Using a mobile bank. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank online card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65594/2149278.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  To take advantage of the operator‚Äôs help in the department, you need to bring a savings book, card, passport with you to the bank‚Äôs office, get in line and inform the employee about your desire.  If the transfer is made to the card of another holder, then you must have all the necessary details with you.  This method is gradually becoming a thing of the past, remaining relevant for older generation customers who do not know another method of transferring money from a passbook to a card.  Often they simply do not trust technology. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to make a transfer at an ATM </h2><p>  How to transfer money from a passbook to a card at an ATM?  The question is simple.  Upon receipt of a plastic card, the client binds it at an ATM to Internet banking.  Thus, the card holder gains access to your personal account.  If at the same time he owns a savings book, then the current account is automatically reflected in the personal account of the client. </p>
