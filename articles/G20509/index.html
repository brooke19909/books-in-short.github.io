Caterpillar has long gained popularity in the construction machinery industry.  Its trucks, excavators, tractors, construction clothing and shoes are made of high quality materials that can withstand hours of hard work.  Most recently, the company began manufacturing fully protected smart phones, which are not afraid of drops, dust and water.  The latest smartphones of 2014 from this manufacturer are mainly designed for athletes, travelers, <span>mining workers</span> and builders.  <span>Protected phones</span> pass mandatory tests, during which the devices are dropped from a height of two meters, mixed with concrete and placed under running water for a while.  After the tests, the experts turn on the smartphone and demonstrate to everyone who is interested the full working capacity of the mobile device.  <span>Caterpillar CAT</span> B15Q is an improved version of the previous model, which was previously introduced by the same company.  In appearance, both devices are not much different, except that in the last released smartphone there is a built-in flashlight.  If you compare both devices by filling, it turns out that the new smartphones with the Q index are much superior to their younger brothers.  The latest model has increased productivity due to the quad-core processor and a built-in RAM capacity of 1 GB.  The designers of the company tried to make the smartphone attractive and functional for users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Confession </h2><p>  The smartphone has all the necessary international quality certificates, including protection against dust, vibration, high temperatures and immersion in water.  Even if your device falls from a height of up to two meters, this will not damage its internal filling, the device will function as before.  In terms of endurance, virtually no new smartphones from other manufacturers are able to compete with this device.  The appearance of the device is rude and aggressive, the design is suitable for real men. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Caterpillar CAT B15Q: proportional reviews </h2><p>  Despite the rather modest screen size, the case itself has quite impressive dimensions, which are 69.5 x 125 x 14.95 mm.  Due to the lack of metal elements, the mobile device has a relatively small weight of 170 grams.  Almost the entire body is made of plastic, and there are aluminum inserts on the sides. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The front panel is completely covered with protective glass, which is framed by a wide frame, which stands out a little on the surface.  At the top of the Caterpillar CAT B15Q mobile device, there is a slot in the center for the earpiece, on the left there is a smartphone logo, and on the right you can see miniature sensors for proximity and backlighting, as well as a front camera lens.  There is no separate panel for notifications.  Immediately below the display are the familiar touch keys of the latest open applications, the Back and Home buttons.  There is a small microphone hole on the right side of the function keys.  For greater visibility, all the buttons on the side panels are yellow.  The power button is located on the right on the upper side panel, and in the center there is a connector for connecting the charger and adapter.  On the right side there is a button on and off the camera and flashlight, as well as a rocker for adjusting the volume.  Under the plug on the right side, there is a connector for a <span>micro USB cable.</span>  On the back are a noise canceling microphone, a main camera lens, a flash and a small speaker grill.  In the center is the logo of the company, and in the lower part there is a latch for securely locking the cover of the mobile device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Ease </h2><p>  If we continue talking about the features of the Caterpillar CAT B15Q, user reviews confirm that the smartphone is very comfortable to hold in your hand, despite its external bulkiness.  This factor contributes to the low weight, which is not typical for such protected devices.  It is not so easy to accidentally drop a smartphone from your hands, due to its rough surface the device is reliably located in your hand.  Fingerprints on the device are invisible, and he is not afraid of spots, because they do not stand out on the surface.  The power button is not very well placed, if you hold the smartphone with one hand, it is simply impossible to reach it.  Also a minus is the fact that the power key does not protrude on the surface of the device, and for its functioning you need to strongly press on it.  All function keys are made of plastic, unlike the case, they do not have sufficient grip.  Only the middle button on the right panel of the smartphone helps out, when you click on it, the display lights up, the mobile device turns on to work.  A long press on this key activates a flashlight, a separate menu for which is not provided.  When you press the volume control button, it has a clear and short stroke. </p>

    <h2>  Production </h2><p>  Rugged smartphones should always have a reliable and high-quality build; the CAT B15Q is no exception.  During the use of the mobile device, no backlashes, creaks and other external confirmations of poor-quality assembly were found.  If you need to remove the back cover, for this you need to move the latch in its lower part, after which the cover will begin to detach upward.  Putting it back is much more difficult, but over time you can deal with it.  Under the back cover is a removable battery and 2 slots for the main and additional SIM cards.  A quick change will not work, as there is no separate connector on the side panel.  For secure mobile devices, this is the norm, the lack of such an opportunity cannot be considered a disadvantage.  All present connectors for connecting additional devices are reliably recessed into a smartphone and covered with special plugs for greater reliability.  Accessories with a small plug simply do not reach the contacts, it is preferable to use headphones, a USB cable provided in the kit.  Try to use them very carefully, because it is very difficult to find a replacement. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The screen has a four-inch IPS-matrix with a resolution of 800 x 480 mm.  The touch screen supports up to ten taps at the same time, is capacitive, with multi-touch.  The functionality also has automatic backlight control and light sensors.  Viewing angles in a mobile device are good enough, but not record-breaking.  The color rendering is average, at first glance at the screen, the shades seem a little dull, but over time the eyes get used to it.  Image distortion is present at the bottom and top when the screen is rotated.  Due to the small size of the matrix, a modest screen resolution does not cause any inconvenience.  Fingerprints sometimes remain, but they can easily be removed from the display.  The smartphone works great even in direct sunlight.  The backlight is adjustable, it is comfortable to browse files or read in dim lighting or in the dark.  The touchscreen works without delay, there are no complaints about it.  If you compare an ordinary smartphone and Caterpillar CAT B15Q, then the screen is not very high quality, but for a secure device it is very good, and it allows you to work in almost any environment. </p>

    <h2>  Shooting </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with two cameras: the front at 0.3 megapixels and the main at 5 megapixels.  Home has autofocus and flash.  You can turn on the camera quickly by double-clicking on the right sidebar button.  The front sensor is more suitable for video calls on a mobile device than for shooting.  In daylight conditions, the main camera does its job well.  The only negative is the loss of small details and poor sharpness on the sides of the image.  If you need clear shots, always use the flash.  The maximum allowable video resolution is 1280 x 720. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Caterpillar <span>CAT B15Q</span> is a typical representative of protective devices.  For users of such smartphones, simplicity and reliability are more important, rather than an ultra-high-quality screen and huge performance.  In general, the communicator copes with its duties very well.  The last thing worth noting about the Caterpillar CAT B15Q, the price for it starts from 15 000 rubles, but it can be significantly higher depending on the conditions of sale. </p><p>  In conclusion, we will analyze the feedback from buyers of the communicator - people who have used it for a long time and know about all the pros and cons.  Among the negative aspects, they often note low autonomy, unjustified prices, and greater thickness.  There is also dissatisfaction with the lack of permanent memory and the fact that for this manufacturer the production of <span>telephones is not</span> the main direction, which means that insufficient attention can be paid to it.  We will not retell positive reviews, since the strengths were discussed above. </p>
