    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Almost all tourists were satisfied with their apartments in this hotel.  So, according to them, the rooms here are spacious, with freshly renovated and pleasantly decorated.  As in many modern <span>hotels in Vietnam,</span> there is no full wall between the bathroom and the living room, but there is only a glass partition with shutters.  Many of our compatriots are somewhat surprised by this design decision.  However, this does not cause any problems, since you can always close the blinds. </p><p>  The guests liked the comfortable modern furniture.  According to travelers, there are very large and comfortable beds.  The tourists also had no complaints about the technology.  The vacationers considered the opportunity to use wireless Internet both in rooms and throughout the rest of the Muong Thanh Nha Trang Center Hotel to be a big plus.  Moreover, Wi-Fi is free, and the connection speed is very good. </p><p>  As for the minuses, some guests complained about the lack of balconies in the apartments.  Therefore, wet things sometimes they had to dry on chairs and armchairs.  However, experienced travelers claim that this feature is characteristic of most hotels in Nha Trang.  So in this city it will be difficult to find a modern hotel with balconies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, some vacationers complained that they were somewhat disturbed by the noise from the construction site in the neighborhood.  The fact is that a new hotel is being built here.  At night, construction work is stopped, so you will not be disturbed during sleep.  However, if you decide to relax in the room during the day, then noise may disturb you.  Therefore, tourists are advised to capture earplugs just in case.  In addition, our compatriots claim that the construction is being carried out at a fairly fast pace, so it is likely that the construction of the hotel will be completed soon, and nothing will disturb the guests of neighboring hotels. </p>

    <h2>  Cleaning service </h2><p>  Judging by the comments of tourists, the work of the maids at the Muong Thanh Nha Trang Center 5 * hotel (Nha Trang) did not cause much excitement among vacationers.  According to our compatriots, cleaning was carried out at a rather mediocre level.  So, the maids threw garbage every day, added bath accessories as needed, brought drinking water, made beds, updated towels.  However, vacuuming and washing the floors in the rooms here is irregular.  In fairness, it is worth noting that experienced travelers claim that this situation is typical for the vast majority of hotels in Vietnam.  Therefore, it does not make sense to be particularly upset about this. </p><p>  Tourists, during whose stay at this hotel had their birthday or wedding date, are pleased to note in the reviews that the administration did not forget to congratulate them and presented a compliment in the form of a small delicious cake. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  When booking accommodation at Muong Thanh Nha Trang Center <span>Hotel (Vietnam, Nha Trang),</span> you can choose the most suitable food option for you - only breakfast, half board or full board.  I must say that most of our compatriots chose to stay on the first option.  Therefore, most hotel reviews affect only breakfast.  So, according to the guests, in the mornings in the hotel restaurant it was possible to eat plenty of tasty and high-quality dishes and products.  So, the buffet always had dishes of both Vietnamese and European cuisine.  Vacationers could always taste delicious soups, perfectly cooked meat, fried eggs, omelettes, boiled eggs, sausages, cheeses, pastries, fruits and vegetables, fresh juice, tea, coffee, yogurt and much more.  Tourists note that the breakfast menu has always been very diverse. </p><p>  During the day, many guests preferred eating outside the Muong Thanh Nha Trang Center Hotel.  Moreover, there are a lot of cafes and restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel, offering a variety of dishes for every taste and budget.  Those who decided to have lunch and dinner at the hotel also, according to them, did not regret it.  According to them, the cooking here is very tasty. </p>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  An indisputable advantage of this hotel is its proximity to the sea.  So, to get to the beach, guests only need to leave the hotel and cross the road.  The beach here is large, fine sand.  The hotel offers guests free sunbeds and umbrellas.  True, their number is limited, so experienced tourists are advised to come to the sea early to have time to take a deck chair. </p>
