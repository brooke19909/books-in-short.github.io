During this period, rains are raging here.  Other places on the Black or Mediterranean coast will be suitable for relaxing on the beach, since during this period there is a "velvet" season.  But lovers of outdoor activities are just waiting here.  The sea is very favorable for surfing.  It is possible to catch the wave and enjoy the water extreme in September.

Bad weather lasts about 18 days.  Half of them are quite clear and warm.  Since the resort is close to the equator, almost all year the ratio of day to night is the same, that is, the average day lasts 12 hours. </p><p>  What time of year you would not come, it is almost always very hot here, so when choosing a hotel, you need to pay attention to the availability of air conditioning.  In September, the air temperature averages +31 in the afternoon, +26 at night.  Of course, there are days when a thermometer in the shade can show +35. </p><p>  For lovers of walks in the rain, it may seem that this weather is not entirely scary.  But keep in mind that in early autumn the average rainfall in the aisles is 180 mm, which can drop a little more than 10 days.  Sometimes rainy weather can last more than 20 days.  At such a time, it is better, of course, not to leave the hotel.  If you decide to go for a walk, stock up on a raincoat and rubber boots. </p><p>  Even if you expect that the <span>Gulf of Thailand is</span> always warm (average water temperature +29 degrees Celsius), then you are unlikely to be able to enjoy his arms, as the water is very dirty and muddy.  Visiting the beach in rainy weather is better not worth it. </p><p>  In principle, Pattaya in September is suitable for recreation, but before the trip it is better to familiarize yourself with the weather conditions and stock up on necessary things. </p><p>  It is also advisable to pre-determine the place of residence.  In Pattaya, a huge number of decent hotels, one of which is the Twin Palms Resort 3 *. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel Description </h2>

    <h2>  The impression of tourists about the rest in the city </h2><p>  To Pattaya, you need to deliberately go to the rainy season.  So, in the city of Bangkok, it can drip a little, while in Pattaya it‚Äôs ‚Äúflooded like a bucket‚Äù.  But it is also possible that throughout the rest you will not even notice that it was raining.  If the weather turns bad at night, then until the morning there may not be a trace from the past bad weather. </p><p>  Due to the intense heat, it may seem that in some places, especially in the drain pits, there is an unpleasant odor.  But due to the fact that a large variety of tropical flowers grows around the hotel and in the hotel itself, the smell is simply not felt. </p><p>  In the rainy season, many complain about the dirty sea and the coast.  After a long rainfall and a strong storm, the water naturally becomes cloudy.  From extreme heat in any pond, fish can be washed ashore, which is also not entirely pleasant.  But this happens at every resort.  Of course, employees of beaches and hotels try to put everything in order, but you can not argue with nature. </p><p>  The streets may seem rather dirty.  After showers and holidays, and in Pattaya this is a frequent occurrence, of course, there can be a lot of garbage.  Janitors work all day tirelessly.  The staff of each hotel clean the area daily, trying for their guests.  Not all locals and tourists are tidy people, they can leave trash behind themselves.  In general, Pattaya is very clean and well maintained, each street has its own landscape, and the presence of numerous cafes makes this place unforgettable. </p><p>  A lot of parents worry, is it possible to relax here with the children?  Of course you can!  But there is one caveat.  In the country, 3 sexes are recognized, but this does not strike the eye.  After a couple of days, you don‚Äôt even pay attention to these people.  Many people walk along the main streets with children and do not feel fear or discomfort.  There are lots of places where you can go with your child to have fun and dinner.  Walking with children on a trance show is naturally not recommended. </p><h2>  Guest Reviews </h2>

    <p>  Choosing a hotel is always a very responsible decision.  The location should be close to the main streets and the beach.  I want it to be clean and comfortable.  If you chose the Twin Palms Resort 3 * hotel, you will not regret it, as it is very conveniently located.  Everything you need for relaxation, you have: a small local bazaar, a shopping store and center, entertainment venues, massage parlors and beaches.  Almost everywhere you can walk, if you are too lazy, you should use a taxi.  It costs only 10 baht per person. </p><p>  Near the hotel Twin Palms Resort Pattaya 3 * there are two beaches.  The rooms are simple but comfortable and everything you need is there.  All devices are working.  The main plus is a working air conditioner.  The TV shows two Russian channels, if it becomes boring, which is unlikely, then you can watch it.  If you need an urgent cleaning of the room, you will quickly arrange it. </p><p>  Twin Palms Resort Pattaya 3 * hotel is built so that everyone can find a comfortable place to relax.  The staff will help you to choose a comfortable room for you with all the necessary amenities.  The hotel is always quiet and calm, you can sleep well in the morning.  A lot of couples and adequate guests. </p><p>  Breakfast may seem monotonous, but for Thai cuisine what you need.  Fans of a good meal can order a separate meal or have breakfast on the way to the beach in any restaurant.  Twin Palms Resort (Pattaya) has two clean, well-kept pools.  On the branches you can see small living creatures, and geckos can crawl along the walls and catch midges.  But this does not bother, but even to some extent touches. </p>

    <p>  Our tourists always speak positively about other foreigners visiting Twin Palms Resort.  Often here you can observe groups of tourists from China who are transported to the islands.  They behave very decently and quietly.  The inhabitants of India are a little strange people, they can not always agree with other nationalities.  But this is not the main thing in a vacation in Pattaya.  If you do not want to spoil your impression, just enjoy your companies and personal relaxation. </p><p>  According to most guests, the main advantage of the Twin Palms Resort 3 * hotel is its location.  Everything else is at a decent level.  Hospitable and high-quality service, comfortable clean rooms, well-groomed territory.  But all this is in other hotels in Pattaya.  But it is difficult to find such infrastructure as in Twin Palms Resort 3 *.  Reviews of tourists who have visited several hotels in Pattaya, argue that this value for money must still be sought.  Many people opt for this hotel and come here regularly. </p><h2>  On a tour </h2><p>  Tourists very often use the services of a guide or travel in groups to look at interesting places.  There are sightseeing tours of famous places.  Travelers are advised to visit <span>Nong Nooch</span> or Khao Kheo - simply incredible places. </p><h2>  Nong Nooch Park </h2><p>  You can safely go there by public transport or taxi.  All types of transportation are very comfortable. </p><p>  These are incredible emotions, you can stay there at least the whole day, and it will seem that you have not yet bypassed everything.  Amazing plant shapes, well-groomed streets, statues and monuments.  A delightful performance of elephants and horses.  The price for all this is about 1000 baht. </p><h2>  Khao Kheo </h2><p>  A visit costs 750 baht per person.  This is a wonderful zoo with various animals that you can contact and take pictures with.  And the local statues will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  Locals recommend visiting Chatuchak in Bangkok.  The market is so large that it is very difficult to get around it without knowing the terrain.  It is also worth going to the local mall for fun.  Various street festivals and festivals are very impressive.  It would be regrettable, but there are so many who want to cash in on tourists and try to sell everything more expensive, so be careful and look at the prices. </p><h2>  Tourist note </h2><p>  Also, do not forget about precautions on the beach, the weather is very deceiving.  It seems like a prolonged sky and rain begins, but you can burn it instantly, a very burning sun.  You need to stock up with protective creams, and be sure to treat the skin after tanning.  If you, of course, have forgotten or still hoped that it does not threaten you, you can be saved by local <span>aloe vera.</span>  Or look into Thai pharmacies.  Medications are very high quality and inexpensive.  Foreigners, like in a supermarket, go here with baskets. </p><p>  The restaurants serve excellent dishes, even chicken will be prepared in a special way.  For example, TomYam serves very interesting seafood dishes.  Quite an unusual taste, but not for everybody.  No less exotic dishes are also served at the Twin Palms Resort 3 * hotel.  Guest reviews will help with the selection. </p><p>  Locals sell all drinks with herbs, and not everyone can enjoy it.  But for the test, you can take something.  It also serves a very interesting dish - rice with mango and coconut sauce.  A wide variety of exotic fruits, everyone should definitely try it. </p><p>  Alcoholic drinks for everybody.  Soy cocktails are more for local, bottled - just yummy.  Children will surely enjoy juices.  Beer is no different from ours.  Very tasty rum, but incredibly strong, you can not drink a lot. </p><p>  Exotics, entertainment, but at the same time, peace and tranquility - all this includes Pattaya.  Twin Palms Resort 3 * is a wonderful place to sleep in a beautiful resort.  The main thing is to go in a good mood, and then the rest will be unforgettable. </p>
