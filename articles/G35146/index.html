Alfastrakhovaniye JSC confidently occupies a leading position among all competitors.  The company has permits to conclude contracts in 27 insurance directions.  Among a significant number of developed insurance rules, CASCO from Alfastrakhovanie attracts customers with its simplicity, various options, and quick payment.  Let's consider different options. </p><h2>  CASCO from "Alfa insurance" </h2><p>  Vehicle insurance, whether it is a car or motorcycle, a bus or a tractor, is voluntary.  The main insurance risks in which the insurer is liable are damage to the car, its theft or theft, as well as the complete destruction of vehicles.  The approved CASCO insurance rules offer to protect the property interests of the client of the company by concluding a car insurance contract. </p><p>  When concluding an insurance contract, CASCO Alfastrakhovanie guarantees insurance compensation if an accident occurs with the insured car.  Also, insurance cover will be valid in case of natural events, illegal actions of unauthorized persons, causing material damage to the car by any objects.  Based on the developed conditions, insurance compensation will be paid regardless of who is responsible for the emergency.  The main thing is that he be sober. </p><p>  The current CASCO insurance rules from Alfastrakhovanie are developed for different types of customers.  They take into account the driving experience of the insured, material capabilities, social status, number of cars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="destine-broker.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Casco insurance from Alfa insurance" class="if uuid-2576508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52023/2576508.jpg"></div><h2>  Casco "50 to 50" Alfa insurance </h2><p>  The full cost of the CASCO insurance contract very often scares away potential consumers of insurance products.  There are situations when a client wants to conclude an insurance agreement with a profile company, but the price becomes an obstacle.  For such cases, the rules from "Alfastrakhovanie" CASCO "50 to 50". </p><p>  In order not to overpay for insurance services, the company offers to pay half the amount of the insurance payment.  The main condition for the validity of such an agreement: upon the occurrence of an insurance event, the policyholder is obliged to make the second half of the contribution.  However, if the driver traveled without fail during the entire policy period, then he will save part of the payment. </p><h2>  Basic requirements for Casco ‚Äú50 to 50‚Äù </h2><p>  Based on the insurance rules of CASCO from Alfastrakhova, in order to take advantage of this program, there is a list of conditions, compliance with which is mandatory: </p><ul><li>  the age of persons who are entitled to drive this vehicle and specified in the insurance document may not be less than 25 years; </li><li>  driving experience of these persons must exceed five years; </li><li>  trouble-free history of driving a car. <div class="photo" data-original="destine-broker.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Casco 50 to 50 from Al insurance" class="if uuid-2576510" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52023/2576510.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  CASCO AlfaBUSINESS </h2><p>  Among the clients of the insurance company there are people who want to conclude a CASCO contract at full price, but there is a slight nuance.  Upon the occurrence of an insurance event, which is specified in the contract, the policyholder expects the fastest possible resolution of the issue of payment of insurance compensation.  However, he does not have time to collect various kinds of supporting documents from various organizations.  In such cases, employees offer CASCO AlfaBusiness.  According to these insurance policies of CASCO from Alfastrakhovanie, the payment is charged without any kinds of certificates and confirmations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pros and Cons of CASCO AlfaBusiness </h2><p>  The advantages of this insurance product include the absence of a limit on the number of calls to the insurer for insurance events.  Another positive element of this program is that the client of the company will receive insurance compensation in full for damaged headlights, windshield, rear or side windows.  Customer feedback on CASCO from Alfastrakhovanie suggests that such a product is quite popular among motorists. </p><p>  The disadvantages of the proposed program should include the limitation of insurance compensation to two accidents without providing certificates. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.consumeraffairs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Casco AlfaBusiness" class="if uuid-2576515" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52023/2576515.jpg"></div><h2>  CASCO "Alpha ALL INCLUSIVE" </h2><p>  For VIP-clients, the insurance company AlfaStrakhovanie has developed CASCO insurance rules with special conditions.  So, if there are some restrictions on the number of insurance events for AlfaBusiness that are issued without providing supporting documents, then for ALL INCLUSIVE, this is not the case.  Payment for the cost of damaged glass products and their replacement are carried out by the insurance company without references from the relevant organizations. </p><p>  Under this program, without paperwork, you can also receive insurance compensation for a damaged body and its elements as a result of an insurance event.  The only restriction in this case is the payment of not more than fifty percent of the amount under the contract.  The customer is offered the choice of a car workshop up to the official service stations, even if the warranty on the car has expired. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="wiseinsurancegroup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Casco Alpha ALL INCLUDED" class="if uuid-2576527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52023/2576527.jpg"></div><h2>  Option "Keys on the hood" </h2><p>  An additional program is offered for users of AlfaBUSINESS and Alpha ALL INCLUSIVE.  Its presence allows customers not to worry about unforeseen expenses and spending free time on collecting documents. </p><p>  In the event of an accident, the insurance company undertakes to send the vehicle to the service station and provide the client with a repaired car.  For this, the insurer: </p><ul><li>  ensures the presence of an emergency commissioner at the scene of the accident; </li><li>  guarantees delivery of a damaged car by a tow truck to a repair company; </li><li>  concludes service contracts with specialized service organizations for quality repairs; </li><li>  informs the car owner about the completion of repair work. <div class="photo" data-original="erch2014.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="keys on the hood of insurance" class="if uuid-2576517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52023/2576517.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  CASCO "TEN" </h2><p>  This insurance product is tied to OSAGO.  CASCO ‚ÄúTEN‚Äù rules from ‚ÄúAlfastrakhovanie‚Äù limit the number of clients who can use this insurance contract.  The presence of a policy purchased from an insurance company enables the policyholder to take advantage of additional insurance coverage. </p><p>  Based on the insurance rules CASCO "TEN" from "Alfastrakhovaniya", the company guarantees payment of one hundred percent of the sum insured in case of car theft.  The amount of compensation is not affected by the wear and tear of the car for the period from the beginning of the contract.  The insurance value of the car under the contract will not be reduced by the amount of payments made earlier. </p><p>  If the car is damaged as a result of insurance events, the company will arrange for the repair of the insured vehicle at an official repair station or will offer a choice of other professional service stations. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of CASCO ‚ÄúTEN‚Äù </h2><p>  Insurance terms CASCO ‚ÄúTEN‚Äù from ‚ÄúAlfastrakhovaniya‚Äù have attractive points for customers.  The positive aspects of the current program should include body repair, for which there is no established limit on the number of payments.  In case of damage to the body, the policyholder is also exempted from the need to provide official supporting documents. </p><p>  The minuses of the insurance rules from Alfastrakhovanie CASCO ‚ÄúTEN‚Äù are the limit of two insured events for receiving insurance compensation without information from competent organizations.  The company also warns customers that this program does not provide for the involvement of an emergency commissioner to document the results of the incident and collect a package of documents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nkminsurance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Casco's top ten insurance" class="if uuid-2576540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52023/2576540.jpg"></div><h2>  Smart CASCO </h2><p>  Insurance rules CASCO "Alfastrakhovanie" specialized specialists have developed so as to attract a variety of categories of drivers and vehicle owners.  The current program will help save more than half of the insurance premium by comparing payments using standard transport insurance options. </p><p>  In order to take advantage of such an attractive offer, the future client of the insurance company must be an attentive and experienced driver.  Based on the conditions of the ‚ÄúSmart CASCO‚Äù rules from ‚ÄúAlfastrakhovaniya‚Äù, neat drivers can become a potential client of the insurer. </p><h2>  How does Smart CASCO work? </h2><p>  In order to get a real discount when buying a CASCO policy, you should install a special device that fixes the policyholder's driving style.  An employee of the company installs a special mobile application on the client‚Äôs phone.  It allows you to track the movement of the car, the manner of controlling the driver.  The device registers the speed of the car, the sharpness of movement, the smoothness of permutations.  Such monitoring is carried out within six months. </p><p>  In order for the client to receive a reduced payment during the execution of the contract, the insurer analyzes the vehicle motion readings.  For comparative characteristics, they analyze trips for the entire period of use of the car and the last twenty. </p><p>  According to the current rules of insurance "Smart CASCO", "Alfastrakhovanie" takes cars under insurance cover up to seven years from the year of manufacture and only foreign production. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wiener.co.rs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Smart Casco from Alfa Insurance" class="if uuid-2576507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52023/2576507.jpg"></div><p>  The CASCO contract in Alfastrakhovanie can be concluded directly at the premises of the insurance organization or on the official website.  Regardless of the type of program chosen, the client of the insurer can choose any term of the contract.  It should be remembered that the insurance cover begins to operate on the next day after payment of the insurance payment.  The client may pay the insurance premium at a time or divide it into quarterly amounts.  When prolonging the insurance document for the next term, the policyholder is provided with additional benefits in the form of a reduced payment and quick clearance through Internet resources. </p><p>  The CASCO agreement will allow each client of the company to feel confidence not only in financial support in the form of payment of insurance compensation, but also assistance in collecting documents, delivering a car to a service station.  When choosing a product from the insurance company, the user should familiarize himself with all the programs and possible exceptions to the current rules.  And, as a rule, a potential insurer should pay a little more so as not to worry about a possible refusal to pay, than to save on payment and repair a damaged car at their own expense. </p>
