    <h2>  First edition </h2><p>  The very first generation iPad, the comparison of models of which is our main task, was very successful and laid the foundation for a whole "dynasty" of smart tablets.  The iPad was released in April 2010.  The first version did not support 3G, only Wi-Fi was available to users (the built-in modem appeared in the gadget a bit later, when the model was re-released).  And there were only three options for the amount of memory: 16, 32 and 64 GB.  For 2010, this was quite enough, given the fact that the applications did not take up much space.  The color of the case was only silver, but this suited many buyers.  The latest version of the operating system that is supported by the iPad is iOs 5.1.1.  All subsequent updates are unavailable, since the ‚Äúhardware‚Äù of the tablet simply does not ‚Äúpull‚Äù the requirements put forward by the manufacturer.  The screen size is 9.7 inches.  It is this size that marked the beginning of the era of the famous tablets of the "apple" company.  As well as the <span>oleophobic coating of the</span> screen, on which there are practically no fingerprints.  There was no front camera or main camera on the iPad.  This flaw was fixed in later versions.  Today it is impossible to purchase a completely new iPad of the first generation, since it was discontinued in 2011.  On sale there are only previously used devices, the cost of which is very low.  However, it does not make sense to spend money on them, because they are very outdated in terms of hardware and the software installed on them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Second issue </h2><p>  If we make comparisons of the iPad, then we can not say about the iPad 2.  The start of sales began immediately after the production of the first generation of iPads ended.  In March 2011, Apple released its second iPad.  He already had some changes in appearance.  There was something that was not in the first <span>iPad: iPad</span> 2 (the comparison will be only for these two models) has acquired an external panel in black and white.  But the case has remained unchanged - silver.  By the way, the second iPad supports the current version of the operating system - iOS 9.2.  The amount of RAM doubled, instead of 256 MB it became 512. And given the fact that the system itself takes very little on itself, this is enough for the most necessary applications.  He got a tablet and cameras - the back at 0.69 megapixels and the front at 0.3 megapixels.  The amount of internal memory is available in three versions, as in the first generation iPad.  The tablet of the second release in 2014 was removed from sales.  Those who have this model in their use, nevertheless, should think about purchasing a new device - the outdated hardware with great difficulty ‚Äúpulls‚Äù the requests of the operating system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews on the second iPad </h2><p>  Perhaps, according to experts and users, this is the most unsuccessful version of the "apple" tablet.  And there are reasons for that.  If we compare the iPad from the first to the third generation, then the second version is extremely unsuccessful.  Firstly, the cameras here are of too low quality, so it‚Äôs better to be completely without them than with such low-grade ones.  Secondly, although the weight of the tablet has become less, the dimensions have not changed at all.  As well as viewing angles.  The image quality also loses significantly to the next model, if we compare the iPad 3 with the iPad 2. Therefore, many users choose a more advanced model, although the price for it at the start of sales was much higher. </p><h2>  Third issue </h2><p>  Drawing comparisons of iPad by model, one cannot but say about the innovative for 2012 release - iPad 3. It was in it that the voice assistant Siri appeared.  But the color of the case, if the iPad 3 is compared with previous models, has not changed - only silver.  The RAM was pleased - 1024 MB.  The main camera has gained as much as 5 megapixels, which is enough under good lighting conditions.  The operating system is supported and the most modern - 9.2.  At the same time, the processor pulls it quite successfully, and all the software is installed without problems.  If we compare the iPad 3 with the second-generation device, it becomes obvious that the third version of the tablet turned out to be more perfect and successful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Reviews on the third iPad </h2><p>  According to users and experts, it was the third generation of ‚Äúapple‚Äù tablets that became the most successful and laid the foundation for an iPad boom.  A sufficiently large amount of RAM makes the device so fast and responsive that the owners simply do not notice any minor flaws.  In addition, all users unanimously agree that the third-generation iPad is much nicer to hold (and use too) than the previous two models. </p><h2>  First mini version </h2><p>  In 2012, immediately after the start of sales of the third iPad, the sale of a reduced version of the "apple" tablet started in November.  He got the name iPad Mini.  And the size - 7.9 inches became the hallmark.  A pocket option, so to speak.  The RAM on the tablet, it would seem, is a bit - only 512 MB.  But even with such a "brain" the gadget just "flies."  If we compare the iPad Mini with a full-sized cousin, then it looks exactly like the iPad 2. However, it has a better camera - 5 megapixels, and the front camera - 1.2 megapixels.  Therefore, the gadget, despite its relatively low cost today (about 10-13 thousand rubles), is indeed a worthy representative in its category.  The modern operating system iOS 9.2 supports without lags and brakes. </p>

    <h2>  Second mini version </h2><p>  iPad Mini and iPad Mini 2 (the comparison in this section will be carried out exclusively in relation to these two models), it would seem, are very similar to each other.  However, the mini-version of the second generation has become more perfect, despite the fact that the resolution of both cameras remains exactly the same.  RAM doubled - 1024 MB, and for such a "baby" this is a serious claim to the speed of the device.  In addition, the gadget received a more capacious battery - instead of 4400 mAh of the first generation, as many as 6471 mAh.  This is enough to use the tablet all day when fully loaded, and even not the fact that you have to recharge at night.  And, of course, the choice of internal memory has increased.  If in the iPad mini of the first generation the choice was limited to 64 GB (16, 32 and 64), then the second generation also found a version of 128 GB so that all the necessary files were always at hand. </p><h2>  Fourth mini version </h2><p>  There is no need to talk about the third, since it differs little from the second according to the main criteria.  But the fourth iPad Mini was really a breakthrough in the field of "apple" mini-gadgets, sales of which started in September 2015.  The first thing that catches your eye is the internal memory of the device.  The buyer is somewhat limited in choice: there are options for 16, 64 and 128 GB.  But the usual 32-gigabyte version does not exist.  It is worth noting that 16 GB is negligible for a tablet of this level.  The battery capacity has become a little less - 5124 mAh.  However, the manufacturer claims that the charge will be spent more economically, and therefore sacrificed the treasured mAh.  The tablet has become thinner - only 6.1 mm instead of 7.5 mm in the second and third mini-ipads.  The amount of RAM increased - 2048 MB.  <span>This is an unrivaled</span> result for the pocket option!  The rear main camera acquired 8 megapixels for pictures.  But the front remained unchanged (1.2 megapixels). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad mini comparison" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1061012.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pro version </h2><p>  Comparing the iPad tablets, one cannot but say about the new product, the cost of which is simply prohibitive, by modern standards.  So what is it about this iPad?  The cameras in it are exactly the same as in Apple‚Äôs fourth mini-tablet.  Therefore, the owners in this case do not receive anything new.  As for the internal memory, only three versions are available - 16 GB, 32 GB and 128 GB.  At the same time, the manufacturer seems to be forcing to purchase a device with a large volume, because less is completely insufficient.  It is possible that in the future this defect will be corrected, because sales began only in November 2015.  Unfortunately, the usual memory capacity of 64 GB is not yet provided.  The battery has become very powerful - 10307 mAh.  And with 4096 MB of RAM, the tablet becomes a full-fledged center for entertainment and work.  Despite the fact that a capacious screen takes on a lot of battery power, it is still enough for a long time.  And the most important thing that has appeared in the iPad Pro is the large diagonal of the display.  It is 12.9 inches.  This is really a huge, but lightweight tablet, which is convenient to use for work and games.  Many buyers note that it was the iPad Pro that completely replaced their desktop computer. </p>

    <h2>  Comparison with Android tablets </h2><p>  Of course, to make such a comparison is not entirely correct.  Firstly, the price category of devices is different.  Apple gadgets almost always turn out to be slightly more expensive than any other.  And if we compare the iPad and Samsung, then we can only talk about image quality.  And then not all models.  For example, in the production of most Samsung tablets, Ammoled glass is used, which transmits amazingly all colors, tones and midtones.  But at the same time, it doesn‚Äôt stand next to the retina display of the ‚Äúapple‚Äù gadget. </p>

    <p>  The cost of Samsung is slightly less than that of Apple-tablets.  But at the same time, many users like the Android operating system much more than closed and somewhat limited iOS.  What to choose?  Which model to stay on?  Here everyone decides for himself. </p>
