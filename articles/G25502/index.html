    <h2>  Features acoustics JBL </h2><p>  In recent years, the company has been actively developing the portable model segment, making serious progress in this.  In many ways, the popularity of this line is due to the introduction of new technological solutions, some of which are based on wireless communications. </p><p>  A classic example of a system with such a snap is demonstrated by the JBL Charge speakers with a Bluetooth module.  Its presence allows you to control the device through a smartphone, as well as receive incoming calls with voice output over the speaker.  The modern portable model of the speaker system does not do without a capacious battery.  Moreover, the company has set the task of equipping devices with productive, but at the same time compact batteries.  As a result, lithium-ion batteries were selected with an average potential of 3000 mAh. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Special attention deserves the appearance of acoustics.  The developers of the internal filling, together with the designers, take into account the specifics of the operation of mobile speakers.  Therefore, materials that are characterized by wear resistance, dustproof properties and mechanical strength are initially selected.  The result is practical and versatile JBL acoustics in terms of physical handling, reviews of which generally confirm the high level of its external security. </p>

    <h2>  Varieties of systems </h2><p>  Although portable models are at the peak of popularity today, the company is widely represented in other segments.  For example, floor systems are distinguished by high-quality sound, balanced power and outstanding communication capabilities with other equipment. </p><p>  Another thing is that in this niche the manufacturer has many worthy competitors with many years of tradition of manufacturing full-format audio systems.  Is it possible that the shelf-mounted acoustics of JBL in several modifications noticeably stands out against this background, although, again, this is not the segment that fully reveals the strengths of the brand.  They are most likely to appear in a series of compact mobile speakers, reviews of which are worth considering separately. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Reviews about model Flip </h2><p>  This is a typical representative of the family of portable Bluetooth speakers from JBL, which realized almost all the advantages of this segment.  Among users of this model there are ordinary teenagers, fishing enthusiasts, and business people who need to be able to hold conferences with small-sized speakerphones.  And for the most part, JBL Flip acoustics satisfies the sound needs of different user groups. </p><p>  For example, outings do not pose a threat to the device, since the case has not only materials protected from various threats, but also the necessary accessories for comfortable transportation and convenient handling of the device already at the place of operation.  As for the use in conference rooms, here many note a well-implemented noise reduction and echo cancellation system.  That is, the room provides a clean and at the same time powerful translation of speech sound. </p>

    <h2>  Clip model reviews </h2><p>  The basic version of the line is suitable for those lovers of good sound who do not want to overpay and are willing to sacrifice some functionality.  And this does not mean that the model is completely depleted in optional capabilities.  Its owners emphasize the presence of a wireless communication system, the advantages of a battery that supports power supply for 5 hours, as well as the good quality of case materials. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What will have to sacrifice, making such a choice?  First of all, the acoustics of JBL Clip against the background of more technologically advanced representatives of the family are not able to provide stable signal exchange with a smartphone.  According to users, even staying in another room sometimes makes broadcasting difficult.  In addition, many indicate the absence of a low-frequency emitter, which in other models increases the bass reproduction power.  However, if you connect the system via cable, the difference in sound quality will not be so significant. </p><h2>  GO Model Reviews </h2><p>  This model mainly repeats the technical and operational qualities of the previous modification, and its features are reduced to external characteristics.  GO users emphasize the convenience of handling it, the presence of various means of attachment and fixation to clothing and other items.  This is the best option if you need a compact speaker with a reliable shell that can protect the technical stuffing from external influences. </p><p>  In addition, there is a variety of stylistic performances in which this JBL acoustics is presented.  Reviews are generally positive about the working properties of the system.  It is inexpensive, so you should not wait for special acoustic effects, but in the class of portable small-sized models it performs well. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the model Charge 2 Plus </h2><p>  One of the most advanced developments in the family of portable speakers JBL.  The model is aimed at the connoisseur of high-quality sound, but it is not spared from modern optional features.  The same wireless data transfer system, according to the owners, allows you to work stably with three devices.  That is, in the process of using acoustics, you can alternately switch sound sources without performing unnecessary actions to connect. </p><p>  In addition, the JBL Charge 2 Plus system is equipped with a 3000 mAh battery.  This allows you to play music without additional charge for 12 hours.  The model also does not lose the aforementioned devices in the characteristics of physical security.  The practice of operating in different conditions shows that the case protects the system from water, dirt and mechanical damage.  It also assumes several color options to choose from. </p>

    <h2>  Xtreme Model Reviews </h2><p>  Perhaps this model can be attributed to the premium level.  It is confirmed not only by the nominal characteristics, but also by user reviews, noting the wide functionality of the device, the balance of sound quality, reliability, etc. Especially the owners of this model appreciate it for its voluminous battery, which in this case has a potential of 10,000 mAh.  This allows you to use a fairly powerful acoustic platform for 15 hours without interruption. </p><p>  The features of this system include the ability to connect to other audio equipment via a wireless channel.  Moreover, the JBL Xtreme acoustics, unlike the aforementioned devices of low power, organically enters into complexes of full-format speakers without distorting the overall sound picture. </p><h2>  Studio 220 model reviews </h2><p>  It is worth considering the shelf speakers JBL in one of the most successful modifications.  The dual-channel Studio 220 system causes a lot of positive reviews for the ability to reproduce pure, natural sound and the original design, in the development of which, by the way, the latest computer modeling tools were used.  Along with this, the acoustics of JBL Studio 220 became famous thanks to the deep and rich bass.  Improvement in this part was achieved through the use of a bass reflex, supplemented by two sockets.  At their ends, the turbulence of air flows was reduced, which allows for natural bass without overtones. </p><p>  There are other modifications of the same class in the line, in which the main emphasis is placed on communication capabilities.  But, since the shelf-mounted JBL speakers are more often used in stationary mode, such solutions rarely turn out to be advantageous.  Including for the reason that even the new Bluetooth modules do not allow to reveal the sound picture as fully as traditional acoustic cables do. </p>

    <h2>  How much does a JBL speaker cost? </h2><p>  Models of the initial segment can be purchased on average for 2 thousand rubles.  For example, in the GO series you can find modifications for 1,700 rubles.  The average level, in which models like Charge are presented, has devices with price tags of the order of 5-6 thousand. </p><p>  This is followed by the premium version of Xtreme from mobile systems and Studio from the line of ceiling devices.  This is already an expensive JBL acoustics, reviews of which, however, justify such costs.  In particular, the considered modifications are estimated at 11-12 thousand. More traditional models of floor and flow systems in the middle and upper segments can be available for 50-70 thousand.  It depends on the characteristics of specific models, functional content and additional options. </p>

    <h2>  How to choose the best model? </h2><p>  Much of the choice of JBL speakers depends on the operating conditions of the device.  Obviously, listening to music on the street will be possible only with the use of a mobile system.  And here, too, the choice is ambiguous.  For discerning music lovers who want a simple and practical tool for playing sound from a smartphone, we can recommend the GO version.  If you need multifunctional <span>wireless speakers JBL</span> for different purposes with high-quality sound, then you can safely choose from the Charge and Xtreme families. </p><p>  For stationary operation in the home, it makes sense to look at products from the Studio line.  In this case, JBL products are not so much out of the general range of similar speaker systems, but at least a high quality level of the materials used and assembly will be guaranteed.  In addition, at a price in the niche of full-size monitors and speakers, JBL offers very affordable options. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The concept of small portable systems for listening to music ‚Äúon the go‚Äù was not so long ago skeptically considered by manufacturers of audio equipment.  The developers were confused by various constraint factors that did not allow to achieve a truly high quality playback.  Nevertheless, the examples of JBL Charge 2 Plus and Xtreme models showed that the sound characteristics may well meet the needs of a considerable part of music lovers. </p><p>  Of course, even if you use a wired connection method, such systems are not comparable in sound quality with the same ceiling systems, which is quite logical.  But on the other hand, portable models enable independent operation of the speaker away from mains power.  And this advantage in a sense compensates for other flaws and limitations of such acoustics. </p>
