And a trip to Antalya will also entertain. </p><p>  For lovers of entertainment there is a "Dino Park" and the park "Moonlight" with many attractions.  In the city‚Äôs night clubs, Turkish and Russian pop stars often perform. </p><h2>  Hotel More 3: reviews </h2><p>  Most reviews are positive.  People like the location, the rooms, and the food.  Cleaned clean enough, although there are several photos with rust on the taps or hair in the shower.  But these are isolated cases.  The staff is friendly, speaks good Russian, always ready to explain and conduct everything.  Some write that even before 2:00 pm they were politely received, put on a bracelet and gave breakfast, although they were accommodated as expected, after two hours. </p><p>  Even skeptics are fascinated by the nature of the surrounding area.  Only positive reviews about Turkey, Kemer, Hotel "Sea". </p><p>  Among people who negatively evaluate the room, many complain of crowding and breakfast.  They give advice that it is better not to buy tickets at the travel agency of Hero Tour Hotel.  They deceive and give the most mediocre.  A guide named Kamal is also not clean at hand. <br><br></p>
