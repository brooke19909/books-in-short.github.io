    <h2>  Brief information about the bank </h2><p>  The credit institution under the promising name “Point” is part of the largest in the Russian Federation financial group “Discovery”.  It was created on the platform of one of the branches of Business Online, owned by the once-popular Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkrytie.  The Tochka Bank itself (reviews of legal entities, which we will discuss below, will allow us to evaluate the quality of work of this organization) earned in 2015. </p><p>  This service is almost completely managed by the friendly team of the famous interactive Bank24.ru, which recently lost its license.  “Point” specializes in online servicing entrepreneurs, as well as performing diverse settlement operations for representatives of small and medium-sized businesses.  Currently, this bank works with all cities of Russia, but it does it on a remote basis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How convenient is it to open an account in the "Point"? </h2><p>  According to many users, representatives of this bank are doing everything possible to make their services the most attractive.  For example, they pay a lot of attention to the procedure for opening an account. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to experienced entrepreneurs, for this you only need to apply online.  Alternatively, you can report all the necessary information about yourself by calling the hotline: 8 (800) 2000-024.  According to a similar scheme, Otkritie Bank had previously worked.  "Point", reviews of which are often left not only by legal entities, but also by individual entrepreneurs, prefers to act in a similar way. </p><h2>  How long does the account in the “Point” open? </h2><p>  To open an account, for example on the tochka.com bank website, you just need to leave your contact phone number and click on the "Submit Application" button.  As a rule, in a couple of minutes the representative of the “Point” will call you back and discuss the details of the design. </p><p>  So, in order for the consideration of the application to last no more than 6 hours, the entrepreneur needs to attach several scans to his profile.  These are the requirements that the Tochka Bank makes for entrepreneurs.  Testimonials that speak of the high processing speed of the application confirm these rules.  At the same time, scans of documents for legal entities and individual entrepreneurs may vary. </p>

    <h2>  What documents do legal entities need to open an account? </h2><p>  To open an account for legal entities, you need the following scans of documents: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  memorandum of <span>association</span> or <span>charter of the enterprise</span> with the appropriate seal of registration; </li><li>  agreement and power of attorney (in case of transfer of authority to manage the organization to representatives of management companies); </li><li>  information regarding the participants or shareholders of the company; </li><li>  powers of attorney and orders (transferring powers to manage finances to third parties with the right to sign); </li><li>  passport data of responsible persons; </li><li>  insurance numbers of individual personal accounts; </li><li>  licenses (if any); </li><li>  full <span>register of shareholders</span> or extract from it (applies mainly to joint-stock companies); </li><li>  copies of financial statements or any other documents on the financial income and expenses of the enterprise; </li><li>  certificates of amendments (if any additions are made), etc. </li></ul><p>  Recommends to send all these scans of documents to its customers "Point" (bank).  In this case, opening a current <span>account</span> (feedback on its design speaks in favor of the organization’s employees) is much easier, since 70% of the process takes place remotely.  Hence, saving time on finding branches and visiting the bank. </p><h2>  What documentation is needed for IP? </h2><p>  As for individual entrepreneurs, the list of documents that they should scan is much smaller.  For example, they need to provide copies of all pages of the passport.  Moreover, this applies not only to the head of the company, but also to his wards, who can manage the finances of the company.  For example, these may be accountants. </p><p>  Further, the Tochka Bank (IP reviews help evaluate the ease of filing an application) should send the insurance number of your personal personal account (SNILS).  It is also recommended that you send copies of powers of attorney giving third parties the right to dispose of the company's finances. </p><p>  And, of course, to evaluate the activities of the company, the bank needs to obtain information about the amount of income and expenses.  If, however, the IE has been operating for less than a year, to confirm its financial reliability, it should provide copies of the accounting register or the balance sheet for all current accounts. </p><h2>  Bank “Point.  Ru ": reviews of individuals and legal entities on opening an account </h2><p>  Before opening an account with this bank, it is recommended that you read the reviews of those people who have already managed to do this.  For example, some entrepreneurs say that they are happy with everything.  When applying, they liked the high quality of service, punctuality and friendliness of employees, as well as the speed of considering the questionnaire.  According to them, an account with this bank was opened very quickly. </p><p>  Some legal entities also refer to the high speed of reaction to the application by the bank employees.  From their words, it becomes clear that it was in this organization that they managed to quickly open their account. </p><p>  They describe the positive experience of communicating with this financial institution and many individual entrepreneurs.  According to their story, the Tochka Internet Bank (reviews about it are often accompanied by explanatory screenshots, as in the photo below) pleased them with an excellent service.  They talk about the competence of employees who are happy to answer questions and share information on current tariffs.  Some also admire the convenience of accessing an organization.  So, they argue that thanks to the representatives of the "Point" they save a lot of time.  For example, they do not need to go to the tax office and report the account opening.  All this is done by the <span>bank employees</span> themselves <span>.</span> </p><p>  Other entrepreneurs, on the contrary, are saddened by the difficulty of reaching out to bank representatives.  In their opinion, the call center should work around the clock, but it is almost impossible to get through it in the evening. </p>

    <h2>  A small bonus to new customers of the bank </h2><p>  After sending scanned copies of documents with potential customers, one of the Tochka employees appoints a meeting (the bank, reviews of which can be found in this article).  In this case, this meeting is considered a necessary procedure, the purpose of which is to verify the original documents of the client and conclude a cooperation agreement.  It is noteworthy that the interview is organized in a pleasant and welcoming atmosphere, such as in a cafe or diner. </p><p>  After all documentary formalities have been settled, the client of the bank has a statement stating all current bank service rules.  And already on the basis of it, as many users say, they open an account for you (according to the chosen tariff), provide access to Internet banking and issue a plastic “Points” card. </p><p>  As a bonus, according to most entrepreneurs, company representatives issue a special introductory tube.  Initially, it contains documents for signing, and then a small bottle of wine takes their place.  A trifle, but nice. </p><p>  As you can see, the organization “Point” has chosen a somewhat unusual approach to its potential customers (a bank, reviews of which can be heard mainly from the positive side).  This indicates her interest in attracting more entrepreneurs.  But what do people think about current tariffs? </p>

    <h2>  What reviews can be found about bank rates? </h2><p>  If we talk about bank rates, then there are a variety of reviews.  For example, some are happy with the opportunity to take a visual price list of home tariffs.  According to them, it is issued in the form of a small advertising booklet.  Others like the opportunity to open an account for free and the manager’s departure home service (regardless of the selected tariff package). </p><p>  Still others enthusiastically respond to the bank’s manner of calculating interest on the current account balance.  Many also talk about the ability to control account transactions.  And to do this, according to their words, you can using free SMS notifications. </p><p>  But, despite such a large number of positive opinions about tariffs, you can always meet dissatisfied entrepreneurs.  Some, for example, do not like the cost of the service itself.  In their opinion, it is excessively overpriced.  These are the associations that the Tochka bank evokes among users.  Employee reviews will help you learn about the company from a completely different perspective. </p>

    <h2>  What can be gleaned from reviews of bank employees? </h2><p>  <span>Feedback from bank employees</span> can say a lot about the financial institution itself, including what is hidden from prying eyes.  For example, some employees of the "Point" talk about difficult relationships with the management of branches.  According to their story, they are constantly dissatisfied with the quality of their staff, are dismissive of newcomers and do not care about the calculation of bonuses and incentives. </p><p>  Others complain that they are not satisfied with the "frantic rhythm" of work.  According to them, they have no days off and even a lunch break.  Still others complain about the high demands of the management and the salary disproportionate to this. </p><p>  In a word, the bank’s internal policy and relations with its customers are two completely different worlds.  But if you decide to become a client of this institution, we recommend that you study the information about each of them! </p>
