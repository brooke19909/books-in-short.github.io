The region is famous for the fact that almost 10% of all its territories are considered protected and protected by the state of Italy.  Marche combines beach, mountain and historical tourism, which is why it is so attractive for travelers.  However, many of them bypass the area, poisoning in more popular places: Florence, Rome or Venice.  And completely in vain.  Marche is not inferior to other regions in the number of beaches and architectural monuments. </p><h2>  Marche History </h2><p>  The capital of the region, the city of Ancona, was founded in 387 BC.  e.  Greek colonists.  Prior to this, scattered tribes of the Etruscans lived on the territory, which were subsequently driven out by the Romans.  Italy (including Marche) was the most developed part of the world in antiquity, and Ancona, not far from Rome, grew quite rapidly.  At the same time, the city became the center of Italian trade, and the Romans called the settlement "the eastern gate of the country." </p>

    <p>  After the fall of the Roman Empire, Marche was captured by the barbarian Goths.  For some time the territory was ruled by the heiress of Rome - Byzantium, but after the advent of the Lombard tribe, it lost control of the area.  The Lombards actively fought with the Pope until they were conquered by the state of the Franks.  Having seized the land, the king of the Franks handed over to Marcus the Pope, who was his vassal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the XI century, the region gained independence, becoming a free trading republic.  For many centuries, she withstood the sieges of her powerful rival - Venice.  The republican government was subsequently replaced by hereditary rule.  The territory was ruled by the Dukes of Urbinsk of the clan Montefeltro.  Only in the 16th century was the Pope able to regain his power over the Marche region. </p><p>  At the end of the XVIII century, Ancona was captured by the French army of Napoleon, and then became part of the united state of Italy.  Marche is still its administrative unit. </p><h2>  Castle of the Dukes of Urbinsk </h2><p>  The castle was built by order of Frederico da Montefeltro at the end of the 15th century.  He bought the Florentine architects and set out to build the perfect residence for the ruler of a small state.  However, the duke of Urbino suddenly died, and the construction of the castle was suspended. </p>

    <p>  Centuries later, work on the castle was resumed.  Upon completion of the construction, the ducal palace became a classic example of Italian Renaissance culture.  Now the castle is actively visited by tourists.  Numerous excursions are held here, including the art gallery of the castle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Holy hut </h2><p>  The Basilica of Santa Caza (translated as "holy hut") is one of the most revered Christian shrines that Italy is famous for.  Marche has many Catholic churches, but this one stands out among others for its unique history.  The biblical tradition says that once upon a time in the Holy Land, near Jerusalem, there was a house where Mary, the mother of Christ, grew up and was brought up.  A church was later built on the site of the house, which was later destroyed by Muslims.  Then the crusaders transferred a miniature model of the temple, first to Dalmatia, and then to Ancona.  By order of the Pope, a real church was erected in a miniature layout. </p>

    <p>  The park covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 6000 square meters.  m. There are numerous pedestrian and bicycle paths, a walk along which allows you to go through real thickets of forest.  All of them lead to the rocky coast of the Adriatic Sea.  It offers magnificent views of the beaches and the capital of Marche - the city of Ancona.  On the way, tourists can meet many species of birds and animals: peregrine falcons, eagles, martens, badgers.  Here you can also stumble upon park attractions: caves and white cliffs.  Often on the territory of Monte Conero tastings of local wines and delicacies are held. </p><h2>  Cathedral of Ancona </h2><p>  The main church of the city was built in the XI century, and, of course, it is one of the main attractions of Ancona.  The building was built in the <span>Byzantine style</span> and was designed in the shape of a Greek cross.  Here are the remains of the Catholic saints Jude Kyriac and Marcelin of Ancon.  According to the chronicles, a Roman temple dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite was once built on the site of the current cathedral. </p>

    <p>  The cathedral was rebuilt several times, although the facade retained its historical appearance.  The first restoration work was carried out at the end of the 19th century, and during the First World War the temple was partially destroyed by bombing.  The building itself was restored, but the famous frescoes and paintings were irretrievably lost.  Subsequently, the church was bombed again during World War II.  It was also badly damaged by an earthquake in 1972.  However, now the Ancona Cathedral is operating as usual, Catholic services are held here, as well as excursions for tourists who decide to visit the state of Italy.  Marche, a photo of the sights of which can be seen in this article, will amaze travelers with the grandeur and antiquity of its monuments. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Many travelers liked Italy.  Marche, reviews of which are mostly positive, usually stays away from tourists.  They prefer to stay in more popular cities: Rome, Florence, Naples.  However, people who have already visited Ancona claim that it is in no way inferior to these cities.  Moreover, housing in the region is cheaper, which means you can save a lot of money.  Tourists also highlight the economical shopping, the diversity of local cuisine and the delicious wines that Italy is so famous for. </p><p>  Marche, hotels in which is much cheaper than in Rome, will be a great place for those who want to explore the central part of the country without spending large sums.  From Ancona in just a few hours you can reach Rome, Venice, Florence and even San Marino.  The Marche region is worth a visit for anyone who loves historical sites, rocky beaches and natural nature. </p>
