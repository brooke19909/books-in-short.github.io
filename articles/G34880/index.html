Despite the fact that horizontal loading machines are incredibly popular, vertical loading washing machines are the best for many consumers.  Such models are ideal for older people or those who have back problems - there is no need to bend over.  In addition, according to experts, top-loading washing machines are the best technique for large families in which a lot of laundry accumulates: it is much easier to load it into the drum from above.  Such models are practical and convenient, which is highly appreciated by the hostesses. </p><h2>  Rating of the best models of household appliances </h2><p>  Below is a rating of the best top-loading washing machines, according to numerous experts and specialists.  They select the winners in terms of functionality and quality. </p><h2>  Zanussi </h2><p>  The first place in the <span>ranking of the best top</span> -loading <span>washing machines</span> goes to Zanussi.  The device has a capacious drum for 6 kilograms of things.  The machine is controlled from a digital display.  A feature of Zanussi, for which it is in no small measure ranked first in the ranking of the best washing machines with vertical loading, is a large number of drum revolutions - 1200 when spinning things.  The spin speed can be adjusted either automatically or manually for each of the washing programs.  The forced spin stop function allows you to save things that should not be washed in the selected mode.  The device is listed in many Top-10 washing machines with a vertical load due to the energy category A ++.  The machine has eight automatic washing programs, but the advanced functionality and the ability to manually adjust some parameters significantly increase its capabilities.  The maximum sound level during the operation of the machine is 58 dB, while it can increase by only 20 dB in the spin cycle.  Almost silent operation is an indisputable advantage of Zanussi technology.  The drum is made of high-strength and high-quality plastic.  The presence of a timer allows you to delay the start of the program and the machine for a certain time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
