    <h2>  Stay with children </h2><p>  Mehtap Beach Hotel 4 * is mainly oriented towards youth.  Marmaris is a fun, noisy resort where the festive atmosphere reigns uninterrupted.  Relaxing with young children, especially in the city center, is very difficult.  There is practically nothing in the hotel for young guests.  All that couples can attract here is the proximity of the sea. </p><h2>  Leisure for adults </h2><p>  Since Mehtap Beach is located in the center of the resort, it is designed to ensure that guests entertain themselves.  The hotel has an outdoor pool with a rather small area and a depth of 1.65 meters.  According to the guests, it is very little in demand, despite the fact that there are comfortable sunbeds with mattresses and umbrellas around.  There is a billiard room in the lobby, which can be used at an additional cost.  There are no other entertainments.  Animation is also not provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mehtap Beach Hotel reviews" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15383/279828.jpg" width="600"></div><br><br>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The proximity of the sea is the main advantage of the Mehtap <span>Beach Hotel 4 * (Turkey).</span>  Marmaris tourists love for the beauty of nature, climate, shopping, excellent spa business, but a beach holiday for everyone remains in the first place.  Marmaris is located in a bay, some of which belong to the Aegean Sea, others of the Mediterranean.  In fact, it is in the Marmaris region that an invisible border passes (officially it is located a little closer to Dalaman), separating these two huge water basins.  For a beach holiday, this is important, since the waters of the Aegean Sea, you can say, are cool, warm only by the beginning of June, and by the end of September they manage to cool down.  The waters of the Mediterranean Sea are much friendlier, which is why the swimming season on their coast opens in May.  Marmaris is in an intermediate position.  Here, at the end of spring, the water temperature does not exceed +20, and the warmest is from June to September.  But the islet, located at the entrance to the bay, closes it from the restless sea winds. </p><p>  If the weather is all right, a beach holiday at Mehtap Beach is a great success.  In fact, guests coming out of the hotel door immediately get to the beach.  It is quite large in length, so the desired place where you can settle in with comfort is always there.  Coverage of the beach is small pebbles, the entry into the water is smooth, umbrellas and sunbeds are free.  The disadvantage of the beach is the lack of quality cleaning.  Those who wish to relax with great comfort can proceed to the neighboring beaches belonging to the coastal cafe.  There is more order on them, but you have to pay or buy drinks for the sunbed and umbrella. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Mehtap Beach Hotel Turkey" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1533083.jpg" width="505"></div>
