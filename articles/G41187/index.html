  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Breeding geese in a private household</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most valuable and necessary products for humans is meat.  It is also very much appreciated for its taste and is part of so many dishes.  Now it is not a problem to purchase meat products in the store, but the quality of this product leaves much to be desired, since in the process of its cultivation various feed additives harmful to the human body are used.  Therefore, many people, in order to provide themselves and their family with environmentally friendly and healthy meat, try to breed various farm animals at home or in the country. </p><p>  If you have such a desire, then the first thing you need to start your business with is to decide which animals it would be most profitable to breed.  If you live in a private house or you have a summer house, next to a pond and a small pasture, then the most beneficial is breeding geese.  By the way, even if there is no pond nearby, then it can also be replaced with some kind of structure into which water can be filled.  I would like to note that many owners who were engaged in breeding various poultry advise breeding geese for meat, as they consider this species of bird to be the most precocious, hardy and do not require special attention.  Therefore, I would further like to talk about how to care for this bird. </p><p>  The most common <span>breeds of geese</span> are large gray, Kholmogorsk, fighting, Chinese, Gorky and others.  To contain geese, you can adapt either any available room, or build a new one.  For construction, mainly use boards, clay, reeds or other materials.  Most importantly, the finished room should be dry and without drafts, and also so that it can be well ventilated.  For the floor, either boards or clay concrete are used, which are sprinkled with litter (sand, sawdust, straw, etc.). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Breeding geese is impossible without compulsory walking.  Walking yards are built for this purpose, or birds are released into pasture and ponds, on which they feel great both in winter and in summer.  By the way, in the summer, it is preferable to keep geese even at night on the street.  I would also like to add that if you plan to keep a large number of this bird, then consider that geese do not like a lot of crowding.  Expect that on two square meters you will have somewhere 3 heads.  Unfortunately, profitable breeding of geese requires a lot of <span>living space</span> for them.  But, believe me, all these expenses will pay off after the first season and you will have the opportunity to continue doing business in this area. </p><p>  As for feeding, geese mainly eat on pastures, but it is still necessary to feed them.  They eat cereals, various herbs with great pleasure and, like other <span>waterfowl,</span> require a sufficient amount of water.  The winter and <span>summer diets</span> , of course, are different, since in the summer there is a lot of greenery, and in the winter you have to steal the hay and various <span>grass flour.</span>  And only after this lengthy procedure to mix the finished mass with animal feed. </p><p>  Breeding geese has become a fairly profitable business for many homeowners in various regions of our country.  And this is not surprising, since this bird is practically unpretentious to the conditions of detention, weather conditions and diet.  <span>Diet</span> can only affect the full development of the bird and its size.  If you take into account all the pros and cons, then breeding geese as a business is quite profitable, regardless of how many birds you grow.  Moreover, the demand for goose meat has always been, is and will be, which means this business will always be profitable! </p>
