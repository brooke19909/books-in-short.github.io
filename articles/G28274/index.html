  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interesting kumihimo schemes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nowadays, interest in needlework remains as persistent as before, and access to numerous sources of information makes it possible to study the crafts of other nations.  Many needlewomen liked Japanese kumihimo shoelaces for their simplicity and wide opportunities for realizing creative potential.  Experienced craftswomen themselves learned how to create kumihimo schemes, and beginners use ready-made ones. </p><p>  Next, consider how easy it is to create such a braided pigtail.  We will also analyze in detail some interesting kumihimo schemes. </p><h2>  Bit of theory </h2><p>  First you need to prepare tools and materials.  Ancient samurai weaved kumihimo using special round or square looms.  Now there are simplified versions of them in the form of discs or squares with a hole in the center and notches along the edges.  In this article, we will figure out how to weave round shoelaces.  It is easier for beginner needlewomen. </p><p>  In addition to the machine, threads will be needed to implement the kumihimo scheme.  For simple baubles, an ordinary floss is also suitable.  Of course, you can use a thicker yarn or combine several of its varieties to achieve interesting effects. </p><p>  Since the lace-up coefficient of the shoelaces is large, it is necessary to take rather large cuts.  So that the threads do not get tangled, you can use bobbins, bobbins from a sewing machine or just wind them into a ball. </p><h2>  Weaving principle </h2><p>  It is not difficult to disassemble kumihimo weaving patterns if you know the basic principles of this needlework.  For example, consider them on 8 threads, but real shoelaces consist of a minimum of 16. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We take a machine with 32 slots and insert 4 pairs of multi-colored yarn into it.  Starting points in the diagram are indicated by dots.  Then we lift the green left thread up and insert it into the left slot from the blue pair.  We lower the right blue one down to the right of the green one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fusionbeads.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kumihimo schemes" class="if uuid-2228866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2228866.jpg"></div><p>  After that, turn the disc counterclockwise 90 degrees and continue to weave according to the same principle.  The main thing here is not to confuse the direction of throwing the threads, otherwise the pattern will not work out kumihimo, and the lace itself will not be uniform. </p><h2>  Simple scheme "Flowers" </h2><p>  This pattern consists of 16 threads.  To work, you need 3 shades of green, purple and orange.  How to read the circuit?  We take a circle for weaving and mark on it the places where you need to insert a thread of the corresponding color.  At the very top we fix dark green and light green.  In a clockwise direction we retreat 2 slots and fix the lime and purple. </p><p>  We continue to insert the threads in accordance with the color scheme.  When the workpiece is ready, and the free ends are threaded into the central hole and tied to a knot, weaving can begin according to the principle described above.  The main thing is to swap diametrically opposite threads and always rotate the circle in the same direction (traditionally - counterclockwise). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="friendship-bracelets.net" data-author=": chstoner, "><img itemprop="image" alt="kumihimo weaving patterns" class="if uuid-2228883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2228883.jpg"></div><h2>  More complex scheme </h2><p>  On large machines, much more interesting baubles are obtained kumihimo.  Schemes for them are built on the same principle, with only one difference - this time there will be more threads. </p><p>  The above option consists of 24 elements.  It makes it possible to create a rainbow snake on a black background. </p><p>  For work, you need a machine with 48 slots.  In all other respects, weaving will be the same as the previously described options. </p><h2>  Scope for creativity </h2><p>  As with any other needlework, don't be afraid to experiment.  At the initial stages, you can simply change the colors in the schemes and create the same patterns, but in different variations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="friendship-bracelets.net" data-author=": Marina1313, "><img itemprop="image" alt="baubles kumihimo schemes" class="if uuid-2228903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2228903.jpg"></div><p>  Then you can try to create something of your own.  But then to repeat the pattern, you need to make notes or sketches of the beginning of work. </p><p>  Kumihimo laces can also act as an independent bauble decoration, and as an addition to a more complex work, which will add to it uniqueness and originality. </p>
