    <h2>  History </h2><p>  2500 years ago a small Iberian settlement appeared on the site of a modern resort, a little later the Greeks came and established a trading colony.  From the Greek language the word is translated as “White Fortress” and was originally pronounced “Acre Levka”, when the city later came under the rule of the Roman invaders, they renamed it Lucentium, which means “City of bright lights.”  In their place came the Moors and brought with them a new name - Al Lucant, consonant with modern. </p><p>  At the end of the 16th century, the city was recaptured by the Castilians and transformed into an important trading port for all of Spain.  During this period, it was actively reconstructing old buildings and building new ones.  Many monuments of those years can be seen today. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  One of the main reasons for the positive feedback from tourists about Alicante in Spain is its location.  It is located in the Mediterranean climate zone, and therefore almost all year warm and sunny weather reigns throughout the territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The climate in Alicante is sunny and arid, rains are a rarity, mainly in spring and autumn, so the local landscapes resemble Crete and Crimea.  Statistics annually totals 330 sunny days, and the summer, beginning in May, ends only at the end of October. </p><p>  The average air temperature is 18 º, in winter it does not fall below 6 º, and in summer it does not rise above 30 º.  The hottest month is August and the coldest is February.  Water warms up to 23 º in June, in September - up to 27 º.  Reviews of tourists about the weather in Alicante (Spain) are always positive. </p><p>  The swimming season lasts from May to mid-September, during these months the rental of umbrellas and sunbeds is open, lifeguards work on the beach.  For example, in the city of Benidorm, beach services are available almost all year. </p><p>  In October, in Alicante (Spain), according to tourist reviews, is no less good than in the peak season.  At this time, an unusual cream apple (cherimoya), as well as pomegranates and grapefruits, are harvested here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alicante spain tourist reviews pics" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61874/2024418.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists about the beaches of Alicante in Spain are mostly positive.  As throughout the country, they are municipal, public, private and not paid.  A common flag system is used to inform visitors: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  green means the beach is completely safe for swimming; </li><li>  yellow - for confident swimmers; </li><li>  red - swimming is prohibited, but usually it is hung out for a while, for example, when a dangerous course occurs; </li><li>  black shows that there are a lot of jellyfish in the water.  However, over the past nine years, such a flag has never been flown. </li></ul><p>  Each beach has restaurants, bars, equipment rental, playgrounds, showers and toilets.  Rescuers are on duty everywhere.  The favorite among all the beaches in Alicante (Spain) according to tourists' reviews is Postiguet, located at the foot of Benacantil Mountain.  Among others, it stands out for its beautiful promenade and fine clean sand and the longest beach (almost three kilometers long), San Juan, which is especially popular among lovers of water sports.  And those who like to snorkel and snorkel while exploring the underwater world will love the small rocky bays at Cape de Huertas Cape. </p><p>  There is little risk of burns from touching a jellyfish or stepping on spider fish.  When preparing for the trip, you should familiarize yourself with recommendations on what to do in these cases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alicante spain tourists reviews weather" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61874/2024419.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  The best reviews from tourists in Alicante (Spain) over the past decades receive hotels located on the beach "Postiguet".  Even the most expensive hotels do not have their own beach, so you have to use public ones. </p><p>  On the first line of the beach, a five-star room will cost 150-220 euros, and with three stars, for example, in the San Juan area, 120 euros. </p><p>  The most numerous and demanded category of housing are apart-hotels, accessible to middle-income visitors.  You can find such an option both in the city center and close to the beach, for a young couple or for a large family.  A weekly stay in peak season costs from 300 to 1,500 euros, and in normal times, prices are reduced by three times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alicante spain tourists reviews weather" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61874/2024414.jpg"></div>
