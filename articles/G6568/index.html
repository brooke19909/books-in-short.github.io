Peterhof's mode of operation is of interest to many tourists who annually visit the northern capital of Russia.  A visit here is an obligatory item of the program of stay in the city.  This issue is also relevant because it is simply impossible to examine the whole of this grandiose monument of Russian history and culture in one visit.  You can return to these palaces, alleys and fountains many times.  And always find at the same time something new, not noticed before. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Peterhof mode" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/334382.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  Some facts from the history of palaces and parks </h2><p>  The appearance of Peterhof was formed gradually over the course of almost three centuries of Russian history.  It was founded by Peter the Great, and subsequent emperors brought their ideas and architectural preferences to its arrangement.  The complex of fountains of the Grand Cascade is unique both from an engineering and architectural point of view.  In these palaces and parks, a real part of Russian history was created.  Peterhof was badly damaged during the Great Patriotic War.  During the siege of Leningrad, the city was captured and heavily destroyed by the Nazis.  But everything was recreated in its original form by the heroic efforts of the Leningrad people during the years of post-war reconstruction.  Peterhof‚Äôs free working hours during the Soviet era made him one of the favorite vacation spots of the townspeople.  Leningraders and city guests loved this place also for their accessibility.  Getting to him was easy enough.  In particular, along the Neva River, from the city center from the Palace Marina. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alexandria petergof working hours" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/334383.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Peterhof </h2><p>  The palace and park ensemble receives a lot of tourists during the summer season.  <span>Peterhof</span> Lower <span>Park</span> is available for visitors from 9 am to 8 pm daily.  On Saturday - until 9 pm.  Entrance to the lower park is paid.  On a weekday, the cost of an admission ticket is 250 rubles for adults, 100 for students and 150 rubles for senior citizens.  On weekends and holidays, an adult ticket costs 300, and for pensioners - 200 rubles.  Peterhof‚Äôs work schedule provides for a preferential payment level for citizens of Russia and the CIS countries.  This is reflected in the fact that for tourists from non-CIS countries the entrance to the Lower Park is more expensive. </p><h2>  Park "Alexandria", Peterhof.  Mode of operation </h2><p>  "Alexandria" is a country residence of Russian emperors.  Who was its founder is clear from the name.  It is located a little east. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park alexandria peterhof opening hours" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/334381.jpg" width="495"></div>  Until recently, only Alexandria remained free for visitors at the bottom of the park.  Peterhof, whose mode of operation did not fully apply to it, is gradually following the path of commercialization.  Whether we like it or not, maintaining such a large territory in proper condition requires considerable expenses.  Some of them have to be shifted to visitors.  But the cost of admission to <span>the Alexandria Park</span> is still close to symbolic - 30 rubles for adults and 10 rubles for children.  Historic sites on site are subject to a fee.  You can visit the park of the former imperial residence from 11 am to 10 pm.
