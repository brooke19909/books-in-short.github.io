    <h2>  General concepts </h2><p>  Each player is dealt four cards from the deck, only he should see them.  In Omaha Hi-Lo, the rules are structured in such a way that all players have the opportunity to use two pocket cards, no more.  He can combine this pair with only three open “board” cards.  All players, as a rule, must always pay the minimum bet amount before the cards are dealt. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Omaha Hi-Lo Stages </h2><p>  In Omaha Hi / Lo, the rules and combinations are very similar to poker.  When all the participants in the game looked at the cards, they need to bid and make a bet, this stage is called “Pre-flop”.  The participant of the game has the opportunity to raise the bet, double, skip or put cards and "pass". </p><p>  After this, the second stage begins, it is called the “flop”.  Three open cards are piled on the table.  The same betting scheme is repeated, everyone thinks about his subsequent actions, collecting combinations of his pocket and flop cards, and decides what he should do in this situation. </p>

    <p>  Next comes the next stage, the fourth card enters the game, it is called "Turn".  When the card was introduced into the gameplay, the same pattern is repeated.  Each active player who has not left the game, thinks what to do next.  The action is performed clockwise from the player who dealt cards. </p><p>  Once the bets have been placed, the final stage of the River begins.  The last and most decisive fifth card is revealed.  At this stage, the most exciting and risky bets are made.  Each playing player, from left to right, raises the bet, doubles or passes. </p><p>  After accepting bets, players show cards.  They are revealed by the players sitting from left to right of the person who was distributing the cards.  Remember, of the four cards that were issued to you, you can use only two, and only three of those that are called - “ford”. </p><p>  When all players show the collected combinations, the pot is divided into two parts.  The player who has collected the highest combination of cards takes one half.  The second one is taken by the player with the corresponding low combination, that is, the minimum. </p><p>  If the players collected equal combinations of cards, then they are obliged to divide the bank into two.  Also, if no player has collected cards that correspond to a weak combination, the rules of the Omaha Hi / Lo game indicate that the whole pot goes to the player who has collected a large combination.  After the winner receives the bank, the next distribution begins.  The person who sits next, from left to right, will hand over after the last distributor. </p>

    <h2>  Omaha Hi-Lo rules, combinations (high) </h2><p>  Omaha Hi / Lo combinations can be for both high and low hands.  Note that in this game, the ace is weaker than the deuce.  We remind you that to create combinations of cards you can use only two of the four dealt to you, and three from the “ford”. </p><p>  Types of combinations: </p><ol><li>  Highest card - when a situation has occurred in which a participant in a game does not have any combinations, he is judged by the presence of a card of the highest rank.  If it happened that the rivals have equal senior cards, the other strongest card is selected for both players, and the result is decided by it. </li><li>  Pair - is considered in the case when the participant of the game collected 2 cards of equal value.  In addition to these two cards, there are 3 cards left in the hands that are not included in the combination.  If several players have the same combination, the winner is determined by the highest card. </li><li>  Two pairs - the combination is assigned to the participant of the game if he has two combinations of the same rank cards.  The remaining card is usually called a “kicker”.  It determines the winner if the pairs of rivals are equal. </li><li>  Three - the player has collected three cards of the same rank.  Sometimes also called "set."  If two or more players combined the same triples, the winner is the one who holds a card of the highest value. </li><li>  Straight - when the player has five cards in his hands with an alternately increasing level of dignity.  In a situation where several players have a straight in their hands, the winner is the one who has the first highest senior card.  Ace can be used as a card with a rank higher than the king, and under the deuce. </li><li>  Flash - it is considered to be a combination if the player has combined 5 cards of the same suit.  If several participants in the game managed to do this, the winner is the one who has the highest highest card. </li><li>  Full house - will be appointed in that situation if the participant in the game managed to collect one pair and three.  If a Full House is collected from several players, the one with the highest card in the top three wins.  If they are equal in the top three, the highest card is paired. </li><li>  Four of a kind - when a player collects all cards of the same rank, that is four.  If several players have collected this combination, the one who has the senior “kicker” will win. </li><li>  A straight flush is considered the highest combination.  Appointed in the case when the participant in the game combined 5 cards of the same suit, which go in order of increasing value. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Deck selection </h2><p>  You will need a deck of 52 or 54 cards, poker is played without jokers.  Often use plastic cards.  They are most convenient in poker. </p><p>  The deck of poker cards must be of high quality.  Before you start the game, inspect each card for marks.  This is necessary so that players can not determine the card on the shirt.  Often, for each game, they buy a new deck so that it does not wear out and there are no different marks on it in the form of scuffs or bends.  There is a fairly large selection of decks with a variety of shirts.  You must choose the one that you think is most suitable for your game.  Have a good game and big banks! </p>
