Characteristics and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Wanting to lower the cost of devices, the manufacturer sometimes trims a lot of important characteristics.  Although the Lenovo company is not famous for such actions, they also have similar experience in model 369. Wanting to correct a mistake, the company redesigned the smartphone and released an analogue with the prefix i at the end.  What came of this? </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  Appearance Lenovo 369i is quite inconspicuous.  The device cannot boast of special delights, but to say that the design is bad is difficult.  The appearance quite expected from an inexpensive device. </p><p>  Somewhat improves the impression of high-quality plastic.  The material allows the case to look much more expensive.  Also, the presence of a textured panel on the back avoids fingerprints. </p><p>  Zest in the placement of external parts is not observed.  The display, touch buttons, speaker, sensors, microphone, company logo are located on the front, but you should forget about the front-end.  The camera on the front side is missing. </p><p>  The back of the textured plastic placed a camera, a company sign and a speaker on it.  Flash is not provided in Lenovo 369i. </p><p>  On the top of the device, the company tried to install everything at once: USB and headphone jacks, as well as a power button.  The volume control is located on the right side. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Definitely, the decision to collect all frequently used parts in one bottle is not the best.  It's good that the headphone jack is located far from the power button. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  It should be mentioned right away that the device was released in 2013, and you should not expect a good screen from Lenovo 369i.  The specifications are pretty mediocre: just 4 inches with a resolution of 800 by 480. </p><p>  The screen is quite small, and you have to peer at the image, but another problem arises - pixels.  Outdated TFT technology does not improve experience.  Even with a slight tilt angle, the image fades and is distorted. </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  Like most smartphones, the Lenovo 369i is equipped with an MTK processor.  The device operates at a frequency of 1.3 GHz, which, in principle, is not bad.  Compared to its predecessor, the RAM also increased.  Now the gadget has as much as 512 instead of 256 MB. </p><p>  The hardware is enough to perform simple tasks and work with most applications.  Expect more from a cheap phone is not worth it. </p><p>  The owner expects an unpleasant surprise in the form of 4 GB of native memory.  But in fact, approximately 2 GB is available.  The only way out is to increase the volume of the memory card.  The device works pretty well with a 32GB flash drive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  The device is equipped with a camera with only two megapixels.  Even for the 2013 budget smartphone, this is a terribly bad feature.  Actually, talking about quality is not necessary.  Most likely, the owner will not even resort to this function. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The device supports the most necessary networks, and even 3G.  A nice detail is the work with two SIM cards.  Although the second card will go into standby mode when making a call, since there is only one radio module in the device. </p><p>  The smartphone also supports Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth.  Complain about a small number of communication methods does not work. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  The device operates under the guidance of Android 4.2.  Given the filling, such a system is quite enough for Lenovo 369i.  The firmware also has updates, however, they will not bring big changes. </p><p>  On top of the "Android" company interface is installed.  In addition to the shell, the <span>Lenovo 369i</span> also has some useful applications.  Some of the programs installed by the manufacturer will be impossible to remove without root-rights. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The smartphone‚Äôs battery is not very powerful, but the phone is not very demanding.  In the mode of active use of the charge, there will be enough hours for 5-6, and with minimal work the battery will last two days. </p><p>  In addition, simple actions will help to increase the life expectancy.  For example, by reducing the brightness of the display and killing unnecessary tasks, you can significantly extend the work. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  In addition to the device are headphones, adapter, manual, USB cable.  Unfortunately, the owner will need additional expenses to purchase a flash drive and, possibly, a better headset. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of the phone is quite democratic and ranges from 3-4 thousand rubles.  Although some of the phone‚Äôs capabilities are lame, the price more than smooths out sharp corners. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  The main plus of the device is the work with two SIM cards.  For a cheap device, this is a very nice feature. </p><p>  The cost also leaves no one indifferent.  For a minimum price, the user will receive not only a good means of communication, but also a smartphone capable of much. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Significantly more negative sides in the phone.  The same camera is perplexing.  More confusion would have been caused only by her absence.  Perhaps the manufacturer should abandon the camera in favor of improving another parameter. </p><p>  A minimum of native memory does not improve the experience.  Allocated to the user 2 GB is only enough to install the most necessary programs. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

    <p>  The owners did not have the best impressions of the Lenovo 369i.  Reviews, despite the very affordable price, are full of descriptions of negative qualities.  It is easy to understand the dissatisfaction of users, but you should not expect the incredible from a budget device. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  The device turned out to be somewhat one-sided, more towards communication, but it performs the main tasks perfectly.  369i can be considered one of the cheapest creations of Lenovo.  Without a doubt, the smartphone will find its target audience. </p>
