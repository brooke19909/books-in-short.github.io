    <p>  Accidental placement in water for half an hour or a little more will not worsen its work, and for the entire time spent in the liquid, the system will not stop.  And durability, which is the highlight of the manufacturer itself, reliably protects against the penetration of dust, dirt and moisture to internal parts. </p><h2>  Geocaching </h2><p>  A very good plus in Garmin eTrex 10 is that it has support for any GPX geocaching files.  This makes it possible to download various caches in any places, as well as their descriptions directly to the device. </p><p>  Special sensors built into the navigator save and quickly display on the screen all the basic information of interest to the user.  This display includes all the hints, descriptions, difficulty, and the exact location.  All this will help tourists who like to travel to unusual places, not knowing the exact path. </p><p>  Due to the presence of geocaching, the user consciously refuses to write on plain paper, thereby preserving nature.  At the same time, the efficiency of geocaching is significantly increased, which allows to improve the operation of the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Traveling around the world </h2><p>  The portable navigator of the new model called "Garmin eTrex 10" is designed for general consumption.
