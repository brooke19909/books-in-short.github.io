It is possible for anyone who has an idea about knitting to make them.  Beginning needlewomen will only need to know a few simple patterns to please members of their family with beautiful and warm products.  You will also need a knitting pattern for socks on 5 knitting needles. </p><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  If you decide to knit socks for someone from the family, you need to stock up on everything you need beforehand.  First of all, you need a set of knitting needles, which can be purchased at any store offering goods for needlework.  You can immediately buy yarn.  For an adult, <span>knit socks</span> on 5 knitting needles from 150 g of woolen threads.  If we are talking about the manufacture of such products for a child, then about 50-70 g of yarn will be needed. </p><p>  In the process of knitting, you also need to take measurements, so a portable ruler should be at hand.  Beginning needlewomen will help to cope with the work of the knitting pattern of socks on 5 knitting needles, which can be found in this article. </p><h2>  Where to start knitting? </h2><p>  So that future socks fit a person just right, you need to calculate the number of loops.  To do this, you need to tie a small sample, which will allow you to make the correct calculations.  To make it, it is enough to dial 15 loops and knit about 15 rows.  After that, you need to measure the sample with a ruler, without stretching it.  The number of loops typed is subsequently divided into centimeters obtained. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="5-knit sock pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1099036.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Next, you need to make the necessary measurements that will determine the width of the future product.  First you need to take two measurements.  The first is the girth of the leg in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe bone, and the second is the circumference of the foot for lifting.  The data obtained must be summarized and divided in half: this value will be the optimal width of the toe.  After these measurements, the previously obtained number of loops included in 1 cm of the previously connected sample must be multiplied by the calculated width of the toe.  When choosing a hinge, it should be borne in mind that their number must be a multiple of 4, since the fabric will be distributed over four knitting needles. </p><h2>  5-spoke knitting pattern: getting started </h2><p>  Making socks often starts with knitting the cuff.  First of all, you need to dial the desired number of loops and distribute them evenly on all knitting needles during the first row of knitting.  For this, a rubber band in which there is an alternation of front and back loops is best suited.  If men's socks are knitted on 5 needles, then the optimal height of the cuff will be about 8 cm. In children's products, it should already be made about 3-4 cm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit socks on 5 knitting needles" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1099204.jpg" width="523"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  After the cuff is ready, the transition to the main pattern.  For beginner needlewomen, it is enough to know how the front and <span>back loops</span> fit together to knit socks on 5 knitting needles.  If desired, you can use the simplest patterns or make socks multi-colored.  Regardless of color, the yarn used for knitting should be the same thickness and texture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the cuff is made, a pagolenok of the selected length is knitted.  Based on personal preferences, you can make socks short or high. </p><h2>  How is the heel tied? </h2><p>  Of the half of all typed loops, which are located on two knitting needles, the heel is tied.  The cloth, located on the first and second knitting needle, is not knit yet.  If 5-spoke socks are knitted (see microns), then the heel height will be about 6 cm. In women's socks, its height is 5 cm, and in children's socks - 3-4 cm. Since the heel is most susceptible to wear, when knitting it out of place will use stronger threads, for example, darn, in addition to wool.  After the heel is ready, the extra thread is removed, and the foot is knitted only with wool yarn. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="5-spoke baby socks" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1099038.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The loops on the remaining two knitting needles can be assembled onto the studs, then they will not slip.  Otherwise, it is better to make special caps from the eraser on the ends of the needles. </p><p>  After the height of the heel will correspond to the size, you can begin to reduce the loops.  To do this, divide the loops into three parts.  If their number is not a multiple of three, then the side parts are made the same, and the extra loops remain in the middle.  One side part and the central one are knitted.  The last loop of the central part and the first side are knitted together.  After that, the product is turned to the front side.  The first loop after the turn is simply removed without knitting.  Next, you need to knit the central part.  Knit her last loop with the first loop of the side, and again make a U-turn.  Knitting continues until all the loops of the side parts are cut. </p><h2>  Go to knitting foot </h2><p>  After the heel is ready, you can proceed to the manufacture of the track.  The first step is to resume the number of loops.  This is done as follows: from the side of the knitted heel, new loops are recruited.  First, you need to do this on one side with a spoke, on which the remaining heel loops are located.  After this, the loops that are on the third and fourth knitting needles are knitted.  Next, a set of loops from the other side of the heel is repeated.  It is also necessary to transfer half the loops of the central part of the heel to the first knitting needle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="5-spoke men's socks" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1099039.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  After the distribution of the loops, the foot is knitted.  When it reaches the beginning of the thumb, you need to proceed to decrease. </p><h2>  How is the toe formed? </h2><p>  The last part of the sock is called the toe.  If children's socks are knitted on 5 needles, then the heel and the end of the sock can be made of threads of a different color, so that the product will be brighter.  When knitting a toe, you can also use an additional more durable thread.  This will protect your socks from premature wear. </p><p>  To form a rounding, you must first knit the 1st and 3rd knitting needles through a row of two loops together.  The same reductions are made at the end of the 2nd and 4th knitting needles.  Having reduced the number of all loops to half, you need to further make reductions in each row.  When 8 loops remain on the needles, you need to proceed to the end of the work.  To do this, you need to stretch the thread into the remaining loops, tighten it and securely fasten. </p><h2>  Final work </h2><p>  It is not difficult to knit socks on 5 knitting needles.  The main thing is to make accurate measurements.  It is also important to correctly calculate the required number of loops.  The novice needlewomen will also help the above scheme for knitting socks on 5 knitting needles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mk 5-spoke socks" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1099040.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  In order for finished products to have a beautiful look, they need to be steamed.  To do this, the socks are ironed through a slightly damp cloth.  You can not iron the cuff, because after that it will not be fixed on the leg, and the toe will slip. </p>
