    <p>  In the pension there are two indoor pools, which are available to vacationers in May and in September, if the sea is cold. </p><p>  The guesthouse is surrounded by greenery of the park.  The coniferous smell is in the air, as lush pines and spruce trees grow everywhere. </p><p>  For lovers of outdoor activities there are sports fields.  For those who come to rest by car, there is a paid parking. </p><p>  The location of the pension is very convenient.  The city center is only one and a half kilometers.  In just fifteen minutes you can reach the central promenade and the main <span>attractions of Anapa with a</span> calm step <span>.</span> </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  The address of the boarding house ‚ÄúGlory Park‚Äù is Anapa, Pionersky ave., 8 </p><p>  The hotel is located at a distance of about eight kilometers from <span>Anapa Airport</span> and about three kilometers from the train station, so it is very easy to get to the pension.  Transport accessibility of the city plays an important role in its popularity as a resort.  Direct trains, planes and buses are sent to different cities of Russia to Anapa, and in Anapa itself a huge amount of city transport is concentrated. </p><h2>  Pension "Glory Park" (Anapa), reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Reviews about the boarding house "Glory Park" is not enough.  As they say, they talk about him - it means the hotel is popular, but they are positive or negative, this remains to be understood. </p><p>  It is worth saying that if the boarding house declares that it works on an all-inclusive system, then they compare it with popular resorts with the same system.  Hence the negative reviews about the Glory Park.  People who go on vacation even at a relatively low price, but using this system, imagine one thing, but in the end they observe a completely different picture. </p><p>  There are a lot of negative reviews, and mainly they relate to accommodation in a boarding house, conditions of rest, condition of rooms, etc. Progress did not affect this boarding house.  The spirit of the Soviet Union remained in it: all the same modest furniture, the absolute minimalism of the interior.  Those vacationers who were ready for such an environment abstracted and pay attention to other things - nature, weather, a large green area and, in principle, are satisfied with the rest. </p>

    <p>  You need to understand: boarding house ‚ÄúSlava Park‚Äù (Anapa), reviews of which are ambiguous, is still a budget hotel, the prices for rest are small, and you should not expect a European level from it. </p><p>  As for nutrition, things are more fun here.  Positive reviews about the kitchen are enough.  Vacationers say that the food is quite simple, but varied and tasty.  Many are outraged by the behavior of compatriots in the kitchen.  As they say, who did not have time, he was late, and you can not catch the most delicious dishes, as some tourists are too zealous.  But here the mentality of people is to blame, and not a boarding house, there's nothing to be done.  In general, with regard to nutrition, we can conclude: in general terms, it is not bad, even more - good.  Not Egypt or Turkey, but tasty and satisfying enough. </p><p>  What is there about a place like the Slava Park Hotel (Anapa), staff reviews?  Mostly they are positive.  Vacationers note the hospitality and friendliness of the staff, but at the same time, lack of qualifications and relaxation.  It can be concluded that people here are working well, but the authorities do not put forward special requirements for their work.  Hence some negligence. </p><p>  Almost all positive reviews are about the boarding house.  There are no complaints about cleanliness, everything is neat and tidy, although quite simple. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of the Hotel </h2><p>  Based on the reviews of tourists, you can highlight the main pros and cons of relaxation at the Glory Park Hotel. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  large territory; </li><li>  convenient location; </li><li>  good kitchen; </li><li>  low prices; </li><li>  proximity to the sea. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  no repair in the rooms; </li><li>  old furniture; </li><li>  unsanitary conditions (insects, fungus, dampness); </li><li>  neglect of the territory. </li></ul><p>  It is hoped that in the near future the administration of the boarding house will nevertheless reconstruct, and the boarding house will comply with world resort standards. </p>
