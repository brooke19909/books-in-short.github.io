He, along with Fanagoria, was the favorite military unit of A. Suvorov.  It was with them that he stormed the impregnable Turkish fortress Ishmael, went on a Swiss campaign.  The worldwide significance of the Russian Empire, its respect as a great power, was won by the victories of the army.  The regiment took part in all wars, starting from the time of Peter I. </p><div class="photo" data-original="samlib.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Absheron Regiment of Empress Catherine the Great" class="if uuid-3088443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3088443.jpg"></div><h2>  Formation of the Absheron Regiment </h2><p>  After the infantry regiment returned from a campaign in Persia under the command of Matvey Trade, the Astrabad regiment was formed on its basis in 1724.  It was enlarged, and it included the grenadier company of the Zykov regiment, four companies each from the Velikolutsk and Shlisselburg regiments.  Under this name, he lasted eight years.  After the signing of a peace treaty between Persia and Russia, the regiment was renamed, since the city of Astrabad remained in Persian possessions.  Russian regiments were not called by the names of settlements located outside the country. </p><p>  In November 1732, he received the name of the Absheron Infantry Regiment.  It was under this name that he was to enter the history of Russia, covering himself with glory.  Many prominent people of the country, who for the most part served as officers in it, served and fought in his ranks.  These are generals P. A. Antonovich, F. D. Devel, N. I. Evdokimov, P. F. Nebolsin, M. G. Popov, D. I.  Pyshnitsky, D.I.  Romanovsky, K. N. Shelashnikov, E. K. Stange, military physician V. A. Shimansky, hero of the Caucasian War Samoila Ryabov. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Its official name is ‚Äú81st Absheron Regiment of Empress Catherine the Great‚Äù.  The second part of the name, namely, ‚ÄúHis Imperial Highness, Grand Duke George Mikhailovich‚Äù (grandson of Nicholas I), most likely, was added during the First World War or later.  However, which prince is related to the regiment is unknown.  He was a purely civilian, but in the First World War he held the rank of general. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shkolazhizni.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Absheron Regiment History" class="if uuid-3088436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3088436.jpg"></div><h2>  Shelf shape </h2><p>  During the reign of Catherine II, the uniform of the soldiers and officers of the Absheron Regiment by Prince Potemkin was determined as follows.  The soldier relied on a green cloth caftan.  Turn-down collar, cuffs and lapels made of red cloth, red trousers to the knees.  Two ties: black and red.  White boots.  Boots, round-nosed boots.  Hat-hat with white skin.  A cape was put on a white overcoat without sleeves, called epancha. </p><p>  Officers powdered their hair, soldiers sprinkled flour.  The shoulder straps were yellow or red.  Musketeer companies were part of the Absheron Regiment.  He was never a hussar, but for some time he was called a musketeer.  As part of the article, we briefly consider the participation of the Absheron people in wars. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Capture of the Azov fortress in 1736 </h2><p>  For access to the Black and Azov Seas in 1736, Russia launched a military company led by B. Minikh.  This regiment was attended by the Absheron regiment.  At 16 kilometers from the confluence of the Don River in the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, on a high hill, located on the left bank of the river, back in the VI century BC.  e.  the Greeks laid the fortress city of Tanais.  The strategic location of the fortress, from the high walls of which the area was visible, was of great value. </p><p>  The fortress of Azov from the 15th century was under the rule of the Turks, in the hands of which was the control of the waterways along the Don to the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov and further - the Black Sea.  It was from this fortress that the Turks raided Russian settlements, leading the inhabitants into slavery.  The June assault on the fortress was preceded by a three-month siege, during which its walls were shelled from 46 siege weapons.  The assault, which was attended by soldiers of the Absheron Regiment of Empress Catherine the Great, lasted two days.  Successful actions of the Russian army forced the Turkish garrison to surrender. </p><p>  The Crimean campaign of 1736-1739 was the continuation of the successful capture of the Azov fortress, followed by the assault on Perekop, the passage along the shallow Sivash, the capture of Bakhchisaray and Simferopol. </p><div class="photo" data-original="samlib.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="81 Absheron Infantry Regiment" class="if uuid-3088432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3088432.jpg"></div><h2>  The war with Sweden in the years 1741-1743 </h2><p>  After the defeat in the Northern War, Sweden decided to take revenge and unleashed a new war in 1741.  The aim of the Swedish troops was to return the lands that had been transferred to Russia under the Nishtad Peace Treaty, as well as the land between the White Sea and Ladoga.  The Russian army opposing the Swedes was commanded by Field Marshal Lassi.  At this time, important political changes took place within the country.  As a result of the coup, the daughter of Peter I, Elizabeth, came to power, who at first, in 1741, signed a truce with the Swedes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But since the Swedish side did not withdraw its claims and, at the instigation of France, demanded the cancellation of the peace treaty, in 1742 Russia organized a campaign to Finland, which at that time was under Swedish rule.  The Absheron Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel Ivan Leskin participated in it.  The Russian army took Friedrichsgam, Helsingfors, Borgo, Tavastgus.  After that, between the Russian troops and the commander of the Swedish army, Major General J. L. Buske, a surrender agreement is signed.  According to him, the Swedish army should be sent home, and its artillery guns go to the Russians. </p><h2>  Participation in the Seven Years War 1756-1763 </h2><p>  By the middle of the 18th century, the foreign aggressive policy of Prussia, on which England was on the side, intensified.  Despite the fact that Russian-English relations were more than satisfactory, Russia severed relations with Prussia in 1756 and entered into a war with her in alliance with France and Austria.  The Prussian army had a well-armed 145,000th army at the beginning of the war.  Against her came troops under the command of Field Marshal S.F. Apraksin.  They included the Absheron Regiment under the command of Colonel Field Marshal S.F. Apraskin, who controlled it until 1761.  After him, the post of commander was taken by Lieutenant Colonel, Prince P. Dolgorukov.  In 1762, he was replaced by Prince A. Golitsyn. </p><p>  It was in this war that the regiment distinguished itself by participating in victorious battles at Gross-Jegersdorf, Palzig, Zorndorf.  In the battle of Kunersdorf, the regiment, standing knee-deep in blood, defended the height of Spitsberg and lost most of its composition, but did not retreat, ensuring victory for the Russian troops.  For this, the highest command of Emperor Nicholas II in honor of the anniversary of the battle ordered the soldiers and officers of the Absheron Regiment to wear red leather boots and red socks in memory of the heroism of the soldiers of the regiment. </p><p>  During the capture of Berlin on 08/23/1760, the regiment as part of the detachment of Count Chernyshev showed courage and heroism.  In the period from August to December 1761, onm participated in the siege and assault on the Kolberg fortress.  This was the last victory of Russia in the Seven Years War, since the death of the empress and the accession to the throne of Peter III, who was sympathetic to the Prussian king Frederick, were not allowed to take full advantage of the fruits of glorious victories.  The history of the Absheron Regiment was replenished with glorious victories over the powerful army of Prussia.  In 1769, the regiment took part in the Polish campaign, in which the Confederates were defeated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rulit.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="24th KVF regiment of the village of the Absheron maykop department" class="if uuid-3088433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3088433.jpg"></div><h2>  Russian-Turkish war of 1770 </h2><p>  In 1770, Turkey, taking advantage of the Russian military operations against the Commonwealth, declared war on Russia, which was interested in access to the Black Sea.  The purpose of the Ottoman Empire was: Podolia, Volhynia, the expansion of its borders in the Black Sea and the Caucasus.  The Russian army under the command of Rumyantsev and Suvorov, which included the Absheron Regiment of Empress Catherine, won a number of important victories at Kozludzhi, Larg, Kagul. </p><p>  In February 1773, the regiment participated in the capture of Bucharest, in May, as part of a detachment under the command of A. Suvorov, participated in the assault and capture of the Turtukai fortress.  In June of the same year, during a raid on the Danube, a regiment guard of 153 soldiers and 3 officers perished, saving the entire detachment from death.  The Russian Mediterranean fleet under the command of A. Orlov and G. Spiridov defeated the Turkish fleet under Chesme.  On 10.06.1774, a peace treaty was signed in the camp at the village of Kuchuk-Kainardzhi.  The ports of Kerch and Yenikale departed to Russia.  In 1783, Crimea was completely annexed to Russia. </p><h2>  Russian-Turkish war of 1787-1791 </h2><p>  Turkey sought to take revenge for the previous war and return Crimea.  The reason for the war was an agreement on patronage and supreme power between Russia and Kartli-Kakheti (Eastern Georgia), which sharply reduced the influence of Turkey and Iran in the Caucasus, as well as the annexation of the Crimean Khanate to Russia.  The Turks demanded the restoration of the vassality of the Crimean Khanate and Georgia. </p><p>  In this war, the Absheron Regiment under the command of Colonel Peter Telegin enters the army under the command of A. Suvorov and takes part in the famous battles.  In July 1789, the battle of Fokshany and the Coburg battle with the detachments of Osman Pasha took place; in September 1789, the battle of Rymnik.  Suvorov personally took part in the training of soldiers of the regiment, preparing them for the assault on the fortresses. </p><p>  During the siege and capture of Ishmael, Suvorov takes the Phanagorius and Absheron Regiment of Empress Catherine with him, believing in the zeal and valor of the soldiers.  The regiments under the command of Suvorov 12/12/1790 took Ishmael.  But there were heavy battles with the Turkish garrison, which turned every house into a fortress.  The Turks did not hope for mercy, so they fought to the last, but the Russian soldiers did not take courage.  Ishmael fell. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russian7.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Empress Absheron Regiment" class="if uuid-3088440" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3088440.jpg"></div><h2>  The Italian Campaign of A. Suvorov </h2><p>  The creation of the second coalition against France, which included Russia, was the reason for the Russian-Austrian campaign against the Napoleonic army in Italy under the command of Suvorov.  It took place from April to August 1799. Its purpose was to suspend the victories of Napoleon's revolutionary army in Italy. </p><p>  After the Austrian troops trained the tactics developed by him, Suvorov with his army, which included soldiers and officers of the Absheron Regiment of Empress Catherine the Great, in April embarked on a campaign, passing 28 versts every day.  Absheron people participated in the famous passage of Suvorov through the Alps. </p><p>  The decisive battle on the Adda River took place on April 14, when the legendary Napoleonic Marshal Moreau was the opponent of Suvorov from the French side.  Suvorov's army wins the battle.  Then there were the battles of Lecco, at Trebia, Novi, the attack near Ober Alma and St. Gotthard, the Devil's Bridge, the capture of Almsteg and Mutenthal.  After this, the Absheron people returned with honor to Russia. </p><h2>  War with Napoleon in Europe </h2><p>  In 1805, the Absheron Regiment under the command of Colonel Prince A.V.  Siberian as part of a detachment under the command of Prince Bagration participated in the battles near Almsteten and Krems, as well as in the battles of Shengraben and Austerlitz, after which the regiment, consisting of Bagration‚Äôs rearguard, covered the withdrawal of the entire army. </p><h2>  War with the Turks 1806-1812 </h2><p>  The beginning of this war was caused by a number of reasons, the main of which were the resignation of the rulers of Moldavia and Wallachia in 1806, the revolt of the Serbs in 1804 against the Ottoman authorities, as well as the declaration by the Turks of the war of England, which along with Russia was part of the coalition against Napoleonic France.  Turkey was supported by France. </p><p>  The troops of General I. Mechelson with a 40,000-strong army entered Moldova and Wallachia.  It was not possible to conduct vigorous action against the Turks of Russia, therefore, in 1806, Mechelson was ordered to conduct only defense measures.  Until 1809, small battles were observed with varying success, and negotiations were underway to conclude new ceasefires. </p><p>  The 1809 campaign began unsuccessfully.  Attempts to take the fortress of Zhourzhu and Brailov failed.  The sick commander Prozorovsky could not lead the army, Prince Bagration was sent to help him.  Along with him came the 81st Absheron Infantry Regiment, which in October participated in the battle of Obilesti, where a large detachment of Turks was defeated, and in the capture of Bucharest.  In October 1810, he took part in the assault on the fortresses of Zhurzhi and Rushuk, which fell under the pressure of the Russian regiments. </p><h2>  The Patriotic War of 1812 and the foreign campaign of 1813-1815 </h2><p>  By the beginning of Napoleon's invasion of Russia, the 81st Absheron Infantry Regiment was part of the 3rd Observation Army, whose duty was to monitor the enemy, his movement, and also to observe the borders.  Nevertheless, he had to participate in three battles with the Napoleonic army: under Kobrin, Gorodechno and under Berezin. </p><p>  After Napoleon was expelled from Russia, the regiment took part in the European campaign of the army of the Russian Empire.  With his participation, battles took place near Bauzen, Leipzig, Brienne, Champaury, Larotieri, he participated in the capture of Paris.  Reading these lines, one can only be surprised that the history of Europe and Russia of that time is a continuous series of bloody wars, as a result of which borders were changed, new countries disappeared and new ones appeared.  Russia survived these trials thanks to the courage of Russian soldiers, including those who served in the 81st Absheron Infantry Regiment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="skald-ragnar.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="81st Absheron Infantry Regiment" class="if uuid-3088431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3088431.jpg"></div><h2>  Temporary renaming of a regiment </h2><p>  In 1819, the regiment was transferred to the Caucasus.  For an unknown reason, the regiment became known as Troitsky.  There is an unconfirmed explanation for this, according to which General Ermolov signed an order to change the name of all regiments in the Caucasus and replace their banners.  Therefore, for seven years, the 81st Absheron Regiment fought in the Caucasus under a false name and banner.  In 1826, his historical name and banner were returned to him. </p><h2>  Caucasian war </h2><p>  After the victorious Patriotic War of 1812, Russia needed to resolve the issue with the Caucasus.  The war in this region lasted for a long 47 years.  It was not continuous, since under the name of the Caucasian War military operations of the imperial army of Russia were combined in connection with the annexation of the North Caucasus.  The 81st Absheron Regiment participated in the defense of the village of Chirak, the fortifications of Zaryansky, Tsinatikhsky, Belokansky.  He took part in the Dargin campaign, in the battles of Kaka-Shura, Dzhansoy-Gala, Gunib aul, a raid on the Dalymovsky redoubt, as well as in the capture of Shamil. </p><p>  The village of Gunib, where he was located, is located on an impregnable rocky mountain, which can be reached only on the road, fired by the mountaineers from above.  It was 130 Absheron volunteers who took part in the ascent of the impregnable cliffs in order to remove protection, and the companies began to follow them, using stairs, ledges and potholes in the rocks.  Therefore, the assault on Gunib did not begin from below (in this case there would be many losses), but from above, from where they were not expected.  Thanks to the effect of surprise, Shamil was quickly captured. </p><p>  The Caucasian war was an example of unity between soldiers and officers of the Russian army.  This can be explained by the fact that there were no careerists who were mostly in the capital.  Here, the traditions of the times of Suvorov were honored, for which the soldier was primarily a man on whom victory depended.  Here, the lower ranks unquestioningly carried out the commands of officers who believed their subordinates.  After the Caucasian war, the regiment took part in the Khiva campaign, participated in the capture of the fortress of Avli, Khiva and the city of Chandir.  After that, he was again sent to the Caucasus to pacify the uprising in Dagestan and Chechnya. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.art-catalog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Absheron Regiment" class="if uuid-3088427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3088427.jpg"></div><h2>  Village construction </h2><p>  The policy of the Russian government in the Caucasus was reduced to the organization and construction of Cossack villages up to the foothills of the Caucasus.  It should be noted that in the Ciscaucasia, Cossacks have lived since time immemorial.  After the beginning of peaceful life, by order of the commander of the troops of the city of Stavropol, an order was issued on 04/03/1863 to the head of the Pshekh detachment No. 24 on the construction of five villages for the Cossacks.  They were supposed to be placed across the Belaya River, along the Pshehe River.  One of them was named in honor of a regiment actively participating in the Caucasian war, and began to be called the village of Absheron.  Cossacks living here were assigned to the 24th KKV regiment of the Maykop department. </p><h2>  Participation in the First World War </h2><p>  The regiment fought in many battles of the First World War, but the defense of the Osovets fortress, in which he participated, went down in its history.  Despite the fact that the German siege corps exceeded the number of besieged, the Germans decided to use a gas attack.  More than half of those in the fortress died, the rest went to the bayonet, which was later called the attack of the dead.  The Germans, who did not expect such a turn, abandoned their positions and fled.  But the Russian command, in view of heavy casualties, decided to leave the fortress. </p><h2>  1917 revolution </h2><p> In the civil war, the regiment fought in the White Army, in 1920 was evacuated from the Crimea.  It is believed that at this time he ceased to exist.  Probably, he ceased to exist much earlier, together with the imperial army, after the abdication of Nicholas II from the throne.  In the aftermath of the Civil War, there was the 56th Absheron <span>Cavalry Regiment,</span> part of the Maykop Division, which ended the Great Patriotic War as the Grodno Guards Division. </p>
