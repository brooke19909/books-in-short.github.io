  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a dishwasher</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If more recently, dishwashing equipment for many of us was considered a very expensive acquisition, now it is in almost every home.  A dishwasher, the choice of which is no less acute than when buying a washing machine, deserves great attention.  If dirty things can also be taken to the laundry room, then cutlery will never be washed anywhere for you.  Almost always, we choose a dishwasher, focusing on the volume and design of the equipment, sometimes completely forgetting about the technical characteristics.  In order not to make a mistake in choosing and buying a quality product, you should know how one model differs from another. </p><p>  The first thing you should know is that the dishwasher you have to choose can be freestanding and built-in.  In turn, freestanding models can be either small desktop or large floor.  The whole difference lies mainly in appearance.  Desktop dishwashers are ideal for a small family of 2-3 people.  Machines of this type can accommodate up to 10-15 cutlery, the entire washing cycle lasts no more than 30 minutes, and the <span>water flow</span> reaches 10-14 liters. </p><p>  However, for a family of 4-5 people or more, the use of desktop dishwashing machines is not rational.  It is much more efficient to choose a large-volume dishwasher, which will more economically use detergents, water and electricity.  Such equipment accommodates up to 15 sets of dishes and it is enough to include it once a day. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Like washing machines, dishwashers also have different <span>classes of energy consumption,</span> washing and drying.  When we choose a dishwasher, the letters ‚ÄúA‚Äù to ‚ÄúG‚Äù can be seen on the packaging film.  A-class is the highest, and "G", respectively, the lowest class.  It is noteworthy that in <span>the EU countries the</span> implementation of equipment for washing dishes with a class lower than ‚ÄúC‚Äù is prohibited, since such equipment is considered very uneconomical.  Thus, we can conclude that <span>it is</span> best to choose a <span>dishwasher</span> with three letters ‚ÄúA‚Äù, which means the highest class for all three indicators. </p><p>  Also, this technique is divided into categories depending on water consumption.  According to this parameter, they are divided into: highly economical (15-17 liters of water), moderate (18-20 liters of water) and uneconomical (24-26 liters of water).  If we choose a dishwasher, then this figure should be compared with financial capabilities. </p><p>  Each dishwasher has several programs and functions.  The most common are daily washing, pre-soaking and economical options.  In principle, these modes are enough, but the developers strive to please customers 100%.  That is why they provide other functions in some models, so that it becomes easier to choose a dishwasher that suits you. </p><p>  Machines manufactured under brands such as Bosch, Miele, Gaggeanu, Electrolux, Siemens or Kuppersbusch do their job perfectly, besides offering their customers a number of additional options.  So, for example, for glass and fragile dishes, the Electrolux ESL 44500 R model has an option for delicate washing, the process of which occurs at a water temperature of 30 degrees.  The Siemens SN 66M054 model has a built-in delay timer that allows you to start the wash at any specified time without human intervention, and the ‚Äúeasy lock‚Äù option in the Bosch SPV 53M00 machine acts as a ‚Äúlock‚Äù that closes the door in time if you yourself didn‚Äôt close it well. </p><p>  To choose a dishwasher today is not difficult, since the range of goods offered from different <span>brands is</span> more than high, and you can definitely choose the equipment taking into account all your wishes and facilitate homework. </p>
