  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The village of Vyshesteblievskaya of the Temryuk district of the Krasnodar Territory</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The village of Vyshesteblievskaya of the Temryuk district of the Krasnodar Territory is located in the center of the <span>Taman Peninsula,</span> halfway between Anapa and the Crimean Bridge.  The settlement, founded at the end of the 18th century, is home to about 4,000 people.  The leading activity of residents is gardening and winemaking. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Residents of the village are probably happy people.  The village is located in the fertile Krasnodar Territory.  The village of Vyshesteblievskaya is situated on fertile lands in the very heart of the Taman Peninsula, between two seas: the Black and Azov.  Warm climate, healing air, proximity to the best Russian resorts - what else is needed for life? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.domnatamani.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyshesteblievskaya village Temryuk district" class="if uuid-2576681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2576681.jpg"></div><p>  The region is famous for agriculture.  Houses in the village of Vyshesteblievskaya are surrounded by greenery, and peach gardens grow in the vicinity.  Local soils, slightly saline and calcareous, are excellent for cultivating vines.  The authorities allocated funds for the modernization of two local wineries in order to produce a natural noble drink of the highest quality. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The village of Vyshesteblievskaya is the administrative center of the village of the same name and is geographically located 30 kilometers southwest of Temryuk.  Anapa is a little more - 35 km.  An excellent road has been laid to both resort towns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="45.19209530000001" data-lng="36.993891599999984" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/8/7/4/4874.png"></div><p>  From the south, the settlement is washed by the waters of the Tsokur estuary, 5 km to the west is the village of Vinogradny, 5 km to the east - the village of Starotitarovskaya.  If you move north, the road will lead to the village of Sennoy, located on the shores of the Taman Bay of the Black Sea. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  An important railway line passes through the village of Vyshesteblievskaya leading to the large sea terminal Zhelezniy Rog and in the future (after the construction of the Kerch bridge is completed) to the Crimea.  In the fall of 2012, a train with oil crashed 6 kilometers from the village.  However, the threat of large-scale infection was prevented thanks to the coordinated work of responsible services. </p><p>  Two kilometers to the north, a federal strategic route E-97 was laid leading to the Crimean bridge (which is 40 minutes away by car).  Due to its high workload, there is a chance of some environmental degradation. </p><p>  You can get to the village on buses daily plying the following routes: </p><ul><li>  Taman - Temryuk (arrival time 14:17); </li><li>  Temryuk - Taman (11:35, 15:15); </li><li>  Veselovka - Krasnadar (6:13). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pan.bg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimean bridge" class="if uuid-2576693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2576693.jpg"></div><h2>  Base </h2><p>  The village of Vyshesteblievskaya of the Temryuk region was founded in 1794 by the Black Sea Cossacks invited by the Russian authorities to develop the wild lands of the Taman department of the Kuban region at that time.  As the name implies, Zaporizhzhya Cossacks arrived from the countryside located above (north) the town of Steblev, now located in the Cherkasy region of Ukraine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the early years, 348 senior citizens arrived at the newly formed settlement under the supervision of the 28-year-old smoking ataman Semen Stromtsov.  People came, including families, along with their belongings, tools, and even cattle. </p><p>  The location of the settlement for various smokers was determined more than democratically - by lot.  The villages had to be built according to a predetermined plan, and the church was necessarily located in the center.  It is interesting that Vyshesteblievskaya was located in the vicinity of the ancient Greek settlement.  Archaeologists examined the mound, where a mosaic crypt with rich burials of the priestesses of the goddess Demeter was found. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.temples.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Houses in the village of Vyshesteblievskaya" class="if uuid-2576638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2576638.jpg"></div><h2>  XIX century </h2><p>  The task of the Cossack immigrants included border protection and participation in all wars.  Relations with local indigenous people - the Zakubansky highlanders - were quite good-neighborly.  However, in 1807, a pestilence came from their side.  Residents of many cities and smaller towns were massively dying.  The misfortune did not pass around the Vyshesteblievskaya village either.  By the end of the epidemic, only a quarter of the villagers remained alive - 108 people.  By the beginning of 1812, thanks to new immigrants from the Poltava and Chernihiv regions, the population was about 500 souls. </p><p>  Fulfilling their duty, dozens of Cossacks were directly involved in the war with Napoleon on the front line.  In the first third of the 19th century, Circassian raids became more frequent.  This slowed population growth.  In the years 1845-1850, hundreds of new families were resettled here to strengthen the village.  According to the surviving data, by 1855 the number of inhabitants exceeded one and a half thousand.  The construction of a stone church in the name of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary dates back to the same time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prlib.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The village of Vyshesteblievskaya Temryuk district" class="if uuid-2576645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2576645.jpg"></div><h2>  20th Century </h2><p>  Many residents of the Vyshesteblievskaya village enthusiastically welcomed the revolution.  A partisan detachment was also created, which fought with Denikinites.  The final establishment of Soviet power took place in 1920.  The population by this time was 4,500 people.  Forced collectivization led in 1929 to a riot against the confiscation of arable land and vineyards.  However, this did not prevent the creation of the Giant collective farm in 1932. </p><p>  The peaceful life of the villagers was confused by the Great Patriotic War.  So, on September 5, 1942, the village entered the Romanian troops.  The occupation lasted until 10/04/1943.  The liberation of Vyshesteblievskaya required great efforts, the battles lasted more than 2 days, during which thousands of shells and aerial bombs fell here.  In memory of the dead, a memorial complex is installed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wp.wiki-wiki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument Mother Motherland" class="if uuid-2576775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2576775.jpg"></div><p>  In recent history, the village continues to progressively develop.  The pride of the inhabitants is magnificent peach gardens, during the flowering and harvest season attracting thousands of tourists arriving in organized groups.  In 2016, the construction of the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary was completed with donations collected by the residents of Vyshesteblievskaya. </p>
