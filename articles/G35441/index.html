St. Petersburg is a city that is quite difficult to surprise with high-quality and unusual new buildings, nevertheless, the described residential complex is truly admirable.  On a ten-hectare site, there are six magnificent houses, sparkling with glass trim on the balconies and pleasing to the eye <span>with porcelain stoneware facades.</span>  All buildings of variable number of storeys are made in a single architectural style, which only improves the overall impression made by the complex.  In total there are almost three thousand apartments in the houses, the first floors are given for numerous commercial premises. </p><p>  Residential complex “Pearl Frigate” is located in a region with its own infrastructure already in place, in addition, the developer also provides for the construction of its own social and shopping and entertainment facilities.  The undoubted advantage of the location of the complex is the ability to walk to the shores of the Gulf of Finland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd pearl frigate" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1281226.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The environmental situation in the region is more than good.  There are no industrial facilities, in addition, next to the complex there are two large landscaped parks - Novoznamenka and South Primorsky.  And within a radius of two and a half kilometers are well-maintained recreation areas.  All these factors, coupled with the proximity of the Gulf of Finland, make it possible for residents of the Pearl Frigate residential complex not to worry about the purity of the atmosphere and enjoy the fresh air right from the apartment window.  In addition, the developer carries out massive landscaping works, which also, of course, helps to improve the environmental situation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Transport connection </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the developer chose one of the most successful places in St. Petersburg for the complex.  In connection with this, the “Pearl Frigate” is well provided with transport infrastructure.  In 15 minutes from the threshold of the complex you can reach the metro stations "Prospect Veteranov", "Leninsky Prospekt" and "Avtovo", moreover, in 2020 another one will be commissioned next to it - "South-West".  In the immediate vicinity of the Pearl Frigate residential complex there are four stops, from which buses and fixed-route taxis leave regularly. </p>

    <p>  Not far from the complex is a roundabout, if necessary, you can use the Peterhof highway. </p><h2>  Trade and social infrastructure </h2><p>  Residential complex “Pearl Frigate”, the photo of which is presented in the article, is located on the territory that already has a sufficiently developed infrastructure, and therefore all its residents can use the services of the facilities already available here.  So, literally next to the residential complex is located shopping and entertainment center "Pearl Plaza", there are also health and sports centers nearby.  By bus, you can get to the O'Key, Maksidom and Lenta hypermarkets in ten minutes, in addition, there are many small shops in the buildings that are already on the ground floors, as well as in the complex, where you can buy items and essentials. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Literally next to the houses are four schools and several kindergartens.  However, the microdistrict is quite large, and these facilities are clearly not enough.  In this <span>regard, the developer</span> plans to put into operation immediately after the construction of residential buildings two more schools and a kindergarten. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="residential complex pearl frigate" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1281835.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What does the developer offer to potential buyers </h2><p>  Apartments in LCD "Pearl Frigate" the developer positions itself as a comfort class housing.  In this regard, there are no studios at all, most of the apartments are “kopecks” and “treshki”.  There are four rooms. </p><p>  All the premises were pre-finished, in connection with which each owner can make repairs on their own, in accordance with their own taste.  If necessary, for an additional fee, the company offers the services of a designer and specialist finishers. </p><h2>  What does the final finish suggest? </h2><p>  Everything provided by the comfort class segment.  All necessary engineering communications have been summed up, as well as telephone, television networks and the Internet.  Double-glazed windows are installed in the window openings, metal constructions equipped with modern anti-burglary locks are installed in the doorways.  An individual heating control system is provided.  Balconies and loggias are glazed.  On the floors - screed, walls and ceilings are aligned.  But what often causes customer dissatisfaction is the fact that plumbing is not installed.  Yet today, when the market has a huge selection of high-quality accessories for the toilet and bathroom, the developer could even attend to their installation.  Especially considering that it offers not an economical option, but apartments of the comfort class. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd pearl frigate saint petersburg" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1281227.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Layout of apartments </h2><p>  Here, the company's specialists did their best and competently carried out all the design work.  All apartments have an ergonomic and functional layout that is consistent with the idea of ​​European quality housing.  The ceiling height in the apartments is 2 m 85 cm. </p><p>  In addition, there is a fairly large selection of layouts for apartments of any format.  So everyone can choose for themselves a suitable option in accordance with their own taste and individual preferences.  For example, there are one-room apartments with an area of ​​more than 80 "squares", and this despite the fact that basically the quadrature of premises of this format does not exceed 30-35 square meters.  m </p><p>  Bathrooms are separate everywhere (except for a few of the smallest "odnushki").  Some 3- and 4-room apartments also have guest toilets. </p><p>  Kitchens are large everywhere, in some apartments reaching almost 20 square meters.  Also, regardless of the <span>type of living space,</span> in any one there is a spacious entrance hall, in which you can simply not only put a spacious sliding wardrobe, but even equip a small dressing room. </p><p>  Each apartment is equipped with a loggia or balcony. </p><h2>  A few words about the cost </h2><p>  To date, only 40 apartments are available in the houses of the first stage.  147 - in the buildings of the second stage.  The rest can be purchased now in houses under construction as equity holders and at the initial cost.  Which, incidentally, is beneficial. </p><p>  Now about the prices specifically.  They depend on the footage and, of course, the layout.  So, for the above-mentioned huge one-room apartment will have to pay about eight million.  On average, odnushki cost from 3.5 to 6 million rubles.  For two-room apartments you will have to pay from 5.5 to 10 million, for "three rubles" - from 7 to 11, well, and four-room apartments will cost the buyer from 11 to almost 16 million rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pearl frigate reviews" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1281840.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Yes, prices, of course, cannot be called affordable.  Well, what, in fact, want?  Yet this is Peter, and even the coast of the Gulf of Finland. </p><h2>  LCD "Pearl Frigate": reviews </h2><p>  So, what do those who have already moved into apartments and those who are still considering buying a property say about the <span>residential complex</span> ?  To say that they are only enthusiastic would be wrong.  But there is no particular negative. </p><p>  The quality of apartments, as a rule, is not satisfactory.  That's just, as mentioned above, buyers are unhappy with the lack of plumbing.  Documents and deadlines are also in full order.  The developer is reliable, will not deceive and will not fail.  Yes, and the house without deficiencies will not give up. </p><p>  A lot of positive reviews about the infrastructure of the district from the inhabitants of the residential complex "Pearl Frigate".  That's really what’s really on top, absolutely nothing to complain about.  Moreover, everything shows that the developer is trying and taking care of his customers, as evidenced by the speed of construction work on the construction of additional infrastructure facilities.  Of course, everyone admires the fact that the <span>beach of the Gulf of Finland</span> can be reached on foot in ten minutes. </p><p>  Many believe that the cost of housing is still significantly overstated.  Especially taking into account the fact that the apartments are rented out without a full finish, which will have to be spent additionally, and this will result in a rather impressive amount.  And people are not very happy with the transport infrastructure.  The metro is far away, during rush hours the buses are crowded.  However, this problem with the commissioning of a new metro station will be a thing of the past.  Otherwise, the LCD “Pearl Frigate” is all right. </p>
