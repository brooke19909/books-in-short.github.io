And the inhabitants of the island, living in this territory from time immemorial, do not know what a wheel is, because they do not let absolutely anyone into their world, and those who dare to take risks simply kill. </p>

And it is not surprising: in this way, the natives protect their own distinctive culture, which is necessarily threatened with destruction if it is touched even by an echo of civilization.

    <h2>  Who are these mysterious Sentinels? </h2><p>  Outwardly, Sentinels, completely isolated from the world, look like Negroids, are characterized by dark skin, curly hair and short, up to 150 cm, growth.  Perhaps they appeared on this territory since the time the Andaman archipelago belonged to Indonesia.  Later, a piece of land broke away and carried away with all its contents into the ocean. </p>

    <p>  North Sentinel Island, whose area is only 72 square meters.  km, officially refers to India, but in fact - it is a sovereign territory.  After all, no agreements or contacts were made with residents of these lands on any kind of accession. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  North Sentinel Island: Grain Collected </h2><p>  The first evidence of the existence of the island appeared in 1771.  The basis for such assumptions was the information of the British inspector who reported the dim light from the dwellings, most likely located inside the island.  In 1867, a merchant ship wrecked off the coast of Sentinel;  106 sailors ashore were in danger of being killed by inhospitable Aborigines.  They managed to escape thanks to a warship passing nearby. </p>

    <p>  In the 19th century, police pursued a fugitive convict who approached Sentinel.  Having discovered the body of the criminal with his throat cut and riddled with arrows, the defenders of the law quickly rushed to retire. </p><p>  In 2006, two fishermen, poor fools, who imagined illegal fishing near the island, were killed by Sentinel shooters.  A helicopter was sent behind the bodies, which the natives fired from bows.  The pilots managed to understand that the corpses were still buried, because the wind from the blades exposed their bodies, buried shallow. </p><h2>  Aboriginal lifestyle </h2><p>  A large number of attempts were made to establish contact with the islanders: on the shore they were left with products and items that could be useful in the household, that is, they used the traditional way of meeting unknown <span>wild tribes.</span>  The North Sentinel Island on its banks saw the abandoned pigs, coconuts, colorful buckets.  It is known that products were eaten, pigs were killed and buried, and only specimens of red color aroused interest from buckets.  According to the observations of anthropologists, the islanders live off of hunting, fishing and gathering, because there are no characteristic signs of any processing on earth.  Scientists have found that they take metal for arrows from the sea, constantly throwing various garbage ashore, process it and skillfully intersperse it in spears and arrows.  Also, observers noted that there are three types of tips: sharp, designed for fishing and hunting, and blunt - for warning shots.  The islanders do not have boats, because they have never been seen crossing to nearby islands or fishing in canoes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 2001, there were attempts to more accurately determine the number of people living on the island.  They tried to conduct the census from the air, counting 21 men and 18 women.  According to anthropologists, a hut constructed from cone-lined branches is shared by two families or three or four people.  The data are very approximate, because the calculation carried out in this way cannot be accurate.  The tsunami that happened in 2004 could affect the number of islanders, one of the worst natural disasters in history.  Of the maximum 9.5 points, magnitude was 9.3 points.  The Andamans suffered very seriously, but the Sentinels still managed to survive.  Regarding the Sentinel language: perhaps it belongs to the group of Andaman languages, but nothing is known about it. </p><h2>  Solve the riddle of wild people? </h2><p>  They began to protect the North Sentinel Island (photo attached) from about the 90s: tourists and the local population are not allowed here, special posts are located around the island and there is a boat patrol. </p>

Nevertheless, the desire to know the unknown does not leave modern travelers, perhaps someday the Northern Sentinel Island will become an open book for everyone.  In the meantime, from the desire to unravel the mystery of the wild people of modern man, in particular, the threat of the extinction of cultures so rare for the present time holds back.
