  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Personality and Society Sociology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The human personality is studied in detail with the help of various humanities, but sociology pays special attention to the concepts of personality and society.  It focuses primarily on the study of personality problems and draws attention to social causes that affect human behavior.  The basic concept used in sociology to denote the process of personality development is the concept of socialization. </p><p>  Studying the personality and society, sociology considers the whole process in which a person assimilates social knowledge and experience, rules and norms of behavior.  As a result of this process, a person himself becomes a full member of society.  Typically, in the process of personality socialization, two stages can be distinguished: the process from the moment a person is born until the formation of a mature personality is primary socialization.  Secondary socialization usually occurs in the event of a change and restructuring of an already existing personality. </p><p>  If we turn to the concept of personality, we can see that in everyday speech it is identical to the concept of man, these two concepts have been used as synonyms for more than two thousand years.  In sociology, the term personality refers to a person as a separate unit of society, taken in the social aspect. </p><p>  This is a community of human social properties, which is a product of social development.  This individual is included in the system of social relations through communication and active subject activity.  In the process of human life and activity in modern society, the need constantly arises for the secondary socialization of personality.  Considering the personality and society, sociology concludes that social status can change repeatedly, as a person masters additional knowledge and skills. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In fact, society is for the human individual a social environment that combines many different social factors that influence the formation of the personality and its behavior.  Sociology considers such a large social environment as a world community as the interaction of various personalities on a global scale.  From the whole concept, the social environment can be distinguished by the macroenvironment - this is the <span>social division of labor</span> and the social structure of society, resulting from the nature of this division, the <span>system of education</span> and upbringing in society, and so on. </p><p>  In addition to it, there is a microenvironment - this is a school, family, <span>work collective.</span>  The process of how the personality and society interact with each other is defined by sociology as interconnected.  On the one hand, the human environment and the <span>social system</span> act on it, and on the other hand, the person himself, through his active actions, is able to change both the living environment and the social environment in which he is located. </p><p>  In the process of such interaction, relationships called social are realized.  These relations are a stable definite system of communication between various individuals, which develops in the conditions of a given society in the process of their interaction with each other.  At its core, it is a relationship that develops between people who are in different <span>social groups.</span> </p><p>  Everything that we do is the result of social relations and any of our activities comes down to building and reproducing these relations.  If a person was able to succeed in something, this means that, first of all, he succeeded in the ability to build relationships with other people.  Therefore, the relationship of the individual and society is considered not only as the activity of society, but also as the activity of an individual who in certain social conditions satisfies his needs and at the same time pursues certain personal goals. </p>
