    <h2>  Ivankovo ‚Äã‚Äãreservoir </h2><p>  One of the best places to spend a weekend is the so-called Moscow Sea.  Officially, it is called the <span>Ivankovo ‚Äã‚Äãreservoir</span> and was created by the works of the Canal Army soldiers of Dmitrovlag in the sinister 1937.  It is used for cargo shipping along the Volga Route, as well as to Moscow and Tver.  In addition, it ensures the functioning of the <span>Ivankovo ‚Äã‚Äãhydroelectric station</span> and other water and electricity supply facilities of the capital. </p><p>  Over the expanse of the Moscow Sea rises to three hundred islands.  At the same time, the level of the Ivankovo ‚Äã‚Äãreservoir fluctuates throughout the year, and its maximum depth in spring can reach 19 m. </p><p>  On the shores of the Moscow Sea there are excellently equipped beaches with mini-golf and beach volleyball courts, comfortable wooden benches, showers and toilets, umbrellas and changing cabins.  There are also beach and sports equipment rental facilities, including rowing boats, pedal boats and skis, jet skis, wakeboards and kites.  In addition, ice rinks are equipped at the reservoir in winter, and ski slopes are laid along the banks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Klyazma reservoir: beaches </h2><p>  This hydraulic object arose as a result of the construction of the Pirogovsky hydroelectric complex in 1937.  On the banks of the reservoir organized several recreation areas.  For example, an excellent place for spending leisure time in the open air is the paid <span>Trinity Beach.</span>  It belongs to the so-called lawn, where you can lie on the grass and have a picnic.  There are sandy beaches nearby.  However, most of them are inferior in equipment to the ‚ÄúTroitsky‚Äù. </p><p>  Klyazma reservoir, whose beaches are no less popular with residents of the capital than the recreation areas of Ivankovsky, is rich in fish.  In particular, there are: roach, perch, catfish, scavenger, ruff and bream.  That is why this <span>artificial lake</span> has long been considered an excellent place for organizing fishing both in summer and in winter. </p><p>  The popularity of the Klyazma reservoir is also due to its excellent transport accessibility.  For example, you can get to its shores along Ostashkovsky or Dmitrovsky shosse by car, as well as from the capital by pleasure flights following from the River Station, or by electric trains to the Khlebnikovo or Vodniki railway platform. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Pirogovskoe Reservoir </h2><p>  This pond is considered part of the Klyazma artificial sea.  On its shore there is such a popular vacation spot among Muscovites as "Bay of Joy."  The reservoir differs from other reservoirs in the Moscow Region in that there are conditions for yachting and jet skiing.  Despite the fact that it is always crowded on its shores on fine days, excellent fishing can be organized there.  The fact is that because of the rather large area you can always find a nook to sit with a fishing rod in the hope of an excellent catch. </p><h2>  Mozhaisk Reservoir </h2><p>  This artificial sea is the largest in the region.  Its area is 30.7 km <sup>2</sup> , and in the summer for residents of the capital it turns into the most attractive place to relax on the weekend.  Fishing on the Mozhaisk Reservoir is especially good.  It is organized both in summer and in winter.  The right bank of this reservoir is mostly steep and is perfect for fishing on a large bream and pike perch on a donka, float fishing rod, spinning rod or feeder.  Pike is also caught there. </p><p>  Fishing on the Mozhaisk reservoir can be organized both from the shore and from a boat, and almost any species of fish inhabiting this reservoir lives in the dam area.  At the same time, due to the large number of people who want to try their luck, going out in the country with the aim of sitting in silence with a fishing rod can be hopelessly spoiled.  That is why many experienced fishermen prefer to look for more secluded places.  Fortunately, because of the vast body of water, excellent fishing on the Mozhaisk Reservoir can always be organized. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  As for the beaches, the most famous of them is Ilyinsky, where there is a rental of water equipment, a barbecue area, sun loungers, etc. There are also many wild beaches on the banks of the reservoir.  Rest on them is less comfortable, but there are no crowds of sunbathers. </p><h2>  Uchinskoe reservoir: fishing </h2><p>  The reservoir and its banks are considered a strict water protection zone.  It appeared in 1937 as a result of the construction of a large Akulovsky hydroelectric complex.  Officially approaching his water mirror less than 200 m is strictly prohibited, but this rule is often violated.  In particular, throughout the year there are quite a few who, despite all the warnings, strive to get to the Uchinsk reservoir.  Fishing, they are assured, is simply excellent there.  In this reservoir there is a large number of zander, perch, pike and bream.  Also there you can catch crucian carp, carp, roach, gudgeon, tench, ide, burbot, catfish and ruff.  Inveterate fishermen can spend the night in the "Fisherman's House", located between the villages of Rozhdestveno and Dolganikha, where guests can rent boats. </p><p>  As for beach vacations, in spite of all the prohibitions, in the summertime on the northern shore of the reservoir you can find many swimmers and sunbathers.  However, there are no equipped recreation areas there. </p><p>  Getting to the Uchinsk reservoir is very simple.  For example, you can leave from Savelovsky station to the station "Labor", cross the channel to them.  Moscow to Rozhdestveno and then go on foot to the right. </p>

The main feature of the reservoir is that the flow here is constantly changing, which is due to the functioning of the pumping station, which creates a constant circulation of water. </p>

    <p>  You can get to this reservoir in the Moscow Region in various ways.  For example, taking an electric train from the <span>Riga station</span> to the Shakhovskaya station, you need to take a bus to the village of Merklovo, and then walk 3.5 km on foot to the village of Filenino. </p><h2>  Istra Reservoir </h2><p>  The reservoir was formed in 1935 as a result of the construction of an earthen dam 25 m high, 488 m long along the ridge. Like other reservoirs in the Moscow Region, in the summer it attracts hundreds of residents of the capital who are forced to spend the holiday season in a dusty metropolis. </p><p>  The main feature of the Istra Sea is the ability to practice kayaking. </p><p>  On the shores of the reservoir are the mansions of many famous Russians, including the prima donna of domestic show business.  In addition, there are the most comfortable beaches in the region, so many residents of the capital prefer to spend their days off in the Moscow region on the Istra Reservoir.  In particular, you can have a great time near the village of Turusovo, which is easily accessible via Pyatnitskoye Shosse, driving 40 km from the Moscow Ring Road to Sokolovo, then following the sign. </p><p>  Now you know where in the metropolitan area you can organize a beach summer vacation.  The Moscow region is rich in reservoirs, including huge reservoirs, where a wide variety of water activities or fishing are available. </p>
