Their visit is an important item on the list of travelers.  Soft white sand and crystal clear water, despite the rapid construction of beach hotels, make this resort a place where you can enjoy beautiful nature and relax from the bustle of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.comollegardesdehasta.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Varadero in Cuba" class="if uuid-2513394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72243/2513394.jpg"></div><p>  How to get from Havana to Varadero on your own?  Varadero is not so far from Havana, only 134 kilometers.  This distance can be traveled in a couple of hours, although several stops can be made along the road. </p><h2>  Sightseeing tour </h2><p>  Often travelers flying to Varadero for a few weeks want to visit Havana.  If the trip is planned with an overnight stay, then it is better to take an excursion.  The tour operator organizes overnight at the hotel and transfers to and from Havana.  The tour will also include a sightseeing tour of the capital.  Prices range from 120 CUC (7500 rubles) per person for a day trip to 2000 CUC (12 200 rubles) for an overnight trip.  This trip can be booked in advance or booked at the hotel reception. </p><div class="photo" data-original="traveladventureeverywhere.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital of cuba" class="if uuid-2513391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72243/2513391.jpg"></div><h2>  Traveling alone </h2><p>  How to get from Varadero to Havana on your own?  If you plan an independent trip, you can use the services of a taxi, regular buses or rent a car.  Such a trip will save a little money and time, because the tourist himself chooses what he wants to do in the capital: sightseeing, shopping or tasting local dishes and Cuban rum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bus </h2><p>  The easiest way to get from Varadero to Havana is via the Viazul bus.

The station can be easily reached from any hotel, for example, by taxi - the cost is 3-5 CUC (150-200 rubles). </p><div class="photo" data-original="fivepointfive.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Travel by bus" class="if uuid-2513371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72243/2513371.jpg"></div><p>  A bus is a great way to get to Havana quickly and safely.  It is possible that it will be filled with other tourists who want to see the capital.  It is better to reserve a seat in advance, at least one day in advance.
