Cleopatra: a love story</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Truly bloodthirsty can be called some of the joys of the ancient world.  Many ruled in the world, but Cleopatra is unique in the sense that she was the last of the Egyptian pharaohs and the first female politician.  In one of the ancient scrolls, a contemporary wrote about her that the price of her love was death.  But still there were men who were not afraid of such an ominous condition.  Madly in love with Cleopatra, they gave their lives for the night spent with her, and in the morning their severed heads were exhibited at the entrance to the palace ... </p><h2>  Mores of that time </h2><p>  To the modern man, the joys of the Ancient world may seem the height of debauchery.  At that time, not only cohabitation, but also legal marriages between fathers and daughters, uncles and nieces, as well as siblings, were quite widespread, especially among the nobility.  Of course, the first motive that prompted such actions was property interest.  In addition, people saw how they acted in such cases in the royal families, and took an example from them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The joys of the ancient world" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/758993.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <p>  In Egypt, similar pleasures of the Ancient World were also practiced.  Cleopatra and her brother were no exception.  In addition, the priests actively introduced and strongly encouraged the so-called idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpurity of blood in royal families.  Apparently, in ancient times they already knew that reusable incest leads to various mental illnesses and other ailments of August descendants.  Thus, the priests of the Ancient World priests could use to achieve their selfish goals, because it is clear that it is much easier to manage a sick or demented person. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Incest at that time was a common practice, while the moral qualities of people had nothing to do with it.  Take, for example, Pharaoh Akhenaten, who was, incidentally, the husband of the beautiful Nefertiti.  He was a progressive and good man in every respect, but even during the life of his wife he also married his second daughter.  The rest of this article will discuss Egypt and the pleasures of the Ancient World.  Many ruled in the world, but still Cleopatra was a truly extraordinary woman. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  The future Queen of Egypt was born in 69 BC.  e.  She was the representative of one of the most notable Greek clans.  Her father was Ptolemy XII, and her mother was Cleopatra V. In addition to her, there were other children in the family: three sisters - Arsinoe, Berenice, Cleopatra VI, and two younger <span>brothers named</span> after his father.  When the imperious, cruel and hated lord of Egypt finally died, his children ascended the throne: 12-year-old son Ptolemy and his sister Cleopatra, who at that time turned 17 years old.  According to the custom adopted by the pharaohs, they got married. </p><p>  I must say that Cleopatra VII was a fairly educated woman.  She studied mathematics, philosophy, literature, and also knew how to play some musical instruments.  In addition, she knew 8 languages ‚Äã‚Äãand was the only one of the entire Ptolemaic dynasty who spoke freely with the Egyptians. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The joys of the ancient world.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Until now, it has not been possible to find a source where the appearance of this queen was reliably described.  But we can say for sure that all researchers unanimously reiterate: Cleopatra was a sensual and seductive woman.  This is evidenced by the facts from her life. </p><p>  Now we can call the immoral joys of the Ancient world.  Cleopatra contained many men, but at that time it was not considered something shameful.  It is no secret that the young pharaoh Ptolemy XIII was only nominally considered the ruler of Egypt.  In reality, Queen Cleopatra was in power </p><h2>  Power struggle </h2><p>  But this could not last long.  Dissatisfied with her rule, the mentor of Ptolemy XIII, along with other high-ranking dignitaries in 48 BC.  e.  raised a rebellion against Cleopatra in the capital of Egypt - Alexandria.  The rebellious people threatened to kill the queen, so she had to flee with her sister Arsinoe to neighboring Syrian lands.  At the same time, Cleopatra did not consider herself defeated. </p><p>  Soon, she managed to gather an army, at the head of which she moved to the Egyptian borders.  Brother and sister and husband and wife decided to find out in battle who will own the power in the country.  Two enemy armies met face to face about 30 miles east of Port Said, near Pelusius. </p><h2>  <strong>Acquaintance</strong> </h2><p>  Meanwhile, in the Roman Empire, Julius Caesar and Pompey fought for power.  The latter lost the battle of Farsalos and was forced to flee to Alexandria.  But the Egyptian nobles decided to curry favor with the emperor and executed Pompey.  A few days later Caesar arrived in Alexandria, where a peculiar ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù awaited him - the severed head of his enemy.  Seeing her, he was horrified and ordered Cleopatra and Ptolemy to end the war, dissolve his soldiers and come to him immediately for explanation and further reconciliation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The joys of the Ancient world: Cleopatra" class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21144/758302.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Having arrived in Alexandria, the young pharaoh began to complain about the actions of his sister.  But before deciding, Caesar wished to hear the other side of the conflict.  The queen knew that as soon as she appeared in the capital, her brother's supporters would immediately kill her.  Therefore, she came up with a very original plan: she arrived in Alexandria at night in a simple fishing boat.  She ordered to wrap herself in a colorful fabric (according to other sources - a carpet) and bring it to the emperor's chambers.  It was both a great disguise and an original joke.  Thus one of the most romantic acquaintances in history happened. </p><p>  Knowing the subtleties of seduction and all the joys of the Ancient World that existed at that time, Cleopatra, whose love story still excites people's minds, amazed the spoiled emperor not only with her ingenuity, but also with a subtle sense of humor.  In addition, her movements and even her voice literally captivated Caesar.  Julius, like other men, could not resist the love spell of the charming Egyptian woman and that very night became her lover. </p><h2>  Full Queen </h2><p>  The Alexandrian war, which Caesar waged solely for the love of Cleopatra, ended 8 months later.  During the fighting, two-thirds of the Egyptian capital was burned, including the famous library.  After this, Alexandria swore allegiance to Caesar, and the fullness of power, along with the throne, returned to Cleopatra. </p><p>  Losing no time, she immediately married her next brother - Ptolemy XIV.  It is worth noting that this marriage was fictitious.  In fact, the queen all this time was the mistress of Julius Caesar and autocratically ruled the state with the support of the imperial legions. </p><h2>  "Alexandria Courtesan" </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Rome was in turmoil and rivers of blood flowed there, Caesar was in no hurry to return there.  In the sweet embrace of his mistress, he forgot about his duty and state duties.  In order to keep the emperor near her, Cleopatra tried every day to surprise and interest him more and more.  Until that time, not a single woman experienced in Caesar's love could bind herself for a long time. </p><p>  From the few scrolls that could survive, and from the works of art of that time, you can imagine what the joys of the Ancient World were.  Cleopatra with her lover had fun on a luxury ship, the length of which was almost 100, height - 20, and width - 15 meters.  On his deck stood a real two-story palace with cedar and cypress colonnades.  Usually the ship was followed by an escort of 400 vessels.  Such luxury was intended to demonstrate to the ruler of the Roman Empire all the greatness of Egypt, as well as the honors they render him. </p><p>  A few months later, Caesar had to say goodbye to Cleopatra and go back.  The joys of the Ancient World in terms of consequences did not differ too much from modern ones: after some time Cleopatra had a son named Ptolemy-Caesarion.  To protect the queen and her child from possible enemies, 3 <span>Roman legions</span> were constantly in Alexandria <span>,</span> which the Roman prudently left. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What were the joys of the ancient world" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21144/758303.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The murder of Julius Caesar </h2><p>  Cleopatra with her husband and son in 46 BC  e.  went on a visit to Rome, where they arranged a triumphal meeting.  The locals were struck by the unprecedented luxury of the cortege of a foreign ruler: a string of chariots sparkling with gold, followed by a large number of black Nubian slaves, as well as hand cheetahs, gazelles and antelopes. </p><p>  For the sake of the ‚ÄúAlexandrian courtesan,‚Äù Caesar was ready to change the law, which forbade her husband to have more than one wife.  By the way, his legal wife was Kalpurnia - a childless woman.  He wanted to officially marry the Egyptian queen and make his son Caesarion the only heir to the Roman Empire. </p><p>  I must say that no one ever paid attention to the number of Caesar's secret mistresses and to the other joys of the Ancient World that were not alien to him.  But when he tried to recognize Cleopatra as his legal wife, it was perceived as an insult to the whole people.  And now, 2 years after the arrival of the Egyptian woman, in March 44 BC.  e., a group of conspiracy Republicans kills Caesar.  He was <span>stabbed</span> 23 <span>times.</span>  So this dramatic love story and an attempt to legitimize his relationship with the ‚ÄúAlexandrian deceiver‚Äù ended dramatically for him.  Some rulers of states paid in this way for the joys of the Ancient world.  Cleopatra was shocked, because she did not expect such a turn of events. </p><h2>  Flight from Rome </h2><p>  Another blow for the queen was the document left by the murdered emperor.  When the will of Julius Caesar was opened, it turned out that he had appointed Octavian, his nephew, as the successor, and did not even mention Caesarion's officially recognized son.  Cleopatra realized that she and her son were in mortal danger, so she tried to leave Rome as soon as possible and return to Alexandria. </p><p>  A little later, under mysterious circumstances, her brother and husband Ptolemy XIV die.  There is an assumption that Cleopatra herself poisoned him to become the only and full sovereign ruler of Egypt, and to make her son Caesarion her heir. </p><p>  After the death of the Roman emperor in the state, a confrontation began between his murderers and the thirsty for revenge Octavian, Lepidus and Anthony.  As a result, the triumvirate won.  Mark Anthony became the ruler of the eastern provinces.  But Cleopatra, leaving Rome, did not know that she was able to ignite a spark of love in his heart. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The joys of the ancient world.

    <h2>  New meeting </h2><p>  Marc Anthony was a famous Roman politician and commander, as well as a friend and confidant of Julius Caesar.  They always supported each other in the most difficult times for them.  That was until the death of the emperor. </p><p>  After defeating Caesar‚Äôs killer Brutus, Mark went to Asia and Greece to collect indemnity.  Everywhere he was greeted with a standing ovation, and only Cleopatra did not reward the great commander with her attention.  Angry, Anthony ordered her to arrive in Tarsus. </p><p>  What joys of the Ancient world were, it is possible to judge by how Cleopatra appeared at a seemingly business meeting.  Just imagine: the mistress of Egypt sailed on a ship in the costume of Venus, surrounded by cupids, nymphs and fauns!  The huge vessel, made of precious wood with gilded stern, was sailing under scarlet sails.  It exuded an unusual fragrance and came ashore to the sounds of the most beautiful music, when the sun was already dropping.  In the rapidly gathering twilight on the ship, a magnificent illumination suddenly flashed. </p><p>  Mark Anthony, a brilliant commander, a brave man and a favorite of women who, it would seem, knew all the joys of the Ancient World, was struck on the spot by such a grandiose performance.  Therefore, instead of falling upon the high-handed queen with angry speeches and threats to turn her country into one of the many provinces of the great Roman Empire, he invited Cleopatra to dine alone with him.  In response, she invited Anthony to board the ship, literally strewn with rose petals, and made a feast in honor of him, which lasted 4 days.  It was with such luxury in Egypt that the joys of the Ancient World were usually organized.  Cleopatra (photos of the royal person, of course, we can‚Äôt provide you, but there are as many pictures as possible) did not stop there.  She invited a senior Roman to visit her palace in Alexandria. </p><p>  Anthony arrived in the capital and immediately went to the residence of the queen.  So great a welcome was waiting for him that he completely forgot about government affairs.  Throughout the winter, orgies and other dubious amusements were held in the palace of the ‚ÄúAlexandrian courtesan‚Äù.  Turning into a real bacchante, she did not leave her lover for a minute and indulged all his desires.  Cleopatra tried to make sure that every day spent by Mark Anthony next to her was unique.  She came up with more and more amusements that promised both of them a lot of pleasure.  So she entertained her lover, who was new to such joys of the Ancient World.  The photo below is a shot from the film Anthony and Cleopatra, in which the magnificent Queen Elizabeth Taylor played the role of the Egyptian Queen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The joys of the ancient world Cleopatra was" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/758977.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  King of egypt </h2><p>  Anthony began the next military campaign in 37 BC.  e.  This time it was aimed at the conquest of Syrian lands.  The Roman asked Cleopatra to give him funds for the Parthian campaign.  The queen agreed, and in exchange for this, Mark gave her part of northern Judea and Phenicia, and also legalized his marriage and children.  All the thoughts of the commander were exclusively occupied by the Egyptian mistress.  The lands he conquered, he gave away to children.  She began to be called the ‚ÄúNew Isis‚Äù and was present at the audience in the costume of the goddess: in tight-fitting clothing with a crown in the form of a hawk's head and cow horns. </p><p>  Everywhere, wherever Anthony fought, he was accompanied by the ‚ÄúAlexandrian courtesan,‚Äù who arranged for him all kinds of joys of the Ancient World.  Many ruled in the world, but Cleopatra knew how to command men like no one else.  She persuaded Anthony to renounce not only his legal wife, but also Rome.  In the end, he became known as the <span>king of Egypt,</span> and by his order they began to mint a coin on which the profile of Cleopatra flaunted.  In addition, on the shields of the once Roman legionnaires began to knock out her name. </p><p>  Such behavior of Mark Anthony could not but cause deep indignation of the Romans.  On this occasion, in 32 BC.  e.  Octavian made his accusatory speech in the Senate.  As a result, it was decided to declare war on the Egyptian queen.  The joint army of Cleopatra and Anthony was superior to the Roman.  The couple in love knew about it, hoped for military power and ... lost.  The fact is that the queen, who had no military experience, undertook to command a part of the navy.  Obviously, not understanding Mark's strategy, at the decisive moment of the battle she ordered her ships to retreat.  Thus, the Romans won.  This <span>naval battle</span> took place at the beginning of September 31 BC.  e.  near Actium in Greece.  But it took Octavian Augustus another year to approach Alexandria.  In desperation, Cleopatra and Anthony arranged a grand farewell feast during which endless orgies took place, which Egypt had never seen before. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The joys of the ancient world.

    <h2>  The death of Anthony and Cleopatra </h2><p>  Troops of Octavian by 30 BC  e.  almost approached the walls of Alexandria.  Hoping to somewhat alleviate the anger of the new Roman emperor, the queen sends a messenger to him with generous gifts.  Having learned almost all the joys of the Ancient World, Cleopatra was nevertheless sure that at 38 she looked all the same seductive and irresistible.  The royal lady decided to hide in her luxurious tomb, which was recently built by her order, and wait a bit. </p><p>  Meanwhile, Mark Anthony was informed that his beloved woman had committed suicide.  Hearing this, he attempted to stab himself with a dagger.  The commander was still alive when he was brought to the tomb.  A few hours later, Anthony died in the arms of his mistress. </p><p>  While the Egyptian queen was pulling time, the Romans managed to capture Alexandria.  After burying Mark, she returned to the palace.  It is worth noting that the new Roman emperor was known for his amorous adventures, and the joys of the Ancient world were not alien to him.  Cleopatra ruled the men who ruled the world, but this time she was unable to agree with Octavian - her female charms did not make any impression on the Roman. </p><p> The ‚ÄúAlexandrian seducer‚Äù had already foreseen her future and had no illusions about this: she, chained in a chain, would be forced to walk along the streets of the Eternal City behind a chariot of triumph.  But, according to legend, Cleopatra escaped shame: her faithful servants handed over to their mistress a basket of food, where they hid a small poisonous asp.  Before her death, she wrote a letter to Octavian, in which she asked to be buried with Mark Anthony.  So in 30 BC  e.  the last August day ended the love story of the Egyptian queen. </p><p>  The Alexandria Courtesan was buried with great honors, just as she wanted.  As you know, Cleopatra was the last of the pharaohs.  After her death, Egypt was annexed to the Roman Empire and received the status of a province.  According to legend, Octavian Augustus ordered the destruction of all available images of the queen. </p><p>  I must say that at that time, all the nobles were familiar with the peculiar joys of the Ancient World.  Many ruled in the world, but Cleopatra is unique.  According to some sources, she was not beautiful, as is commonly believed.  But thanks to a sharp and lively mind, education and enchanting charm, I was able to achieve the location of two such great commanders as <span>Gaius Julius Caesar</span> and Mark Anthony, who were ready to give their lives for her love. </p>
