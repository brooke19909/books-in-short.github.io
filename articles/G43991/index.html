The villages of Ozerki and the Old Heath have long stood on the shore of the reservoir, not far from Krasnaya Gorka and Kaltino. </p><p>  Unfortunately, some reviews about fishing in this area are not full of enthusiastic phrases, but to say for sure what it is, you should conduct the fishing process yourself.  The approach to the water is in the shade.  Because of this, leaving, you should immediately cover yourself with a towel, as you feel a sharp sense of coolness. </p><p>  Of course, you can come here with children!  Zhdanov Lake is a place that is clean ecologically and actually.  There is practically no garbage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zhdanovskoe lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1155362.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The emergence of hydronym </h2><p>  Its name was given to the reservoir thanks to the statesman <span>A. Zhdanov,</span> who visited these places and was engaged in their ennobling.  There was a sanatorium on the shore.  His people nicknamed it in the same way, although it belonged to a party asset. </p><p>  Previously, the first Zhdanovskoe lake was called Ozeritskoye in the village of the same name located nearby, or Simonovo.  But the second pond was named after a local resident of Heifel.  He was engaged in charity work, built a road and schools.  Therefore, you can often hear the name Kefel Lake, but the Andronovo hydronym is often seen on the maps.  The most common yet (unofficial) is the name "Zhdanovskoe Lake 2". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A small characteristic of the lakes </h2><p>  The coastline of the lakes is represented by sandy beaches, which were formed thanks to A. Zhdanov, who ordered to make the Black Sea sand, as they say, from Pitsunda itself.  At the same time, a gentle descent into the water was formed, which is safe for swimming even for children. </p><p>  Zhdanovskoe lake is located in a forest, which is represented by various species of trees, ranging from bush plants to centuries-old pine trees.  Due to this, the air here is the cleanest, and in most places - the beauty of untouched nature. </p><p>  The terrain is not flat, but represented by small gentle hills that are completely covered with vegetation.  Often there are pines, larch, broad-leaved trees, as well as hazel.  A huge variety of herbs grows here, from medicinal to rare species listed in the Red Book. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zhdanovskoe lake 2" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1155361.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lake Zhdanovskoye in Vsevolozhsk, as the source </h2><p>  You need to know that the first Zhdanovskaya water area is the starting point for the Lubya River, which flows through the city of Vsevolozhsk.  But from the 2nd lake there is a spring that is connected to the channel, but periodically dries up.  Moreover, the connection from the second reservoir is much shorter than from the first. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Animal world </h2><p>  The animal world is very diverse and interesting.  For example, the muskrats living in this lake were specially introduced for acclimatization, which they successfully passed and took root.  Rare bird species such as shore swallows are also found.  There are various representatives of the fauna, such as the hare, oatmeal, and partridge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zhdanovskoe lake fishing" class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1155360.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <h2>  Zhdanovskoe Lake: fishing </h2><p>  Also, these lakes are interesting to fishing enthusiasts, as the water world is rich in various inhabitants.  In the waters live not only crucian carp, pike, perch, but roach, carp, and bream are also found.  Verkhovka, gudgeon, ruffles and bleak are also rarely found, but pike are especially popular for catching.  However, due to the decrease in water level, fish are less likely to swim to spawn, due to which its quantity is reduced.  But no one was left without a catch, since successful fishing is not only from the shore, but also from the boat, and because of the reed.  You can find and crayfish, the number of which is small, but they still come across.  Moreover, the fact that they live in these reservoirs indicates the purity of the water. </p><p>  On the shores of these lakes, fishing competitions are often held.  The local water bodies are appreciated not only for the variety of species represented, but also for peace and tranquility, which can not be found everywhere. </p><h2>  Recreation facilities </h2><p>  On the shores of the lakes are located private recreation centers that have a fenced area and provide a different range of services.  At the same time, finding them in the forest zone helps not only to conduct any outdoor activities, but also to enjoy nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zhdanovskoe lake in Vsevolozhsk" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1155359.jpg" width="600"></div>
